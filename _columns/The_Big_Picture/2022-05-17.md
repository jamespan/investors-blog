The evergreen message from the stock market today? Don't fight the Fed. A second message? Do not cross the mighty U.S. consumer.




Economic data presented Tuesday pointed to hope that the U.S. economy will not go into a recession, despite a new barrage of arrows slung by the Federal Reserve as an effort to slay the beast of inflation. Perhaps this fresh set of data helped ignite a 2.8% rally by the Nasdaq composite.


Other indexes also enjoyed a much needed shot in the arm.


The S&P 500 rose 2%, outmatching a 1.3% lift in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Yet small caps outmuscled both indexes. The Russell 2000 soared 3.2%, marking its biggest single-session gain in 2022 so far.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund, struggling all year long, ran almost 2.5% higher. Its major moving averages, from the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) to the 50- and 200-day lines, continue to slope lower.


Double Dose Of Encouraging Data
-------------------------------


Monthly retail sales in America beat the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) with a 0.9% month-on-month gain in April vs. March. Core sales rose 1%. Plus, the prior month's increase in retail sales excluding fuel and autos got a surprising large boost â€” from a puny 0.2% gain to 1.2%.


"Spending is falling on the goods experiencing the fastest price increases. Gasoline prices surged 44% over the past year in the CPI report, while spending rose 37%; food at home prices jumped 11%, and spending at grocery stores rose 8%," Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas, wrote in an email sent to IBD.


"Consumer spending continues to grow in other areas, with the exceptions of those that surged the most in the lockdown economy. Food services spending in particular is growing very rapidly, up 20% year-over-year versus a 7.2% increase in prices of food away from home," Adams added. "This is further evidence of how spending is shifting back to services and away from goods as the pandemic affects lifestyles less."


Meanwhile, industrial production in the world's No. 1 economy jumped 1.1% in April vs. the prior month. That trounced economists' estimate for a 0.4% increase. Capacity utilization of the nation's factories jumped past all economists' forecasts at 79%. This figure edged even the most optimistic view of 78.8%.


As an affirmation that the encouraging economic data means America could in fact side-step another recession, the cyclical iShares US Transportation ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) ETF stormed 3.1% higher. Watch to see if it can overcome short-term upside resistance at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).

Stock Market Today: Why The Outlook Changes
-------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP051722-274x300.jpg)


Volume grew modestly on both main exchanges vs. the prior session.


Given that the Nasdaq rose on Thursday, Tuesday's session marked Day 4 of a rally attempt. A new [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), therefore, enters the books.


This means the current outlook goes back to a confirmed uptrend from a stock market in correction-mode. A follow-through gives investors the earliest research-driven signal that it's time to quickly form a watchlist of strong stocks and gradually commit capital to leading stocks.


Any new buys from here should turn a profit, and do so immediately after you buy. But use each purchase as feedback on whether the market truly wants to produce a meaningful move.


An Important Tailwind Beyond Economic News
------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, the market appears to continue to get support from corporate buybacks.


S&P Global last week noted that reported share buybacks are at $250 billion as of the first quarter of 2022. That's good enough to set a new 12-month record of $953 billion, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. These statistics count 86% of S&P 500 firms reporting, and the figure is up 6% from $234.6 billion reported by the same companies in Q4 2021.


Looking toward Q2 earnings, 14% of companies will therefore have a share count at least 4% lower than their Q2 2021 count. 


Of course, no one has any idea if this latest follow-through will have the same short shelf life as others in recent months.


Consider, for instance, the S&P 500's follow-through on Dec. 15, the eighth day of the rally attempt. Just two days later, the stock market got punched with heavy institutional selling, and IBD responded with a revision in the outlook to "uptrend under pressure." Ultimately, the uptrend lasted almost five weeks; on Jan. 18, 2022, IBD ratcheted the outlook to "market in correction." Soon afterward, heavy distribution days plagued the Nasdaq and S&P 500's charts.


Nonetheless, a four- or five-week rally did give active investors some tradable opportunities.


On March 16, the S&P 500 staged another follow-through. This one arrived on Day 15 of a new rally attempt. But this uptrend was also rather short-lived. On April 6, the outlook sank to "uptrend under pressure," then descended back to "market in correction" on April 22.


Can Traders Cash In On A New Rally? 5 Keys
------------------------------------------


From April 5 to April 21, the S&P 500 alone suffered no fewer than six distribution days over a 12-session period. Four of those declines in higher volume saw the large-cap index fall 2% or more.


That's not how a healthy uptrend acts. So, keep monitoring this aspect of the stock market via the changes in this column's Market Pulse.


Four more keys to consider if it's worth playing this new potential rally?


One, watch for new breakouts. So far, such a list is more paltry than plentiful. As Tuesday's Market Pulse illustrates, impressive moves out of [superb bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) are not defining the character of the session. Rather, companies with strong fundamentals need a lot more time to rally and get within 5% to 15% of their 52-week highs. If they do, they've accomplished the hard work of clearing [bearish overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/).


Ideally, Big Picture readers will begin to see bullish moves coming out of non-defensive sectors.



Consider the tone of leadership emanating from IBD's features, including the four-times-a-week [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch story](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/). Most recently, the past four companies that grabbed the spotlight? Two in the trucking and logistics areas, **C.H. Robinson Worldwide** ([CHRW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHRW)) and **Marten Transport** ([MRTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRTN)); **Western Midstream** ([WES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WES)), a gas pipeline operator and natural gas collector and processor; and century-plus-old sweets maker **Hershey** ([HSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSY)).


For the patient holder, Western Midstream offers the reward of a rich dividend that currently yields 7.5% annually.


Two, watch the market internals.


On Tuesday, advancers beat decliners by more than 3 to 1 on both main exchanges. You'd expect that on such a big up day. But will this improvement in breadth continue? If yes, then you should begin to see more stocks rising more powerfully and falling less dramatically.


As the Nasdaq advance-decline line has shown since November, there have been an ever greater number of stocks falling. Watch for a potential break in this trend in the General Market Indicators link at the bottom of the Big Picture, or by typing in "GMIAB" in [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).

Interest Rates And The Stock Market
-----------------------------------



Three, look for signs that bond investors are not fleeing the market.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond actually rose 9 basis points to 2.96%. Back in October 2018, the yield peaked at 3.24%, then dropped precipitously. A short-term bear market decline took place in the final three months of that year. But in January 2019, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled a shift away from raising interest rates to the point that it could wreck economic expansion. This news unleashed a strong advance in the stock market before the onslaught of coronavirus in early 2020.


[Powell spoke at a conference](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-powell-to-take-wsj-questions-on-inflation-and-economic-outlook-11652779802) on Tuesday, hosted by IBD sister publication, the Wall Street Journal, to address the U.S. central bank's current strategy to curb inflation.


Rising yields mean bond holders are exiting debt securities and running for the hills.


Four, watch how weakened sectors behave in the remainder of the year.


Headed into Tuesday's session [IBD's stock tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-may-16-2022/) showed Internet, Consumer, Banks, Software and Apparel ranking at or near the bottom of 33 industry sectors in terms of mid- and long-term performance.


If inflation indeed cools off in the latter half of 2022, these areas of the market stand to benefit. For instance, lower inflation puts less pressure on the Fed to raise short-term interest rates. That could help maintain a positive slope in the yield curve, benefiting the banks.


Sector rotation helps keep secular bull runs going.



Don't Ignore Or Dismiss This Sector, At Least Yet
-------------------------------------------------


This doesn't mean the current stock market leaders, particularly in the energy patch, necessarily have to stop rising.


**HF Sinclair** ([DINO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DINO)) is aiming at a fourth straight weekly gain. Shares in the refiner of crude oil have cleared long-term resistance at 40. Its relative strength line has gushed into new high ground. Don't chase stocks well past their [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), however. In DINO's case, the 5% buy zone from a 42.49 entry arguably extends to 44.61.


**Phillips 66** ([PSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSX)), another member of IBD's oil and gas refining group, shows a 3.3% weekly gain so far. Shares are clearing a 93.65 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an 11-week cup that's lodged within an 11-month consolidation pattern.


The large-cap oil refining and fuel marketing giant has posted huge profits in each of the past four quarters, including $3.18 a share in Q3 2021 (vs. a penny loss in the year-earlier period). So a 75 Earnings Per Share Rating belies the company's latest results. Sales have pumped up 149%, 93%, 100% and 67% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.


The Street sees Phillips' earnings growing 65% this year to $9.40 a share.

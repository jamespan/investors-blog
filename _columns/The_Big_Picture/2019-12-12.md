Stock Market Hits Record Highs On U.S.-China Trade Deal; Adobe, Broadcom Report Late
=====================================================================================

The stock market hit more record highs Thursday after [CNBC reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/12/trump-getting-very-close-to-a-big-deal-with-china-they-want-it-and-so-do-we.html) that the U.S. and China had agreed in principle to a "phase one" trade deal, pending President Donald Trump's approval. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced more than 200 points.




The Nasdaq composite moved up 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.9%. The Dow industrials rose 0.8%, or 220 points. All three major indexes hit record highs. On the downside, the IBD 50 did not participate in the rally, a potential worrisome sign to monitor.


Volume was sharply higher across both exchanges relative to Wednesday's turnover, a positive sign of institutional demand at new highs.


Stock Market Rally Continues
----------------------------


From the Dec. 3 lows, the Nasdaq has gained in five out of seven trading sessions, culminating in Thursday's rally to record highs. A potential overhang was the impending Dec. 15 deadline for an additional $156 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, but all signs pointed to President Trump [backing away from those tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-trump-big-decision-do-nothing-will-dow-jones-care/) as the phase-one deal seemed all but signed.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP121219-236x300.jpg)Bullishly, the Nov. 6 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq expired. After 25 trading sessions, distribution days fall off the overall count because they are no longer relevant to the action in the current stock market. Still, the distribution count on the Nasdaq remains somewhat elevated at five. That hasn't kept the index from continuing its steady trek to record highs. Meanwhile, top growth stocks, like market leader and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), continue to perform well.


IBD 50 Underperforms Amid Lululemon's Drop
------------------------------------------


The IBD 50, our screen of top growth stocks, fell 0.3%, sharply diverging from the major indexes' gains. Weighing on the index's performance was significant weakness in hot [IPO stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/mastercard-2006-ipo-was-smashing-success/) **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) and retail leader **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


InMode plunged almost 9%. The stock looks poised to test its 50-day moving average line for the first time since a breakout above a 29.48 buy point in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). Shares are about 33% off their all-time high, set less than one month ago, reflecting InMode's volatile behavior.


[Lululemon stock](https://www.investors.com/research/lulu-stock-buy-now/) pared losses to 3.7% after falling as much as 6.4% in the wake of the [company's disappointing](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-q3-2019-stock-92-growth-results/) holiday-quarter revenue guidance. The yoga-gear maker said revenue could range from $1.315 billion to $1.33 billion, below consensus estimates for $1.38 billion.


On the upside, [Dow Jones stock](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) was one of the day's top performers, with a 2.8% gain. The Wall Street investment bank is approaching the [20%-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) from a 117.34 buy point in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


Top Stocks To Watch: AMD, Tesla Stock
-------------------------------------



Top stocks to watch in the current stock market include today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/amd-stock-forms-three-weeks-tight-pattern/), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), and late Thursday's earnings movers **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).


AMD stock surged above a 41.89 buy point in a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) formation with a nearly 8% gain. The new entry comes more than a month after a move above the 35.65 buy point of a cup base. According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), AMD stock [has an 88](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.htm?fromsearch=1) out of a highest-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/).


Meanwhile, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) briefly broke out past a 361.30 buy point in a deep [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). Shares closed up 2% to end just below the new entry.

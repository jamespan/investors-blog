Nasdaq, Chip Stocks Lead Stock Market; 3 Top New Issues Ramp Higher
====================================================================

Semiconductor stocks led another rally in the Nasdaq Monday, but price action in the rest of the stock market was more subdued, with declining stocks slightly outnumbering advancers on both main exchanges.




Inside the Nasdaq 100, three semiconductor equipment stocks were among the top percentage gainers. **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) hit a 52-week high after a breakout from a [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) with a 45.85 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) earlier this month. **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), meanwhile, is working on the right side of a cup-shaped base with a 209.60 entry. **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) continues to show strength after a breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 123.53 buy point.


VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) also added 2% to 118.79. It's still in buy range from a 116.06 [buy point.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP072219-239x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite ended with a gain of 0.7%; the S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrials picked up 0.1%. Small caps couldn't keep up as the Russell 2000 eased 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Friday.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) eased 0.4%, weighed down by weakness in **Paysign** ([PAYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYS)) and **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)), which plunged 22% and 8%, respectively. BTIG Research downgraded Paysign to sell from neutral, Dow Jones reported.


Signs of institutional selling, or [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), remain well contained in the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Four distribution days for the Nasdaq since the June 7 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) are a yellow flag at this point, but other yellow flags are tough to find. And stock market bulls certainly have reason to feel good, with [semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) leading the market and plenty of bullish setups that still could yield upside breakouts. **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)), **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) are good examples.


Stock Market & The Fed
----------------------


The stock market's attention has turned away from China trade talks to earnings season and next week's Federal Reserve meeting. The market is fully expecting a quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate to a range of 2% to 2.25%. Last week, [the odds of a half-point cut](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/) increased substantially after New York Fed President John Williams said the Fed should "take swift action when faced with adverse economic conditions." He later walked those comments back. Currently, the market sees a 20% chance of a half-point cut.


Other Stock Market Winners
--------------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) outperformed in the Dow Jones after Morgan Stanley maintained an overweight rating and raised its price target to 247. The [FAANG stock](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) has been finding a new home above the 200 level as it approaches a 215.41 entry.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) rebounded 1.3%, recovering a bit after a lackluster session Friday. Shares jumped 3% early Friday on strong earnings, but the gain faded to less than 0.2% by the close. Still, a recent breakout over a 131.47 entry is working nicely.



Also in the Dow Jones today, [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) picked up 0.7% to 140.84, helped by news that "Lion King" grossed $185 million domestically over the weekend.


Disney's breakout over a 142.47 buy point has had a hard time gaining traction, mostly due to a lack of institutional buying. Disney came close to clearing the buy point last month when shares gapped up on June 13, but the stock has been moving sideways since then.


Expectations are high for Disney+, the company's new streaming service set to launch later this year, although Disney will be spending heavily in coming quarters to promote the service, hurting the bottom line.


Growth Stocks On The Move
-------------------------


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) picked up 1.6% to 84. After a breakout from an ascending base, Zscaler just completed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). The add-on buy point is 85.60. It's still in the buy zone after a breakout from an ascending base, and new buyers might also opt to add to the position if it can clear the 85.60 buy point with conviction.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-use-marketsmith-growth-250/), three new issues flexed their muscle.


**Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) jumped 10% to 194.20. It's closing in quickly on its all-time high of 201.88. It's been consolidating for only four weeks, but aggressive traders might opt to buy if it breaks out over its latest high with conviction.


Meanwhile, after soaring nearly 14% last week on strong earnings, **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) followed through after Friday's earnings breakout. Shares rose another 5% to 87.68 on Monday.


**Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) gained 3.5% to 96.67. It's working on a cup-shaped base with a 107.44 buy point, but Zoom's daily chart shows a potential handle taking shape, which could yield an earlier entry.


Earnings Watch
--------------


Some potentially market-moving [earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/chipotle-stock-strong-ahead-of-earnings-facebook-amazon-also-set-to-report/) loom large on the horizon this week, with results due from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)).

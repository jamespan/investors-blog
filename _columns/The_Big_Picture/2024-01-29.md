As Wall Street weeks go, it doesn't get much bigger than this one. Even with so much at stake, stock market indexes climbed broadly Monday.




The S&P 500 added 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6% as both marked record closing highs for the sixth time this month. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.1% to its highest close in more than two years.


Small caps outperformed, as the Russell 2000 tacked on 1.7% and topped resistance at the 2,000 level.


There was a sudden lurch higher at 3 p.m. ET that solidified the day's stock market gains. Around that time, the Treasury Department said its [borrowing costs in the first quarter](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-cuts-its-first-quarter-borrowing-estimate-05771f90?&mod=home-page) will be about $55 billion less than expected. The 10-year Treasury yield, which fell 7 basis points to 4.08%, dropped a couple more basis points after the news.


Volume rose on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Advancing stocks topped decliners by a [7-to-3 ratio on the Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/daily-market-statistics) and by about 11-to-5 on the NYSE.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP012924-180x300.jpg)Other market data also pointed to a broad advance. The iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ([ITOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITOT)), an exchange traded fund that tracks the S&P 1500 index, climbed 0.9%.


The NYSE and Nasdaq advance-decline lines are now above their 10-day moving average. It may not sound like much, but this indicator has provided good timing signals. The data is in [IBD MarketSmith](https://get.investors.com/marketsmith/) under the symbols GMIAA and GMIAB.


The IBD 50 outperformed with a 1.4% jump. **SentinelOne** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) led the group with a 7% surge that took shares to a new high. **GitLab** ([GTLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLB)) and **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) made new closing highs after rising 6% and 5%. In fact, more than 20 of the IBD 50 stocks made 52-week closing or intraday highs. That should encourage bulls.


Stock Market Faces Fed, Tech Earnings
-------------------------------------


In the next few days, the stock market will get a decision from the Federal Reserve, the January employment report and earnings reports from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and other major companies.


But at least the stock market has built quite a cushion that would allow it to absorb some potential losses. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq moved higher in 12 of the past 13 weeks.


The bad part is that the big advance has left indexes extended. The Nasdaq, for instance, is more than 5% above its 50-day moving average. Also, the S&P 500 has piled up six [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), including a couple of [stalling sessions](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-sells-into-strength-with-stalling-signals/). The S&P 500, however, lost its Dec. 20 distribution day because 25 sessions have passed since then.


Combined with the major headlines coming this week, IBD last week decided against investors sticking their necks out very far. We [reduced the recommended stock exposure to 60%-80%](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-higher-after-gdp-report-key-inflation-report-next/) from 80%-100%.


This week, five of the Magnificent Seven companies will announce quarterly results. To put it in perspective, those five represent nearly one-fourth the market cap of the entire S&P 500 index.


Magnificent Seven Shoulder S&P Earnings
---------------------------------------


The Magnificent Seven also are responsible for much of the S&P 500's fourth-quarter earnings on the stock market. Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms and Microsoft and Nvidia — the latter of which reports in a few weeks — represent the six largest positive contributors to earnings growth in the S&P 500, says FactSet Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters.


In whole, analysts expect those six companies to report year-over-year earnings growth of 53.7% for the fourth quarter. The entire S&P 500's earnings are expected to fall 1.4%. Take all six away, and the rest of the S&P 500's bottom line would decline 10.5%.


Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet also are projected to be the top four contributors to S&P 500 earnings in the current quarter, Butters said in a report to clients. Combined, the four are expected to report year-over-year earnings growth of 79.7%. That's a big chunk of the total estimated earnings growth for the entire S&P 500 of 4.6%. Excluding the four Magnificent Seven, the remaining 496 S&P 500 companies are estimated to grow earnings just 0.3%.


Meanwhile, the stock market faces geopolitical risk that could disrupt global markets at any moment. Over the weekend, [three U.S. service members were killed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-three-americans-killed-many-wounded-in-drone-attack-by-iran-backed-militia-in-jordan-4cafcbc2?mod=search_headline) in a drone strike on a U.S. base in Jordan. Dozens more fell injured, and President Biden vowed to respond. Officials believe an Iran-backed group is responsible.

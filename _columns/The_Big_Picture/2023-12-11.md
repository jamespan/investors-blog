The stock market added to recent gains on Monday, but it was a tough day for the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/), which closed with losses of about 1% to 2%.




Sellers hit large-cap technology bellwethers like **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), but both stocks closed off lows and held support at their 50-day moving averages. META and NVDA are [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks.


Stock Market Today
------------------


On a day that saw the Nasdaq composite edge higher by 0.2%, the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) gained nearly 0.9%, helped by strength in semiconductor stocks. The First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) performed even better, up 1.9%. Even so, breadth was slightly negative on the Nasdaq.

After three straight gains, the Nasdaq composite is sitting just below its July 19 high of 14,446.


Big gainers in the chip equipment group included **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), which cleared a 730.99 entry in higher volume. **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) also gave buy signals.


Sentiment was positive in the group after [UBS maintained a buy rating](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/micron-stock-gets-big-price-target-hike-ahead-of-earnings-report/) on **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) and lifted MU's price target to 90 from 76. The analyst cited a recovering memory-chip market and the potential for bullish guidance when Micron reports next week. Micron is a big buyer of chip gear.


Also Monday, **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) rallied 9% after Citi gave the stock a price target of 1,100. That matches the target of a few other analysts, according to FactSet.


After rising above its late-July high on Friday, the S&P 500 picked up an additional 0.4%, while the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) gained 0.9%.


Out of the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) outperformed again, up 0.6%. Consumer staples, industrial and health care stocks also outperformed.


Dow Jones component **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) is the second highest-weighted holding of XLF at just over 9%. It's near the top of a shallow cup base with a 159.38 entry. But after six straight weekly gains, JPM stock could be ready to add a handle to its pattern. **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) is also in the top-10 holdings of XLF with a weighting of nearly 7%. It's also near highs and just below a 416.60 handle entry.


Breadth was barely positive on the NYSE.


Inflation And The Fed
---------------------


It's a busy week of economic data for the stock market this week. The latest reading from the consumer price index is due Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The latest reading on wholesale prices will be out Wednesday with the release of the producer price index.


Year over year, consumer prices are expected to be up 3.1%, just below October's reading of 3.2%. Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, are seen rising 4%, unchanged from October.

The two-day Federal Reserve meeting also gets underway Tuesday with a decision on interest rates due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The stock market is growing more confident about a soft landing for the U.S. economy next year â€” where growth will slow but not enough to knock us into a harsh recession.


The bond market isn't as convinced. After hitting a high of nearly 5% on Oct. 23, relentless buying in the bond market has knocked the 10-year Treasury yield all the way down to 4.23%. The 200-day line for the 10-year yield sits around 4.03%


According to [CME Fedwatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html), federal funds futures traders think there's a 75% chance that the first Fed rate cut next year will come at the May meeting.


Market Movers
-------------


**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) closed off lows and finished just below its 50-day line, after a new study showed patients who took [Lilly's weight-loss drug Zepbound](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-stock-slumps-as-a-new-study-highlights-the-impact-of-stopping-weight-loss-drug/) slowly regained weight nearly a year after stopping the treatment. LLY stock has been a big winner this year, with the weight-loss drug market expected to hit $100 billion by 2030.


The stock market served up a couple of base breakouts from **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)), but both stocks limped past buy points and closed off highs in tepid action.



**UiPath** ([PATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PATH)) and **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) are examples of two recent breakouts that showed quite a bit of power. And both stocks continue to trade tightly near highs. That means both stocks should be watched for alternate entries.


There's plenty to like about the latest stock market uptrend that was confirmed by follow-through days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in early November.


While leading growth stocks continue to show strength, keep in mind that there are a lot of extended stocks out there. Avoid the pitfall of chasing big winners that have run up a lot. Buying opportunities still exist but they're definitely getting harder to find.

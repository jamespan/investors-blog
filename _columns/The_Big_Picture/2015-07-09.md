Stocks Turn Big Early Gains Into Nearly Nothing
================================================

Stocks lost most of their early gains Thursday, as an attempt to repair the previous session's damage failed. The Nasdaq added 0.3% after being up 1.5% just after the open. The S&P 500 inched up 0.2%. The IBD 50 led with a 0.6% pop. Volume in the stock market fell on both major exchanges.

  

The market received a technical improvement Thursday. The June 3 distribution day on the S&P 500 dropped off because of time.

  

After five weeks, a distribution day — a sign of institutional selling — is no longer relevant to current conditions.

  

Thursday's session posed a test for the market. The market suffered sharp losses Wednesday, but lower volume suggested funds weren't driving the move. At first, Thursday's big gains in rising volume suggested that the bulls were back in charge. But then gains and volume faded.

  

The wild action in recent sessions points to uncertainty. The market apparently is having trouble sizing up the trouble in Greece and China.

  

Late Thursday, Greece offered a new plan for the eurozone's consideration.

  

Another factor making things difficult for stocks is seasonality. Q2 earnings season is just getting underway and that has put a lid on corporate buybacks. Companies aren't allowed to buy back shares in the five weeks leading up to their quarterly reports.

  

The timeout on buybacks, however, is almost over. Among stocks in the S&P 500, a handful are reporting this week, and then 45, 132, 146 and 109 will report in the coming four weeks.

  

There's no guarantee that companies will start buying immediately or at all, but corporate buybacks have played a major role in the bull market.

  

On Thursday, retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) showed all-too typical action for this uncertain market. The stock broke out of a flat base in strong volume, seemingly ending weeks of sideways action. But by the close, Ulta was back under the 159.95 buy point.

  

That isn't necessarily deadly. The test, though, for Ulta will be in the days ahead. Many recent breakouts have sagged after the initial euphoria.

  

As for the general market, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are now trading under the 50-day and 200-day line, respectively. That's not where an uptrend belongs.

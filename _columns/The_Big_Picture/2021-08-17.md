Stocks Today: Small, Midcap Issues Lead Sell-Off; Will This Top Sector Strengthen Amid New Covid Worries?
==========================================================================================================

Smaller companies sold off more than their large-cap counterparts amid a wide-ranging sell-off in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Yet a slow-burning afternoon rebound blunted the decline.




That rebound helped the major indexes avoid a classic test of support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


U.S. retail sales fell by 1.1% in July vs. the prior month. That exceeded the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of a lighter drop of 0.2%. The range of estimates spanned from down 1.5% to up 0.2%. Translation? The new wave of positive coronavirus cases, courtesy of the highly contagious delta variant, is making it a lot tougher to shed light on how fast the economy is recovering from one of America's worst recessions in history.

On the other hand, industrial production data in the world's No. 1 economy surprised to the upside last month. For instance, manufacturing output grew 1.4% vs. June, smashing economists' consensus projection for a 0.5% rise. And July capacity utilization jumped to 76.1%, vs. 75.4% the prior month.


Given this mixed economic message, IBD readers could reasonably conclude that Tuesday's harsh initial selling likely also got fueled by concerns over how government policy over Covid-19 may affect the critical back-to-school shopping season and general spending.


Small Stocks Hit Harder Today
-----------------------------


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), down 1.2%, came close to its first test of the long-term 200-day moving average on Tuesday. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) also fell 1.2%.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite shaved an early loss of more than 1.6% to 0.9%. It came close to the first test of the 50-day line since June 3.


The S&P 500 dropped 0.7% as gains of 0.5% by at least seven medical industry groups likely helped cushion the blow overall.


Volume grew on both exchanges, according to early data. So Tuesday undoubtedly served as a serious profit-taking session by institutional traders. Yet the distribution count stayed the same. A July 13 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 on the 25-day expiration rule.


As to be expected, losing stocks overwhelmed winning ones — by a 3-1 ratio on the NYSE and nearly so on the Nasdaq.


[MarketSmith's homepage](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) shows 383 stocks ceding ground in heavy volume vs. 104 issues advancing in above-average turnover.


Heavy selling dominated in the retail sector, including shoes and apparel, autos, department stores, home furnishings and jewelry. MarketSmith showed these IBD industry groups fell more than 3% each on a price-weighted basis.

Will The Medical Sector Dominate In August?
-------------------------------------------


Within the Dow Jones Industrial Average, coronavirus vaccine play **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) (up 22% from a 41.19 pivot point) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) bucked the day's decline. Both boast nifty gains for the third quarter. **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), a 7% winner on Tuesday, made a bullish hop off its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) has acted like a champion of late, heading closer to a 20% gain from its 893.89 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a base-on-base breakout.



**Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) hasn't broken out this year. But a supersized [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) is forming. The innovator in diabetes care is approaching a 113.58 entry.


The entire Medical sector, however, actually ranks well outside the top 10 among 33 sectors in terms of mid- to long-term performance. At least that was surely the case headed into Tuesday's session. The [Nasdaq and NYSE Smart Tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-aug-16-2021/), found within IBD Data Tables, updates the rankings daily. (Within the URL, you can go back to historical rankings simply by changing the date.)


Right now, Metals, Apparel, Internet, Chips and Banks occupied the top five rungs as of Tuesday morning. And this makes total sense. Congress and the White House are pushing to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure deal that could boost spending in construction and create more jobs. However, it's important to stay focused on the new leaders in terms of IBD ratings, solid price-and-volume action, and bases of exceptional quality.


As [Teladoc](https://www.investors.com/research/teladoc-tdoc-stock-buy-now/) ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) and **Zoom Technologies** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) show, last year's winners don't necessarily stay on top of their industries. Huge moves can require long phases of price consolidation.

Stocks seesawed in a routine range Thursday, with the S&P 500 falling 0.3% at one point and rising as much as 0.7%.

  

The S&P 500 closed with a 0.6% gain, while the Nasdaq tacked on 0.3%. The IBD 50 added 0.5%.

  

Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq, which lost a distribution day because of time.

  

A distribution day becomes irrelevant to current conditions after 25 sessions. The Feb. 12 stalling day on the Nasdaq expired.

  

Thursday's session was somewhat of a recovery from the previous day's sell-off. Wednesday's retreat came after Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's comments on interest rates.

  

Some on the Street said Yellen's remarks were unnecessarily specific. Former chief Ben Bernanke had similar moments, partly because he placed a high value on transparency. Such mishaps, however, never happened in the Alan Greenspan era because Greenspan understood the value of ambiguity and was a master of obfuscation.

  

Why should investors care?

  

If Yellen's first move is any indication, the Street can expect her reign to be more like Bernanke's than Greenspan's. That could lead to more short-term bumps in the stock market because getting clarity exactly right, while preserving flexibility, is much more difficult than preserving flexibility by blowing smoke.

  

Economic reports Thursday weren't lacking anything. The figures were unexpectedly strong.

  

Initial jobless claims were fewer than the consensus number and at the bottom of the range of estimates. The Philadelphia Fed survey for March was above the consensus and at the top of the range. Leading indicators for February beat the consensus and were above the range of estimates.

  

Existing-home sales for February matched views, but that did nothing to ease the resale gloom. Resales have fallen in six of the past seven months and struck a 1-1/2 year low with the latest number.

  

New-home sales, of course, aren't included in existing-home sales data. In January, new-home sales hit a 5-1/2 year high. Data for February will be released March 25.

  

Still, homebuilder stocks lost their turnaround momentum this month.

  

In February, homebuilder stocks were looking attractive. The industry group was in the top 25 of 197 groups. The group has since fallen out of the top 40, and most housing-stock breakouts have not held up. They're looking ugly.

  

The handsome sector right now is finance.

  

Brokerages and financial advisers are sketching good-looking bases. Many are clearing cup-with-handle patterns, including **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) and **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)). **Ameriprise Financial** ([AMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMP)) is still in a handle.

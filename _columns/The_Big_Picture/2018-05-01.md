Stocks Power Up, And Apple Earnings Add Fuel
=============================================

If the stock market is on shaky knees, Tuesday's positive reversal showed it still has some good cartilage and tendons. **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) earnings after the close gave the market another reason to cheer.




The Nasdaq composite erased a 0.4% loss to close 0.9% higher. The Philadelphia semiconductor index leapt 1.7% as the index bounced off the 200-day moving average. Not only was the chip bounce a boost for the technology-heavy composite, but it showed that the sector can still bounce back from its struggles.


The S&P 500 also made a recovery, coming back from a 0.9% loss to escape with a gain of 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average pared losses but still closed 0.3% lower. The small-cap Russell 2000 contributed with a 0.5% increase. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


While Tuesday's turnaround was a relief, the major indexes still seem to be trying to find their way. Indexes remain below their 50-day moving averages, still fresh from a bruising sustained the last time they tried to regain those lines.

For the S&P 500 and the Dow, those long-term price averages are acting as a retaining wall to keep sellers from flooding over. The Nasdaq has more room to spare above its 200-day line.


After the close Tuesday, Apple reported [earnings and sales that beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-q2-earnings/), plus it raised its dividend and set a $100 billion share buyback. Apple rose sharply in extended trading. As the largest U.S. stock by market capitalization, Apple's rally should have a positive impact on trading Wednesday.


Earnings are the primary focus on Wall Street right now, and scores of significant companies are on deck. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) highlight another heavy docket of announcements Wednesday.


On Tuesday, one of the earnings winners was **Tenet Healthcare** ([THC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THC)). The hospital company's Q1 adjusted earnings of 57 cents a share and revenue of $4.7 billion beat expectations. The company also raised its guidance. **IPG Photonics** ([IPGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPGP)) jumped 9.5% after it also beat profit and sales estimates.


But **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) tumbled more than 8% to the lowest level since mid-February. The meal-ordering platform topped Q1 expectations but [some metrics missed estimates](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/grubhub-first-quarter-earnings/).

CLOSE




There's a big divergence between earnings and stock performance. Earnings growth is on track for the best S&P 500 earning growth since the third quarter of 2010, or 23.2%, according to FactSet.


With more than half the S&P 500 companies already reported, 79% have topped EPS estimates. "If 79% is the final percentage for the quarter, it will mark the highest percentage of S&P 500 companies reporting actual EPS above estimates since FactSet began tracking this metric in Q3 2008," analyst John Butters noted in a report.


In aggregate, earnings are 9.1% above estimates, which is also above the five-year average. More companies, 74%, are reporting sales above estimates compared to the five-year average. The aggregate increase is 1.7% above estimates, which is also above the five-year average. That would be the best percentage of surprises since FactSet began tracking that metric in Q3 2008.


Despite the rosy profits, stock performance has lagged. There's no clear explanation why the market has not embraced the strength in earnings.


Some top stocks have struggled to make or sustain gains after strong reports. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) are examples. **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is about the only leading stock that has made a solid, sustained advance from earnings. It reported March 27.


The market's worries now include interest rates, but the 10-year yield has eased after reaching the psychologically important 3% level last week. The Fed concludes a policy meeting Wednesday, and Wall Street may get some guidance on the path of interest rate increases. Trade barriers are not the worry they were in February but still a factor.


The number of [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) is still low, but the flagging action in indexes and leading stocks should tell you enough that it's a dangerous environment. At least 15 stocks in IBD 50 are below their 50-day lines. Still, there are plenty in buy areas or in bases.


The distribution day count was reset with the April 10 [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/). But that follow-through has essentially failed. All gains from then are now gone, although the February lows have yet to be penetrated.

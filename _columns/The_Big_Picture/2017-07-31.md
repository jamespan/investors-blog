Dow Hits High But What's Wrong With Tech?
==========================================

The Dow Jones industrial average had its day in the sun again with an all-time high Monday, but the Nasdaq composite extended its losing streak to three sessions and suffered another distribution day.




It was a mostly uneventful session, where major stock indexes didn't move much in either direction. The Dow added 0.3%, as names like **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) rose around 1%; the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq surrendered 0.4%. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) lagged, falling 0.8%.


Volume on the Nasdaq rose from Friday's levels, resulting in a mild distribution day for the index. NYSE volume rose slightly from Friday, but the S&P 500's tiny decline wasn't enough to qualify as distribution.


The so-called FANG stocks were in the spotlight again and offer a mixed bag in terms of overall technical health.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are under the least amount of duress, but it's a different story for **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which mildly breached support at the 50-day moving average Monday with its third straight above-average volume decline. Shares fell 3% after a big earnings miss last week.

**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), meanwhile, marked its fifth straight close below the 50-day line, falling just over 1%. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating has slumped to E, the worst possible, due to several higher-volume declines in recent weeks. Stocks are rated on an A+ to E scale, with A+ signifying heavy institutional buying and E meaning heavy institutional selling.


Two other tech bellwethers, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), look a bit vulnerable ahead of earnings reports this week.


Apple, which reports Tuesday after the close, is working on a flat base but struggling for support at the 50-day line, while Tesla has been getting resistance at the 50-day line for the past six trading sessions after gapping below the support level July 5. Tesla reports Wednesday after the close.


The distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is relatively light and certainly not indicative of a market that's about to roll over. That said, the Nasdaq's precipitous drop Thursday raised a lot of eyebrows because it was a day of unequivocal institutional selling. It was a harsh reminder that risk can appear even with the major stock indexes in a confirmed uptrend.


A low distribution-day count is a good thing, but that's juxtaposed with the aforementioned action in some leading growth stocks. But to say that the price action of leading growth stocks is flagging a market pullback would be premature because there are still plenty of names out there acting just fine.


Financials outperformed Monday but not because of rising bond yields. The 10-year Treasury yield was mostly unchanged at 2.29%.


**PNC Financial** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)) gained nearly 1% to 128.80 in average turnover as it trades just above a 128.35 cup-with-handle buy point. **BB&T Corp**. ([BBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBT)) rose for the eighth time in nine sessions as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base. Shares also rose nearly 1%


Meanwhile, a quick scan through the IBD 50 yields some healthy setups.


**Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) is etching a flat base with a 73.71 buy point. Quarterly results are due Tuesday after the close.


**Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) is also working on a flat base with a 39.60 entry. Earnings are due Friday before the open.

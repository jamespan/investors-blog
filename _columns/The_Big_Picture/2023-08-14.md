While the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rebounded Monday, the stock market continued to give mixed signals amid an August slump.




Historically, August is one of the worst months for the stock market, and this year it is following that precedent. August is the second-worst month for the Nasdaq, with an average gain of 0.5%, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. For the S&P 500, it is the third-worst month historically, averaging a mere 0.1% gain.


Summer months in general tend to be lackluster on Wall Street.


On Monday, the Nasdaq bounced 1.1%, for its best day since July 28. The index closed slightly above the [50-day moving average,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) but has yet to break a downward trajectory. In other words, it's too soon to spot a bottom in the index.


Laden with seven [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), the stock market's best-performing major index of 2023 has been under profit-taking. Its pullback, though, also helps the index digest its March-July rally.


The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and generally continues to look better than the Nasdaq. During the August pullback, the S&P has remained above its 50-day line. While the S&P has a neutral C [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/), the Nasdaq's D- points to more institutional selling in techs.


Dow Performs Better, But Small Caps Lag
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP081423-248x300.jpg)Also holding above the 50-day average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is outperforming other indexes, as it often does when the market recedes. The Dow hasn't closed below its 21-day exponential moving average since July 7.


This month, the Dow is down 0.7%. That compares with month-to-date losses of roughly 4% in the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 and 2.2% in the S&P 500. On Monday, the Dow edged up 0.1%, climbing into positive territory thanks to a last-minute rally in the stock market.


The Russell 2000 fell 0.2%. But the small-cap benchmark found support at its 50-day moving average. It was down more than 1% in the first hour. The 50-day average coincides with the 1900 level, which has been a level of both support and resistance multiple times the past 12 months.


Volume edged up on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq from Friday's totals. The IBD 50 index rose 0.3% Monday.


What To Do In Today's Stock Market
----------------------------------


The diverging trends of the major stock market indexes make it hard to detect a clear direction. While the market remains unsettled, investors should be invested 60% to 80% in stocks. Taking some profits is a smart strategy right now, especially in those where you have gains of 20% or more. With fewer charts setting up in buy areas, investors should buy reluctantly.


The August pullback is taking down most sectors. But relative strength in energy and health care is one reason indexes are behaving differently.


Since the Nasdaq peaked on July 19, all S&P sector indexes are down. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) is the weakest, off 6%. Consumer discretionary and utilities are both down roughly 4%.


But Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) is up more than 8%, and Health Care Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) is up 2.6%. Those sectors favor the S&P 500, where health care accounts for 13.1% of the index and energy 4.3%. In [the Nasdaq](https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/index/Breakdown/COMP), health care is 8.1% and energy 1.1%.


Indeed, you'd find a few good chart setups in the energy sector now, including **SLB** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)), **Sunoco** ([SUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUN)) and **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)).


Stock Market Watches Retail Earnings
------------------------------------


While there's no inflation data coming out this week, the stock market will train its focus on Wednesday's minutes from the July Fed meeting.


It's a [big week for retailers](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), with some of the largest big box chains announcing results. **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) will release its July-quarter report Tuesday before the stock market opens.


Wednesday, **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) announces fiscal second-quarter results, and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) releases earnings on Thursday. Off-price chains **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) also report this week.


To boot, the U.S. Census Bureau releases the July retail sales report Tuesday morning. These reports come at time when inflation continues to factor into spending and margins.


In a report Monday, S&P Global Market Intelligence said the back-to-school shopping season looks softer this year, but still earns a "passing" grade. Strong wage growth and easing inflation combine to keep real income gains positive and retail sales growing.


Citing renewed consumer confidence and rising incomes, S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast back-to-school sales growth of 1.8% to $978 billion in 2023.

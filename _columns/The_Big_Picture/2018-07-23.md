title: Bank Stocks Outperform As JPMorgan Leads Dow; Alphabet Soars Late

A rally in regional bank stocks and other financials Monday trumped a weak performance from **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) stock as major stock indexes fought back after early declines.




**JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) outperformed in the Dow with gains of nearly 2%, while **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)) was a big winner in the Nasdaq 100, up 13%, on a big earnings beat.


Bank stocks took their cue from a surge in the 10-year Treasury yield. It jumped 7 basis points to 2.96%. The move was especially significant because a daily chart of the yield showed a gap above the 50-day moving average. That brings a move above 3% into play.


At the close, the Nasdaq composite outperformed, rising 0.3%. The Nasdaq 100 also rose 0.3%, but the index gained another 0.5% in after-hours trading after Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) reported stellar [second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alphabet-stock-earnings/). Shares of Alphabet were up 4% in late trading after rising 1% during the regular session.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP072318-207x300.jpg)The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and the Russell 2000 picked up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average eased less than 0.1%. Nasdaq volume fell and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in below Friday's levels.


Headed into Monday, the Nasdaq showed five [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) since June 19. That might look high on the surface, but four of the higher-volume declines showed percentage losses of 0.3% to 0.5%. That's certainly not meaningful distribution.


From a technical perspective, there's still much to like for the bulls as the Dow holds above the 28,000 level and the S&P 500 trends above 2,800. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, continues to trade tightly near all-time highs.


Bank Stocks Outperform
----------------------


Inside the superregional bank group, [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) name **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) had a good day, up 2%. It's back above the 50-day moving average, but Monday's move came in light volume.


Two other bank stocks in the group rose. **SunTrust** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)) gained 2.5% to 72.58. It's near the top of a long flat base with a 74.37 entry. **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)), meanwhile, rose nearly 3% to 110.90. It's at the top of a flat base with a 110.91 buy point.

Transports Shine Again
----------------------


The Dow Jones Transportation average also turned in a solid showing, up 0.7%. Railroad operator **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) scored its fifth straight gain after last week's breakout over a 67.79 buy point. Shares rose 1.2%.


Airline stocks also outperformed. On the heels of a strong earnings report last week, shares of **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) extended gains, rising 0.8% to 81.59. It's still in buy range from the 79.10 entry, although it's risen for eight straight sessions so a pullback wouldn't be out of the ordinary.


Other gainers included **Tiffany** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)). The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name notched its eighth straight gain, rising 1.3% to 138.13. It closed just above a flat-base entry of 138.08. Volume rose from Friday but was below average.


Elsewhere, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) reversed higher, rising 2% to 89.24. According to a [Bloomberg story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-23/loeb-s-third-point-takes-paypal-stake-sees-stock-rising-to-125), it's a new holding for Third Point's Dan Loeb. PayPal in June cleared a double-bottom base with an 84.09 entry, and later cleared an 86.42 buy point.



**Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) slipped 0.2% to 358.13 ahead of its earnings report Tuesday before the open. It was featured as a possible call-option trade in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/option-trading-top-biotech-biogen-bullish-chart-earnings/) column. The [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point is 367.99.


The stock has been holding gains smartly after shares soared nearly 20% on July 6. The catalyst was positive trial data for an Alzheimer's drug.


Tesla Stock Pressured
---------------------


Meanwhile, shares of Tesla slumped 3.3% on renewed concerns about its financial health. A report in the Wall Street Journal said the electric-car maker [asked suppliers for refunds](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-falls-suppliers-cash-back/) to help it become profitable. Last week, Needham downgraded shares to sell, citing the expiration of federal tax credits, continued cash burn and an unsustainable capital structure.


Oil prices were volatile Monday. U.S. crude oil futures hit an intraday high of $69.31 early in the session over rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran. But oil backed off, falling 0.5% to settle at $67.89 a barrel.

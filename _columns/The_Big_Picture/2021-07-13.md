Technology stocks stood alone Tuesday as most of the stock market fell in a session of mixed messages on the economy and corporate earnings.




Negative reversals in the major indexes indicated the stock market's climb is slowing, if not pausing. Indexes closed near session lows as volume picked up and breadth was the poorest in weeks.


A spike in the 10-year Treasury note's yield starting at 1 p.m. ET appeared to accelerate selling in equities. The yield went from 1.36% to 1.42% in less than 45 minutes. Late Tuesday, the yield was quoted at 1.41%, up 5 basis points.


The Nasdaq composite fell 0.4% after falling off a record high. Outperforming technology stocks were no match for broad weakness in consumer, health care and other sectors.


![MP071321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP071321-249x300.jpg)Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) climbed as much as 1.1% but cut its gain by about two-thirds, closing with a 0.4% increase. It was the only S&P sector ETF to rise Tuesday, despite weaker semiconductor and software shares.


The S&P 500 fell nearly 0.4% after cyclicals and financials cooled off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3% after a poor showing by **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) ([more production problems](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-new-headwind-to-787-production-deliveries/)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)).


Small caps took the biggest hit, as the Russell 2000 sold off 1.9% and Friday's rally evaporated. It was also the index's largest drop since June 18.


Stock Market Suffers Distribution
---------------------------------


Higher volume caused the Nasdaq to add a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). At the same time, the June 15 distribution was erased because the composite climbed more than 5% from that day's close. Volume also rose on the NYSE, which gave the S&P 500 a fourth distribution day.


Both the NYSE and Nasdaq saw nearly three stocks fall for every one that climbed.


Inflation — the stock market's latest worry — again came in hotter than expected. The June [consumer-price index increased 5.4% from a year ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-june-2021-11626125947?mod=hp_lead_pos1), the largest jump since August of 2008. Core prices, excluding food and energy costs, rose 4.5% from a year before. [Economists expected a 5% increase](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) and a 4% rise in core prices.


Jennifer Lee, Senior Economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the latest numbers further cloud the debate over the lasting effects of inflation.


The National Federation of Independent Business June survey, she noted, showed that 44% of businesses plan to raise their selling prices, the biggest share since 1979. Producer prices for May were up over 5% from 2019, import prices climbed 4%, and the Beige Book found businesses expect cost increases and plan to raise prices in coming months. So, the debate on whether inflation is merely transitory remains murky. "In fact, (the debate) got a little hotter."


While the report added to inflation worries, it couldn't be entirely blamed for Tuesday's stock market losses. Indexes opened lower but soon traded in the black. The Nasdaq climbed as much as 0.5% and the S&P 500 0.2% before sellers started taking over around 1 p.m. ET.


Second-quarter earnings start flooding in this week, and [Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan beat profit expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/jpmorgan-stock-goldman-sachs-earnings-q2-2021/). Falling Treasury yields are a drag on banks, while trading revenue is normalizing after pandemic-era volatility. But strong IPO and M&A activity boosted investment banking results.

S&P 500 Earnings Expected To Surge
----------------------------------


Goldman shares fell 1.2%; JPMorgan fell 1.5%. Both stocks are forming flat bases, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


After the S&P 500's rousing first-quarter earnings gain of 52%, the index is poised to top it. Second-quarter earnings in the S&P 500 are expected to surge 64%, according to FactSet. That would be the highest earnings growth rate since Q4 of 2009, when EPS rose 109.1%. Q2 profit estimates climbed 7.2% from March 31 to June 30. That's the largest quarterly increase in estimates since FactSet began tracking those numbers in 2002.


The IBD 50 fell 0.8%. A handful of stocks that had been sputtering, including **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)) and **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)), led the index lower.


[Chinese stocks were mainly higher](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/china-tech-stocks-rally-as-tencent-gets-approval-for-acquisition/) after Chinese regulators approved **Tencent Holdings'** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) $3.5 billion acquisition of **Sogou** ([SOGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOGO)), China's second-largest search engine company. The move eased concerns about China's regulatory crackdown. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) rose 1.1%, though it remained 18% below prior highs. Tencent's U.S.-traded shares jumped 3.8%; Sogou added 2.3%.

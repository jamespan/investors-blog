  Small Caps Lead Mixed Day On Fed Rate Hike; Are These Leaders OK?

Although it was quite mild, stocks showed a bit of whiplike action after the Janet Yellen-led Federal Reserve officially raised interest rates for the fifth time in two years. But there's no mistaking that the nine-year bull market remains in a confirmed uptrend.




 The Nasdaq composite edged 0.2% higher as volume crept up a bit. Intraday, the tech-weighted index was up 0.5%. In other words, amid a relative dearth of surprise news other than last night's upset win of a Democratic seat in the U.S. Senate, the Nasdaq traded quietly.


While the overall price-and-volume action of the Nasdaq would normally fit the textbook definition of a stalling session, a form of distribution, the market has seen numerous instances of these days, only to keep driving higher. Thus, Wednesday does not count as a distribution; with the Nov. 7 Nasdaq [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) (a 0.3% decline in higher turnover) expiring on time, the leading index's distribution count on the Market Pulse falls to four.


Keep in mind that price-related volatility among the major indexes has shrunk a lot this year. That makes it even more difficult to discern a tight trading session in which the market inches higher in a calm fashion from real instances of pronounced institutional selling.

The distribution-day count for the S&P 500 remains at an ultra low single day, the 0.2% decline on Nov. 14.Â NYSE volume was roughly flat, according to early data.


The S&P SmallCap 600 outperformed with a 0.5% advance.


The Dow Jones industrials, boosted by nine of the 30 components gaining 1 point or more, gained 0.3%. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) (93 RS Rating on Stock Checkup) surged again, bringing more focus into commodity plays. Numerous metal ores stocks are basing again or breaking out, from copper play **Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) to **BHP Billiton** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) and **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)). Freeport has cleared the 15.69 buy point of a double-bottom base.



Caterpillar was highlighted in the latest IBD Weekly column in [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


Copper, the so-called metal with a Ph.D. in economics, is having a fine 2017. Near-term futures are up nearly 22% since Jan. 1.


The Dow utility average matched the Dow industrials' gain, rising 0.3%. Utilities are generally doing just fine even though the fed funds rate is now at a target range of 1.25% to 1.5%. Utilities incur tons of debt to finance infrastructure projects, but the cost of money is still historically super-low.


When many Generation X'ers were still playing with Barbie dolls and Legos and riding the Big Wheel all-plastic tricycles, their parents had to deal with lending rates that approached 20% for home mortgages and a Federal Reserve discount rate that reached as high as 14% for money center banks.


At 750, the Dow utilities are up a respectable 13.8% year to date.


Even at 1.5%, the fed funds rate is still a far cry from the 5.25% level that held from June 2006 to September 2007. Relative to that level, the reported prospect of three additional quarter-point hikes in 2018, presumably under the next Fed chief to be, Jerome Powell, would hardly make U.S. Treasury bonds competitive with the future earnings yield of the S&P 500.


That earnings yield, which is simply the expected full-year earnings of S&P 500 firms divided by the current price of the benchmark, has hovered between 5% and 6% for years.



The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which ended flat on Wednesday, is still up 5.3% since the start of the quarter. Even with 11 trading sessions remaining in 2017, the high tech sector is likely to end the year with handsome gains. Still, watch how the leading names, such as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), behave in the coming weeks.


Why? Continued resistance at the 50-day and 10-week moving averages and further declines would likely mean that these tech superstars are ready to put their feet up in front of a warm fire and take a serious break.


Nvidia, a 2.4% loser on Wednesday, is now 14% off a 218.67 all-time peak. Applied Materials, the largest member of IBD's semiconductor equipment industry group, lies 16% beneath its all-time high of 60.89.


Some software names, such as hot new IPO **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), are also poised to form potential new bases.


Yet if you are new to IBD, remember this: Bases are good. They represent [opportunity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

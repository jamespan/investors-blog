In a day when the major indexes were in flux, the stock market saved its best work for the final hour, keeping hopes alive for a bottoming signal.




The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.8% while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%. Gains firmed up in the final two hours of the session.


The three major indexes remained below their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The Dow met resistance at that line for the second time in three sessions. In addition, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain below trendlines that delineated their lows during the March-July run.


Indeed, as the stock market wraps up August it's nursing monthly index losses of 3.3% to 4.4%. That would snap five-month win streaks for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Small caps outperformed Monday, as the Russell 2000 added 0.8%. The index continues to find support at its 200-day moving average. Yet, the small-cap benchmark wasn't spared in the current stock market correction, losing as much as 8.6%. The Russell is more than 2% below its 50-day moving average, more than the major indexes. It's also down more than the other indexes this month, off 6.7%.


The IBD 50 index rose 0.8% as **Futu Holdings** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) surged nearly 8% in active trading. BofA Securities upgraded the Chinese brokerage from underperform to buy and raised the price target from 32.15 to 62.80, reports said.


Stock Market Leadership Changing
--------------------------------


Stock market leadership has narrowed during the month, and in other ways shifted significantly.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP082823-285x300.jpg)The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology Sectors are both on pace for their worst month since December, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) ETF is down 5.6% this month. It is almost sure to end a seven-month winning streak â€” its longest since August 2014.


Despite its difficulties, the stock market remains in a rally attempt. All it would take to confirm the move is a big index rally with an increase in daily volume. As long as the Nasdaq and S&P stay above their August lows, a [follow-through signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) remains in play.


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq from Friday's levels. That made Monday's gains less satiating. In fact, the market's rally attempt is unfolding in a trend of declining volume. Ideally, a price advance should happen with rising or at least steady volume.


If a follow-through comes, however, it may not matter. The Jan. 6 follow-through came after light holiday-season trading. And the March 29 follow-through also came after a period of light trading. Both of those signals resulted in productive uptrends.


Currently, internal stock market indicators are mixed.


While the Nasdaq is still looking oversold in its Short-Term Overbought-Oversold Oscillator (found in [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)), the 10-day moving averages of up vs. down volume and of new highs vs. new lows show sellers still have the upper hand. Similar trends also appear in the NYSE composite.


This agrees with the [diminishing number of new highs](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/new-highs-in-short-supply-as-august-sees-this-shift-in-trend/) vs. new lows this month.


But in a bit of relief for investors, the number of sell signals among high-rated stocks has slowed the past week or so.


Similarities To Previous Correction
-----------------------------------


Until a follow-through emerges, investors need to avoid buying more stocks and instead raise cash. Taking some profits is a smart strategy, as is quickly selling stocks that flash sell signals. IBD is recommending a stock exposure of 0% to 20%.


In some ways, the current stock market correction resembles the last one, in February and March. Then, the S&P 500 gave back about 9% and the Nasdaq 10.5%. This time, the S&P has corrected 6% and the Nasdaq about 9%.


Both corrections started with excessive optimism and were driven by rising bond yields, says an analysis from Ned Davis Research. "Now as then, bond yield downturn has helped market start to recover from oversold condition with optimism relieved and long-term uptrend intact."


The 10-year Treasury yield has eased from its Aug. 22 high, to 4.21% late Monday, but is still near January 2008 highs.


Chinese stocks also outperformed the U.S. stock market after Chinese officials [took steps to shore up the country's financial system](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alibaba-jd-china-hong-kong-stock-price-6dc0fed8?mod=hp_LEAD_3). In one such move, the Ministry of Finance announced it is cutting the stamp duty on securities transactions by half.


The iShares MSCI China ETF ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) rose 1%, and iShares China Large Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) climbed 2.4%. Overnight, the Shanghai Composite jumped 1.1% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng rose 1%. (The Tokyo Nikkei 225 rallied 1.7%.)

Stocks took a step back Monday following Friday's rally, although leaders had a nice day.

  

The Nasdaq fell 0.2% after having been up as much as 0.3%. It closed back below the 5000 level but stayed above its 50-day moving average.

  

Hurt by losses in energy stocks, the S&P 500 fell 0.5%. Recently, the benchmark index has met resistance near 2120.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 edged up 0.1% for its fourth straight gain.

  

The IBD 50, which fell the past two weeks, rallied 0.3%, with 26 of its components up on the day. Among the biggest winners in the IBD 50, **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) jumped 7% in big volume and extended its advance from a 35.96 buy point. It's now extended from that entry.

  

**Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) and **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) also rallied in fast trade. The latter posted better-than-expected first-quarter results. (See [story](http://news.investors.com/technology/051115-752035-act-lgnd-endp-report-q1-earnings.htm).)

  

Overall market volume fell sharply from Friday's heavy pace.

  

Breadth was mixed. Nasdaq winners edged losers by a little less than 9 to 8. But NYSE decliners topped advancers by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.

  

Weekend news that China was cutting interest rates for the third time in six months to boost its economy didn't do much for the U.S. stock market, which is in correction mode amid a heavy load of distribution days.

  

But Chinese stocks **Jumei International** ([JMEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JMEI)), **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)) rallied 4% to 7%.

  

Others such as **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) fell.

  

The U.S. market had previously rallied after China cut rates in early March and late November.

  

With the market in a correction, investors should not be putting money to work with new buys. The market correction can act as a headwind, making it tough for most stocks to gain ground. Also, the continuation of earnings season has added volatility. **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) have been hammered on disappointing quarterly results. But even good quarterly earnings and sales will not lead to a higher stock price, as Autohome showed by sinking despite beating views on Wednesday.

  

So instead of sticking their necks out when the environment isn't in their favor, investors should continue to pay attention to what's happening and work on watch lists in the meantime.

  

Since last April, market corrections noted in the Market Pulse have been as short as a few days to nearly eight weeks. Thus investors need to be ready to buy when the uptrend returns. A new uptrend could start quickly.

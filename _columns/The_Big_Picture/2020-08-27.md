The stock market ended with mixed action Thursday in a volatile trading session following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech. The Nasdaq set a record high before reversing modestly lower.




The Nasdaq ended down 0.3%, after falling as much as 1%, easily lagging behind the other major stock indexes. The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded up 0.6%, or 160 points, boosted by a 4.5% gain in shares of **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). Walmart shares regained their 132.09 buy point in a double-bottom base after the [company said](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tiktok-sale-imminent-walmart-joins-microsoft-bidding-frenzy-oracle-offer/) in a statement that it is joining **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) in a bid for TikTok. Microsoft stock rallied 2.5% to record highs.


Workday A Top Stock Market Performer
------------------------------------


The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.3%. Leading growth stocks underperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) declined 1.5%. Inside the IBD 50, **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) was one of the top performers with a 1.4% advance, and is extended from a 200.10 buy point after Wednesday's breakout. Workday shares [soared on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/workday-earnings-workday-stock-wday-q2-2020/) after the close. On the downside, software leader **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and chip leader **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) tumbled 3.4% and 5.7%, respectively.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Nasdaq Reverses From Record High
--------------------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 again set record highs Thursday after [Powell updated the Federal Reserve's policy on inflation](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-confirms-big-policy-shift-stoke-inflation-dow-jones/), saying the Fed is willing to allow inflation above the traditional 2% cap to support the labor market and broader economy.


![MP082720_3](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP082720_3-230x300.jpg)But after a late-day sell-off, the Nasdaq reversed lower, while the S&P 500 cut its gains.


The Nasdaq's 0.3% loss combined with higher volume added a distribution day, offsetting the loss of the Nasdaq's Aug. 19 distribution day. So, the Nasdaq still only has one. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost its only [distribution day.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) The Aug. 19 distribution day fell off because the Nasdaq rose more than 5% from that day's closing price.


The S&P's Aug. 11 distribution day fell off due to the same 5% rule. But late Thursday, NYSE volume was confirmed higher, which gave the S&P 500 a stall day. That's a subtle form of distribution.


[Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-cheers-salesforce-earnings-nasdaq-sp500-mark-new-highs/) warned that the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 were at the top of their upper channel lines again. Previous tests of the upper channel line have resulted in short pullbacks.


Top technology stocks suffered some losses Thursday, but nothing that damaged their charts. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fell 1.2%, but is still within striking distance of record highs, while FANG leader **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) tumbled 3.5%. On the upside, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) surged another 4% to all-time highs. Meanwhile, a number of high-profile growth stocks are in or near buy zones.

Stocks In Buy Zones: Amazon, Intuitive Surgical, NetEase
--------------------------------------------------------


Bullishly, a number of top growth stocks are breaking out past [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) or forming new bases, as the stock market hits all-time highs.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is in the buy range above a 3,344.39 buy point in a flat base, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares fell 1.2% Thursday in lighter volume.


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) broke out past a 704.10 buy point in a four-weeks-tight formation with a 1.3% advance. The stock is a new addition to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) service.


Top Chinese stock **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) is in the 5% buy zone past a 503.37 buy point in a flat base after Tuesday's breakout move. The 5% buy zone goes up to 528.54. Shares dipped 0.4% Thursday.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [NetEase stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netease-inc-adr-ntes.aspx) shows a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the top echelon of growth stocks.


Fellow top Chinese stocks **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) have staged breakouts within the past couple of weeks. Alibaba is up 6% from a 268.10 buy point in a [flat base,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) while JD.com is up about 15% from a 69.28 entry.



Stocks To Watch: Atlassian, Netflix
-----------------------------------


**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are moving up the right side of new bases, displaying new buy points.


Atlassian is shaping a lopsided [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/) with a 196.43 buy point. Shares regained their 50-day line on Wednesday and are about 4% away from the new entry after Thursday's 2.9% gain.


A key flaw is the stock's lagging [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line is far from its May 15 highs. Ideally, the RS line should hit a new high on the breakout or soon after to confirm the stock as a potential stock market leader.


Netflix tumbled nearly 4% Thursday, giving back a portion of Wednesday's 11.6% surge. For now, a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) is forming with a 575.47 buy point. Netflix is a longtime IBD [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock.

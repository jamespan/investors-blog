Stock indexes posted nice gains Friday, but weren't able to do any major repairs to their charts. The Nasdaq popped 1.2%, while the S&P 500 added 0.6%. The IBD 50 advanced 1.1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE, despite options expirations that tend to lift trade.


The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq left some work undone: They failed to retake their 50-day moving averages.


Yet, the indexes did accomplish this much: The Nasdaq broke a losing streak of four weeks, and the S&P 500 ended a three-week losing streak.


The uptrend has been under pressure now for more than four weeks.

The difficulties, however, go back further. The Nasdaq notched a high in July and since then, sloppy action has ruled the market except for sustained advances in October and February through mid-March.


Is this likely to continue?


Take a look at either the Nasdaq's daily chart on Investors.com or another chart with a wide, horizontal view that shows the index from at least July. Action has been wide and loose, especially on the downside.


The upside action doesn’t look nearly as wild, particularly for the last two rebounds. On the daily chart, the rebounds feature many bullishly high closes. Pullbacks have been minor. The rebounds have been in the 15%-18% range.


Yet, there's something else that, so far, looks like it could be a change in character.


The current pullback of roughly 6% is more orderly than the downdrafts in August and January were.


A chart reader might draw two conclusions. First, the current pattern looks much better than previous consolidations. Second, the V-shaped rebounds, not ideal, could give way now to a more stable U-shaped rebound.


Does that sound too optimistic? Perhaps. There's nothing that says the market can’t turn ugly from here, or simply step sideways for a long time. However, as of now, the Nasdaq’s chart action looks like an improvement over its prior corrections.

Another factor to look at in relation to the Nasdaq’s chart is the put-call volume ratio. The ratio closed at 1.16 on Feb. 8; 1.21 on March 8; 1.11 on May 4; 1.15 on May 13; and 1.20 on Thursday.


The readings show the put-call ratio has been fairly accurate in pegging short-term lows.


For the week, the Nasdaq rose 1.1% and the S&P 500 0.3%.


**Coming up**: The week's key report will come Friday before the open. The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the second take on first-quarter GDP. The first reading came in at an anemic 0.5%. Bulls are hoping for a strong upward revision.

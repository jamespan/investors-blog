So far, so good.




After the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 made [follow-through rally confirmations Friday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-roars-back-to-life-amid-new-fed-hopes-these-stocks-shine-brightest/), the stock market extended gains Monday.


In the initial hours, performance was uneven. The Nasdaq composite and small caps lagged the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. But the Nasdaq composed itself in afternoon trading and closed almost 0.9% higher.


The S&P 500 and Dow led with gains of 1.2% and 1.3%. The Russell 2000 rose less than 0.4% as small caps never caught up with the rest of the market. Volume rose 2% vs. Friday's session on the Nasdaq and was indicated lower on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MP102422-287x300.jpg)Friday's [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) — when the S&P and Nasdaq surged more than 2% each in higher volume — marked the start of a confirmed market uptrend. But while the signal is historically bullish, today's market calls for greater safeguards.


Reasons For Stock Market Caution
--------------------------------


Three follow-throughs that occurred earlier this year all failed, as they often do in bear markets. And today's stock market still faces major risks.


The Fed, for one, is still looking for clear signs that inflation is cooling off before it cuts back on rate hikes. Scores of earnings reports are coming out this week, including many bellwether companies.


While Britain [settled on a new prime minister](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rishi-sunak-extends-lead-in-race-for-next-u-k-prime-minister-11666607256?mod=hp_lead_pos1), Chinese assets plummeted after President [Xi Jinping reinforced his hold over the ruling Communist Party](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-stocks-dive-after-china-party-meeting-11666588451?mod=hp_lead_pos3).


That probably means more of China's zero-Covid policy and tough regulations on technology companies. Foreign capital fled China's domestic stock market. The Shanghai composite slid 2%. The Hong Kong-based Hang Seng plummeted 6.4% — its worst day since Nov. 6, 2008, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


U.S. traded Chinese ETFs also reeled. IShares' MSCI China ETF ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) sold off 9.7% and China Large Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) 10%. KraneShares China Internet ETF ([KWEB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KWEB)) tumbled more than 14%. China-sensitive stocks such as **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) (which cut prices in China) and **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) also bypassed Monday's market advance.


How To Approach Today's Market
------------------------------


Rather than go all-in, stock investors should increase exposure carefully. As Friday's Big Picture advised, an exposure level no higher than 20% of a stock portfolio might be prudent for most investors right now.


Start with a handful of selective buys and if they produce gains, expand your pool of purchases. More growth stocks need to rally above buy points. Stock market indexes need to avoid big-volume declines.


In a sense, the stock market needs confirmation of its confirmation signal.


The amount of institutional-quality stocks forming sound bases or breaking out is relatively small. But opportunities are growing. On Monday, more than 20 stocks appeared on [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s breakouts list. Most, however, were unimpressive.



Many lacked strong volume, including new issue **Corebridge Financial** ([CRBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRBG)), health products supplier **McKesson** ([MCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCK)), managed care provider **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) and retailer **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)).


**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) — one of the most attractive chart setups of late — made a better showing with volume for the day jumping 56% above average. **International Money Express** ([IMXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMXI)) got big volume, 170% above average, as it broke out of a cup base. IMXI has been flagged as one of the key [Nasdaq stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/research/nasdaq-stocks-to-watch-today/).


Volume was strong for **Verra Mobility** ([VRRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRRM)) but the transportation tech company closed well off its 17.41 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Stock Market Could Remain Volatile, Sensitive To Data
-----------------------------------------------------


Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, says the market rally suggests markets will remain volatile, and investors should gird themselves for large moves in the stock market — in both directions.


"Incremental improvements in inflation or labor market data, indications of economic resilience or any softening of language from the Fed has the potential to drive a market bounce, as we have seen in recent days," he said in a note Monday. "But while it is encouraging that Fed officials have started to point to an end in sight for rate rises, such a pause will remain conditional on fading inflation and a cooling labor market. This has yet to be seen in the data."


Earnings could be another hindrance to the stock market's rebound. "We believe the full effects of restrictive monetary policy for the economy and corporate profits are not yet well reflected in consensus forecasts — leading to potential disappointments ahead."


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed 2 basis points to 4.23%, still floating around June 2008 highs.


The S&P Global flash composite purchasing managers index showed slowing economic activity. The composite output, service activity and manufacturing indexes saw contractions. The stock market is treating weaker data as a reason to put the brakes on Fed tightening.


The personal consumption expenditure gauge, the Fed's favorite measure of price inflation, is due out Friday.

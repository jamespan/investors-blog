**Global-e Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) slides nearly 18% in the stock market Wednesday in more than triple its usual volume. Security and safety products firm **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) gets the Taser equivalent of a shock from sellers, falling 16% in the heaviest turnover in almost two months. And payments company **Shift4** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) gets socked for a 17% drop as 9.8 million shares exchange hands, more than six times its average over the past 50 sessions.


Obviously, you wouldn't receive this type of information or see such a heavy pelting of top-rated growth stocks — or, for that matter, an accumulation of shares in others — by simply looking at what the key indexes did.




For the second session in a row, the major equity benchmarks gave the illusion of a tranquil stock market. After handily erasing its intraday losses on Tuesday with a small gain, the Nasdaq composite gave a mirrorlike performance on Wednesday. Up less than 0.1% on Wednesday and closing at 20,056, the Nasdaq closed above the psychologically important 20,000 level for only the fourth time in 2025.


The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to 6,144 and strode to an all-time high. The index traded within a narrow range of just 36 points — less than 0.6% from intraday low to high. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange shrank modestly vs. Tuesday. On the Nasdaq, turnover cooled 6% to 8.16 billion shares.


So is the stock market masking a bigger shift away from growth stocks?


Of course, investors likely would be hard-pressed to make such a conclusion after observing the above-named indexes. That's when a look at sector indexes helps.


Keep An Eye On Value In Stock Market
------------------------------------



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP021925.jpg)At first blush, dispersion among these gauges of the stock market appeared low on Wednesday as well. The iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) exchange traded fund rose 0.3%, not really much of a difference with the less-than-0.1% move up by iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)).


But in 2025, the former is clearly leading the latter.


Since Jan. 1, iShares Russell 1000 Value has boosted its gain to almost 6%, while iShares Russell 1000 Growth has advanced 3.7%. This strikes quite a contrast when you note that the 12-month gain by Russell Value, up 16.4%, pales next to Russell Growth's 27.9% jump. Thus, the next moves by both exchange traded funds bears watching.


In similar fashion, the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF ([IVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IVE)) rose 0.4% to match a three-week high. Meanwhile, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF ([IVW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IVW)) gained ground for a fourth straight session, but on Wednesday it inched up just 3 pennies.


Go Across The Pond
------------------


Is the emerging shift away from growth stocks in the U.S. and toward value part of an even bigger phenomenon?


Let's consider how stock markets overseas are faring.


According to Dow Jones Data, the Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.9% on Wednesday to 552.10. Even then, the index boasts an 8.8% lift so far this year. That's double what the S&P 500, a 24.2% winner excluding dividends in 2023 and up 23.3% last year, has done so far in 2025. It's up nearly 4.5%.


But consider the recent woeful news headlines on the economy and the auto industry coming out of Germany. With a pivotal national election approaching, the country's DAX benchmark fell 1.8% on Wednesday to trim its year-to-date gain to 12.7%. And France's CAC 40 Index, up 9.9%, looks sharp compared with a 3.9% rise for the Nasdaq.


The Euro Stoxx 50, sort of a Dow Jones Industrial Average equivalent across the pond, holds an 11.5% gain since Jan. 1.


The U.S. investor perhaps could use two ETFs as proxies for at least two EU member countries: iShares MSCI Germany ([EWG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWG)), which gapped down Wednesday 2.3% to halt a six-day winning streak, and iShares MSCI France ([EWQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWQ)), down 1.4% in accelerating volume.



EWG has risen 8% past a flat base that furnished a 34.12 pivot point before Wednesday's pullback. EWQ, in a nine-month base, has rebounded 15% from its early January low of 35.22.


Over in Latin America, amid the possibility that the White House will impose a stiff 25% tariff on imports from Mexico in early March, Mexico's IPC benchmark fell 0.7%. But the Indice de Precios y Cotizaciones has risen an impressive 9.3% since Jan. 1.

Three Key Stock Market Sell Rules
---------------------------------



**HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and Axon cleaved their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) in heavy volume. Selling at least part of the position on this action is one critical way to lock in gains and leave the door open for a potential rebound in the near term.


HubSpot, meanwhile, also delivered a second sell rule: Don't let a gain of more than 10% from a [proper breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) turn into a loss. Letting your hard-earned gains round-trip into losses can affect your psyche such that you might be gun shy in growth stocks when conditions improve.


The third rule that resonates in both good markets and bad? [Cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) in every investment. Limit the loss to no greater than 7%.


Both companies exited the [Leaderboard model portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com/?_gl=1*v0bsyd*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2Ljk3NDU5MzM4My4xNzM4ODY5Mjc4LjE3Mzg4NjkyNzg.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczODkzNzIxOS4yMDguMS4xNzM4OTM3OTk2LjUxLjAuMA..#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) of IBD-style growth stocks on Wednesday as HubSpot clipped its rising [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). When a true stock market winner breaks out of a well-formed base, it usually leads its 21-day line for weeks, even months, before testing support at this key short-term technical level.


Even after Wednesday's sharp fall, according to MarketSurge, Cambridge, Mass.-based HubSpot, an expert in inbound marketing and sales software, has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 82.

Earnings Picture: Still Bright?
-------------------------------


Data from S&P Global Market Intelligence reported that S&P 500 firms are forecast to earn a collective $268.40 this year, up 11% vs. 2024. In terms of sectors, the biggest gains are expected in health care, up 18.7% vs. 2024; information technology, up 18.3%; industrials, up 12%; and materials and utilities, up 8.7%.


"We're having a very solid earnings season (regarding the fourth quarter), with 77% reporting earnings beats with average beat of 7%," Louis Navellier, veteran mutual fund manager, wrote in comments emailed to IBD. "Overall guidance for the full year 2025 remains firm."


That said, it's very important to monitor how the stock market responds to earnings news. On Wednesday, some laggard stocks continued to get punished following their quarterly reports.


Down Even More
--------------


Take **Celanese** ([CE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CE)). The specialist in polymers and aceytl intermediates in the chemicals industry reported a 35% drop in earnings to $1.45 a share as sales fell 8% to $2.37 billion. Both figures showed an even sharper decline in profits and sales vs. the third quarter. Celanese tumbled 21% in the heaviest volume since its third-quarter earnings were delivered three months ago.


A year ago, according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF&_gl=1*1k2cc1h*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2Ljk3NDU5MzM4My4xNzM4ODY5Mjc4LjE3Mzg4NjkyNzg.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczODkzNzIxOS4yMDguMS4xNzM4OTM3OTg4LjU5LjAuMA..), Celanese stock held a solid 87 Relative Strength Rating. Today, it's at 8 on a scale of 1 to 99.


**Flowserve** ([FLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLS)) dropped 6.5% and undercut its 50-day moving average after a recent breakout past 62.32 made minor headway. The pump and valve giant reported modest fourth-quarter numbers, with earnings per share up 3% and sales 1% higher.


So, despite the fact that Flowserve carried a decent [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92 heading into the fourth-quarter report, the 83 [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) was so-so when compared with companies in, say, the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/?_gl=1*1wd5qbh*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2Ljk3NDU5MzM4My4xNzM4ODY5Mjc4LjE3Mzg4NjkyNzg.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczOTk5Njk3MC4yNTcuMS4xNzQwMDAyODY3LjU4LjAuMA..). Within this stock list, the median earnings growth in the latest quarter was 36% vs. year-ago levels. After the report, Flowserve's EPS Rating plunged to 67.

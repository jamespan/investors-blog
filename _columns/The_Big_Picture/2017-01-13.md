The Nasdaq got back on track Friday, a day after posting its first down day of 2017.


Small caps also recovered, with the S&P 600 rising 0.8% after falling in four of the previous eight sessions, the only ones so far this new year.


On Friday, the Nasdaq gained 0.5%, while the S&P 500 added 0.2% and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1%.


![mp011317](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP011317-192x300.png)Volume declined on both major exchanges in the run-up to the three-day weekend, according to preliminary data. The stock market will be closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.


On a quiet day, individual investors might not expect much notable action among leaders.


But a number of stocks showed strong, follow-up action to recent breakouts. Some remain in a buy zone. Others recently have consolidated long enough to be considered in proper bases and should be watched for breakouts.


Here are nine stocks that individual investors might consider for possible buys.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) retook a buy point it had cleared and then lost. The stock remains in the 5% buy zone.


Ad tech firm **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) padded a recent breakout but remains in the 5% buy zone.


Medical device maker **AngioDynamics** ([ANGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANGO)) broke out of a flat base Friday and remains in the 5% buy zone.


Stocks now in bases include **Toro** ([TTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTC)), **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)), **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)).


The stocks sketching bases appear to be mimicking the sideways action of the S&P 500.


If the base builders showed relative strength lines rising to new highs, it would be much better.


The Nasdaq's pattern, which has an upward tilt over the past two weeks, would be a better model for leaders.


The Nasdaq rose 1% for the week, while the S&P 500 inched down 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.4%. The small-cap S&P 600 eased less than 0.1% for the week. The SPDR Gold Trust ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) outperformed, bursting 2.2% higher for its third weekly gain in a row.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, mining metal ores led with an 8% weekly gain. Generic drugs did the worst, losing 5%.


**Coming up:** With Q4 earnings season now underway, some big reports are coming up. Tuesday: **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) and Morgan Stanley. Wednesday: **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and Netflix. Thursday: **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)). Friday: **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) and **SunTrust Banks** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)).

Stock Market Takes Fed Statement In Stride; Alphabet, AMD Lead Nasdaq
======================================================================

Strong earnings reports from **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) helped lift the Nasdaq composite to a gain of 0.7% Wednesday. The stock market strengthened a bit after the conclusion of the two-day Federal Reserve meeting and policy statement at 2 p.m. ET.




The Russell 2000 led the way, up 1.5%, but the small cap index is still below its 50-day moving average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and continues to hover near the 35,000 level. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) was a bright spot in the blue-chip index. Shares gapped up after the company reported its first quarterly profit in nearly two years, but Boeing got turned away at its 50-day moving average after hitting a high of 237.49. The stock's 50-day line is 237.42.


The Nasdaq composite made a solid test of its 10-week moving average last week. Then it declined 1.2% Monday's in lower volume, and several leading growth stocks fell hard. The weak action was a reminder to stay nimble. Stay on top of your current holdings and don't be afraid to take partial profits, even if some winners continue to hold above key support levels. If some new buys aren't panning out, don't be afraid to cut losses short.

------------------


![MP072821](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP072821-247x300.jpg)The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%. AMD stock was the big winner in the index, up 7.5%, after the chip giant reported a 250% surge in quarterly profit. Revenue jumped 99% to $3.85 billion. AMD ended the session still in buy range from a 95.54 buy point. But after a long period of sideways movement, AMD's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is lagging.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in very close to Tuesday's levels.


For the second day in row, energy and materials stocks led. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) picked up 0.9%, while the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) added 0.3%. Health care stocks also outperformed, with the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) up 0.4%.


In the medical products group, **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) broke out of a long consolidation after reporting earnings. Even though it's still in a buy zone from a 228.94 buy point, the stock looks extended after clearing an early 208.05 entry.


Growth stocks had another good day, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) up 2.4%. Eight names in the IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks rose 4% or more, including recent IPO **Global-E Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)), which soared 10% to an all-time high.


Fed Statement
-------------


Wall Street was looking for more clarity about when the Fed might start tapering its monthly bond purchases, but it didn't get it. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did say that [progress is being made toward its employment and inflation goals](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-stock-market-reaction-hinges-on-these-four-words-from-fed-chief-powell/), but that more progress is needed on the labor market side. The bottom line? The Fed is still in wait-and-see mode.


Actual tapering of the Fed's $120-billion per month in asset purchases won't likely begin until late this year or early in 2022.


The July statement comes ahead of the Fed's annual Jackson Hole symposium on Aug. 26-28. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for Sept. 21-22.


The 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 1.25% ahead of the statement and inched up to 1.26% near the close.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Steel producer and IBD 50 firm **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) broke out over a trend line Wednesday, giving an early entry. The stock is still in a seven-week consolidation with a conventional entry of 24.87. Group peer **ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)) rallied 2% to 34.29. It topped a 34.06 buy point with earnings due Thursday before the open.


A couple of [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/10years) stocks showed bullish price action after early downdrafts.


**Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) plunged to its 50-day moving average, but a 13% early loss was pared to 1.8% by the close. Institutional-quality growth stocks often find support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) after a breakout, and that's exactly what happened with Generac. Generac joined Leaderboard on June 8 when it broke out in heavy volume.


**InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) was under pressure early and paid a visit to its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), but the stock bounced off the support level, closing with a gain of nearly 2%. InMode preannounced bullish results on July 12. But the actual results came in slightly better than guidance. Adjusted earnings surged 325% from the year-ago quarter, with revenue up 184% to $87.3 million.

What are streaks? They're meant to be broken. After the Federal Reserve confirmed investors' expectations by raising short-term interest rates by half a point, the stock market snapped its two-day winning streak as well.




Stock Market Today: A Different Air Of Selling
----------------------------------------------


But Wednesday's decline differed from recent reactions to the U.S. central bank's past decisions.


The Nasdaq's 0.8% slip only slightly exceeded drops of 0.6% to 0.7% by the S&P 500 and Russell 2000. Volume, almost unbelievably, sank 10% or more vs. Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.4%, taking back less than a quarter of its roughly 1.9% advance in the prior two sessions. NYSE volume also fell.


Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rose 2.7% to $77.42 a barrel. The yield on the key U.S. Treasury bond ended virtually flat at 3.5%.


Broad selling in the stock market? For sure. Yet Wednesday's figures proved mild compared to what happened on Sept. 21.


On that day, the Fed raised the fed funds rate by three quarters of a point to a target range of 3%-3.25%. The S&P 500 slumped 1.7% by session's end. Then it slid an additional 3.8% in four more days of declines.


This sell-off preceded the current short-term market bottom and a [follow-through day on Oct. 21](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-roars-back-to-life-amid-new-fed-hopes-these-stocks-shine-brightest/).


On Nov. 2, sellers sent the large-cap benchmark barreling 2.5% lower on another Fed rate hike by 75 basis points and hawkish commentary that afternoon by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Not A Fed Pivot Yet
-------------------


By sending the fed funds rate up 50 basis points to a target range of 4.25%-4.5% on Wednesday, the Fed ended its run of 75-basis-point increases at the prior four meetings. Indeed, this monetary tightening campaign has made history as one of the swiftest in IBD readers' lives. Yet perhaps more importantly, the Fed may have signaled that it won't have to be so aggressive in the coming months to accomplish its twin goals of economic growth and stable prices.


Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede, noted in an email sent to IBD that "investors should expect the Fed to become less prescriptive and increasingly reactive to the latest inflation trends in fine tuning rates." Pride added that perhaps a half to three quarters of 1 point in total future rate hikes may be "in the pipeline for Q1 2023 until settling out at a terminal rate around 5%."


In its "Summary of Economic Projections" (SEP) issued together with the rate hike decision, the Fed governors en masse gave a median forecast for the fed funds rate — what is charged on overnight loans to money center banks — of 5.1% in all of 2023. This implies a target range of 5%-5.25%.


Keep in mind that the full range of estimates in 2023 run from 4.9% to as high as 5.6%, equating to a target range of 5.5%-5.75%.


Encouraging Inflation Signs
---------------------------


Plus, the SEP showed a median fed funds rate forecast of 4.1% in 2024 and 3.1% in 2025.


Meanwhile, after Powell finished his post-announcement talk, Bruce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors, told IBD that the most encouraging of comment from the Fed chief was "acknowledgment of how core inflation is coming down more than expected, as evidenced by new rental leases coming at levels significantly below data being used to calculate core CPI."


"This is a big deal, given that housing is the largest component of core CPI. Therefore, we wouldn't be surprised if Powell uses this as a primary reason for halting rate increases at their May meeting," Doty added.


Meanwhile, the SEP also showed the Fed's confidence that inflation, as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures index, will peak this year at 4.8%. The governors' median forecast also sees core PCE inflation easing to 3.5% next year, 2.5% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025.



At 3995, the S&P 500 shows a healthy 14.4% rebound off its mid-October low of 3491. Disappointingly, the index still hasn't crossed clearly back above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). And that technical level hasn't yet bottomed. That is, its slope still keeps falling. This implies the long-term trend is bearish.


3 Stock Market Elements To Watch
--------------------------------


Yet the stock market is also quietly flashing at least three reasons why the uptrend is not about to croak.


One, market breadth has steadily improved, and much more so on the NYSE.


The NYSE advance-decline line tobogganed lower from mid-August to early October. Yet since then, the A-D line has traversed higher at a decent angle. Further rises would indicate that more stocks are building bases and getting closer to breakout points.


Two, other sector indexes have done even better than the S&P 500. And they're not in the oil and gas patch.



Consider iShares U.S. Transportation ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)). The ETF is also struggling to break through  resistance at its 200-day line. Yet at 227.19, it's garnered an 18.2% advance since its October low.


In technology, which has been battered harder than practically all other broad sectors, chip stocks are acting better lately. VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) backtracked 1.7% on Wednesday. However, it stopped short of crashing back through its own [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/).


At 223.77, the ETF has logged a 34% gain from its Oct. 13 reversal low.

Is The Rally In Oil Stocks Done?
--------------------------------


Three, oil and gas stocks aren't quite dominating the market's leadership as much as they have in, say, the first six months of 2021 or in earlier periods of this year.


Sure, Energy remained No. 1 among all 33 IBD sectors for middle- to long-term price performance headed into Wednesday's session. But most individual leaders in the oil and gas space have lost their footing. **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)), **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) have all squandered their recent gains after surpassing IBD-style buy points. The first two are facing tests of support at their own 200-day lines.



A new tradeable rally in the stock market relies on fresh sectors of leadership.


While the major indexes lost ground on Wednesday, [at least 18 of IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) bucked the decline and gained 0.5% or more.


They included solar energy, long-term medical care, shoe manufacturing, trucking, generic drugs, department stores, logistics, database software, discount retail, homebuilding and RV and mobile home manufacturing.

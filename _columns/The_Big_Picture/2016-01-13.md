Small Caps Slide Into A Bear Market; Nasdaq Also Falls Hard
============================================================

Small-cap stocks officially entered a bear market amid a wide-ranging sell-off Wednesday, fueled by the lowest oil prices in a dozen years. Brent crude futures touched below $30 a barrel, accelerating the stock market's decline. Brent oil marked lows not seen since April 2004 and has now fallen nearly 74% below its June 2014 peak of $114.81 a barrel.


The Russell 2000, a key market gauge of smaller, publicly traded companies, dove 3.3% to end at 1010.19. That level is 22.1% below its 52-week peak of 1295.99, set on June 23.


In stock parlance, a decline is officially labeled a bear market when the price correction exceeds 20% from a 52-week or all-time high.

The Russell 2000 is down 11.1% year to date. It slumped 5.7% in 2015.


The S&P 500 fell 2.5% on Wednesday, and the Dow industrials lost 2.2%. Big-cap techs were no less immune to bear bites Wednesday, as the Nasdaq composite lost 3.4%, easily its worst single-session decline in 2016 so far.


The slide in chip stocks has also weighed on the Nasdaq. On Wednesday, the Philadelphia semiconductor index, or the SOX, fell 3.1%. The Nasdaq is down 9.6% for the year, while the S&P 500 is off 7.5%.


In a bear market, the best place for individual investors is in cash. The urge to hunt for bargains may be primal, yet it should be avoided. Those who get into the market too early face the dangerous prospect of catching a falling knife.


**Jan. 4 Sell Signal**


Earlier, a signal to move to the sidelines arrived on Jan. 4. The indexes dropped hard, and the Nasdaq fell sharply below the low of the rally attempt that began Dec. 14.


Wednesday's sell-off squashed the market's latest rally attempt that began with Monday's reversal for a small gain on the S&P 500.


On Wednesday, losing stocks swamped winners by more than 7-to-1 on the NYSE and nearly 7-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


In Wednesday's IBD 50, WebMD ([WBMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBMD))Â was the sole winner, up 6% in five times average volume. The medical information website is expected to increase Q4 profit by 56% and 2016 earnings by 10%. More than half of the IBD 50 dropped 3% or more.


Concerns over the bulge in U.S. supplies of gasoline, diesel and heating oil Wednesday drove the decline in U.S. equities.


Market players have more to worry about than the fact that commodities are locked in a deflationary spiral. The impact on corporate profits will be pronounced.


S&P Capital IQ analysts note that aggregate S&P 500 earnings in the fourth quarter of last year are estimated at $28.70, down 6.1% vs. year-ago levels. It would mark the second quarterly decline in a row.


Among the 10 S&P sectors, energy and materials provide the biggest drag, with earnings seen falling 70.4% and 24.4%, respectively. Yet even after excluding energy, S&P profits are still forecast to dip 0.1%.


Only three sectors (consumer discretionary +7.5%, health care +5.6% and telecom services +17.9%) are seen boosting their earnings year over year.


The major indexes showed strength in October. Yet since then, the S&P 500 has clearly shown three distinct waves of selling (see the daily chart on Page B2), each of them producing a set of lower highs and lower lows.


Each of these sell-offs caused a spike in the put-call volume ratio above the critical 1.15 level. (See the graph right below the S&P 500's chart.) However, this psychological sentiment indicator has proved less valuable.


Indeed, the effectiveness of contrarian market indicators can change like the weather. So how will the bulls-vs.-bears ratio fare? On Wednesday, the weekly poll by Investors Intelligence showed the percentage of bullish newsletter editors plummeting to 28.6% while bears rose to 35.7%. (See the graphs on B11.)


Such a crossing of the two lines has proved bullish for stocks, as seen in both 2002 and in 2008. Yet, an extreme level of pessimism can persist before a new bull market can actually begin.


The way to deal with uncertainty is to watch the daily interplay between price and volume in the major indexes and confirm that true demand has returned. This occurs when the market jumps more than 1.25% in heavier volume than the day before, usually four days or more into an attempted rally.


This type of action, called a follow-through, gives the best indication that a new market uptrend is underway. And that is the silver lining of the market's current destruction. The deeper the drop, the more likely a strong new uptrend will be born. More than a few market observers have been waiting for such a moment ever since the stock market galloped off its early 2009 lows. Back then, the S&P 500 hit bottom at 666. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 ended at 1890.


IBD research shows that not all follow-through days work out. However, every major market bottom since 1900 featured a follow-through rally.

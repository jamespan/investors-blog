 U.S. stocks stepped ahead confidently Thursday, as the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 scored new highs.


The Nasdaq rose 0.8%, while the S&P 500 echoed the move. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average tailgated with a 0.6% gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 was the day's star, up 1.9%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and preliminary data showed it lower on the NYSE.

**Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) gapped up 6.5%. **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) surged 6%. **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) popped nearly 4%. **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) rose nearly 2%. **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) added 1%.


Most of the discount and variety stocks appeared to be reacting to earnings reports.


Despite the gains, some of the stores remain well off their highs. The exceptions are Ollie's Bargain Outlet and Five Below.


Ollie's has a Composite Rating of 94, the best among the group. Piper Jaffray on Thursday maintained an overweight rating and raised the price target from 37 to 48. Ollie's closed at 43.65 Thursday.


Five Below reported quarterly results after Thursday's close. Earnings for fiscal Q1 that ended in April topped views with 15 cents a share vs. 14 cents expected. Revenue was slightly higher than expected. The company raised guidance for the full year ending in January. Shares climbed 2% in extended trading.


Software security stocks also did well. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) gapped up 16% on quarterly results, but the stock is in a sloppy consolidation.


Soap and food were among the day's worst performers. Bulls are always happy to see defensive plays lag the leaders.


Leadership was broad Thursday. In the IBD 50, winners led losers by more than 4-to-1. In the Big Cap 20, which has outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, winners rose by a 9-to-1 ratio. Winners in the Dow outnumbered losers by about a 4-to-1 ratio. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by better than 9-to-2 and by 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq.


Economic News
-------------


Economic data played some strong cards Thursday. The ADP jobs report for May was almost 50% higher than expected. The ISM manufacturing gauge for May also topped views.


On the negative side, first-time jobless claims were about 4% more than expected. Construction spending for April also missed, falling by 1.4% vs. expectations for a gain of 0.5%.


On Friday before the open, the nonfarm payrolls report for May will be released. The Street's consensus estimate is for 180,000 jobs added. The range of estimates runs from 140,000 to 231,000. The jobless rate is expected to stay at 4.4%.


Interest Rate Outlook
---------------------


Strength in the economy is generally increasing the conviction that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates after the Fed meets June 13 and 14. CME Group's FedWatch Tool pegs the odds for a rate hike at 91.2%.


Higher interest rates are expected to help bank stocks, but many bank-stock groups have been sliding.


The money centers and superregionals are 10% off their highs. Regionals such as those in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast are down only 5%. The foreign banks are doing best, about 1% off their highs.

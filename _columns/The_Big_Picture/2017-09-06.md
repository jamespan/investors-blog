Four Keys That May Show The Market Bulls Will Stick Around
===========================================================

Stocks failed to react with much enthusiasm to a surprise deal between the White House and Democrats to avert a federal budget fiasco by month's end. But Wednesday's modest rebound in mixed volume helped keep the market uptrend intact.


The latest Beige Book report from the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, did not appear to shed much new light on what most market participants already know about the U.S. economy â€” that it is growing moderately, and even showing signs of mild acceleration.


"Consumer spending increased in most Districts, with gains reported for nonauto retail sales and tourism, but mixed results for vehicle sales," the Fed noted in its regular survey of economic and business activity across 12 districts of the U.S.


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials each gained between 0.2% and 0.3% on Wednesday, carving out some of Tuesday's losses. Yet a check of the price-and-volume action showed a few signs of caution among the buyers.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MP09061717-202x300.png)For starters, turnover did not rise much on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session (up less than 1%), even as Tuesday marked the first day back from the long holiday weekend. On the NYSE, volume dropped less than 4%.


It's not clear whether the extensive flooding damage in Houston has impacted the trading activity for financial institutions in that all-important metropolis of the South.


Wednesday's price action was quiet to the extent that the intraday high and low of both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were narrower in range than in Tuesday's sell-off. That's the chart's way of saying that some equity investors decided to stay on the sidelines amid concerns of escalating diplomatic tension over North Korea's nuclear bomb efforts, the emergence of Hurricane Irma, and low confidence in Congress' ability to enact new reforms to boost the economy.


Small caps showed even smaller gains. The Russell 2000, an index laggard this year, rose less than 0.2%.


If your growth-oriented stocks didn't see much of a boost on Wednesday, one reason is this: While as many as 18 of IBD's 197 industry groups outran the major indexes with gains of 1.5% or more, most of these groups came from the bottom half or even bottom quartile of the rankings. Oil drillers, ranked dead last at No. 197 for six-month relative price performance, was the day's best group, up more than 3%. Department store chains (No. 157), international oil and gas exploration (No. 162) and wholesale drugs and medical supplies (No. 192) all romped 2% higher or more.


In other words, you are simply going to have days in which the cellar dwellers of the market play catch-up.


Nonetheless, the market shows at least four signs that the uptrend, despite carrying an above-average load of distribution days (significant declines by a major index in higher turnover vs. the prior session), stands a good chance of stretching further.



One, leading stocks did not produce meaningful breakouts on Wednesday, and a few, including **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), are struggling a bit. But look at the current list of the IBD 50 and Big Cap 20 and you'll find few instances in which the IBD chart analysis is noting defensive sell signals getting triggered.


Important sell signals include a severe break of the 50-day moving average, terrible action by the true leaders in a specific industry, and immediate failures after a breakout from a late-stage base.


Two, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq continue to find support near or at the 50-day moving average. The 50-day moving average is a line that traces the average closing price of a stock or an index over the trailing 50 trading sessions. Not only is a rising 50-day line a good thing, indicating that the general trend is up, but so is the situation when major benchmarks are leading their 50-day lines on the way up, not lagging them.


Three, more stocks show positive ratings of accumulation. As seen in the latest issue of IBD Weekly on Page B7, 3,046 stocks in IBD's database hold either an A or B for Accumulation/Distribution, vs. 1,817 having a D or E, which indicate massive selling by institutions. (Track these stats via the table within the S&P 500 chart on the "What's The Market Trend?" page in IBD Weekly and via the link to the general market indicators page at the end of this story.)


Four, market professionals still hold a healthy dose of pessimism. The latest sentiment survey by Investors Intelligence shows that just 49.5% of newsletter editors are bullish about equities, while 19.1% expect a bear market to enfold and the rest are betting on an intermediate correction (a 10% decline or more). Pessimism is good for stocks. Those who are pessimistic may eventually give in to the market's strength and become buyers.


The CBOE Volatility index, meanwhile, has rebounded from a historic low of 8.84 set in late July, and the NYSE short interest ratio (see in Page B6 in IBD Weekly) continues to climb. Short sellers who find they are wrong eventually must cover and buy back shares.

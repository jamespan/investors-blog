The stock market showed little oomph on Wednesday and a midday rebound soured a bit in late-hour trading. Yet the Nasdaq composite, thanks mainly to the [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/alphabet-google-stock-buy-tech-breakout/), was still able to break a three-day losing streak, and the major indexes continue to be in reasonable shape.




 The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% while the Nasdaq 100 finished 0.5% higher. In contrast, the S&P 500 struggled to hold thin gains, ending a hair lower amid a broad sell-off in the oil patch. U.S. near-term futures dropped almost 3% to $55.95 a barrel, posting one of the worst days in months. However, the rebound in crude oil from a June low near $42.74 is still largely intact.


Small caps tripped a bit, with the S&P SmallCap 600 down 0.5%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was indicated lower on the NYSE. Breadth was largely negative on both main exchanges. Despite the Nasdaq's advance, losing stocks beat winners by a nearly 3-2 margin.

Google operator **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), one of the FANG (or if you prefer, FAANG) megacap tech stars, highlighted some movement of institutional investors' cash back into the tech sector. And for Alphabet, it couldn't have arrived at a better time as shares showed whippy action above and below the [50-day moving average](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) on Tuesday.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), meanwhile, is having a bullish fourth quarter as shares rose more than 1% in heavy volume and respected the 50-day moving average.


Watch for the stock to continue work on what may end up as a new flat base with a new 86.30 buy point.


**Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)) and China's social media and video game titan **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) are just a few other leading techs that appear to be finding buyers at or near their respective 50-day lines.


Such action hardly would ever qualify as "news" among the major media outlets. That doesn't matter, though. Veteran IBD readers and market observers know that ultimately the strength of a market uptrend hinges a great deal on the strength of individual leading stocks.


Look inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and, for now, you really aren't exactly seeing fistfuls of growth stocks diving well below their 50-day or 10-week moving averages.



But what if they do? That might not necessarily mean the bull run is over. Some leading stocks have gained a lot of ground, and so a new base building phase wouldn't be out of the question.


With fewer quarterly results hitting the wires lately, investors are paying more attention to the state of a comprehensive tax reform package, the possibility of a federal government shutdown, and the likely moves of the Federal Reserve after its Dec. 12-13 meeting on interest rates.


One piece of news, as reported in a [Stock Market Today column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) earlier on Wednesday, was the surprise overwhelming majority vote within the U.S. Senate Banking committee to repeal some parts of the gigantic Dodd Frank regulatory legislation on Wall Street. Some smaller banks and brokerages will face less scrutiny and thus could see lower operating expenses in the future. Yet, financial stocks were mainly lower Wednesday.



The No. 1-ranked company in the IBD Big Cap 20 as of Wednesday afternoon trade? Broker **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)), which posted a nifty 24% rise in earnings per share on a 16% revenue boost in the third quarter.


Schwab, edging mildly lower Wednesday in below-average turnover to 50.54, is extended from a flat base buy point of 46.31.


Keep an eye for good breakout ideas via IBD's [new high list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/) as well. (You can also see the new highs list, arranged by the top sector contributors, by going to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.) Lately, bank and finance stocks have dominated the list. Some of these may still in buy range from a proper base, even after marking a 52-week or all-time high.



Retailing stocks should be watched closely too. Sectors Leaders member **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) are a few of the new leaders in this all-important sector.


After the close, Ollie's reported another strong quarter as earnings rose 29% in the October-ended fiscal third quarter, matching the increase seen in Q2, while sales grew 18% to $238.1 million. Net margin improved by 70 basis points to 6%. But Ollie's gave weak revenue guidance. Shares fell more than 3% in extended trading.


While the 29% EPS gain is a decline compared with increases in the 30% to 50% range during fiscal 2015 and 2016, the consistency of Ollie's growth is remarkable.


IBD has no fewer than 18 retail-oriented subgroups within its daily ranking of 197 industry groups and subgroups. Industry strength plays a big role in the success of a leading growth stock.


At least five retail industry groups — including home furnishings, discount and variety, apparel and shoes, and automobile — now rank within the top 40 in terms of six-month relative price performance. No wonder, given the strong job market, increasing consumer confidence, and other improving areas of the economy.

The first day of trading in August didn't go so well as another sharp drop in oil prices and a rough day for Apple weighed on sentiment. It could've been worse, though, thanks to a late-day rally. The Dow gave up 0.5%, much better than its intraday loss of 1.1%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 eased 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 0.6%.

  

The S&P 500 closed right at its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq ended just above the support level. The IBD 50 turned in a resilient performance again, falling just 0.1%. The index of leading growth stocks is trouncing the S&P 500 year-to-date, up close to 15%.

  

IBD 50 name **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) was one of the best gainers, rising 3%, on a strong day for airline stocks. A drop in oil prices seemed to help transportation stocks. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark crude oil lost $1.95, or 4.1%, to $45.17 a barrel.

  

Volume fell on both main exchanges. The Nasdaq's June 26 distribution day fell off the count due to time, shrinking the count to two. Seven remain on the S&P 500, though.

  

Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.

  

The market's defensive nature was on full display again as food, beverage and tobacco stocks outperformed.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) slumped more than 2% as institutional selling in the stock continued. It pierced its 200-day moving average, an area where it had found support for more than a year.

  

Early in the session, investors took a sell-off in Greece stocks in stride. After a five-week shutdown, Greece's benchmark ASE index dropped 16% after falling as much as 23%.

  

On the home front, a weaker-than-expected reading for the July ISM Manufacturing index didn't help matters, but it wasn't a big miss, coming in at 52.7 vs. expectations of 53.7. The June reading was 53.5.

  

The bears have been pounding the deteriorating breadth drum for a while, but the bulls can still point toward the overall solid action in leading growth stocks.

  

Strong price performance from the likes of **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), among others, can't be ignored. They've been pillars of strength. Meanwhile, damage to leading stocks has been limited at best. Still, the market continues to send mixed signals, resulting in a tough environment for a growth porfolio to make headway. Without an edge, a defensive posture still makes sense.

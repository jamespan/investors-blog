The stock market turned in another strong performance Tuesday, ending mixed and mostly unchanged after two straight bullish sessions.




Indexes made a bullish close Monday. Sellers hit the stock market just after 2 p.m. ET. But buyers overpowered sellers doing the final hour of trading, lifting indexes near session highs.


Tuesday's session started off with several NYSE-listed stocks halted due to [pricing issues](https://www.investors.com/news/nyse-trading-resumes-after-technical-issue-interrupts-early-trade/). Several Dow Jones stocks were affected, including **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). Most of the impacted stocks resumed trading by 9:45 a.m. ET.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a modest gain, up 0.3%. An earnings sell-off for **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) was offset by strong Q4 results from **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), which jumped 3.7% and regained the 50-day moving average. Travelers dived below its 50-day line last week, hurt by news from fellow insurer **Allstate** ([ALL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALL)), which said that catastrophe losses would be higher than expected in Q4 due to Winter Storm Elliott.

**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) also outperformed in the Dow Jones, up 1.9%. But after a bounce off the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), CAT has quickly become extended from a 239.95 entry.


The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.3% in lower volume and the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) eased 0.2%. Declining stocks had a slight edge over advancers.


QQQ was up 0.7% in extended trading, helped by a 4% gain for **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which reported [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/msft-stock-microsoft-cloud-services-fuel-earnings-beat/).


After surging above its 50-day moving average Monday in strong volume, Nasdaq 100 firm **Paccar** ([PCAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCAR)) jumped out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 107.28 buy point. The catalyst was a strong earnings report from the engine and truck maker that showed earnings per share up 77% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased 22% to $8.13 billion.


But Paccar is one of many recent examples where a stock technically rises into a buy zone, but it's made a big run already. Paccar closed just above the entry, but it's up 13% over the past three sessions.


India-based **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) is another example. After five straight gains in tepid volume, HDB is still in buy range from a 70.87 entry. But new buyers might be better served to wait for a pullback.


**Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) also outperformed in the Nasdaq 100 as it tests support at the 10-week moving average. The test comes after a heavy-volume breakout during the week ended Nov. 18.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) slipped 0.2% and remains in a good technical setup above all its key moving averages. Watch for resistance around 190, though.


What To Do Now
--------------


In the current stock market environment, exposure between 40% and 60% seems about right. The S&P 500 still has overhead supply issues to work through as the index sits below its recent high of 4100.


The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, looks poised to make a run at its 200-day moving average (currently around 11,540). But it's still a potential resistance level to watch.

A slew of high-profile technology earnings reports this week and next will have a big say in whether or not the Nasdaq can retake its 200-day line.


It's also a busy week of [economic data](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), culminating with the release of the December Personal Income and Spending report Friday. Wall Street will be watching for more signs of cooling inflation in that report. As part of the report, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index is expected to come in at 5% down from 5.5% a year ago. Look for core PCE to be up 4.4%, down slightly from 4.7%.


After a strong move above the 4000 level Monday, the S&P 500 gave back less than 0.1% in lower volume.


Out of the S&P 500's 11 sectors, health care and energy lagged. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $80.13 a barrel, down 1.8%.


Homebuilders Strong
-------------------


Several building-related industry groups outperformed, including the homebuilder group, which rose 0.5%. Sentiment was positive in the group after **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) reported earnings and revenue that blew away estimates. Revenue increased 3% to $7.26 billion, well ahead of the consensus estimate of $6.4 billion.



The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) is a relatively new holding for [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com). It joined the Leaders list Friday when the ETF was bouncing off its 21-day lineÂ in strong volume.


Also in the building sector, the heavy construction group is home to three strong performers near proper entry points: **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)), **Aecom** ([ACM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACM)) and Leaderboard stock **Fluor** ([FLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLR)).


In the solar space, **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) has proven itself one of the big leaders in the group. A 173.78 buy point is still in play after FSLR halted a seven-session win streak last week.


In the retail sector, **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), the parent company of T.J. Max, Marshalls and HomeGoods chains, bounced nicely off its 50-day moving average. It's near an 81.27 buy point after a low-volume breakout on Jan. 6, the same day the Nasdaq composite confirmed a new uptrend with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/).

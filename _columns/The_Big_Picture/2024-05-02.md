  Nasdaq Snaps Back From Fed Volatility As Apple Earnings Beat; Jobs Report Next

The stock market rallied Thursday as investors processed commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Next up, Wall Street braced for Friday's pivotal April jobs report from the Labor Department.




Meanwhile, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) advanced in extended trading after its [better-than-expected earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-fiscal-q2-2024-earnings/), sending futures higher. The company also announced a $110 billion stock buyback. Shares rallied more than 6% in after-hours trading.


Tomorrow, Wall Street will shift its attention to April's jobs report, due early in the day. The U.S. economy is expected to add 243,000 jobs in April, down from March's 303,000 increase, according to Econoday estimates. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.8%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both climbed 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 moved up 1.8%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session, removing some of the bullishness from the stock market rally. Lower volume prevented a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) from occurring, too.

What To Do In Today's Stock Market
----------------------------------


Despite Thursday's positive action, IBD's recommended exposure level sits at 20%-40% with the major stock indexes still sitting below their 50-day benchmarks.


During [Thursday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), the IBD team commented that a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), combined with a heavy volume move above the 50-day line, is still needed to boost confidence in the stock market.


But it will likely take a few days before we can realistically jump over these hurdles. In the meantime, the team advocates keeping your watchlists tight and ready for action.


In particular, look for stocks with strong relative strength lines. Those are holding up better than the overall market and could become leaders in the next uptrend.


Although market direction is uncertain still, some quality stocks are breaking out or setting up for a potential advance.


In [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list Thursday, **Howmet Aerospace** ([HWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HWM)) staged a breakaway gap past a flat base.


**Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) is rapidly approaching a 108.04 flat-base entry after Wednesday's retake of the 50-day line.

Market Leaders: NXP, Qualcomm
-----------------------------



**NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)), along with **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and **Carrier Global** ([CARR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARR)), are among stocks to watch.


NXP regained its 251.96 double-bottom [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) Thursday with a 1.9% gain, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). Bullishly, its RS line made a new high on the breakout day, a sign of big stock market outperformance.


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Eli Lilly is also tracing a double bottom, but shares are below their 793.67 buy point following two straight days of losses.


[Qualcomm surged](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qualcomm-stock-qcom-q2-2024-earnings/) almost 10% Thursday after the company's earnings report. Shares closed in buy range above a 177.59 flat-base entry.


And Carrier Global closed above a 60.87 buy point, despite a three-day losing streak that saw the stock give up its breakout gains.

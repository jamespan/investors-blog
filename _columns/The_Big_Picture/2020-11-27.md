Nasdaq Advances To Record Highs; Hot IPO Stocks Corsair Gaming, Palantir Technologies Offer Key Lesson In Selling
==================================================================================================================

The major stock indexes ended Friday with mixed gains, closing the week on a positive note. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the stock market higher, hitting a record high, as tech giant Tesla raced to more all-time highs Friday. Hot IPO stocks Corsair Gaming and Palantir Technologies illustrated the importance of taking profits on the way up.




The Nasdaq outperformed with a 0.9% advance, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average followed up with a 0.1% gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 0.6%.


Leading growth stocks handily beat the major stock indexes, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) trading up 1.5% on Friday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) advanced 11% to break out above a 154.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a short cup base.

Nasdaq Hits Record High
-----------------------


On Friday, the Nasdaq set record highs for a second straight day, decisively clearing the composite's Nov. 9 high at 12,108.07. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 limped to a new high, while the Dow Jones industrials are within striking distance of all-time highs.


With the Nasdaq back at record highs, investors should have more confidence in the current stock market rally. However, many stock leaders are [getting sharply extended from their correct buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/).


For example, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is more than 25% above a 466 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). Meanwhile, hot IPO stocks **Corsair Gaming** ([CRSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSR)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) more than doubled from their correct buy points.

Hot IPO Stocks: Corsair Gaming, Palantir Technologies
-----------------------------------------------------


Two of the stock market's big winners, Corsair Gaming and Palantir Technologies, offer lessons on the importance of [taking profits on the way up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) during big upside moves.


Corsair Gaming dived more than 9% Friday, adding to Wednesday's 16.5% plunge and is already more than 20% off its all-time high. On Nov, 24, shares skyrocketed as much as 127% past a 22.60 buy point in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).


[Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/corsair-stock-ipo-flashing-sell-signals/) advised taking at least some profits amid the stock's steep climb. Traders should have considered selling a third to half of their position in Corsair stock. Shares are in pullback mode, but it isn't a buyable pullback.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Palantir Technologies surged as much as 15.3% to 33.50 before closing with a steep loss. This type of downside reversal in huge turnover can indicate a short-term top. It would be prudent to lock in some gains.


According to IBD Leaderboard commentary, "Palantir Technologies is extended as it continues to rocket to new highs. It was cut to a quarter position Tuesday to lock in some profit."

Snowflake: Holding Through Earnings
-----------------------------------


Hot IPO stock **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) surged more than 8% Friday, pushing the stock out of the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) above a 301.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) following Wednesday's breakout, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


The company will report earnings on Dec. 2 after the stock market close. When deciding to hold a stock through earnings, a good rule of thumb is to have at least a 5% profit cushion. This profit cushion can help — but not completely — protect against a sharp sell-off in case of disappointing earnings results.


Snowflake was featured in this week's [Investing With IBD podcast](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/snowflake-stock-aso-stock-leads-hot-ipo-stocks-to-watch/).

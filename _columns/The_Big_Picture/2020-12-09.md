Stock Market Takes A Hit As Stimulus Talks Drag On; DoorDash Soars In Debut
============================================================================

After 10 straight gains for the Nasdaq 100, sellers came into the stock market Wednesday and hit technology stocks hard. Solar, software and semiconductor stocks took the most heat.




Leading chip-equipment stocks like **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) fell sharply, but the weakness only amounted to tests of the 10-day moving average for each stock.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), a proxy for leading growth stocks, slumped 2.4%. Sixteen components fell 3% or more, but **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) was a bright spot, up nearly 2%. Shares outperformed after UBS gave a buy rating and a 94 price target. Trex is near the top of a nine-week consolidation.


Stocks drifted lower but the selling never got intense in the morning, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans and Democrats are "still looking for a way forward" on another coronavirus stimulus package.

The comment came after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin proposed a new $916 billion stimulus package to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which included a one-time $600 direct payment to most Americans but eliminated a $300 per week unemployment benefit. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected it.


The selling pace picked up in afternoon trading.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite slumped 1.9% and closed below its 10-day moving average. The Nasdaq has been finding support at the 10-day line since the its [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) on Nov. 5. The S&P 500 gave back 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.35%. The Dow's performance was impressive considering that technology components like **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) ended with losses of 2% to 3%.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Tuesday's levels, giving the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/).


The distribution-day count remains mild for both indexes. And despite sharp declines for many leading growth stocks Wednesday, sell signals were few and far between. Recent IPO **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) slumped nearly 7%, but it's still testing support at its 10-day line.


Small caps led the way in the morning, but a 1% gain for the Russell 2000 turned into a 0.8% loss by the close. **Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)) was a nice gainer in the index, up 19.5%. It's a smaller, more speculative name, but Lovesac gapped out of a cup base after the maker of foam-filled furniture reported an unexpected profit and 43% jump in revenue.


**Owens & Minor** ([OMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OMI)) also broke out in the Russell 2000. Shares jumped nearly 14% to 28.58. It's still in the 5% buy zone after topping a buy point at 27.85.


Hot IPO Market
--------------


In [IPO news](https://www.investors.com/iponews), **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) soared in its debut after pricing Tuesday night at 102. The stock opened at 182 and closed at 189.51, up 86%. DoorDash is still losing money but shows triple-digit sales growth in recent quarters.

Another IPO made a big splash. **C3.ai** ([AI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AI)) more than doubled on its first day of trading. The company priced last night at 42 and closed at 92.49, up 120%.


In related news, **Airbnb** (which will trade under the ABNB symbol) on Monday raised its proposed range to 56-60 from 44-50. It's expected to price tonight and start trading on Thursday.


The performance of DoorDash and C3.ai support the argument that market conditions are getting a bit frothy. Amid excessive bullishness and big gains in less-proven, small-cap names, it's OK to consider taking partial or full profits in some of your big winners.


Sentiment Stays Bullish
-----------------------


Meanwhile, the latest Investors Intelligence survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a small drop in bullish sentiment, but bullishness is still at extreme levels. The bulls fell to 64.4% from 64.7% the prior week and 64.6% the week before that. The bulls were near 60% in January before a market pullback. Just recently, the bulls were at 61.5% in early September just ahead of a market decline.

The survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) has been aggressive with new adds recently, with seven stocks joining the Leaders list since the start of the month.


**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) moved from the watch list to the Leaders list Wednesday as it forms a cup-with-handle base with a 53.82 buy point. Shares reversed nicely higher Tuesday, but the stock got pulled down with the broad market Wednesday. Its chart is still intact as it holds above the 50-day moving average.



**Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) also joined the Leaders list Wednesday when it broke out over a trend line. But the stock closed near its low after popping 5.4%. Its chart is still intact as well.


Other top performers outside of Leaderboard could be ready to take a breather.


Those with a big gain in **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) might have decided to trim their holdings Wednesday when the stock gapped up after getting very extended in price. Meanwhile, **Unity Software**'s ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) downside reversal and outside day raises the likelihood it's ready to pause and consolidate gains for a bit. Those with a profit here might consider trimming their position as well.


But plenty of recent breakouts in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) continue to work well, including **Crispr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)), **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)), **Xpel** ([XPEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEL)) and **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)). There are plenty more, too.


It still makes sense to monitor compelling setups like **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **EXP World Holdings** ([EXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPI)), but a defensive posture is best for now.

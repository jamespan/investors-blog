The Nasdaq composite led a rousing rally for the bulls, gaining 1.7% on Tuesday and finishing near session highs.




The premier index for growth stocks also snapped a four-day losing streak — the first of its kind since the market bottomed on March 23 and notched a pair of [follow-throughs on April 2](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) (by the S&P 500) and [April 6](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-update-tom-pettys-wont-back-down-ftd/) (by the Nasdaq).


The Nasdaq is now knocking on the door of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), which ended the session near 11,010.


Volatility tanked, at least among options traders. The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or the VIX, sank 4.1% to 26.65.


Compared with the Nasdaq's advance and a 1.9% rebound by the Nasdaq 100, the S&P 500's nearly 1.1% rally looks tame. But that outperformed gains of 0.8% by the Russell 2000 and the Dow Jones transportation average, and 0.7% gains by the Dow utilities and the S&P Midcap 400.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF gained 1.1%, eating more into recent heavy losses.


Volume fell on both exchanges.

![MP092220](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP092220.jpg)Veteran IBD readers and practitioners of chart analysis know that one rosy day alone in the stock market does not mean selling pressure has completely lifted.


[A follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) helps determine if the stock market, after a terrible spill, is ready to rumble higher. And it comes a minimum four days into a new rally attempt. Similarly, it's going to take more evidence that institutional-class money managers are serious about putting more capital to work during a month that's famous for sharp declines and higher volatility.


For this reason, the current stock market outlook remains at "uptrend under pressure."


Yet for now, tech stocks led Tuesday's show amid a global economy that is still threatened by the greatest health crisis in more than a century.


Market internals showed slight improvement.


Slightly Better Breadth
-----------------------


While winners on the Nasdaq beat losers by merely eight issues on Tuesday, gainers led by a 4-3 margin on the NYSE. Meanwhile, stocks hitting new 52-week or all-time highs maintained a muted tone. Early estimates showed a total of fewer than 100 stocks doing just that. No surprise, however. The Nasdaq has fallen 13% from its 12,074 peak, the S&P 500 around 10% from its 3588 summit.


Don't forget that in the realm of true growth stocks, the leaders tend to fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the correction seen in the general market itself. So, September has fast become a month of base building. Others, including a few named in the Market Pulse table, are trying to resist the formation of full-blown bases and are seeking strong buying support at their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Palomar** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)) and **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) — Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) — offer a few examples. AMD got the showcase in Tuesday's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-amd-sets-up-new-buy-point-takes-on-intel-nvidia/) feature. In the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) have held up even better. A few of these names are wrestling with their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Beyond Nasdaq: Fanning Out Beyond Tech?
---------------------------------------


Why did the S&P 500 do pretty well on Tuesday? Building, telecom, solar, semiconductor, retail apparel and casino shares enjoyed above-average institutional demand, at least for a day. These groups and fistfuls of others rose 2% or more. (Please see the final daily percentage changes and six-month relative performance rankings of all 197 industry groups tracked by IBD at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Robust housing data on Tuesday likely helped the market's cause.


For August, U.S. existing home sales of 6 million at an annualized rate beat the [Econoday forecast of 5.965 million](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Sales also jumped 10.5% vs. year-ago levels, 2.4% vs. July. The Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing index also blasted economists' projections, increasing to 21 in September vs. 18 in August and the consensus view of 12.

Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research (NDR), suggests investors avoid looking at the market leadership in terms of the typical lenses of growth vs. value. One reason? Typical characteristics of a cyclical bull market tend to show financial stocks leading the way. They haven't.


Another reason? The stock market of the 2010s and 2020s is acting quite differently from its time in the 1950s through 1970s, when manufacturing stocks had a much bigger presence on Wall Street. Clissold notes that back then, "value investing" made a ton of sense. Economic cycles from peak to trough tended to be more frequent. So a cheap manufacturing stock with a "low" valuation often rebounded faster.


Today, though, the ever-growing digital side of the economy, the domination of service industries, and a huge level of debt at the national and consumer levels have helped lead to long-term outperformance by the internet and tech areas of the stock market. Plus, due to these elements, future recessions will be deeper and harder to dig out of, Clissold argues.


This helps explain why certain technology firms make up so much of the market value of the S&P 500.


Tech Titans
-----------


Eight names, including **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and new Dow Jones Industrial Average member **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), make up 26% of the total market value of the S&P 500 and 20% of total earnings, according to NDR research.


"We are still in a secular bull market until proven otherwise," Clissold told IBD. "This is driven by the Federal Reserve, and this will change when it is discredited, or changes its stance (on inflation)."


If and when inflation rates go well beyond what is targeted by both the central U.S. bank and institutional investors, they tend to hurt equities. Price-to-earnings multiples contract, Clissold notes, and that can whack stock prices.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond has held steady in recent days, trading in a relatively tight band of 0.63% to 0.72% in September so far. On Tuesday, the yield held steady at 0.68%.

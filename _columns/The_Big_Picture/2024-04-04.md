  Stocks Reverse Lower, Break Important Chart Level; Jobs Report Next

The major stock indexes reversed sharply lower Thursday and broke a long level of support. Up next, Wall Street will shift its attention to the March jobs report.




The major stock indexes gave up solid gains in an afternoon tumble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied as much 0.8% before ending with a 1.4% slide.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, up 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively, in midday trading, finished with losses of 1.2% and 1.4%. It was the worst reversal for both indexes since July 27, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 1.1%, also in a bearish reversal.


There didn't appear to be a specific catalyst for the reversal of fortunes. But comments from two Federal Reserve officials certainly didn't help.


Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said he expects two rate cuts this year, but [it's possible there will be none](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-kashkari-says-he-expects-two-rate-cuts-this-year-but-its-possible-there-will-be-none-b8365841?mod=home-page). Meanwhile, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said [the Fed should take its time](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/barkin-says-fed-would-be-smart-to-take-its-time-to-cut-rates-due-to-persistent-inflation-ff2d96ef?mod=home-page) on rate cuts due to persistent inflation.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session. That, combined with the poor price action, added [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) to both indexes. The Nasdaq continues to hold eight days of institutional selling because its Feb. 28 distribution day fell off the count due to time. The S&P 500 now has seven.

Dow Jones components **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) were among the biggest losers, falling 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively. American Express shares remain above their 50-day line, while Salesforce breached that level Thursday.


Among Magnificent Seven stocks, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was the biggest winner, with a 1.6% advance. Meanwhile, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) skidded 3.4%, making its lowest close since March 11.


And top growth stocks declined, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund sold off 1.8%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) rallied 1.4%, just shy of retaking a 45.62 buy point following last week's weakness.


What To Do In Today's Stock Market
----------------------------------


During Thursday's action, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes broke below their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), a shorter-term support level that had served as a floor for both indexes multiple times this year. The Dow also lost support at the 21-day line and closed below the 50-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 2.


With bearish signs adding up, IBD downgraded its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure" and reduced its recommended exposure level to 40%-60%.


To help reduce your exposure to stocks, sell your losers and take some profits in the winners. Be sure to follow sell rules, including selling any stock that drops 7% or more from your purchase price.


During [Thursday's IBD Live Show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), the IBD Team discussed how the sideways action in the market makes for a challenging environment. Rangebound markets can lure investors in and stop you out, so patience is key here. However, pauses can be constructive, and if the pause continues, investors may see more bases form, leading to new opportunities.


In [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list Thursday, **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) [jumped past](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hubspot-stock-rises-on-report-google-eyeing-bid-for-company/) a 660 buy point, but ended below it.


Keep track of emerging bases with the [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Near Pivot" list. Currently, it shows only a handful of stocks. For example, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is seeing stout resistance at its 50-day line. Shares are building a flat base with a 815.32 entry.


In the immediate future for the stock market, the Labor Department's March jobs report is due out Friday ahead of the stock market open.


Wall Street expects the U.S. economy to add 200,000 jobs in March, down from February's 275,000 new jobs, per Econoday. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.9%.


Market Leaders And Magnificent Seven
------------------------------------


[Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), along with **Dell Technologies** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)), attempted to break out past new buy points this week, while **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) is putting the finishing touches on a new base.

Google parent Alphabet is struggling after rising past a 153.78 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares fell 2.8% Thursday.


Meta shares briefly topped a 515.05 entry in a short consolidation. But the stock gave up its early gains, closing below the buy trigger.


Dell Technologies hit a 131.06 entry in a short consolidation, but ended below that level as the stock dropped 1.1%.


Finally, Uber shares are forming a flat base that would present a buying opportunity at 82.14. With the stock at the 50-day line, a decisive bounce would also place Uber stock in a new buy area.

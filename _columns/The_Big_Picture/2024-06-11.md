**Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) breakout in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a sight to behold Tuesday, but the blue-chip index and S&P 500 struggled to make headway on the stock market as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway.




The Dow Jones industrials fell nearly 1.1% early but pared the loss to 0.3% by the close. Apple surged more than 7% in strong volume, one day after it introduced [Apple Intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-unswayed-by-ai-news-at-wwdc-2024/) at the start of its annual Worldwide Developers conference. Apple fell 1.9% in higher volume Monday, but the stock broke out with conviction Tuesday from a 26-week consolidation.


But Apple's strength was offset by weakness in financial stocks in the Dow Jones like **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)). Out of the three, Goldman Sachs is the strongest as it holds above its 50-day moving average. AmEx fell sharply below its 50-day line, while JPMorgan closed just below the support level.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite outperformed with a gain of nearly 0.9% and climbed to a record high. But volume fell from Monday, and breadth was suspect again, with decliners having a slight edge over advancers.


Â 


Nasdaq 100 futures were unchanged in after-hours trading despite a strong gain for **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), which announced cloud deals with Google and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT))-backed OpenAI. Oracle shares were up 10% in extended trading. Results from **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) are due Wednesday after the close.


The S&P 500 edged 0.3% higher to a fresh high, also in lower volume. Losers beat winners on the NYSE by nearly 2-to-1. The Russell 2000 small-cap index pared an intraday loss of nearly 1.3% to 0.4%.


The [latest policy statement from the Fed](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-june-rate-cut-projections-cpi-inflation-sp-500/) will be out Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. But the stock market will have a key piece of data to digest before that when the May Consumer Price Index is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. On a year-over-year basis, core prices are expected to be up 3.5%, down slightly from 3.5% in April.


On the heels of Friday's strong jobs report, traders are still debating the timing of the first Fed rate cut. At one point Tuesday, there was a 50-50 chance that the first rate cut will come at the September meeting, with the chances for a cut at the November meeting at 66%.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


With the stock market on a confirmed uptrend, an invested percentage of 80%-100% still makes sense. While it's getting harder to find actionable setups due to a large number of extended stocks, some opportunities are still out there.

As always, keep track of your leaders and laggards, and don't be shy about cutting your weakest performers and funneling money into your winners. If some of your strongest performers are extended, just wait for better entry points before adding shares.


Inside the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) was a top gainer, up more than 4%. The stock closed near the top of a long consolidation that started in late December.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) stayed in recovery mode after Monday's upside reversal. It's only a quarter position in Leaderboard at this point. But a position increase could be in store as ELF eyes a cup-with-handle buy point of 202.58.


Mining, steel, financial and gold stocks lagged on the stock market Tuesday. Uranium miner **Cameco** ([CCJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCJ)) dived 5% and is testing its 50-day line. Gold stocks like **Agnico-Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)), **Newmont** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) and **Wheaton Precious Metals** ([WPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WPM)) closed with losses of around 1%-1.5% and are trading near their 50-day lines.


Shipping stocks also lagged, with the group down about 2%. Hopes rose for an Israel-Hamas cease-fire, which would [make it easier for shipping to return to Red Sea](https://www.wsj.com/articles/container-shippers-stock-prices-fall-on-possible-easing-of-red-sea-hostilities-9681e188?mod=logistics_news_article_pos1) routes and reduce shippers' rates.


But top performers in the group like **Global Ship Lease** ([GSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSL)) and **Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)) held up well as both stocks trade near their 21-day exponential moving averages.

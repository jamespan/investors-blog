Could three be the magic number for both the Federal Reserve and the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)?




The Fed indicated it's still planning on three interest rate cuts between now and the end of 2024. Judging by Wednesday's buoyant response to the conclusion of the Fed's two-day meeting, the stock market rewarded bullish investors for maintaining a solid posture on the economy and risk assets.


Not too long ago, the majority of bond traders surveyed by the CME believed that the powerful U.S. central bank looked poised to trim short-term interest rates at least five times, by a quarter of one percentage point at a time. But in recent weeks, that bet got thrown out the window.


As of Wednesday's close, the CME FedWatch survey settled on a 76.6% probability that the Fed will cut the fed funds rate by a minimum 25 basis points at the upcoming June 12 meeting. Currently, the Fed is holding this rate within a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in more than two decades. Just a day earlier, the chances of this happening stood at just 59.1%. However, keep in mind that a month ago this figure stood near 78%.


Can The Fed Achieve Both Growth And Tame Inflation?
---------------------------------------------------


"The Fed really really wants its soft-landing ending," Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, told IBD via email. "Stronger growth, lower unemployment, higher inflation, and yet still no change to the median dot (graph). (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell has perhaps shown his cards. He needs a good reason not to cut rates, rather than a reason to cut rates."


By the median dot, Shah refers to the range of estimates by Fed interest-rate policy committee members on U.S. GDP growth, the unemployment rate, the price consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation index and, of course, the fed funds rate.


Perhaps the big shocker: Based on the median estimates, the central bank has now projected a higher core PCE inflation rate for 2024 at 2.6%, up from the December forecast of 2.4%, while keeping its December thinking of making three rate cuts sometime this year the same. Did the statement, as well as Powell's comments during a news conference, hint that inflation does not necessarily need to hit 2% on the low end before monetary easing commences?


"How serious is the Fed about its 2% target? This Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) suggests that the Fed is willing to risk cutting rates before inflation is close to target and while GDP growth is above-trend. History teaches us this is a risky path," Shah added.


The SEP also showed headline PCE inflation steady vs. the December projections at 2.4%. But the Fed also boosted its economic growth forecast in 2024 to 2.1% from 1.4%, and the unemployment rate hitting 4.0%, not 4.1%. So, the stock market may be rising in anticipation of a decent economy and moderate inflation, the so-called "Goldilocks scenario."


The long-dated U.S. government bond market traded relatively quietly. Still, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond edged down 2 basis points to 4.27%. As noted in [Monday's The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-evenly-among-large-caps-but-small-caps-dip-could-this-sector-break-out-amid-fed-news/), the yield made its highest close since late November.


Growth Stocks Outperform
------------------------


Further, and perhaps even more importantly, [leading stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) demonstrated outperformance across several branches of the stock market. It truly isn't just about tech in 2024.


And so while large caps outperformed their small-cap siblings on Monday, the smaller companies turned the tables by Wednesday. A 1.9% gain by the Russell 2000 basically trampled advances of 0.9% by the S&P 500 and nearly 1.3% by the Nasdaq composite.


Within the small-cap realm, growth did a little better than value.



Consider the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) exchange traded fund. Its 1.1% gain nipped a 0.9% rise by iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)). Yet both ETFs have been looking strong since recent tests of the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) for the former and the [50-day simple moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/)Â for the latter.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 trimmed two of its six distribution days from the current count, as noted each day in Market Pulse.


Breadth also proved bullish in the stock market. On the Nasdaq, advancers outstripped decliners by a nearly 3-1 margin. Ditto for stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. See the exact numbers for both exchanges in the General Market Indicators PDF page, found as a link at the bottom of the Big Picture column.


Stock Market: How Distribution Days Work
----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP032024-.jpg)By rising more than 5% beyond the closing prices of the Feb. 13 and Feb. 20 [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), the S&P was able to trim its overall count of that statistic. The Nasdaq, which traded as high as 16,377 intraday on Wednesday, would need to rise to as high as 16,736.57 to pick off its March 5 distribution day.


Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 need to rise 5% beyond a distribution day's close on an intraday basis, not a closing-price basis, in order to zap it from the count. Otherwise, after 25 trading sessions have passed, a distribution day also falls off the count on time.


You don't get distribution, a fancy term for brutal professional selling, in the stock market unless a key index falls at least 0.2% and volume on the corresponding exchange rises vs. the prior session. Turnover doesn't have to be particularly heavy, just higher than the day before. For the S&P 500, Investor's Business Daily simply uses the NYSE.


In fact, Wednesday's move struck a bullish tone in this additional way: Volume actually grew on both main exchanges, indicating accumulation by the big players in the investment world.


How The IBD 50 Fared
--------------------


[Looking at the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), top growth stocks in the stock market appeared to mirror the eagerness among institutions to scoop shares.


At least seven of the components saw volume increase at least 20% above their average turnover over the past 50 sessions. And all but one gained significant ground.


These top names came from not just technology, but also the consumer, insurance and medical areas of the stock market.


**Royal Caribbean Cruises** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)), an IBD 50 member, broke out again.


The stock rose 4.7% to 135.53. It also crossed a prior buy point of 130.97 established when Royal Caribbean formed a narrow, faulty flat base. Why was it faulty? It formed over a period of fewer than 25 sessions on a daily chart. More basing took place. So the action from Dec. 29 through last week could also be viewed as one entire base.



The 5% buy zone for the consumer spending and travel play goes up to 137.52.

Three Rate Cuts Look More Likely
--------------------------------


Other IBD 50 stocks that ruled the roost on Wednesday included **Natera** ([NTRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRA)), up nearly 2% in quadruple average trade; **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)) and **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)), which both got some air time on [Wednesday's "IBD Live" episode](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/); and **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)), which has returned to the [Leaderboard model portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). All four rallied in heavy volume, as did bitcoin play **CleanSpark** ([CLSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLSK)).


Nobody was at all surprised that the U.S. central bank decided to sit on its hands on Wednesday. But Wall Street wanted to see whether the Federal Reserve governors still think it's possible for the cost of money to come down later in the year.


Stock market investors more or less got what they wanted as the Fed predicted three cuts this year.


In December, governors on the Federal Open Market Committee's interest rate policy board had individually set their own predictions for economic growth, inflation and the appropriate interest rate for overnight loans from the Fed to big Wall Street firms. The median projection stood at 4.6%, or basically the midpoint of a range of 4.5% to 4.75% on the fed funds rate.


In the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) posted on Wednesday, that projection did not change.


The Future Of Inflation And Rates
---------------------------------


Here are a few more comments from stock market observers on the key Fed meeting:


* "Putting it all together, it suggests the Fed is still inclined to cut rates to a more neutral level, but it needs to see the data to back that up and we aren't there yet." â James Knightley, chief international economist, ING.
* "A concern that we had going into (the decision) was the recent higher-than-forecast CPI readings. Although inflation is above target, 12-month core PCE has been trending lower over the last 12 months." â Larry Tentarelli, president, Blue Chip Daily Trend Report.
* "Powell stuttered more than I would have expected when addressing the heart of the meeting's intrigue: the Fed's commitment to 2% inflation. Fixed income will continue to grapple between expectations for lower rates, which is good for bonds, against more tolerance for inflation, which is bad for bonds." â Christian Hoffman, portfolio manager, Thornburg Investment Management ($44 billion in client assets).
* "It's good to see the Fed understands it can cut rates while still being tough on inflation given that the real fed funds rate will still be considered very restrictive." â Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager, Sit Investment Associates.
* "The Fed's economic forecasts embrace the idea that recent economic strength is in part a reflection of strong labor force and productivity growth. This allows for faster economic growth without additional inflationary pressure." â Paul Mielczarski, head of global macro strategy, Brandywine Global.

  Stock Market Cuts Losses As Treasury Yields Continue To Fall; Why Amazon Is A Stock Market Leader

The stock market cut heavy losses Thursday, but the major stock indexes still ended moderately lower, as Treasury yields continued to slide. Despite a tough day for techs and retail, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) showed why it's a stock market leader.




The 10-year Treasury yield extended this week's loss to 10%, settling just under 1.29%. The benchmark yield closed at its lowest level since mid-February. Financials, which tend to suffer from falling yields, were one of the worst performing S&P sectors, down 2%. [Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-fed-minutes-in-stride-paypal-lululemon-give-buy-signals/) noted the stock market is now concerned about the precipitous decline in yields amid an economic recovery that may not be as strong as expected.


Dow transports slid 3.3%. Worries about the economic recovery and a [pushback from the White House against consolidation in rail and ocean shipping](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-target-railroads-ocean-shipping-in-executive-order-11625736601?mod=hp_lead_pos7) appeared to hit the sector.


The Nasdaq sold off as much as 2% before closing down 0.7%. The S&P 500 dropped 0.9%, while the Dow Jones industrials slid 0.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.9%. Leading growth stocks suffered heavy losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 2%. IBD 50 stock **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) plunged over 21% in huge turnover. Earlier this week, the stock triggered the [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/key-sell-signal-saved-stamps-com-stock-investors-from-posting-big-losses/) from a 35.25 buy point in a cup base.

Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 backed off after making record highs earlier in the week. Meanwhile, the Dow is again trying to find support at its 50-day moving average.


The stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend with the Nasdaq just one day off all-time highs. Institutional selling remains modest, although the S&P 500 added a new distribution day Thursday, upping its total to four. The Nasdaq still has two days of institutional selling after avoiding a distribution day Thursday due to lower volume.


The way indexes trimmed losses was encouraging also. Some leaders such as **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), **Sea Ltd.** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)) and **Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)) appear to be finding support at key levels.


Yet, the stock market saw selling on a scale it had not seen in weeks. Several IBD 50 stocks are down 7% to 10% or more this week.

Stock Analysis: Amazon
----------------------



FANG stock leader Amazon.com ended just out of buy range past a cup-with-handle's 3,524.96 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) following Tuesday's strong breakout, according to [IBD MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The buy zone tops out at 3,701.21. Shares reversed from early losses to rally 0.9% Thursday.


The company continues to exhibit [huge quarterly earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/great-stocks-have-key-element-in-earnings-a-in-can-slim/) with three consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth.


From a technical perspective, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) spiked to its highest level since early February, a sign of newfound strength. According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [AMZN stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) shows a solid 92 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).


Stocks To Watch: Roku, Shopify
------------------------------


IBD 50 stock Roku added a handle to a cup base, moving the buy point from 486.82 to 463.09. IBD Leaderboard identified a 397.79 buy point in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/), which Roku has topped.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Shopify is trying to break out past a 1,552.33 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) but faces difficulties. Shares tumbled nearly 4% Thursday following Wednesday's downside reversal. That it's had two days of weakness is worth monitoring, especially after a breakout attempt to new highs.

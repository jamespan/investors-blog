Stock Market Hits Pause On President Trump's China News Conference; Costco Headlines 4 Key Earnings Results
============================================================================================================

The stock market ended a volatile session with modest losses Thursday, as the major stock indexes ran into late-day selling after President Donald Trump announced there will be a news conference Friday on China policy. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied as much as 1.2% before turning lower to close down nearly 0.5%.




The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.6%. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 lagged with its 2.4% fall. But leading growth stocks sharply outperformed: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied 1.3% to snap a two-day losing streak. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq vs. Wednesday's session and appeared lower on the NYSE.


Stock Market Hits New Monthly Highs
-----------------------------------


All three major stock indexes hit monthly highs Thursday before reversing lower. The Nasdaq reached its highest level since Feb. 21 and is just 5% away from its previous all-time highs. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is still holding above its 3000 price level but remains about 11% off its all-time highs.

Despite Thursday's sharp reversal, volume was lighter than Wednesday, so no [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) was added. With still only one day of institutional selling on the Nasdaq — a stall day on Tuesday — the market uptrend remains in a bullish mindset. The S&P 500 has zero distributions days after strong gains in recent sessions.


For now, leading growth stocks are [holding their key support levels](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-stocks-and-indexes-rebound-in-new-positive-signs-for-market/) despite big sell-offs in recent sessions. For example, stock market leader **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) found much-needed support at its 50-day line on Wednesday. The strong show of support at a key level left the [IBD 50 stock in a buy zone](http://www.investors.com/research/netflix-stock-ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-pick-hits-a-buy-zone/).


Rising U.S.-China tensions remain a headwind for the current stock market rally. Early Thursday, China approved a controversial national security law for Hong Kong, setting the stage for President Trump's Friday news conference.


Meanwhile, Trump signed an executive order Thursday on online platforms. The order urges tightened oversight on social media companies, which currently police their own content without fear of lawsuits related to comments, videos and other content posted by users on their platforms.

Potential Breakout Stocks To Watch: Snap
----------------------------------------


Social media stock **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) is rapidly approaching an 18.56 buy point in a cup with handle, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Snap stock surged 7.35%, ending less than 2% away from the entry. Snap [was featured](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/dow-jones-stock-apple-alphabet-break-out-new-buy-points-stock-market-rally/) in this week's [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/) column.


Rivals **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) ended sharply lower Thursday on news of Trump's executive order. Facebook fell 1.6% in a whipsaw trading session, extending a losing streak to three sessions. Shares are holding about 4.7% above a 215.38 buy point in a cup with handle after a breakout on May 19.


Facebook is an [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard). According to Leaderboard commentary, "A gap-up in heavy volume in late April on Q1 results added a bullish tint to its new base. Notice how the RS line hit new highs ahead of the breakout."


[Twitter stock](https://www.investors.com/research/twitter-stock-buy-now/) sold off 4.5% Thursday. Shares fell further below their long-term 200-day line after retaking the level on Tuesday. The stock is more than 30% off its 52-week high after tumbling in the coronavirus stock market crash.

The S&P 500 climbed to a record high Monday as the stock market appeared determined to finish the year with a flurry.




Indexes rose for a fourth day in a row, as every major sector participated and more leading stocks broke out of bases or rose from support levels. S&P energy, technology and real estate sector ETFs climbed more than 2%.


The S&P 500 added 1.4% to 4791, topping its prior record high of 4743 set on Nov. 22.


The Nasdaq composite also rose 1.4% after confirming support around the 15,000 level last week. It now heads for a test of resistance at the 16,000 level.


There's also the risk of the market getting overextended. The S&P 500's 4.9% rally from Tuesday's close is the hottest four-day gain since November 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P is also about 3% above its 50-day average, which is getting above its current trend.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1% as technology components **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) led with gains of 2% or more. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) also rose 2% on a bullish day for oil and gas stocks overall.


Of the four, Microsoft is the most buy-ready, with shares rising from support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The software giant also is nearing the 349.77 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/).


Volume fell from Thursday's totals on the Nasdaq and NYSE. The week between Christmas and New Year's Day tends to be quiet, but some last-minute portfolio adjustments could boost trading as the week goes on.


Index gains may not matter much if top stocks aren't following along. And plenty of top stocks followed along Monday. The list of new breakouts expanded, and that included some stocks that had been profiled in IBD columns. Some came in light volume, however.


Multiple Breakouts Adorn Stock Market
-------------------------------------


**ArcBest** ([ARCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCB)) broke out of a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/) in heavy volume. The stock is in buy range from the 116.89 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) to 122.73. Volume was more than double the trucking company's average, and the relative strength line is at new highs — two bullish factors.



**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) bolted past the 159.10 buy point of another base-on-base formation. Volume was lackluster, but the relative strength line is near highs. The chip-equipment maker is one of the [top technology stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) right now.


**Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) rose above the 41.70 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base. Volume was below average. IBD's [options column discussed trade ideas for Freeport](https://www.investors.com/mstool/research/options/fcx-stock-stock-market-leader-how-to-set-up-a-broken-wing-butterfly-option-trade/) in November.


**AMN Healthcare** ([AMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMN)) broke out of an oddly shaped consolidation with a 124.72 buy point. But volume was weak and the health care staffing services firm closed just below the entry. Peer **Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)) jumped past a 29.55 buy point in active trading.


Advertising firm **Interpublic Group** ([IPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPG)) rose above the 37.30 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was 36% below average.


IBD 50 Tops Stock Market Performance
------------------------------------


The IBD 50 rose 2.2% Monday, and much of that was thanks to **Alpha & Omega  Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)). The chip designer shot up 11.3% to a new high.


Of the 50 stocks, 19 rose more than 3%, in a cross section of tech, health care, materials and building companies.


Besides breakouts from bases, watch for stocks in follow-on buy areas. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Onto Innovation** ([ONTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONTO)), **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) (today's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/building-stock-flashes-a-buy-signal/) pick) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are rising from support at the 10-week line.

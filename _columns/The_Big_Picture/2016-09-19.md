Early gains faded for the stock market Monday as Wall Street grew apprehensive ahead of the start of the two-day Fed meeting.


There's a chance the Fed could hike rates by a quarter-point Wednesday, but the market doesn't think so. Fed funds futures traders think it's more likely that rates will go up at the December meeting. The Bank of Japan is meeting at the same time as the Fed. There aren't many bonds left for the Bank of Japan to buy, but it could continue with its aggressive asset-buying program.


The Nasdaq composite was up 0.7% early but ended with a loss of 0.2%. The Dow and S&P 500 ended with minuscule losses. Volume fell sharply from Friday's levels, which were unusually high due to options and futures expirations.


![MP091916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MP091916-196x300.jpg)The Nasdaq came to within 6 points of its Sept. 7 high before reversing. The S&P 500 is still below its 50-day moving average, which means 2168 is a potential resistance level to watch.


The bright spot Monday was the action in small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000 outperformed, rising 0.6%. So did the **[IBD 50,](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/)** which rose 0.4%.


Overall, growth stocks turned in solid performances. At the close, 13 names in the IBD 50 rose 1% or more. **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)) once again scored big gains in strong volume.


Still, Monday's reversal by the Nasdaq was a reminder to individual investors why the market uptrend is still under pressure. It still doesn't make sense to have aggressive exposure to stocks, even amid strong performance by IBD 50 names.


Many of the list's strongest performers are already extended after big price runs. Actionable ideas are few and far between at the moment. Even when a good setup arises, it's hard to have confidence that an upside breakout will have staying power.

In economic news, the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index surged to 65 in September, well above the consensus estimate of 60. That matched the best level of homebuilder sentiment since October. It hasn't been higher since October 2005.


The 10-year Treasury yield didn't move much on the news. As of 5 p.m. ET, it was at 1.71%, up 2 basis points. Meanwhile, benchmark West Texas intermediate crude oil added 27 cents, or 0.6%, to settle at $43.30 a barrel.


IBD's homebuilder group popped 1.7% early but faded to a gain of just 0.3%. **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) rallied 3% but got turned away at its 50-day moving average. Group leader **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) added 0.9% as it holds above its 50-day line.


Among the day's movers, **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) added 0.8% ahead of its earnings report Tuesday after the close. The **[cloud software firm](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/adobe-systems-fedex-seek-support-ahead-of-earnings/)** was featured in the latest Earnings Preview column as a potential options play.


In afternoon trading Monday, a slightly out-of-the-money monthly call option (Oct. 16 expiration) with a 100 strike price came with a premium of $2.85, offering a trade with 2.9% downside risk ($2.85/99.45). In other words, the most that could be lost for the right to buy 100 shares of Adobe was $285 (100 x $2.85). It's better buying an option ahead of earnings rather than the stock itself, because the risk is predefined.


Meanwhile, Netherlands-based **Patheon** ([PTHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTHN)) cleared a short IPO base, rising 5% to 29.52. The buy point was 28.90. JPMorgan brought the company public in July at 21. Patheon, a provider of outsourced pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, is headed up by former **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) CEO James Mullen.

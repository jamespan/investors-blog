  Nasdaq's Bullish Move Adds To Positive Signals For Stock Market

The stock market scored big gains Monday and — more importantly — new signals that institutional investors are committing themselves to accumulating shares.




The Nasdaq composite roared 2.6% and closed about 1% away from its Sept. 2 prior high. The S&P 500 was no slouch, surging 1.6%.


Stock Market Shows Upward Momentum
----------------------------------


In the most significant step, volume rose on the Nasdaq. That gave the Nasdaq a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). It is fresh evidence that the stock market is on an upward trajectory. NYSE volume appeared to be lower, so no follow-through for the S&P 500.


But wait — haven't we been in a confirmed uptrend for nearly two weeks? True, IBD changed its [market outlook from "correction" to "confirmed uptrend" Sept. 30](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gives-bullish-signal/) after the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose sharply in higher volume. It's a narrow index on which to base such an important bottoming signal, but the results show it was the right time to start buying.


![MP101220-FSLR](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP101220-FSLR-229x300.jpg)Monday's new follow-through should give investors more confidence. The only problem is that indexes seem a bit stretched after a 6.4% jump so far this month in the Nasdaq and more than 5% in the S&P 500. Both erased losses from a dreadful September and are near new highs.


Distribution Day Gone Already
-----------------------------


Indexes are rallying so fast, it took less than a week to erase the only [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) of the new uptrend. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have already climbed more than 5% past their closing levels on Oct. 6, when indexes slid in heavy volume. Effectively, this wipes out the only sign of hesitation in the stock market since the follow-through.


The Nasdaq led thanks in large part to a marvelous day for its big five components. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) jumped 2.6% to 6.4%. Their charts Monday showed larger strides than in prior days. All five stocks are forming bases.


Breadth was good, with advancing stocks over decliners by about a 3-to-2 ratio on the Nasdaq and NYSE. The IBD 50 climbed 2.4%. The Russell 2000 rose 0.7%, lagging after a period of outperformance.


Multiple Opportunities For Growth
---------------------------------


For growth investors, today's stock market is rich in opportunities for growth investors, with dozens of stocks breaking out of proper bases and many approaching [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


About [10 stocks in the IBD 50 last week completed the sixth week of price consolidations](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/growth-stocks-present-target-rich-environment-ahead-of-q3-reporting-season/), leaving them in cup-type bases worth studying.


[MarketSmith's list of breakouts](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) over the past few weeks shows nearly 60 stocks, and only four are below their buy points. On average, these breakouts are up more than 7% from their entries. Gains range as high as 40%. None could be considered failed breakouts. Nearly all arose from first- or second-stage bases, which is good.


Monday's breakouts offered a mix of health care, retail, finance and other sectors.


Current Stock Market Leaders
----------------------------



**Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) rose above the 298.86 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) in heavy volume. The stock's position size in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) was raised.


**Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) gapped out of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 56.30 entry in more than double its average volume. The company, discussed in [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/shift4-payments-stock-blasts-past-buy-point-on-touchless-services/), announced a touchless ordering system for restaurants. **Cintas** ([CTAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTAS)) topped a flat base at 345.07.


Talks on a coronavirus stimulus bill remained bogged down, with no major progress Monday. The stock market now focuses on earnings season, which [begins this week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) with some major financials. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) will announce results Tuesday.


**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) go on Wednesday. In the transportation sector, **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) announces Tuesday. Trucker**J.B. Hunt** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) and **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)) railroad release earnings Friday.


A Bullish Sign For Earnings?
----------------------------


Some analysts sense optimism about Q3 earnings.


"We are likely to get a much smaller year-over-year decline in S&P 500 Index profits in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, which is good news," said a research note from LPL Financial strategists Ryan Detrick and Jeff Buchbinder. "Consensus is calling for a roughly 20% year-over-year decline in earnings per share according to FactSet's estimate, but we expect quite a bit better."


The consensus estimate for Q3 EPS has risen about 4% over the past three months, which is the best increase in more than two years according to FactSet. That, the strategists say, "is a good sign that companies may be able to deliver more than the typical upside. ... Bottom line, we think companies may deliver a solid upside surprise this earnings season."

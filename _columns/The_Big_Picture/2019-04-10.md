Nasdaq Today Led By Software Stocks; Small Caps Surge
======================================================

The stock market ended higher Wednesday, with small caps leading the charge. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) stock weighed on the Dow Jones, but the Nasdaq today rallied, helped by a rebound in [software stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/3-ways-to-play-software-stocks-as-top-names-break-out/). Meanwhile, the release of the minutes from the March Federal Reserve meeting came and went without much fanfare.




After Tuesday's 1.2% drop, the Russell 2000 small-cap index jumped 1.4%. The Nasdaq composite added 0.7%, and the S&P 500 rose 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrials lagged with a gain of less than 0.1%. Nasdaq volume fell slightly from Tuesday. NYSE volume edged higher.


Growth stocks turned in solid performances as Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 0.9%. The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) was helped by strong performances from software names **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)). [Fortinet cleared the 88.70 buy point](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fortinet-stock-user-conference/), rising nearly 3% in strong turnover. It's still inside the 5% buy zone.


Fed Minutes
-----------


The Fed minutes didn't contain anything new, which is why the stock market took it in stride. The majority of committee members expect the federal funds rate to be unchanged for the remainder of the year, although some officials said the rate outlook could shift either way depending on economic data and other factors. Despite indications of soft GDP growth in first quarter, Fed officials generally expect economic activity to expand this year, with a strong labor market and inflation near 2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP_041019-253x300.jpg)The bond market interpreted the minutes as mostly dovish. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 4 basis points to 2.46%.


Gainers In The Nasdaq Today
---------------------------


**Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, up 2%. It's back above the 50-day moving average as it forms a flat base with a 200.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). IBD's enterprise software group was a nice gainer Wednesday, up more than 1%. Big sellers were in the group March 22, March 27 and April 4, but the group is only 2% off its high and holding nicely above the 50-day moving average.


**Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) was another strong gainer in the Nasdaq 100. It cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 169.15 buy point, but the breakout came in light volume.


IBD 50 mainstay **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) is testing its 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout in early February. The caveat for Paycom is that its latest breakout was from a late-stage base.


Financials Set To Report
------------------------


Amid a lot of calls for a lackluster first-quarter earnings season, the growth runway for several top software stocks remains strong. For the financials, however, it's a different story amid fears of a slowdown for the U.S. economy and low interest rates.


Several financial stocks have earnings coming up, including **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) on Friday. No doubt it's hard to find bullish stocks in the financial sector due to cloudy fundamentals. But First Republic is holding near highs as it sits just below a 106.29 entry.



Wednesday's session yielded one big breakout. **Gray Television** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)), featured in Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/gray-television-stock-buy-point-tv-consolidation/), cleared a flat base with a 23.55 buy point.


Elsewhere, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is getting support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout from a first-stage base. It's no secret why the leaders in the group are still holding up well. Growth prospects are still strong for many firms, including ServiceNow, which is expected to grow annual earnings 25% this year and 38% in 2020.


New issue **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) jumped 4% in strong volume as it works on a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). But it's a flawed base due to an excessive 49% pullback as the cup formed.


General Market Health
---------------------


The bulls still have a lot to like about the confirmed uptrend. Market technicals remain healthy with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 in position for breakout attempts. But 8000 is still a potential resistance level to watch for the Nasdaq; same with the 2900 level for the S&P 500.


The environment remains favorable for new buys, but keep in mind that the market's true leaders started breaking out weeks ago. Keep your focus on industry group leaders that are either breaking out of bases or finding support after recent breakouts.

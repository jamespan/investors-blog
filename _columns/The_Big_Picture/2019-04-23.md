Nasdaq Charges To All-Time Closing High; Why These 5 Numbers Matter For Top Stocks
===================================================================================

The economy. Europe. Energy prices. Earnings. Which of the four, do you suppose, made a difference in a bullish day for the [current stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) and top stocks on Tuesday?




While all four factors certainly occupy the minds of equity trading desks and professional portfolio managers in both the short run and the long, it would be mighty hard to dispute that some nice earnings surprises ultimately spurred the market's advance.


**Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) all smashed Wall Street's consensus views for the bottom line.



Lockheed not only [beat views but also raised guidance](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/lockheed-earnings-defense-stocks-northrop-grumman-general-dynamics-raytheon/). By gapping up more than 5% in heavy turnover, Lockheed made more progress past the 311.88 entry of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).


[The 5% buy zone for Lockheed shares](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) goes up to 327.47 for now.


Toy giant and consumer spending play Hasbro is working on the [right side of a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). The company snapped a five-quarter slump in sales with a 2% lift in the top line.


And investors did the Wall Street equivalent of a standing ovation after Twitter posted a surprise jump in "average monetizable daily active users" to 134 million in the quarter, and explained further progress in wiping out the accounts of abusive and privacy-busting tweets.


Twitter shares gained more than 15%, bolting past an aggressive entry point at 37.23. As noted in an annotated chart on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), one could have bought shares in the social media giant near 39.



The large cap still trades nearly 17% below the left-side peak of its giant cup. Translation: Another [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) may emerge.


According to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday, so far 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 that reported first-quarter results have issued upside EPS surprises.

Will Twitter Join The Top Stocks?
---------------------------------


If there was any wry irony to be snatched from the ticker tape on Tuesday, consider this: Twitter, the [newest member of IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), trades on the NYSE and not the tech-heavy Nasdaq.


No matter. It wasn't the NYSE composite, a "laggard" on Tuesday with a 0.6% advance, that rolled to new highs. Save that commendation for the Nasdaq composite, which gained 1.3% and posted a new all-time closing high of 8120. The day's intraday high of 8128 came within a finger's length of touching the Aug. 30 all-time peak of 8133.30.


The only key indexes to beat the Nasdaq? The Russell 2000 rose 1.6%, and the S&P SmallCap 600 tacked on 1.5%.


The S&P 500 gained a respectable 0.9% as beaten-down medical and health care shares rebounded furiously. Energy and cyclical stocks including solar energy, coal and chemicals also jumped sharply. But declines in construction gear, homebuilder, drugstore chain, metal ore, oil and gold mining firms blunted the large-cap benchmark's advance.


(See the [daily performance of all 197 IBD industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-apr-23-2019/) in the [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) section at Stock Lists at Investors.com.)


Volume expanded sharply on both main exchanges. Chalk up Tuesday as the clearest example of institutional accumulation of shares. Without the participation of big fund managers, no rally can last.


With the Nasdaq "hitting new highs, the market recovery from the downturn at the end of last year is now complete, and despite the economic concerns, investors have clearly signaled they expect continued growth," Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note to clients. "With markets breaking out again, the likelihood of further gains is high, especially if earnings continue to come in ahead of expectations."


These ETFs Are Getting Hotter
-----------------------------


Exchange traded funds that represent the cream of the crop in growth stocks did all right.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ran ahead 1.1% to 34.50, extending its year-to-date gain to 24.8%. That smothers a 17% return without dividends by the S&P 500 for now. FFTY is managed by [Innovator Capital](http://www.innovatoretfs.com/etf/?ticker=ffty).



Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)), a day after boosting off its 50-day line in bullish fashion, also rose 1.1%.


Due to the strength of the Nasdaq's advance lately, the March 19 [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) (in which the index gained 0.1% but ended in the lower half of the day's session) exited the distribution-day count in the Market Pulse table.


So the Nasdaq is now left with just a single [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) in the past 25 trading sessions. [Distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the 500 are coming close to expiring on time.


5 Key Numbers To Watch Right Now
--------------------------------


At the bottom of each edition of The Big Picture, the column includes a large file of general market indicators, including expansive daily charts of the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the lagging Dow Jones Industrial Average. Longtime readers know that this page contains a treasure trove of data and statistics to help IBD-style investors get a sense of how things are really humming (nicely or badly) under the market's hood.


Which five data points deserve mention right now — especially given that the confirmed uptrend has entered its 16th week since the Jan. 4 follow-through?


**11**: That's the number of weeks in which the 50-day moving average of the Nasdaq composite has been rising. The 50-day line bottomed out in late January, just weeks after IBD noted a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) in the Jan. 4 Big Picture column. At a glance, you get a pretty good idea of an index or stock's price direction with the 50-day.


**17**: That's the number of weeks in which the NYSE's advance-decline line has been marking an uptrend. A rising A-D line is bullish. Why? More stocks keep rising in price than falling. This means the potential for [new breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) also goes up.


Active Vs. Passive: Who's Winning
---------------------------------


**17.9**: That's the year-to-date percentage gain of the IBD Mutual Fund Index through last week's close on Thursday, as seen in IBD Weekly. Why care? With the Dow Jones up 13.9% over the same time frame, it shows that active portfolio management is excelling. Through Tuesday's action, the Mutual Fund Index boosted its gain since Jan. 1 to 19.4% vs. 14.3% for the 30-stock blue chip index.


**24.9%**: That's the year-to-date price-weighted gain of stocks making [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


**Minus 3.9%**: That's the consensus estimate of profit decline among S&P 500 companies for the first quarter. Will these large caps beat this view? Remember, it's almost a tradition for analysts to cut their estimates in the months and weeks running up to earnings reports. That's why it's imperative for leading companies to post strong results and provide bullish outlooks too.


Looking Ahead, Not Back
-----------------------


MacMillan of Commonwealth Financial noted that the market has largely shaken off the Mueller report looking at Russian activity aimed at influencing U.S. elections. He added Brexit "has turned from tragedy to farce; and for all the worries about growth and corporate earnings, both seem to be beating expectations."


At this point, should investors watch for over-exuberance or excessive complacency?


The [CBOE Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or the VIX, has plunged back to the 12 level. That comes close to the level where it hovered before the fourth-quarter market correction got under way. Some market veterans are watching this measure of investor pessimism closely.


Chris Zaccarelli, CIO for Charlotte, N.C.-based Independent Advisor Alliance, with $3 billion in assets under management, watches the VIX closely (you can too in the [IBD Psychological Market Indicators section](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/)). He sounds notes of both short-term caution and long-term optimism.


"The economy has been resilient and corporate earnings are coming in better than expected – although still at growth rates that are more indicative of a stable economy, but not an accelerating one, so it's hard to justify valuations at this point and we would be concerned of another pullback in the next 3-6 months," Zaccarelli wrote in comments provided to IBD.


"Over the long term, this bull market should be able to sustain any pullbacks and could run for another 1-2 years from here so we remain positive over the longer term, despite our near term cautiousness."


Remember that the VIX, the [bulls-bears ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) and the [put vs. call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) are investor sentiment indicators. That is, they act as secondary market indicators. The daily price-and-volume action of the Nasdaq and S&P 500, plus the health of true market leaders, still give you the primary view on stocks and the economy going forward.

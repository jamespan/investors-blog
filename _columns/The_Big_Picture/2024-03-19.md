A wave of selling hit artificial intelligence stocks early Tuesday, knocking the Nasdaq composite to an intraday loss of 0.9% during the first half-hour of trading. But an upside reversal for the major stock indexes had the bulls in a good mood by the close even as the gains came in light volume.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed with a gain of 0.8%, the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Nasdaq picked up 0.4%. The Russell 2000 came close to a test of its 50-day moving average but ended the day 0.5% higher. Volume on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange fell slightly from Monday's light levels.


Winners beat losers on the Nasdaq by about 3-to-2. The ratio was more than 2-to-1 positive on the NYSE. But it's important to note that the Nasdaq's advance/decline line has been trending lower since mid-February.


It was another resilient performance for the Nasdaq even as several top-rated growth stocks fell hard in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com). **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) slumped 9% after the company said it plans to raise $2 billion through a stock sale. The offering hasn't priced yet. Also, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) fell nearly 5%, but it's holding support at the 50-day line so far.


Stock Market And The Fed
------------------------


After six straight gains, the 10-year Treasury yield slipped 4 basis points to around 4.30% as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway. The policy statement is due Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. ET.

The Fed is widely expected to keep its key lending rate unchanged in a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Futures traders at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) think the first rate cut will come at the June meeting. But there's only a 60% chance at this point. Traders see the fed funds rate at 4.50% to 4.75% by the end of the year.

Major stock indexes continue to attract buyers even with an elevated distribution day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Distribution days are always worth monitoring in the stock market, especially since the Nasdaq shows five of them since March 4. But while some leaders are showing chinks in their armor, plenty more are holding up just fine.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), down nearly 4% early in the session, reversed higher for a gain of 1.1%. Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Monday introduced [Blackwell](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-gtc-2024-news-wall-street/), the company's next-generation AI computing platform.


While Nvidia continues to hold above its 21-day line, the stock's price action on March 8 was decidedly bearish. Volume was the heaviest for a down session in many months. The sell-off raises the likelihood that Nvidia could be ready to pull back further and build a new [base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/).


Despite a strong close for the indexes, several top-performing growth stocks lagged in the IBD 50. But the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund pared a 2.9% intraday drop to less than 1%. Inside the IBD 50, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) and **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) lagged with losses of 3% to 4%, but both pullbacks look normal at this point.


Stocks To Watch
---------------


Inside the IBD 50, bitcoin miner **CleanSpark** ([CLSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLSK)) closed 5.5% lower. The stock continues to find support near the 15 level, although a break below the recent low of 14.78 could bring a test of the 50-day line into play.


Other bitcoin-related stocks fell sharply but closed well off lows. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ([BITO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITO)), **MicroStrategy** ([MSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR)) and **Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) all held support at their 21-day lines.


While actionable setups remain sparse in the stock market, a couple of top stocks are flirting with new entries.


**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) continues to show relative strength a breakout from a double-bottom base in January. It's only about 5% off its high with a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) in the works. DraftKings is on the [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com).



**Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) bounced nearly 5% higher in light volume. The stock is close to clearing a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) as it forms a cup-with-handle base with a 241.86 entry. The renewed strength comes after Duolingo gapped up on earnings in late February.


**Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), meanwhile, is still in a buy zone from a 132.03 entry.


**Kura Sushi** ([KRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRUS)) shot past a 108.22 handle buy point in strong volume. It's a thinly traded stock, but some top-performing funds in IBD's Mutual Fund index currently own shares, including Wasatch Micro Cap Fund (WMICX).

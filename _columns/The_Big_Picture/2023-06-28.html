<div class="single-post-content post-content drop-cap crawler"><p>The stock market began Wednesday somewhat shaky. By session's end, the performance proved mixed. Yet overall, it was hardly a trading day to complain much about — especially those who have actively invested in <a href="https://www.investors.com/technology/">tech stocks</a>.</p>

<p>Wednesday's session, meanwhile, also flagged weakness in an area of the stock market where, if you are a growth stock picker, it actually should give you some encouragement, not discouragement. Namely, utility, food and other defensive issues stunk.</p>
<h2>Nasdaq, Tech Stocks Reverse</h2>
<p>Practically everyone expected a weak start on Wednesday. Overnight, the Wall Street Journal reported government sources saying that the Biden Administration may stiffen <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-stocks-hit-by-worries-over-u-s-curbs-on-ai-chip-exports-to-china/">restrictions on the types of advanced semiconductors that could get shipped to China</a>, America's chief geopolitical and economic rival. The story highlighted the possibility that chip designers may need to obtain a license from the Commerce Department before selling and delivering such chips to Chinese customers.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite fell slightly more than 0.4% in the early going. It finished up almost 0.3%. Credit the rebound to strength in IBD industry groups such as computer hardware and peripherals, up 3.1%, according to early data; database software, up 1.6%; specialty enterprise software, a 1.3% gainer; and the much more widely populated enterprise software group, which closed 1% higher.</p>
<p>While a 0.4% gain by itself is not really much to toot about, the action overall fits nicely within the context of the ongoing rebound seen in tech stocks.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>

<hr>
<h2>A Positive Technical Test So Far</h2>
<div class="small-12 columns "><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=0NDQC"></iframe></div></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-8494697 alignleft" src="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062823-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="300" srcset="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062823-218x300.jpg 218w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062823-745x1024.jpg 745w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062823-768x1056.jpg 768w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062823.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px" uia-uid="0|1">Plus, please consider the way the Nasdaq composite handled a test of its <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/">21-day exponential moving average</a> — a key technical level in the near term for a market in rally mode — in recent days. Tuesday's rally of almost 1.7% was vital. And by finishing at 13,591, the Nasdaq gained back most of a two-day, 2.2% slide that began with Friday's decline.</p>
<p>That session's volume soared on the annual rebalancing of Russell equity indexes.</p>
<p>In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 could not add to Tuesday's stout gain. It finished less than 2 points lower at 4376. However, like what was seen in the Nasdaq, the intraday trading range was relatively narrow — less than 0.7% from Wednesday's session low to high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.2%.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.investors.com/category/research/options/"><strong>What's Cooking In Options Strategies Lately</strong></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 slightly underperformed the Nasdaq and tech stocks in general. A nearly 0.5% gain to 1858 placed the popular small-cap gauge up a decent 3.1% since the start of the second quarter and up nearly 10% from its March 24 low of 1695.</p>
<p>Volume was lower on the Nasdaq but rose 5% on the NYSE, according to Dow Jones data.</p>
<h2>Defensive Issues Get Shellacked</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, investors decided to ditch safe-haven stocks. The Dow Jones utility average fell more than 1.6%, gutting a two-day rebound. The index is down 7.3% for the year.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns "><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=HSY"></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Hershey</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSY" target="_blank">HSY</a>), which gained a morsel of attention in recent months on the IBD Live daily show on investing, continued to melt further below its 50-day moving average. Shares dropped 4% to 249.59 in heavy volume.</p>
<p>Recent losses in the chocolate, gum, mint and baking ingredients monolith now threaten that the stock will give back all of its gains from a <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/">cup-with-handle breakout</a> at 242.25.</p>
<p>Also outside the Nasdaq,<strong> General Mills</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS" target="_blank">GIS</a>) gapped down and fell 5.2% in volume that jumped 280% above average. May-ended quarter results showed a significant growth slowdown (earnings flat at $1.12 a share, following year-over-gains of 12%, 11% and 15%. Sales rose just 3% to $5.03 billion. That marked the weakest increase in five quarters.</p>
<p>The exit from these stocks in recent days and weeks seems to suggest that investors generally are hunting for more growth in their portfolios.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Mercury Rising Outside Tech Stocks, Too</h2>
<p><strong>Celsius</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH" target="_blank">CELH</a>) perhaps offers instant proof. The fat-burning exercise drink maker is aiming for a fifth straight weekly gain.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns "><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=weekly&amp;symbol=CELH"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint">Leaderboard half size position</a> has entered the 20%-25% profit zone after a strong breakout past <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/">multiple buy points</a>, including a standard cup entry at 122.24, during the week ended May 12. That breakout occurred just six weeks after the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 delivered a solid follow-through day on March 29.</p>
<p>Celsius (92 <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/">Composite Rating</a>, 92 Relative Strength) earned 40 cents a share in the first quarter, up 344% vs. a year ago, on the back of 95% growth in sales to $260 million.</p>
<p>The average top-line increase over the past four quarters? An astounding 100.3%. And in the four quarters before that period, Celsius' sales had driven 100% higher or more in every quarter.</p>
<h2>Watch Friday's News</h2>
<p>Of course, the relatively tight ranges for the equity indexes may have a lot to do with portfolio managers and equity trading desks awaiting another salvo of important inflation data on the U.S. economy. On Friday before the open, expect some fireworks to follow the latest report on the personal consumption expenditures index, one of the Federal Reserve's most closely monitored price indicators.</p>
<p>The consensus forecast from Econoday? It calls for a 0.1% increase in May vs. the prior month and a 3.8% rise vs. a year earlier. In April, the PCE Price Index jumped 0.4% for the month and 4.4% year over year. So, economists are hoping for more signs that inflation is cooling.</p>
<p>Yet as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell noted at a forum hosted by the European Central Bank on Wednesday in Portugal, inflation in the U.S. is far from nearing the U.S. central bank's desired rate of 2% to 2.5%.</p>
<p>Indeed, the core PCE index's expectations call for 0.4% growth month on month and up 4.7% vs. a year earlier. Both figures, if met on Friday, would mark no change from&nbsp; April.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the probability of another quarter-point hike in the fed funds rate, or what big banks pay for overnight cash infusions, rose to 81.8% on Wednesday, according to data from the CME FedWatch tool. That's up mildly from an already high 74.4% a week ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the yield on the key U.S. 10-year government bond fell 5 basis points to 3.71%.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Leading Tech Stocks: Will This Pattern Pay Off?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the strength of this nearly three-month rally since the March 29 confirmed uptrend signal will continue to depend on the action of top growth stocks on both the Nasdaq and NYSE.</p>
<p>Could <strong>Palantir Technologies</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR" target="_blank">PLTR</a>), the cloud-based data analytics software expert already up 138% for the year, become a useful litmus test?</p>
<div class="small-12 columns "><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=PLTR"></iframe></div></div>
<p>As the stock shot out of a first-stage base and rocketed more than 100% over a span of four weeks, it formed what arguably could become the flagpole of a <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-tesla-stock-rally-high-tight-flag-base/">potential high, tight flag</a>.</p>
<p>Note that this is the rarest of great chart patterns. Few really work out. IBD founder William O'Neil has noted that you generally see only one great example in every bull cycle.</p>
<p>Typically, the flag portion, or the decline within the high, tight flag, needs to be tight. Think no more than a decline of 20% to 25% over a span of two, three or four weeks.</p>
<p>At Friday's low of 13.56, PLTR dropped 21% from its recent peak of 17.16. Watch for signs of lighter selling, tight action, and strength within its own industry group.</p>

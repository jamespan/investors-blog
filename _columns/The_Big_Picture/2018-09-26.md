Federal Reserve Curveball Baffles Wall Street; Stocks Offer This Silver Lining
===============================================================================

Wall Street expected the cost of money to go up on Wednesday, and the major indexes initially rose as if it had been long priced in. But in the afternoon, the Fed seemed to throw the monetary-policy equivalent of a curveball.




Virtually every portfolio manager expected the Fed funds target rate to go up a quarter point to a range of 2%-2.25%. No surprise there. But in its statement, the interest rate policy committee removed an entire sentence used in prior news releases that contained the phrase, "The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative."


That, of course, doesn't surprise many folks on the Street, given that the Federal Reserve had already raised short-term interest rates twice this year, and five times since March 2017. The Fed appears certain, too, that inflation is now squarely hitting its long-term objective of 2% a year. Yet it still raised questions among journalists covering the news. Fed chief Jerome Powell attempted to clarify, saying that "[overall financial conditions remain accommodative](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/the-fed-hikes-interest-rates-stays-too-hawkish/)." But Powell also said that certain asset prices are looking toppy.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MP_7x3_092618-230x300.jpg)In short, Wednesday's session showed in a miniature way how Wall Street still shows allergic reactions to uncertainty.


The Nasdaq composite, the leading index all year, gave back a midday advance of as much as 0.8% to end just more than 0.2% lower. Volume rose ever so slightly vs. the prior session. Yet it was enough to slap the tech-heavy index with its [seventh distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), or instance of unusually heavy professional selling, in the past 25 sessions.


The Current Distribution Count
------------------------------


Keep in mind, however, that many of those distribution days have had the impact of a mosquito bite on a bull. As noted in past Big Picture columns, most of the recent sell-offs have been very mild. On the Nasdaq, just two distribution days scored a decline of 1% or more (-1.2% on Sept. 5, -1.4% on Sept. 17).


The S&P 500's drop by day's end was also trifling. Yet the session stung bulls more in that the large-cap benchmark had risen nearly 0.6% during the first 4-1/2 hours of the session.


NYSE volume rose mildly. Yet the distribution-day count for the S&P 500 remained at three, because the Aug. 21 stalling day expired on time.


A few sector indexes did much worse, and a few did much better.


The Dow utility average slid 1.1%. Higher interest rates generally make dividend-rich stocks less attractive. Small caps sharply underperformed. The S&P SmallCap 600 dropped 0.9%, the Russell 2000 1%.


But amid a cooling off by crude oil futures, certain transport issues rallied. The Dow Jones transportation average rose 0.6%.


On top of that, leading growth stocks added a subtle yet very important silver lining to the day's trading.


Fed Action And Impact On Leading Stocks
---------------------------------------


For starters, consider the IBD 50. Only a handful of top market winners fell 1.5% or more for the day. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Health Insurance Innovations** ([HIIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIIQ)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) certainly could afford to retreat some, after posting big gains already this year. The trio of stocks fell sharply yet remain above their rising 10-week moving averages.


In fact, within the IBD 50, the only stock to fall significantly in intense turnover was **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)), which departed IBD Leaderboard earlier in the day after struggling to retake its 50-day line.


IBD's [Sector Leaders list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) showed more stocks, such as **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), rising for the day in heavy volume than those that declined in vigorous turnover.


The Fed Can't Stop Innovative New Growth Companies
--------------------------------------------------



Lastly, out of the 12 stocks that represent [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), nine strode higher for the day.


Among those 12 companies, new member **CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)) notched a third straight gain and raced to a new all-time high of 57.25. The online auto retailer went public on Oct. 12, 2017, at $16 a share. In less than a year, shares have more than tripled.


New issues are part of the critical lifeblood that keeps bull markets young.


In the latest IBD Weekly newspaper last Friday, on page B6, IBD's New Issues index showed a 19.7% year-to-date gain. That smashes the S&P 500's 9.6% advance over the same time period.


With two trading days left in the month, investors will want to look for any signs of profit-taking, window dressing, or any other adjustments to the end of the third quarter of 2018. Yet overall, the three-month period is likely to end pretty well. At 7990, the Nasdaq composite currently holds a handsome 6.4% quarter-to-date gain.


IBD 50 Still Tops The Market
----------------------------


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), down just 0.2% on Wednesday, is up 8.3% since July 1.


[Bullishness remains at a pretty high level](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears), returning above the 60% threshold among newsletter editors polled each week by Investors Intelligence. But the put-call volume ratio is at 0.74, nowhere near bearishly low levels.

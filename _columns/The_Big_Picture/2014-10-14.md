The stock market made a feeble rebound Tuesday, doing nothing to alter its bearish overtones.

  

The Nasdaq advanced 0.3% and the S&P 500 less than 0.2% in higher volume. Yet both indexes surrendered beefy morning gains. The Nasdaq had rallied as much as 1.6% at midday before sellers showed up and hammered the indexes near session lows by the close.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average wiped away all gains and closed fractionally lower.

  

But not all corners of the market were so weak.

  

Small caps bounced back with energy, as the Russell 2000 climbed 1.2%. The index had tumbled nearly 14% from its July 1 peak to Monday's low, so it was more likely to snap back from oversold conditions.

  

Utilities and real estate investment trusts — two favorites at times when equities struggle — helped lead the market.

  

Several members of those sectors broke out. **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR))cleared an eight-week flat base at 54.97 in active trading. **Portland General Electric** ([POR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POR)) broke out past an irregular flat base at 34.84 in volume close to double its average.

  

The Dow transportation average soared 2.6%.

  

Airlines, railroads and related stocks rallied as the price of West Texas intermediate crude fell 5% to the lowest level since 2012. The International Energy Agency warned that oil demand this year will grow at the slowest pace since 2009.

  

The news rattled the energy sector, though. Oil and gas industry groups were most of the day's poorest performing.

  

Health care stocks also were among the weakest. The sector has been one of the few remaining areas for investors in which to hide, but breakdowns on those charts are happening with more frequency.

  

As lackluster as Tuesday's gains were, they still marked a possible first step toward a market recovery. It will take at least several days to tell if the indexes can find a true bottom.

  

The indexes have kept falling below areas where they had a chance to rebound, such as the 50-day moving average, the 200-day line, or near the 4400 level on the Nasdaq.

  

For about a year, the market could count on the put-call volume ratio to spike and signal a bottom. But the ratio's elevated levels have done nothing so far to arrest the market's correction.

  

The ratio surged to 1.4 on Monday, an unusually high reading of investor fear. It reached that high in August 2011 and in May 2012. Both times, it took several weeks until the market bottomed and made a follow-through. In 2012, the Nasdaq made another new low in early October before it finally got its uptrend on track.

  

The IBD 50 rose 0.6% Tuesday. The index has corrected about 15% since its Sept. 3 peak, not quite matching the 16.6% decline in March and April.

  

Most of the 50 stocks are trading below the 50-day moving average, and some of those moving-average lines are starting to curve lower.

  

**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) had one of the IBD 50's best showings, rebounding 8% in heavy trading. The company raised its Q4 guidance.

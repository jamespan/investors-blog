Indexes Reverse Lower, Give Up Chance To Rebound
=================================================

An early bounce in the main indexes faded Tuesday, as the market remained hobbled.


The Nasdaq, up as much as 0.9% at one point, closed with a loss of 1.2%. The S&P 500 also reversed lower, shedding 0.8%. Both closed at session lows. The small-cap Russell 2000 was nearly flat after giving up a big gain.


Declining stocks led advancers by 7-to-5 on the NYSE and by about 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


The market's bearish reversal and higher volume were symptomatic of a correction. Buyers fled at the first sign of trouble.


If any chart watchers were hoping to see the Nasdaq bounce off its 50-day moving average, they were let down. The composite closed below the line and the S&P 500 sank further below its line.


Small investors must devise their own defenses for today's market. Chiefly, that means cutting losses. Taking profits on stocks up more than 20% from the purchase price is another intelligent approach.


Even if the indexes aren't bouncing from their 50-day lines, several leading stocks are at least trying. **NXP Semiconductor** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)), **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) are among those.


However, until the market gets back on its feet it doesn't make sense to buy stocks, especially not in secondary buy areas.


Take **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) for instance: It has slid right through its 50-day line.


The IBD 50 fell 1.7% Tuesday, dragged down mainly by its medical and technology components.


While the market corrects, it's time to look for leading stocks forming bases. Right now, though, it's too early in the downturn to find many bases. It may take a few more weeks to get more patterns to appear.


The market is tense as it waits for the Federal Reserve's statement Wednesday and what it could mean for interest rates.


Financial alarm bells rang in Russia, where interest rates were hiked to 17% from 10.5% in a desperate attempt to prop up Russia's currency. Still, the ruble fell and Russian stocks plunged.


Crude oil inched higher, which helped the beleaguered energy sector enjoy a better day. Retail, which has been a leading sector, was one of the weakest.


Homebuilding stocks sagged after housing starts and building permits in November fell from October and missed forecasts.


High readings in the put-call volume ratio have been reflecting investor anxiety for a few days now. Readings closed above 1.0 in each of the past three days. Ultimately, deep angst can be good for the market, acting as a bottoming (albeit secondary) signal.

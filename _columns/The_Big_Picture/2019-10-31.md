The stock market rally paused Thursday amid U.S.-China trade-deal doubts, as the Nasdaq composite ended the day with a mild loss. Strong earnings from tech giants **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) helped buoy the tech-heavy index.




The Nasdaq closed with a less than 0.2% loss after falling as much as 0.7% earlier in the session. The S&P 500 declined 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a 0.5% loss, or 140 points. A nearly 2% fall in **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) weighed on the Dow Jones industrials. [Caterpillar stock](https://www.investors.com/research/cat-stock-buy-now/) tried to break out past a new buy point this week, but was turned away. Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 stumbled 0.7%, falling for a second straight day.


Volume was higher across both main exchanges compared with Wednesday's session.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) fell just 0.1%, outpacing the main indexes. The index of top growth stocks is trying to regain its 200-day moving average after spending about two months mainly below that key level.


Current Stock Market Rally
--------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP_4x5_103119-245x300.jpg)This week, the S&P 500 index reached record highs, as the current stock market uptrend continues. The [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) has eased, showing improving institutional sentiment. A late rally in the Nasdaq Thursday helped the composite avoid a distribution day by narrowing the day's loss to an insignificant amount. However, the S&P 500 was unable to avoid a distribution day as NYSE volume rose Thursday.


Amid the recent rally, U.S.-China trade talks have taken a back seat to Q3 earnings season. But Thursday's fall was driven by a Bloomberg News report that cast doubt on the potential for a long-term U.S.-China trade deal.


[Q3 earnings season](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-when-to-buy-growth-stocks-earnings/) continues to show mixed results, especially among large-cap tech companies. On the upside, Facebook surged after the earnings report late Wednesday, though it pared gains. Conversely, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) this week moved lower after their earnings results. Lastly, Apple nearly set a record high Thursday after its strong results.

Be particularly mindful of buying stocks ahead of earnings releases. On the upside, strong results can send stocks surging, often staging [bullish breakaway gaps.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) For example, **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) surged above a 60.10 buy point in a flat base after it beat views.


On the downside, weaker-than-expected earnings can result in sharp breakdowns. For example, former [top growth stock](https://www.investors.com/research/twitter-stock-buy-now/) **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) plunged nearly 21% on Oct. 24 after weak earnings, just one day after triggering the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) from a 41.02 entry in a cup with handle.


IBD 50: 2 Leaders Trigger Sell Signals
--------------------------------------



Our index of leading growth stocks — the IBD 50 — outperformed the major stock indexes Thursday amid huge gains from **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) and **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)).


OLED stock advanced 15% after [crushing earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/universal-display-earnings-q3-2019-oled-stock/), as it moves up the right side of a new base. The [new cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) shows a 230.42 buy point.


Tempur Sealy, meanwhile, quickly became extended after the company's earnings. Shares were briefly in the 5% buy zone of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with an 81.95 buy point. Tempur Sealy is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock idea.


On the downside, **Federal Signal** ([FSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSS)) triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) from a recent 34.22 buy point in a flat base. The stock fell as much as 10.6% after the company's earnings came out early Thursday.


Meanwhile, **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)) reversed from early gains to trigger the 7%-8% sell signal from a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) 37.72 buy point. The stock jumped in early trade after the company's [strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/crocs-earnings-q3-2019-boot-barn-earnings-q2-2020/) late Wednesday. But those gains proved to be short-lived. The retailer closed with a 6% decline, a disappointing end to the session.


Stocks To Watch Amid Current Stock Market Rally
-----------------------------------------------


Top stocks to watch in the current stock market include today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/global-payments-stock-nears-buy-point-dividend-hike-earnings/), **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) and FANG stock Facebook.


Top payment processor Global Payments is within striking distance of a 176.05 buy point in a flat base. The stock's [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is nearing new highs, which indicates strong stock market outperformance. Look for it to hit a new high along with the stock price to confirm the breakout's strength.



Meanwhile, Facebook broke out above a 193.20 buy point in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) after the [company's earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-raises-price-target-strong-earnings/). At its 198.09 peak, shares gained as much as 5.2% before closing with a 2.5% gain, just below the entry. A potential flaw is the stock's RS line. So far, the line is well away from new highs.

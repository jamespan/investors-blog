The stock market kicked off the week with modest gains early Monday, with commodity and financial stocks leading the way. But the strength was short-lived, and the major stock indexes pared early gains for the third straight session as indexes reversed lower. The session was a reminder that the market remains in a correction, albeit a mild one so far.




The Dow Jones climbed close to its 50-day moving average and the 35,000 level, but sellers knocked the blue-chip index to a loss of 0.7% by the close. **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) remains a pillar of strength in the Dow. It's showing strength and support after a breakout over a 275.32 buy point.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) lagged in the Dow ahead of a busy week of earnings reports in the financial sector. Both firms are components of the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)), which suffered an outside day Monday, falling 1%.

Seven of the fund's top 10 holdings are on the earnings docket this week, including JPMorgan and **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)), which report early Wednesday. Goldman reports Friday before the open.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 also fell 0.7% and the Nasdaq lost 0.6%. Small caps fell about the same, with the Russell 2000 down 0.6%. Nasdaq volume eased, and preliminary data showed slightly higher volume on the NYSE.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1. Losers beat winners on the NYSE by more than 2-t0-1.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gave back 0.8% after rising 1% midday. It's still below its 50-day moving average after getting turned away at the line last week. The ETF closed 1.3% above its 200-day moving average, which provided support last week.


Inside the IBD 50, **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) reversed higher as it continues to make a solid first test of its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/). It's on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) watchlist. Another IBD 50 component, **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), appears to be basing while holding support at its 10-week line. Note that if a proper base forms, it would be a [late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).


Stocks will tempt you on a daily basis when the stock market is in a correction. While some stocks will always buck the trend in a down market, it's best to favor cash and wait for a buy signal from the major stock indexes in the form of a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/).

Monday marked the seventh day of a rally attempt for the Dow Jones industrials. As long as its Oct. 1 low holds, the rally will be intact. Monday was the fifth day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. As long as the Oct. 4 low holds for those indexes, their rallies will stay intact.


Movers & Shakers
----------------


The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) was an early gainer Monday, but a 1.5% gain faded to a flat close. Copper miner **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) gapped above its 200-day moving average and broke out of a downtrend early in the session. Other miners on the move included **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) and **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)). Teck's high of 28.54 today was the highest since week of June 15, 2018.



The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) reversed slightly lower amid another surge in oil prices. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $80.52 a barrel, up 1.5%, after crossing the $82 level earlier in the session. The ETF topped the 56.75 buy point of a cup base but closed below it.


**Exxon-Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) make up just over 40% of the fund. Both stocks are approaching all-time highs as they form the ride side of bases.


Leading oil and gas stocks started breaking out last month, and most are well extended in price now. Be careful not to buy laggard stocks in the sector.


**Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)) rose to the top of a 15-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), but it's a lopsided base. **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) is also near the top of a 17-week-old cup base, while **PDC Energy** ([PDCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDCE)) is close to breaking out over an alternate entry. But PDC's weekly chart is flawed due to a bearish distribution week the week ended Oct. 1 when shares slumped 7.7% in higher volume.

Solar stocks outperformed, with IBD's solar group up around 4.5%. **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) was a nice gainer in the group, up 3.7%. A breakout attempt over a 97.65 buy point failed, but the stock now has its sights set on its Sept. 14 high of 107.27.


In the building sector, **Louisiana Pacific** ([LPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPX)) gave an early entry Monday with a breakout over a [trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/). That brings a move over its Sept. 30 high at 64.40 into play. While many stocks got pulled down with the broad market after early strength, the wood products stock closed near highs.

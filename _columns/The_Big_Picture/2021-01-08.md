Blue Chip Stocks And Nasdaq Close A Stunning First Week Of 2021
================================================================

Trump flag-waving rioters gone wild on Capitol Hill. A Democrat upset win in the Senate to complete a mini blue wave. Covid-19 cases still raging on both coasts of the U.S. And a sharp plunge in December nonfarm payrolls.




Is there anything that can take down the bulls?


The Nasdaq led Friday's action with a 1.1% advance. A 2.4% gain for the week hammered home the point that big and megacap techs are not ready yet to roll over. The S&P 500 made it four straight gains, up nearly 0.6% on Friday. Small caps rested. Yet iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), slipping 0.2%, still rallied 5.9% for the week. That's on top of a 30.9% rip higher in the fourth quarter of 2020.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 0.2% winner Friday, showed that blue chip stocks could not keep up with the above-mentioned indexes. Still, its 1.6% rally for the week got powered not just by techs but also economically sensitive sectors such as construction, banking, chemicals and oil and gas.


Watch The Blue Chip Stocks
--------------------------



**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) is a legitimate turnaround leader. Like the Dow industrials, it has found nice support along its 10-week moving average. Shares cleared a three-weeks-tight follow-on buy point with a 6.7% thrust higher for the week in heavy turnover. **Eastman Chemical** ([EMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMN)), **Eaton** ([ETN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETN)) and **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)) also made notable strides to new multiyear highs.


The first week of 2021 seemed to pack in a month's worth of historic news. Yet the stock market proved again that it is in a confirmed uptrend.


![MP010821](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP010821-267x300.jpg)That uptrend began anew on Nov. 4. For faithful readers of the Big Picture column, they know that the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average made an [important follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/) following the brief sell-off in the back half of October last year. Since then, the Dow has climbed 12%.


Beyond Blue Chips
-----------------


Market internals remain positive. Hundreds of stocks on both main exchanges are posting new 52-week and all-time highs, boding well for breakout hunters. The advance-decline line of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are tilting higher again.


Sector rotation is helping drive these bullish elements. Consider the top 20-ranking industry groups today. Steel has jumped to No. 15 from 105th just three months ago. Metal ores improved to third vs. 19th over the same time frame. Oilfield services ranks 16th vs. 119th, and heavy construction 19th vs. 98th.


[Bullish sentiment among newsletter pundits](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) is still quite high, even though the Investors Intelligence survey showed bulls dipped to 60.2% from a December peak of 64.7%. But the savvy investor pays first and foremost attention on how the major indexes and true market leaders act each day.


This week also turned out to be the first time since March 19, 2020, that the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond returned above 1%. The return on 3-month T-bills are still unbelievably low, around 0.09%; see this as a tailwind for the banks.

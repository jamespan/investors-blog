Stocks Sag Again, But Two Sectors Outperform
=============================================

U.S. stock indexes struggled for a fourth session in a row, but software and homebuilder stocks chalked up gains.




The Nasdaq sawed off 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each lost 0.8%. The small-cap Russell 2000 retreated 0.9%.


Volume in the stock market rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The day's action constituted [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Distribution involves a price loss in rising volume, which suggests institutional selling.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP_6x5_030719-274x300.jpg)In the past six sessions, distribution has shown up in four sessions, as the market pulls back after rebounding strongly since late December.


200-Day Line Fails To Hold
--------------------------


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 stabbed under their 200-day moving averages, a battleground that could be tested in the near term.


Despite the recent scuffles in the stock market, software stocks added gains Thursday.


Software Stocks
---------------


Analytics software provider **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)) climbed 6% in a vigorous bounce off the 50-day line. Oppenheimer maintained a buy rating on Alteryx with a price target of 85. The stock would need a gain of almost 19% to reach that target.


**Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)), a provider of data analytics software, spurted 2.2% but then eased to a 0.5% gain. San Francisco-based Splunk, though, accomplished a goal. The stock bounced off its 50-day line in volume 20% above average. It still remains below its 130.10 buy point.


The software sector is highly rated, No. 1 among 33 IBD sectors.


Nice Pop For Homebuilders
-------------------------


Homebuilders, meantime, are No. 78 among 197 industry groups. Six weeks ago, homebuilders were rated No. 124.


On Thursday, homebuilder stocks were playing above expectations. Nineteen stocks in the group rose while only three fell. Fifteen stocks posted gains from 1.7% to 4.8%.


Going into Thursday's session, the homebuilder group was up 11.2% so far in 2019.


Bulls expect the spring selling season for houses to be strong this year. Plus, the Federal Reserve's decision to take a break from raising interest rates could help the building sector.


The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) popped 1.2% higher. The exchange-traded fund is up 15% in 2019.


On the negative side, the hardest hit stock groups of the day included retail, airfreight and wholesale electronics.


Financial News
--------------


Nonfarm productivity in the fourth quarter came in at 1.9% vs. views for 1.6%.


In Europe, central bank President Mario Draghi said he expects interest rates to stay where they are throughout 2019. The European Central Bank also announced [a new stimulus program for banks](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/07/european-central-bank-march-2019-interest-rate-decision.html). The news, though, didn't help world markets. The iShares Core MSCI Europe ([IEUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IEUR)) fell 1.5%.


Challenger, Gray and Christmas reported February layoffs that reached 76,835, the highest level in more than three years. Results were somewhat distorted: Payless ShoeSource's filing for Chapter 11 boosted layoffs by 16,000.


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 223,000 just above the Street's consensus estimate of 220,000.

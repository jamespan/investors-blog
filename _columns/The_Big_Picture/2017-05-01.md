 The Nasdaq composite stretched its lead over the other major indexes Monday, as star stocks **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) rallied.


Adding **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), those half-dozen stocks command more than one-fourth of the Nasdaq's total weighting. No wonder the composite, which just had one of its best weeks of the year, added 0.7% to make a record high.

Despite broad strength in big caps, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1%. It, too, remained horizontal. Indeed, neither index has been able to capture anything close to the Nasdaq's fervor. The composite is up 5% since April 13, the last day it closed below the 50-day moving average.


Small caps were under the shadow of big stocks, yet the Russell 2000 climbed 0.5%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The performance of the so-called FANG stocks and a few other major Nasdaq companies was unusually strong. Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Netflix traded at record highs and volume was heavy. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, made a new closing high.


Amazon.com rose about 3% after FBN Securities raised its price target, citing the online retailer's ad sales growth.


The market made it through last week's rush of earnings reports in good shape, and that seems to have left a good taste in Wall Street's mouth. Amazon and Alphabet have climbed after last week's earnings reports.


Facebook announces its first-quarter results Wednesday after the close, and judging by the stock's surge the past two weeks, institutional investors have no fear about the numbers. Apple was up more than 2% ahead of earnings late Tuesday.


The strength in technology spread beyond big caps. Chipmaking, chip equipment, computers, fiber optics and consumer electronics were among the best-performing industry groups.


The start of May brings that familiar refrain, "Sell in May and go away," to Wall Street, market newsletters and investment clubs. Historical trends show the market does tend to underperform in the May-October period.


Since 1950, the S&P 500 (or its predecessor index) was up on average 1.4% from May through October, while it was up an average 7% the other six months, according to LPL Financial. Yet even those months still produced an average increase of 4.1% in the past five years.


"Had you sold in the beginning of May over the past five years and not reinvested until October, you left significant profits on the table," Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL, noted in a report Monday.


In the past four years, the Nasdaq in May climbed 2.6% to 3.8%. But 2012 was miserable, down 7.2%.


If investors want to stay with the market trend, there's no better guide than the behavior of the major indexes. With only a few distribution days in the past several weeks, the market is in no immediate danger. Of course, holding or buying companies ahead of earnings reports is always risky.


Many top stocks are advancing from breakouts, and others are finding support at the 50-day moving average. These are fertile conditions for investing in shares.

Stock indexes Thursday gave back the previous session’s gains, leaving bulls with the unwelcome conviction that price gains are now more like loans than gifts. The Nasdaq skidded 1.5%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average braked 1.2% and 1% respectively. The IBD 50 lost 1.1%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell slightly on the NYSE.


The rising volume on the Nasdaq and sharp price losses met the definition of distribution, which points to institutional selling. The Nasdaq now carries six distribution days, which has to be raising anxiety for the bulls and satisfaction for the bears.

Given those realities, the uptrend is now wearing the under pressure label.


Economic news was sparse Thursday. First-time jobless claims were slightly fewer than expected.


With no clear catalysts upcoming on the news front, attention could be shifting to Q1 results, which will begin to roll in next week.


As IBD reported in a front page story Wednesday, earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to fall 7.1% vs. the year-ago period, and revenue is seen falling 1.1%.  

The earnings drop would be worst since 2009’s third quarter.


Yet in the stock market, great expectations met are sometimes a bigger problem than anything low expectations create. Few would contend that leading stocks are now priced for perfection.


Bears could be holding short positions with the hope of low earnings expectations that prove too high. The NYSE short interest ratio, which is published in IBD’s B section with the Psychological Market Indicators, was 4.49 in Thursday’s paper. The reading is the highest since October to mid-January, when it ranged from 4.47 to 4.96.


If bad earnings misses were to become the reality, then it’s hard to imagine the uptrend staying in place.


Bulls might see some hope tucked inside the low expectations. Upside surprises could fire up individual stocks selectively.


On Thursday, selectivity on the bullish side was the story, though admittedly a brief story.


**Ollie’s Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) jumped 10% in heavy volume. **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) added 3% on a gap up in heavy volume. **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) followed Wednesday’s 8.8% gain with a 1% gain. And **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) tacked on 1% Thursday to Wednesday’s 13% pop.

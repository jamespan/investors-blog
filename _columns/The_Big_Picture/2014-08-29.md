========================================================

Stocks coasted into the three-day weekend Friday, wrapping up the fourth positive week in a row for the major indexes.


The Nasdaq tacked on 0.5% Friday while the S&P 500 added 0.3%. The IBD 50 inched up 0.2%.


Volume fell on the NYSE but was slightly higher on the Nasdaq, thanks to a low-hurdle comparison to Thursday.


Given the slow volume of the past three weeks, this might be a good time to check the gauges on the investment dashboard.


• **The major indexes:** This is the most important gauge, and it shows the market in a confirmed uptrend with few signs of institutional selling. Yet signs of institutional buying also are scarce. The last time the Nasdaq rose 1% or more in rising volume was Aug. 13, the follow-through day.


• **Market leadership:**  The Nasdaq and S&P 500 marked short-term closing lows Aug. 7. Since then, the Nasdaq, IBD 50 and IBD New Issue Index are up about 6% each. The weakest gains are on the small cap S&P 600 and the Dow Jones industrial average, each up 4%. •

 **Closes:** The indexes are closing mostly high in the day's range, a bullish sign.


• **NYSE advance-decline line:** This line is near a high and generally rising, which is what bulls like to see.


• **The IBD Mutual Fund Index:** This gauge also has been rising.


• **New highs:** Combined new highs (NYSE plus Nasdaq) were above 230 six times in the past 10 days. That's not wildly bullish, but it's the best in five weeks.


• **Percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day line:** This figure is at the two-thirds level. When the indexes hit a low Aug. 7, the percentage was 52%. At market peaks in March and July, the figures were 75% and 70%, respectively.


• **Bulls vs. bears:** Investors Intelligence's gauge shows financial advisers divided at 52.5% in the bull camp and 15.1% in the bear camp. The bulls vs. bears gauge is a contrarian indicator, which means the market usually does better when the bear camp is larger than it is now.


• **Breakouts:** August delivered more than two dozen breakouts among top stocks, which is encouraging. However, most gains post-breakout are modest, which can make the stocks hard to hold.


**Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) illustrates the challenges of this market.


The stock cleared a 175.26 buy point in a cup-with-handle base in early June with the market in a confirmed uptrend. On July 22, the stock hit the 20% profit level. An investor could've sold there. However, those who held through July's market uptrend under pressure hit the 30% profit level Aug. 13.


Now, Aug. 13 was the follow-through day. Logic would say that Vipshop should do even better now, right?


Wrong. Vipshop peaked on the market's follow-through day. The stock then retreated and skidded 6% Friday, erasing all but 12% of the gain from its breakout.


The close below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume should be considered a sell signal.


This market is tricky, which is why following the 20% profit-taking rule isn't a bad idea. Don't fall into the trap of trying to manage your portfolio to perfection. Try to manage to keep the odds in your favor.


Economic news Friday was mixed. The Chicago PMI and University of Michigan's consumer sentiment numbers were better than expected. But personal income and consumer spending fell short of views.


For the week, the Nasdaq rose 0.9% while the S&P 500 and the IBD 50 each posted a 0.8% gain.

Stock indexes sold off decisively Friday afternoon, despite good news for the reciprocal-trade camp. Meanwhile, the major indexes closed under their 50-day moving averages.




The Nasdaq dropped 1% Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliced off 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed below their 50-day moving averages, just one day after both indexes climbed back above those key levels. It wasn't a sharp fall below those lines, but a setback for the market's rebound.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed higher NYSE volume.

In the meantime, CNBC reported that, according to anonymous sources, [U.S.-China talks have stalled](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/us-china-trade-talks-have-stalled-sources.html).


Pessimists And Optimists
------------------------


Pessimists and optimists alike found evidence for their mood in the U.S.-Canada-Mexico deal.


Optimists said it proved that President Trump can reach a deal despite bellicose talk that often appears to be an end in itself.


Yet, pessimists noted that reaching an agreement took a year. Given that China is not as friendly to America as the U.S. neighbors to the north and the south, reaching a deal with China could be a very long-term project.


News-Driven Market
------------------


From an investor's viewpoint, the worst part of current stock market conditions is that this is a news-driven market.


A market beholden to news is in some ways neither for the bears nor the bulls. It is a creature that can change from day to day.


Constant, news-driven uncertainty is never good for the stock market. The uncertainty leads to speculation, and sometimes a swirl that raises the ultimate fear — recession.


Overlooked History
------------------


Could the stall on China lead to a worldwide recession?


Perhaps, but some market watchers say investors are overlooking an important fact.


Oil prices are the overlooked item, according to Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research. High oil prices have been the catalyst behind a recession many times in the past, Yardeni recently noted.


Recent attacks on Saudi oil tankers and friction between the U.S. and Iran could lead to supply interruptions. If oil prices go high enough, then a recession would be possible.

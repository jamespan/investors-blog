Indexes Mixed As Leaders Perform Better
========================================

The major indexes closed mixed Tuesday, but underlying strength could be seen in leading stocks.


The Nasdaq added 0.4%, while the S&P 500 fell less than 0.1% — a loss too small to be considered distribution. Volume rose sharply as traders started coming back from summer break.


Oil and other commodity stocks suffered the most and contributed to the lagging performance of the S&P 500. Crude prices sank to the lowest level since January, while gold slid 2%, worsening a downtrend.


Various reasons have been cited for the slump in commodities, but a major factor is the strength of the dollar. Improving U.S. economic reports are boosting the greenback, while the euro is floundering on expectations that the European Central Bank will embrace quantitative easing. (See the International Leaders column on Page B14.)


The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.2%. Much of the blame rested on **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), which skidded 2.5% on news that it had been hacked in a massive credit-card breach. The slide abruptly halted a strong uptrend in Home Depot stock, but it's still extended 11% past an 81.95 early entry.


Indexes continued to make small price movements, their upward trends still intact but moderating. The S&P 500 seems to be coming to grips with the 2000 price level. Distribution since the Aug. 13 follow-through on the Nasdaq has been sparse so far, a good sign for the market.


Leading stocks mostly looked better than the broad market. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and upscale apparel maker **Vince Holding** ([VNCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNCE)) broke out of bases, as did transportation leaders **Ryder System** ([R](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=R)) and **Navigator Holdings** ([NVGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVGS)). Navigator erased most of its gain, however.


The transportation sector was a leader Tuesday, along with a broad section of the computer sector. Watch the industry group ranking tables for other groups making big moves, up or down.


The IBD 50 rose 0.9%. It is close to a record high that it reached last week.


One reason for the IBD 50's advance is a sector rotation that has been providing fresh leadership to take over for parts of the market that are falling out of favor.


Medical stocks, in particular biotechs, are getting hot.


**Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)) and **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) gapped up to new highs on bullish news about drugs they are developing.


But casino stocks are in trouble.


**Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)), **Melco Crown Entertainment** ([MPEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPEL)) and **MGM Resorts International** ([MGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGM)) tumbled in heavy trading to about one-year lows. **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) hit its lowest price since December.


Gaming revenue in Macau — a major growth driver for the industry — is cooling off, as the Chinese government carries out an anticorruption campaign.


The Russia-Ukraine crisis continues to escalate. Wall Street had reacted sharply to headlines from the crisis in the past. But now, the market seems inured to the news, perhaps sensing that the conflict will not spread to other countries.

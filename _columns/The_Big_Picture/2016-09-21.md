U.S. stocks galloped ahead Wednesday after the Federal Reserve decided to stand pat on interest rates.


The Nasdaq popped 1%, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.1%. The Dow Jones utility average led the pack with a 2.1% gain. The IBD 50 rushed 1.6% higher.


Volume was higher across the board.


The Fed said in its statement that "the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened," but added that it decided to wait for "further evidence" of economic progress.


The Nasdaq apparently needed no further evidence. The index pegged a new all-time high. The new high means the market uptrend has resumed, and investors should increase exposure to stocks.

The Aug. 16 distribution day fell off the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 because of time. After five weeks, distribution is no longer relevant to current conditions.


A number of top-rated stocks that ended under the 50-day line last week retook the key line Wednesday.


**B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS)) thrust 5% in strong volume as it settled well above its 50-day line. The stock also closed high in the day's range, a bullish signal.


Other IBD 50 stocks retaking the 50-day line, albeit in routine to below-average volume, included mortgage software provider **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)), water heater maker **A.O. Smith** ([AOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOS)), chip designer **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)), consumer credit information provider **Equifax** ([EFX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EFX)), and financial analytics firm **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)).


A preliminary look found no IBD 50 stocks losing their 50-day line so far this week.


For other stocks, positive action is taking different forms.


**Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) pulled as much as 7% off its Sept. 1 high but found support just above its 50-day line. Through the market's recent minor turbulence, Western Alliance stayed above the 35.21 buy point from an August breakout. The stock rose for the third day in a row Wednesday and is back above its 5% buy zone.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) has held steady in recent weeks, despite the pressure on the market. The stock has sketched a shallow base-on-base pattern with a potential entry at 813.98.


**Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) appears to be recovering from its 83% correction after a January 2014 peak. The stock broke out of a base Wednesday in strong volume. The buy point is 60.97. The Street expects Nu Skin to grow earnings 16% in 2017, which would be the best growth in three years.


Cyclicals also can sometimes present opportunities. Specialty steel stocks were up for a fourth straight session.


**Allegheny Technologies** ([ATI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATI)) and **Carpenter Technology** ([CRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRS)) each advanced 2%. Carpenter retook its 50-day line in strong volume, while Allegheny climbed above its 50-day line in below-average trade.


Carpenter could be undergoing a turnaround. The stock saw earnings decline in fiscal 2013-16. The Street, though, expects earnings to grow 31% in fiscal 2017 ending in June and 39% the next year.


Allegheny also is attempting a turnaround. The company lost money in 2013-15 and is expected to lose 88 cents a share this year. But analysts expect Allegheny to post a profit of 69 cents a share in 2017.


Both stocks have lackluster IBD ratings, making them riskier plays.


**What's ahead**: Thursday will be a busy day for data. Reports scheduled for release include first-time jobless claims, the Chicago Fed National Activity survey, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's house price index, existing-home sales, leading indicators, and the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing index.

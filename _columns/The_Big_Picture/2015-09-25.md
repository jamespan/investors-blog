Stocks started strongly but reversed to finish down Friday, showing the kind of action typical of downtrending markets. The Nasdaq booked a 1% loss after being up 1.1% just after the open. The S&P 500 held up better, trimming to less than 0.1%.

  

The IBD 50 skidded 1.3%.

  

Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell on the NYSE.

  

The negative reversal, along with a sixth distribution day on the Nasdaq, was enough to shift IBD's market outlook to correction. Individual investors should avoid buying stocks in a correction because the odds are now on the bears' side.

  

The Nasdaq is looking more and more determined to go down and test its August closing lows, which are just above 4500.

  

Friday's ugly reversal developed despite three factors that could've been seen as bullish.

  

First: After Thursday's close, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that rates would likely rise "sometime later this year."

  

The Federal Reserve's Sept. 17 decision not to raise rates left some on the Street convinced that the Fed lacks confidence in the U.S. economy.

  

Economic data provided a second piece of potentially bullish news Friday. The final number for Q2 GDP growth came in at 3.9%, stronger than expected.

  

The third piece of news was House Speaker John Boehner's announcement that he was leaving Congress at the end of October. But it wasn't clear just what the market made of this.

  

Conservative Republicans literally cheered the news. Their negative view on Boehner was that he was weak and consistently outmaneuvered by President Obama.

  

If the Street likes the idea of a stronger Republican presence in Congress, then Boehner's exit might be favorable long term. But short term, the move could add uncertainty and perhaps even lead to a government shutdown.

  

Some might wonder what effect a government shutdown would have on the stock market.

  

Very little, if history is any guide. Since 1976, there have been 18 shutdowns. They ranged from one day to 21 days, with seven days as the average.

  

The Nasdaq lost a trivial 0.7% on average during the shutdown periods, while the S&P 500 averaged a 0.4% loss.

  

The stock market apparently doesn't think a government shutdown is the big deal that the mainstream media make it out to be.

  

Although shutdowns don't seem to hurt stocks much, a rally to year-end has followed the conclusion of a shutdown five times for every two times that it fell.

========================================================

U.S. stocks sprinted ahead Friday, as the major indexes rose for a fourth week in a row.


The Nasdaq advanced 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.2% and 0.8% respectively.




 Volume fell on the NYSE but rose on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary calculations.


A [busy week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/alibaba-facebook-amazon-apple-alphabet-earnings/) lies ahead for Q4 earnings season.


Companies set to report include **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) on Wednesday; and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) on Thursday.


All five of these stocks carry heavy weightings in the Nasdaq. Apple's weighting is 6.8%; Alphabet, 5.9%; Microsoft, 5.2%; Amazon, 4.6%; and Facebook, 3.9%. For good or for bad, this means the market will be dealing with some high impact reports.


So far, the Q4 season is shaping up well.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP01261818-665x1024.png)According to Zacks Investment Research, companies are finding momentum on revenue; beats are more common on revenue and earnings in Q4 than in the past several quarters; and the positive-revisions trend is the best in at least six years.


The upbeat Q4 reports are helping stocks navigate higher. The Nasdaq is up 9% year to date, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 are up 8% and 7% respectively. The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), an exchange traded fund that reflects the IBD 50, is up 7%.


On a narrower basis, the best-performing groups so far this year include movies, department stores, consumer loans and online retail.


The weak groups have been homebuilders, dairy and recreational vehicles.


RV stocks suffered deep dents Thursday and Friday. Northcoast Research said dealer inventories were at [an "unsustainable level" for 2018](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/winnebago-thor-industries-trigger-sell-signal-as-analyst-says-rv-inventories-unsustainable/). Northcoast lowered both stocks from buy to neutral.


An individual investor should regard his or her portfolio with cold calculation. Don't be afraid to take profits, where appropriate.


If the rally continues, new opportunities will occur. If a pullback begins, profit takers will be ahead of the curve.

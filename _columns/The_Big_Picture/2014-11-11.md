The main indexes rose modestly Tuesday, as the market's advance continued its moderating trend.

  

With much of the nation taking the day off for Veterans Day, the listless trading on Wall Street was no real surprise. Volume fell across the board.

  

The S&P 500 eked out a new high before closing with a gain of less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq added 0.2%. Both closed near session highs, which has been a habit of theirs for a week running.

  

After a stellar advance from their Oct. 15 lows, the broad indexes have cooled off. The Nasdaq has flattened out more than the S&P 500, which still made new intraday or closing highs seven of the past eight days.

  

Yet the market's slowdown is not surprising in the context of its rally. It even seems like a necessary step to consolidate its rapidly won territory.

  

Three weeks since the Oct. 21 market follow-through, the market remains surprisingly light on distribution. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have suffered just one day of significant losses in higher volume during that stretch.

  

There has been broad participation in the advance, with retail, finance, transportation, software, real estate, medical and other sectors accounting for dozens of stocks making 52-week or all-time highs.

  

In somewhat of a surprise, real estate has been a solid sector. The new-high list lately has shown it often among the leaders.

  

Real estate investment trusts in particular have stood out.

  

The **iShares Cohen & Steers REIT** ([ICF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICF)) and **SPDR Dow Jones REIT** ([RWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RWR)) ETFs are now in the top five in year-to-date returns. (See table on Page B10.)

  

In IBD's property REIT industry group, about one out of every five stocks (172 total) are at or within 1% of a new high. Many REITs have broken out and are making productive runs from their buy points.

  

REITs often perform better in weak markets because they are dividend-rich. But they've continued rallying along with the broad market so far this autumn.

  

Stocks have become the better-performing asset class. But compared with the still-puny interest rates on bonds, dividend stocks have an advantage.

  

Homebuilders and related stocks were market leaders Tuesday. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) missed profit views but sales topped expectations and shares rose 2% in heavy volume. The stock closed 2% above its 23.41 buy point from Monday's breakout.

  

Looking further at top 40 industry groups, some financials also are making strides. Retail groups also have been rising, and investors should check those for emerging opportunities.

  

The put-call volume ratio last week slid to a low considered to be a possible bearish sign. But two other times it did that this year, it proved inconsistent in flashing near-term tops in the major indexes.

  

The IBD 50 was down just a fraction Tuesday. Almost all of the components had ordinary moves. **Arris Group** ([ARRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRS)) slid 5% in heavy trading. The stock fell back to its downward-sloping 50-day moving average. **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)) rose 2.5% to a new high, extending an impressive ascent from the mid-October lows.

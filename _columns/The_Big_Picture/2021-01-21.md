Stock Market Hits Record Highs, But Is It Too Extended? Apple Nears New Buy Point
==================================================================================

The major stock indexes set more record highs Thursday, as FAANG stocks Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple and Alphabet again powered higher. Meanwhile, Netflix remained in buy range.




The Nasdaq advanced 0.5%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 slid 0.9% as small caps sharply underperformed. The S&P 500 moved up less than 0.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged lower.


Leading growth stocks led the way, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 10-ranked **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) surged 10%. Shares are way above their 51.20 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) and investors should take at least some profits during the sharp run-up. The stock looks due for a pullback.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq from Wednesday. Preliminary data showed volume fell on the NYSE.


Stock Market Rally Hits Record Highs
------------------------------------


![MP012121](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP012121-239x300.jpg)The Nasdaq and S&P 500 extended win streaks to three sessions Thursday. Both hit record highs. The Dow Jones industrials also hit an all-time high before turning lower.


With four [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 and zero on the tech-heavy Nasdaq, there is a light amount of institutional selling in the past several weeks. Investors should remain confident, especially with the resurgence in big-cap tech stocks, like the FAANGs. Meanwhile, top growth stocks again led the way Thursday, as evidenced by nice advance in the Innovator IBD 50 ETF.


Keep in mind the Nasdaq remains sharply extended from its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), so a pullback is a definite possibility. The composite ended more than 8% above it on Thursday. Historically, when the Nasdaq is about 6% above its 50-day line, it will begin to pull back.


On Sept. 2, the Nasdaq closed 11.6% above its 50-day line. Just 12 sessions later, the Nasdaq declined as much as 13% from its highs.


Despite the extended Nasdaq, there's no rule that says the market has to stop going up because it's extended. Don't try to predict whether the stock market will continue to set more record highs or start to fall. Most important is the interpretation of the daily action of the indexes and the top growth stocks. Those barometers so far indicate a strong market uptrend.

FAANG Stocks To Watch: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet
--------------------------------------------------------


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) extended a win streak to four sessions Thursday, advancing 2%. The advance stopped right at the 50-day moving average, a possible resistance level.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) climbed 1.3%, nearing a 3,350.75 early buy point. The conventional buy point looms at 3,552.35, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


[Dow Jones component](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) jumped 3.7% and is just shy of a 138.89 buy point in a cup with handle.


According to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock analysis, "Apple nearly doubled from its breakout in April and will be tough to replicate that run. The base is third stage, which is a reason to have lower expectations this time around."


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) ended Thursday in the 5% buy zone past a 1,843.93 buy point of a flat base following Wednesday's breakout. Shares tacked on 0.2% Thursday after sharply trimming gains.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) gapped up and topped its 575.47Â [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy volume Wednesday after the company's [bullish Q4 report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-improved-finances-possible-share-buybacks/). Netflix fell 1.1% Thursday, but closed still above the buy point.

Stock Indexes Face Resistance, But Facebook Breaks Out
=======================================================

Stock indexes tested resistance Thursday as they approached the highs of several weeks ago. The Nasdaq added 0.2%, while the S&P 500 sliced off 0.5%. The IBD 50 led with a 0.6% pop.

  

Volume fell sharply on both major exchanges.

  

Bulls are in the odd situation of seeing the indexes approach new highs, even as they carry a heavy load of distribution. It's as if the market were trying to row a boat with the anchors dragging.

  

The goal for the Nasdaq now is to thrust through the 5,000 level and turn it into support. For the S&P 500, resistance appears to be above and around the 2100 level.

  

Yet the distribution-day count naturally raises a question: Is cutting through that resistance a realistic goal for [this stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today)?

  

In the first two weeks of March, each of the four up days in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 led to distribution the next day in one or both indexes. This suggests institutions sold into signs of strength.

  

So far this week, the indexes have done a better job of holding gains. However, it isn't clear if the market has put opportunistic selling behind itself.

  

Circumstances may have put bulls in the peculiar position of hoping the bears get their way â€” at least for the short term.

  

A pullback that sinks lower than the recent 3% to 4% dips in the major indexes could prep the market for a more stable advance. Shaking out more weak holders would give power to the bulls.

  

Yet individual investors don't always get what they want. The market can tease the bulls and the bears with unsettled action for weeks, sometimes months.

  

For IBD-style investors, 2015 has provided a decent market.

  

So far this year, a number of top-rated stocks have broken out and booked solid gains. If an investor bought at the breakout and held, he or she would now be sitting on a 37% gain in **Papa Murphy's International** ([FRSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRSH)), 37% in **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) and 34% in **NXP Semiconductor** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)).

  

An additional seven leading stocks now have post-breakout gains of 20% to 26%, and 10 more hold gains of 16% to 19%.

  

The catch is that most of the winners broke out in January or February. March has been a weak month for quality breakouts.

  

On Friday, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) did its part to help. The stock lunged 1.84 to 82.75 in heavy volume. Facebook cleared an 82.09 entry in a shallow cup with handle.

  

Friday is a quadruple witching day, involving the expiration of equity and index options and index and single stock futures contracts. This often boosts volume.

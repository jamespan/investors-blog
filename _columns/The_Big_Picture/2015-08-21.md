============================================================

Stock indexes on Friday dived to their lowest level in more than six months. The Nasdaq clanged 3.5% lower for a four-day losing streak that had to waken even the most stubborn bull. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average shed 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.

  

The IBD 50 slid 3.5% as all 50 stocks fell.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges. Friday was an options expiration day, which tends to boost volume.

  

Friday's action, along with "cluster distribution" during the week, bumped the Market Pulse to correction.

  

Cluster distribution involves days of distribution bunched together. The market suffered distribution on one or both major indexes in four consecutive sessions.

  

Friday's shift to the correction label is the first since May. However, the range-bound action in recent months gave the market a wobbly feel, even when in a confirmed uptrend and especially uptrend under pressure.

  

The Nasdaq has dropped 10% off its recent high, and both major indexes are well below their 50-day and 200-day moving average lines.

  

At this juncture, buying stocks carries unacceptable risk.

  

Even so, individual investors should be aware that a relief rally, or even a turnabout in the market, is possible.

  

In October, for example, the Nasdaq corrected 10.7% and then turned north to post a Day 4 follow-through.

  

Watching for a follow-through day, which would confirm that a new uptrend is under way, is the individual investor's chief mission now.

  

Historically, many good follow-through days have occurred in August.

  

In preparation for that day, individual investors should become familiar with what's been performing well and badly during this market decline.

  

Knowing what's working, or at least not falling apart, can provide a hint at what sectors might lead a new rally.

  

So, let's take a brief look at winners and losers. The Nasdaq's decline began after the July 20 closing high. It since fell 10%.

  

Big winners during the same period, according to preliminary data Friday, include gold miners, up 11%; fiber optics, up 9%; and homebuilders, up 8%.

  

These groups might provide a good place to look for watch-list candidates.

  

The biggest losers, not surprisingly, were solar and some oil groups. They were already beaten up, though.

  

Among recent market leaders, biomedicals lost 16% in the same period. The charts of some of the former leaders — such as **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) — are looking desperate if not ugly.

  

The put-call ratio closed at 1.48 Friday, an extreme level that suggests the market could be near a bottom. The last time the put-call ratio was near that level was Oct. 13 when it closed at 1.41. Two days later, the Nasdaq marked a bottom. The Nasdaq then rose almost 17% in six weeks.

  

In economic news Friday, China's manufacturing gauge for August was weaker than expected. In the U.S., the PMI manufacturing gauge for August also fell short of views.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq chopped off 6.8%; the IBD 50, 6.2%; and the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, 5.8% respectively. The small cap S&P 600 lost 4.2%.

  

In the coming week, companies reporting earnings include **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **Zoe's Kitchen** ([ZOES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZOES)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)).

Stocks Continue Rebound Ahead Of Fed Meeting
=============================================

The stock market continued to rebound Tuesday, as some leading stocks also gave encouraging signs. The Nasdaq added 0.9% and challenged a couple of key levels on its chart: The composite closed just below the 50-day moving average and the 5,000 price.


The S&P 500 jumped 1.1% and is further away from its 50-day average. The index sank to the 2,000 area Monday, where it started its rebound.


Of course, support at one level doesn't necessarily mean success above other key levels. While indexes are rebounding, they need to rehab some more before investors should become convinced to wade back into stocks.


A hefty amount of distribution remains in the market's past few weeks, which hasn't gone away with this week's bounce. Some serious institutional buying is still needed to decontaminate the market.


Volume fell across the board, an indication that institutional investors were lukewarm about Tuesday's rally.

The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed, adding 1.4%.


On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates, ending seven years of near-zero fed funds rates. How will stocks react? Will they sell off once the move is confirmed? Will the Fed throw a surprise?


For investors, the best course is to remain in as much cash as possible. If the current rally attempt is for real, the confirmation will emerge soon enough.


There are some hopeful signs developing.


Lots of leading stocks are finding support at the 50-day or 10-week moving average. That creates some follow-on buy opportunities, for those brave enough to risk capital while the market is unsettled.


On the IBD 50, **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)), **Total System Services** ([TSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSS)) and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are examples of that trend. Some leaders, such as Alphabet and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) gave back most of the day's gains, however.


Be aware that some pullbacks are occurring below prior buy points. In those cases, the support is a good sign but not a chance to add shares. That's because you'd be adding to a trade that is already losing money.


A few breakouts added to the positive vibes.


**Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) broke out of a base-on-base pattern with a 106.53 buy point. The postage services company had been trading tightly as it carved its base, a bullish indication.


**Imax** ([IMAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMAX)) topped the 39.97 buy point of a cup with handle, but closed below the entry. Volume was heavy on both stocks.


But **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) was a sober reminder of current risks.


The stock plunged 10% — wiping out about half of a week-and-a-half rally — after news that New York City officials are urging the SEC to probe whether the gun manufacturer has adequately disclosed how often its guns are used in crimes.


The stock has been soaring after a solid quarterly report and fears of more gun control.

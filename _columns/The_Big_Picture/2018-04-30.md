The Dow got off to a good start Monday as Wall Street liked the look of strong earnings from **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)). But early gains faded for the major stock indexes as technology shares faced another fresh round of selling. The S&P 500 suffered a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/).


It wasn't a great close on the final trading day of April.


The Dow jumped nearly 0.8% in early trade. But the blue-chip index ended lower by 0.6%, weighed down by weakness in **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Volume rose on the NYSE but declined on the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP043018-2-3-226x300.jpg)Shares of Verizon tanked more than 4% after a long-awaited deal between **T-Mobile** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) and **Sprint** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) finally came to fruition. [T-Mobile agreed to acquire Sprint](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/t-mobile-sprint-merger-deal/) for more than $26 billion. But the deal still needs to pass regulatory muster.


Dow Hurt By Intel, Microsoft
----------------------------


Meanwhile, after reporting strong earnings last week, Intel and Microsoft lagged in the Dow. Intel reversed sharply lower Friday and extended losses Monday. Shares fell another 2% to 51.62. Intel tried to clear a base last week with a 53.88 buy point. Microsoft also tried to break out last week, but it's now firmly below a 97.34 buy point. Shares lost 2.4% to 93.52.


The Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% early but reversed sharply lower. It lost nearly 0.8% in lower volume, while the S&P 500 gave back 0.8%. The Russell 2000 fell 0.9%. It's been the most resilient of the stock indexes, but the small-cap index closed below the 50-day moving average Monday.


Not A Fearful Market
--------------------


Investors were hardly fearful Monday. The put-call volume ratio registered a tame reading of around 0.85. Readings over 1.15 indicate extreme fear and have been seen at market bottoms in the past. It's a contrarian indicator. Readings over 1.0 mean investors are buying more bearish puts than calls.


Big decliners in the Nasdaq 100 included **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)). Shares of the former leader slumped 3%. The stock could be poised for a test of the 200-day moving average. Micron, already below the 50-day average, is down 27% from its prior high after hitting a high of 63.42 in mid-March.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor index lagged again Monday, falling just over 1%.


Monday's price action was a stark reminder of why the market outlook was lowered a notch last week to "uptrend under pressure." It's not a market under heavy distribution, but the technical health of the major stock indexes is in question and leading growth stocks aren't acting all that great.


**First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) broke out bullishly on April 18 and scored another new high Friday. But gains faded by the close. Shares plunged 9% Monday, ending just above the 50-day moving average.


**SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) lost less than 1% despite stiff selling in the solar group. It's featured in today's [Sector Leaders](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-jumps-after-israels-netanyahu-drops-cheating-bombshell-on-iran-nuclear-deal/) column.


China Names Outperform
----------------------


A few China names saw some buying interest Monday. [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) cleared a cup-with-handle base with an 86.09 point. Shares rose nearly 4% to 87.39 in decent volume. Inside the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) were top percentage gainers, rising 4% and 2%, respectively.


Oil and gas stocks outperformed Monday as oil prices rose. U.S. crude oil futures ended at $68.57 a barrel, up 0.7%, after hitting an intraday high of $69.34. Oil strengthened after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has documents that show [Iran cheated on a nuclear deal](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-jumps-after-israels-netanyahu-drops-cheating-bombshell-on-iran-nuclear-deal/) that allowed it to boost crude exports.


**EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) and **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) tried to clear cup-shaped bases Monday in light volume.


Separately, a big deal in oil refining space made headlines when **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) announced plans to acquire **Andeavor** ([ANDV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANDV)) for $23.3 billion. Shares of Andeavor vaulted 13%, while Marathon Petroleum cratered 8%. Marathon also reported earnings and sales that missed expectations.


All Eyes On The Fed
-------------------


The stock market's attention now turns to the two-day Fed meeting.


In economic news, personal income and spending data were in focus. All of the attention was on the core Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the [Fed's preferred inflation gauge](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-inflation-gauge-pce-nears-2-target/). It hit 1.9% in March, up from 1.6% in February but just below the consensus estimate of 2%.


A two-day Federal Reserve meeting starts Tuesday. A decision on interest rates will be out Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed isn't expected to raise rates this time around, but another quarter-point hike to a range of 1.75% to 2% is widely expected at the June meeting.


Late last week, the first estimate to first-quarter gross domestic product came in at 2.3%, above the consensus estimate for 2% growth.


The 10-year Treasury yield ended mostly flat at 2.95%.

Yawn. Stretch. Another quiet, yet resilient session for the stock market.


For the bulls, Monday was pretty good. Despite tiny gains for the major stock indexes, several market-leading growth stocks outperformed again.




Strong earnings lifted shares of [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) to a 6% gain. Headed into earnings, the China-based company was showing supporting action at the 50-day moving average after a big breakout in July. Quarterly profit of 49 cents a share nearly doubled expectations. Sales increased 34% to $409.9 million. 58.com operates online classifieds and listing platforms in China


Price action was much quieter in the major stock indexes, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average ending with gains of around 0.1%. Small caps lagged slightly, with the Russell 2000 ending with a fractional loss. The small-cap index is clinging to the 50-day moving average. Market bulls, of course, would like to see a bounce off the support level with volume.

Dow component **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) was in the headlines again, but for the wrong reasons as shares tumbled 7%. Since Oct. 20, shares are down 20%. The company outlined a turnaround plan, but Wall Street was pessimistic about how long it could take. Investors also frowned on GE's plans to cut its dividend by 50% to 12 cents a share.


Bright spots in the Dow included **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) with gains of around 1%.


Home Depot, which reports earnings Tuesday before the open, is getting support at the 50-day moving average after a recent breakout.


When it comes to overall market health, readers of this column know that the distribution-day count is getting elevated again in the Nasdaq composite. But out of the index's six distribution days, two declines of 0.6% are the worst it got. That's not a market under meaningful distribution.


With the market in a confirmed uptrend, shoot for some well-timed buys, watch them work, and then decide whether or not to lock in a 20%-25% gain. Or, when a trade doesn't work out as planned, cutting losses at 3% to 4% often makes sense rather than waiting for the [7% to 8% sell rule](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/) to trigger. It's been a good strategy to follow for a while now.


Still, subtle signs of distribution, coupled with high bullishness among newsletter writers are two reasons for individual investors to continue to tread cautiously. Last week, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey of market newsletters showed the bulls at 64.4%, the fifth straight weekly reading above 60, which is regarded by contrarians as the "danger zone" due to excessive optimism.


Other strong gainers out of China Monday included online retailing giant **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)). Shares jumped more than 3% to 41.33. The stock broke out over a trend line, found by connecting the stock's recent highs. It still has a ways to go before it breaks out from its double-bottom formation. The stock's gain was fueled by another strong quarter. JD.com is still about 15% off its high after a 27% pullback. That means overhead supply could still be an issue.


Overhead supply is selling pressure that arises after a stock pulls back, then starts to rally back toward highs. Those who bought on the way down during the pullback sell when the stock starts rallying again, happy to break even on a trade that was underwater for a while.


Elsewhere, China-based online retailer **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) picked up 5% to 34.63. Earnings are due Nov. 21 after the close. Similar to group peer JD.com, Baozun also broke out over a trend line Monday, although a weaker one because it touched only two peaks. It's now 14% off its high. It is also forming a double-bottom base.


New issue **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) continued its torrid ascent after debuting in late September at 14. Shares soared 28.5% Monday to 42.72. That's on the heels of a 70% gain last week when the video streaming firm cleared an IPO base with a 29.90 buy point.

<p>The Nasdaq composite ended the day down 0.2%, but its weekly gain of more than 3% remained impressive. The tech-heavy index sits near highs for the year and was up in 10 out of the past 12 weeks. It is sitting pretty above its <a href="https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/">short-term moving averages</a> and shed its June 23 <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/">distribution day</a> due to a 5% gain from that day's close.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 also reversed lower as early buyers headed for the exits, closing down 0.1%. The benchmark index jumped about 2.5% for the week and continues to looks strong. It remains up about 17% so far in 2023.</p>
<p>Decliners outnumbered advancers by around 3-to-1 on the NYSE and more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/">Volume was also mixed</a>. At this stage, the stock market uptrend continues to show resilience. IBD recommends sticking at 80% to 100% exposure, but be ready to take action on any sell signals in case there is a pullback.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best among the major indexes, grinding 0.3% higher.&nbsp;<strong>UnitedHealth</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH" target="_blank">UNH</a>) was the top performer with a 7.3% lift after it posted a strong earnings report, while <strong>Chevron</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX" target="_blank">CVX</a>) lagged.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>

Growth stocks were given an even harsher slapping, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY" target="_blank">FFTY</a>) dived 1.3%.</p>
<h2>Earnings Tsunami Looms Large</h2>
<p>This week delivered cooler-than-expected inflation data, which helped to propel the market higher.</p>
<p>However, earnings season is now kicking off with gusto. Big bank results were generally positive Friday, but the devil as in the details. <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM" target="_blank">JPM</a>), <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC" target="_blank">WFC</a>) and <strong>Citigroup</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C" target="_blank">C</a>) all beat views, but Citi was punished amid weakness across several of its businesses.</p>
<p>The pace picks up the coming week, with <strong>Netflix</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX" target="_blank">NFLX</a>) and <strong>Tesla</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA" target="_blank">TSLA</a>) among the heavy hitters set to deliver results.</p>
<p>And there is more economic data, with U.S. retail sales for June coming Tuesday and last month's housing starts data coming on Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Stock Market Action: Health Stocks Lead Upside</h2>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 sectors ended the session mostly in the red. Health and consumer staples were the only gainers, while energy and financials struggled the most.</p>
<p>The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a deeper insight into the day's action.</p>
<p>Periodicals, food wholesalers and a range of health-related groups were the best performers. The latter groups bounced due to UnitedHealth's report.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, fiber-optics plays, toy stocks and a range of oil &amp; gas groups all lagged.</p>

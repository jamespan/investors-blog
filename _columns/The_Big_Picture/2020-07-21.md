title: Stocks Fade As Small Caps Outperform; This Indicator Was Bullish

The stock market sold off in afternoon trading, evaporating gains for the Nasdaq composite and leaving the S&P 500 with skimpy gains. Small caps sidestepped the late weakness and outperformed.




An afternoon rebound on the Nasdaq was cut short around 2 p.m. ET, when a wave of selling took the index to a loss of 0.8%. The composite briefly topped last week's peak at 10,824, though it's a level of at least short-term resistance right now.


The Nasdaq megacaps that performed so well Monday took back some gains. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) gave back 1.8% after Monday's nearly 8% surge. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) reversed modestly lower.


Most of those bellwethers lost more than 1%. And for most, volume was below average. [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks also fell mainly in light volume. That's a sign of ordinary selling rather than a rotation.


The S&P 500 saw a 0.8% increase dissolve into just 0.2%. The close in the lower part of the day's price range, combined with higher volume, gave the S&P a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). This was a stalling day, when sellers wrestle control from buyers into the close even if the index closes higher. But for a second straight day, the S&P 500 closed above the June high at 3233.


![MP072120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP072120-255x300.jpg)The IBD 50 slid 1.4%, a sharp underperformance for the leading stocks. Technology and financials were among the IBD 50 stocks down on the day.


Higher Stock Market Open Fades By The Close
-------------------------------------------


Stocks opened higher as they followed gains from European bourses. The European Union agreed to a massive $2 trillion spending plan to shore up the union's economy. Germany's DAX rallied 1%, while stocks in London and Paris rose modestly.


On Wall Street, earnings from **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) added to the positive early vibe.


IBM opened sharply higher after the company [easily beat profit and sales expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-earnings-second-quarter-report-stock/). But those gains were gone by the close in a disappointing display. Coke's sales missed views, but earnings beat estimates. Coca-Cola shares rose more than 2%, though it also pared gains.


Coke's results helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.6%. Oil stocks **Exxon Mobi**l ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) also contributed. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) rose 2.4% after the Federal Aviation Administration took new steps to get the grounded 737 Max jet back in service.


Small caps led the market, as the Russell 2000 rallied 1.3%. Energy small caps did much of the lifting. Invesco S&P Small Cap Energy ETF ([PSCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCE)) surged 7.3% and climbed back above its 50-day moving average.


Stock Market Breadth More Bullish
---------------------------------


Market breadth was much better than indexes suggested. Advancers led decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


A wider-moving market is always better, because it's not healthy when most of the market's gains are at the hands of Amazon, Microsoft and other major storehouses of market value. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is starting to point upward after it trended sideways since June 8. The NYSE A/D line also has been sideways, lagging the indexes.


The stock market is into the thick of earnings season now, and the early returns are favorable.


With less than 10% of S&P 500 companies having posted second-quarter results, 73% topped profit expectations. That's running slightly above the five-year average of 72%, according to FactSet. In aggregate, earnings are coming in more than 6% above the consensus estimates. Moreover 78% of S&P 500 companies have beaten revenue expectations, by a combined 3.5%, FactSet said. That's also trending above the five-year average of 60%.


Earnings Season Expectations Low
--------------------------------


That helps investors look past what's expected to be a dreadful Q2 for earnings and sales, and start looking to an expected recovery in the second half of the year. FactSet says S&P 500 earnings are on track for a 44% decline, the worst since the financial crisis of 2008. All 11 S&P sectors are expected to show lower EPS for the quarter. Net profit margin for the S&P 500 is measuring 7.1%, on track for the lowest since Q4 of 2009.


The price of gold jumped Tuesday after the U.S. dollar weakened and expectations grew for more stimulus measures to boost the economic recovery. Rising gold prices also suggest uncertainty about the economy and equity markets.


SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)), the ETF that tracks the price of bullion, climbed 1.2% to the highest level since October 2012. [Mining stocks were among the leaders](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/growth-stocks-three-gold-miners-hit-new-highs-two-are-in-buy-zones/). **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) climbed above the 28.60 buy point of a cup base but closed below the entry.


**Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) made a new high, a day after it cleared a handle entry at 66.85. The moves follow earlier breakouts for **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) and **Franco-Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)).

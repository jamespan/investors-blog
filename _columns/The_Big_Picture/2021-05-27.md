The stock market ended mixed Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 continued their rebounds from key support levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq underperformed, closing slightly lower after giving up midday gains.




The Nasdaq inched less than 0.1% lower Thursday. The S&P 500 climbed 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrials gained 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.1%, decisively retaking the 50-day moving average.


Leading growth stocks also outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.6%. No. 14-ranked [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) advanced 6.8%, rebounding from The 50-day support level in good volume.


Volume rose 20% on the Nasdaq and appeared to be sharply higher on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![MP052721](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP052721-248x300.jpg)Following last week's tests of their 50-day lines, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 continued their rebounds Thursday with modest gains. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 are nearing record highs.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq failed to add to Monday's bullish retake of its 50-day line, and still remains about 3% away from all-time highs.


While the health of the market trend is slightly improving, the market has piled up distribution in the past several weeks, indicating higher-than-normal market risk. The S&P 500 holds six days of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), while the Nasdaq has four. Given the escalated amount of selling, investors should keep conservative market exposure and focus only on exceptional breakouts.


The April 22 distribution day on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped off due to time. Distribution days older than 25 trading sessions are no longer considered relevant to the current market direction.

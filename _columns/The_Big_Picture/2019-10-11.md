Stock Market Powers Up On Trade Deal, But Gains Fade At The Close; Apple Hits Record
=====================================================================================

The stock market powered higher Friday in heavy volume, but late-day selling removed some of the luster from the day's action. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied as much as 2.1% before trimming those gains after a [partial trade agreement](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-deal-impact-us-economy-dow-jones/) was announced at the end of two days of U.S.-China trade talks.




On Thursday, President Trump [made upbeat comments](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rally-sparked-by-trump-us-china-trade-talk-dow-jones-apple-stock/) regarding the possibility of a potential trade deal with China. On Friday, Trump met with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, resulting in the announcement of the partial trade deal, which could set up a truce in the U.S.-China trade war. Trump said the agreement is a "very substantial phase one" deal.


The Nasdaq composite closed with a 1.3% advance, well off session highs after significant selling hit the stock market near the close. The S&P 500 gained 1.1%, while the Dow Jones industrials closed with a gain of 1.2%, or 319 points. Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 closed with a 1.8% rise. Volume was higher on both exchanges, compared with Thursday's session.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied 1.2%, performing in line with the main indexes. The index of top growth stocks is climbing back toward the 200-day line after spending most of the past month below it.


Trend Remains 'Uptrend Under Pressure'
--------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP101119-261x300.jpg)On Sept. 24, the market stumbled, shifting IBD's market outlook into "uptrend under pressure." On Oct. 3, the major stock indexes found much-needed support around their 200-day moving averages. On Friday, all three major stock indexes made bullish advances past their 50-day moving averages, where there has been substantial resistance. Indexes are just about 3% away from record highs.


Despite the increase in positive action on the major indexes, investors have yet to receive the [all-clear signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to begin buying stocks more heavily. Until the market gives more convincing signals, remain cautious. Continue to monitor stocks with strong relative strength lines and top-notch fundamentals. These could be the next stock market winners in a new rally.


[Earnings season](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-when-to-buy-growth-stocks-earnings/) is once again here. Next week, Dow Jones members **Goldman** **Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) will report their [Q3 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/sp-500-earnings-q3-first-decline-3-years/). Be particularly mindful of buying stocks ahead of earnings releases. On the upside, strong results can send stocks surging, often staging [bullish breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/). On the downside, weaker-than-expected earnings can send shares plunging.

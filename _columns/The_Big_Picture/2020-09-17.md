  Stock Market Falters, As Nasdaq Falls Below Key Level; Apple, Facebook Hobble

The stock market cut into heavy losses Thursday, but the major stock indexes still ended squarely lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off as much as 2.4% before cutting losses in afternoon trade.




The Nasdaq ended 1.3% lower, closing below its key 50-day moving average. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.6%. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Dow Jones industrials traded down 0.5%, or 130 points.


Leading growth stocks also fell sharply, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) declined 1.3%. In the IBD 50, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) tumbled 2.8% and 1.2%, respectively.


Volume was barely higher on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data, and was indicated lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Nasdaq Adds Distribution Day
----------------------------


![MP091720](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP091720.jpg)The Nasdaq fell sharply Thursday in higher volume, adding a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The Nasdaq now has four. The S&P 500 narrowly avoided a new distribution day as volume on the NYSE fell 7% vs. the prior session. That leaves the S&P 500's count at six.


The increase in distribution days, along with two straight days of sharp losses, indicates the market's character remains dangerous. In many cases, these choppy back-and-forth markets are more dangerous than stock market corrections. During corrections, investors remain in cash until follow-through days confirm the start of a new potential uptrend.


After Thursday's loss, the Nasdaq is nearly 10% off its all-time high. The composite closed below its 50-day line, just three days after a brief dip below the line. The Nasdaq is still holding above its recent lows, which were set last Friday.


Wednesday's and Thursday's action underscores that investors should remain cautious until the market trend materially improves.


With the market uptrend still under pressure, investors should be more focused on locking in profits and cutting losses short. Be careful with new buys and take smaller initial positions than normal. The increased risk in the market should give you pause.


**Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) offered an example of this risk. The stock advanced past an 84.10 buy point in a flat base on Tuesday. But shares are now about 2% below the buy point after two days of losses.


When breakouts falter and stock market leaders start to break down below their 50-day support levels, then it's time to get defensive.

Stocks To Watch: Apple, Facebook
--------------------------------


**Activision** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) are among the top stocks that still have good chart patterns.


Video game maker Activision is tracing a flat base that shows an 87.83 buy point, according to a [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares are meeting resistance at their 50-day line.


According to theÂ [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Activision stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-activision-blizzard-inc-atvi.aspx) has a solid 93 out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


Tech giant Apple closed below its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) Thursday for the first time since it was still forming a base in April. If the stock is able to find support and rebound, then a new buying opportunity would emerge.


On the downside, further weakness could lead to a potential defensive sell signal. For now, the volume remains somewhat muted, indicating institutions are not dumping their positions.


Facebook stumbled more than 3% Thursday, becoming the latest FANG stock to give up its 50-day line. Facebook shares are below their key support level for the first time since a July 31 earnings-fueled gap up.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Netflix gave up their 50-day lines last week.

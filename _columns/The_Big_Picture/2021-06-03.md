Stock Market Takes Step Backward As Nasdaq Slides To Key Level; GM Breaks Out
==============================================================================

The stock market ended lower Thursday, as the Nasdaq fell back to a key level. But there were some bright spots as **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) broke out past a new buy point, while **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) followed through on breakouts.




Ahead of the market's open, ADP said private payrolls jumped 978,000 in May, easily topping the 650,000 estimate. The Labor Department will report nonfarm payrolls early Friday.


The Nasdaq handily underperformed, falling more than 1% Thursday, but it ended off session lows. The S&P 500 dropped 0.4%, while the Dow Jones industrials lost 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.8%. Those indexes also closed off session lows.


Leading growth stocks also lagged, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 1.1%. No. 2 [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) tumbled 7.7%, extending volatile trade.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be modestly lower on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP6x4_060321-238x300.jpg)Just one day after [Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/meme-stocks-dominate-action-midcaps-cool-are-these-growth-stocks-the-new-leaders/) noted the falling distribution-day count, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite added a day of institutional selling, moving the total back up to four.


The health of the market trend had been improving, as [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) continued to drop off the count. However, the overall market direction remains opaque. Neither the Dow Jones Industrial Average nor the S&P 500 have managed to reach fresh highs in weeks.


And the Nasdaq is still struggling to add to last week's bullish retake of the 50-day moving average, as it eyes potential resistance around the 14,000 level. The tech-heavy composite was able to halt Thursday's slide around the 50-day line, but there was no decisive sign of support. If the Nasdaq gives up this key level, then further losses could be coming.


Given the tricky environment, investors should maintain a more cautious stance. Continue to build a list of market leaders that are performing well, like General Motors and Ford.

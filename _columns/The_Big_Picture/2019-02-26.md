An ultraquiet session Tuesday for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other key indexes meant that the market continued to preserve fierce gains since a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) took place Jan. 4. In other words, dull action can be good action.




Perhaps a small set of decent reports on the U.S. economy helped keep sellers at bay. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index and a pair of surveys on business and manufacturing activity by Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (on Monday) and Richmond (Tuesday) all handily beat the [Econoday consensus forecasts](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). And the start of a two-day testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to Congress did not seem to offer new news on monetary policy. Powell is slated to talk with the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.


In fact, strength in long-dated U.S. Treasuries reaffirmed long-term confidence in the world's largest economy.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond fell sharply, down 3 basis points to 2.64%. The spread between 3-month T-bills and 10-year bonds continues to narrow, now at 19 basis points with the 3-month bill yielding 2.45%. However, the yield curve is still far from being in an inverted shape.

Some leading stocks showed negative action after running up for more than eight weeks since the Jan. 4 follow-through signaled a key inflection point for stocks was underway.


Take Profits On The Way Up
--------------------------


One only has to look at the sharp drops on Tuesday byÂ **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)), **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) and **Syneos Health** ([SYNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNH)) as a reminder that when you buy a stock, think in advance about the right time to sell.


Overall, though, the market's uptrend remains firmly in place. And Tuesday's relatively dull decline is just the sort of pause that you want to see.


Syneos, a [member of the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), fell 7% to 51.60 in heavy volume on Tuesday. For those who bought at the recent breakout, a drop of more than 7%-8% below the stock's 53.94 buy point would mean it's time to cut it loose. That's the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).



The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials all gave back roughly 0.1%. A midafternoon rally pushed these indexes into mildly positive territory before the sellers dominated in the final 30 minutes of trade.


The Dow Jones transports eased 0.4%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


A New Challenge For The S&P 500: Will 4th Time Be A Charm?
----------------------------------------------------------


At almost 2800, the S&P 500, technically speaking, is now swimming at a level where it has repeatedly gotten caught in a whirlpool of selling.


Let's study the S&P 500-tracking SPDR S&P 500 ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) ETF. SPY rallied to around 280 in three separate occasions: mid-October, early November and early December. Over that period, the exchange traded fund failed to rise past a closing price of 287.40 set on Oct. 9.



The next day, on Oct. 10, the S&P 500 collapsed. It slid 3.3% and the S&P 500 marked only a third distribution day. But at the same time, the Nasdaq notched its seventh day of unusually heavy institutional selling. That same day, IBD changed the market outlook from "Uptrend under pressure" to "Market in correction."


How To Beat The Dow Jones In 2019
---------------------------------


If you wish to outperform indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, you generally must focus on companies that not only have strong growth fundamentals (that is, earnings, sales, the industry's highest profit margins, the best products in the marketplace). But you also need to be willing to buy stocks that have more relative strength than the market itself.


The average RS Rating among the Dow 30 stocks today is a mediocre 65, but 10 names actually score an 80 Relative Strength Rating or higher. They include **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). The median score is 71.


Of course, stocks with big momentum are likely to pull back more violently than you'd like on any given day. **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) just might be the latest fitting example. So, knowing the character of a stock before buying shares is critical. So is buying in disciplined fashion. Never [chase a stock more than 5% past the proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/); this helps control risk. Sell at least some shares when your profit reaches 20% to 25%. And buy a smaller amount of shares in your best gainers only on the first or second pullback and rebound off the 10-week moving average.


These Indexes Lag The Dow Jones
-------------------------------


Small caps had a tougher day. The Russell 2000 fell 0.7%, the S&P SmallCap 600 lost nearly 0.9%. Go to a [MarketSmith daily chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/), and you'll see that both indexes are having a bit of trouble climbing back above the 200-day moving average. The 200-day line is useful for equity indexes in the sense that when you have a confirmed market uptrend, the key bench marks should be rising above it, not bumping their heads against it.


On a positive note, the 200-day moving average of both small-cap gauges appears to have flattened out in recent weeks. No doubt, the medium-term 50-day moving averages have begun to curl higher.


Market internals remain positive. New highs still dominate new lows. Lately, stocks from the Software, Medical and Real Estate sectors have crowded the top of IBD's daily screened [new highs list](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


S&P 500 And Earnings Outlook
----------------------------


With nearly nine out of 10 companies in the S&P 500 having reported Q4 results, portfolio managers will no doubt continue to monitor developments on U.S.-China trade, interest rates and future economic data. Another key input? The pace of earnings for the next two quarters and all of 2019.


Jason Pride, CIO at money manager Glenmede, notes that S&P 500 performance is far superior when the U.S. experiences a so-called "earnings recession" vs. a true economic recession. His firm's research has found that going back to 1926, during an economic recession the large-cap benchmark has generally fallen 5.5% on an average annual basis.


But in periods when earnings fall for two quarters in a row on a year-over-year basis, the S&P 500 has actually risen 15.1% on average "as investors look through the dip in profitability to more prosperous periods in the near future," Pride wrote in a note to clients. He adds that the Street currently projects 4.3% profit growth for the full year, even as the market currently sees a 2.9% dip in profits for the current quarter.


Meanwhile, Ned Davis Research notes that the current rate of companies beating earnings estimates in the latest quarter is below a three-year average. The firm notes this could be good for equities. Why? Ed Clissold and Thanh Nguyen note that since 2012, "the S&P 500 has risen at a faster rate when beat rates have been lower."

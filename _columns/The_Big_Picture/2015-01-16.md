Stock Indexes Find Support, But Situation Still Murky
======================================================

Stock indexes found support at a familiar place Friday, brushing recent lows and then rebounding.

  

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 1.4% and 1.3% respectively. The IBD 50 and the small-cap Russell 2000 led with 1.9% gains, a bullish development.

  

Volume fell on the NYSE and the Nasdaq, despite that Friday was an options expirations day, which can boost trade.

  

The indexes kept to a recent script. Three times in recent weeks, including last week, the Nasdaq has drifted to the 4550-4565 area. The S&P 500's support has been at the 1972-1992 area.

  

On Friday, both indexes touched those levels again and then rose. While it's too early to declare the third test over, the action was encouraging. If the market repeats the pattern, a small advance will follow, culminating in a fresh test of resistance just under 2100 on the S&P 500 and under 4815 on the Nasdaq.

  

If the current uptrend, which is under pressure, is to make progress, those resistance levels will have to be topped. In a similar way, a dive through the recent lows would suggest stocks are in more serious trouble.

  

One concern is the Nasdaq's advance-decline line. Since July, as the Nasdaq made new highs the advance-decline line generally has failed to make new highs. (The NYSE advance-decline line doesn't show this divergence.)

  

Yet a few quality breakouts continue to emerge. On Friday, **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) broke out.

  

How should an IBD-style investor play this murky situation?

  

The answer depends in part on the investor's level of cash. If you are convinced you need to lower exposure, then buying new breakouts should be ruled out. However, other investors might consider their cash pile overdone and risky in the opposite way. If the uptrend regains its stride, you don't want to be chasing breakouts that could be bought now.

  

Also, the pressured uptrend could offer an opportunity to enter stocks that are still in buy range or have returned to one.

  

Possibilities include **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)), **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)).

  

If you do buy something, open with a half position and let the stock's action guide your next step.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 fell 2.1%; the Nasdaq, 1.5%; the S&P 500, 1.2%; and the Russell 2000, 0.8%.

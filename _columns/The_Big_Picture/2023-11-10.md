The stock market signed off on a high note Friday, rallying as it posted its second up week in a row. Investors now will shift attention to a potentially crucial meeting between President Joe Biden and China leader Xi Jinping in the week ahead.




The Nasdaq composite had its best day since May as it jumped 2.1%, pulling away from its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) in the process. The tech-heavy index turned in a solid weekly gain of 2.4% and is now up just shy of 33% for 2023.


The S&P 500 moved further above its own 50-day line as it gained 1.6%. The benchmark index lifted 1.4% for the week and is now up more than 15% for the year.


Advancers outnumbered decliners by nearly 3-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange but by less than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. There were also solid gains for the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) and the First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)), which is heartening.


Stock Market: Dow Extends Above 50-Day
--------------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished well clear of its 50-day line with a 1.2% lift. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) — which closed at a record high — and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were among the strongest performers.


Small caps on the stock market continue to look weak despite the Russell 2000 popping 1.1%. Growth stocks fared a bit better with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 1.5%.


In light of the strong action, IBD is upping its recommended exposure level to 60% to 80%. But take care to increase exposure in a measured fashion, especially as the risk of a market pullback has risen.


Bear in mind, the Nasdaq's advance/decline line has started to trend lower and now sits below the 10-day moving average, not what investors would expect after two weeks of strong gains. Waning breadth is a yellow flag which warrants further caution.


Biden-Xi Meeting, Inflation Data Looms
--------------------------------------


Stocks were strong for most of the week. The only wobble came Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke at the IMF Annual Research Conference in Washington.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP111023.jpg)In another development for stock market watchers, there were more signs of a cooling economy Friday. Consumer sentiment came in at 60.4 for November, below economists' forecast of 63.5.


All eyes will now turn to Wednesday's meeting between President Biden and China's Xi Jinping during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco. This will be only the second time the men have met during Biden's presidency.


Beijing wants assurances the U.S. does not want to decouple from China and does not support Taiwanese independence. It also seeks to avoid a new Cold War.


What Washington Wants
---------------------


For its part, the Biden administration wants to discuss issues such as the Israel-Hamas war. It also hopes to talk about North Korea and Chinese support of Russia in its war with Ukraine.


President Xi also is set to be the guest of honor at a dinner with a slew of American business executives at the summit. Apple, **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are among noteworthy U.S. companies that have operations in China.


Meanwhile, there will also be more inflation data dropping in the coming week. Consumer Price Index data is due Tuesday while the Producer Price Index comes Wednesday. U.S. retail sales data also drops Wednesday while the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey for November is due Thursday.


Finally, earnings season is coming to a close, but the likes of **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and Swiss shoemaker **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) will be on deck.

Resilient. Strong. Still hitting new highs. Scary.


However you want to describe it, the U.S. stock market perhaps is not acting the way that the bears would like on the eve of the 30th anniversary of Black Monday, the 1987 stock market crash.




When small-cap indexes rise faster than their large-cap brethren, Wall Street veterans usually take that as a sign of increasing confidence in the economy. On Wednesday, the S&P SmallCap 600 continued to play catch-up with the large-cap S&P 500. The former rose 0.7% and cracked a five-session losing streak; the latter inched up less than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.


Leading stocks are the ultimate barometer of market health. And as many of the stocks in the IBD 50 are showing, investors are making money by buying the top companies at key buy points — including breakouts and rebounds off the 10-week moving average — as few big winners are showing ridiculously obvious sell signals.


The Dow Jones industrial average carried a 0.7% gain, its biggest since a 1.2% advance on Sept. 11, on the back of a huge gap up by **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)). As noted in a [Stock Market Today column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/small-caps-dow-lead-stocks-apple-acts-right-will-ibm-finally-form-a-base/) earlier in the day, Big Blue may just be on the same path that **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) took prior to its Jan. 6-9 blast of a breakout. That is, Big Blue is trying to turn the corner on its long-term struggle to grow again.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP2x1_101817-174x300.png)The Street is currently forecasting IBM's earnings to pick up 3% in the fourth quarter, which would be the biggest gain in four quarters. Of course, such a gain would not at all meet the C in IBD's [CAN SLIM investment paradigm](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). But a turnaround in profits and sales for IBM would represent another piece of evidence that the global economy is on the right track.


On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 500 points, or 22%. While it's not 100% clear why the crash happened, some market observers have noted that program trading connected the action of index futures with cash equity prices to form a negative feedback loop, creating a free fall.


Others point to a background of rising interest rates around the world and growing concerns of inflation. The U.S. equity market, meanwhile, had perhaps risen too far, too fast. From Jan. 1, 1987, to the year's peak of 2746 on Aug. 25, the Dow 30 had climbed 44.8%.


How many times can you recall a major index rising 44% in less than eight months? Clearly, the market back then was in some form of bubble.


As IBD reported in an [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/could-you-have-spotted-the-1987-stock-market-top-yes-heres-how/) earlier this year, the Dow showed plenty of signs of heavy selling before the excruciating decline began in October of that year. IBD calls those sell-offs "[distribution](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/)," as in days in which savvy fund managers dump tons of stocks and distribute them to the masses.


Fast-forward 30 years to today, and despite a fresh stalling day for the Nasdaq on Wednesday, the distribution count remains low. While the stalling day counts as distribution, it occurred on a day of small changes on the composite. That lessens the importance of the distribution day.


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq was barely higher while the S&P rose 0.1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Meanwhile, a look at the market internals suggests that investors should not fret too much about the tight trading ranges seen by the major indexes in recent weeks. The slow moves, combined with new highs, have helped suck volatility out of index options, as seen by the [CBOE Market Volatility Index](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility).


Market breadth is positive. On the Nasdaq, winners edged losers by a 4-3 ratio. That may help the Nasdaq keep its advance-decline line rising for a ninth straight week.


The new highs list is still robust. (Access the entire list via [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) under Stock Lists at Investors.com). Tuesday's screened list showed just 95 Nasdaq issues making new or all-time highs, vs. anywhere from 197 to 229 over the prior five sessions. Keep an eye on the total, as well as the top sectors making up the list. Lately, Chips, Finance, Insurance, Software, Banks and Medical have dominated.


The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is leading. From Aug. 10 to Oct. 17, the index of premier growth companies is up 12.3%, vs. a 5% gain by the S&P 500.


The S&P SmallCap 600, at 911.56, is up 8.8% for the year, miles behind the S&P 500's 14.4% prance higher. However, small-cap equities had a marvelous 2016, in which the 600 rallied 24.7%. In the slow-growth economy of 2016, that kind of gain seems obscene.

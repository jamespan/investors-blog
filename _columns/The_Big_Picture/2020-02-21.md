The stock market sold off Friday, as another wave of selling hit the major indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dove as much as 2.1% on rising coronavirus fears.




The Nasdaq closed with a 1.8% decline after a modest bounce. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell over 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved down 0.8%, or 227 points. Leading growth stocks were also hit hard; the IBD 50 fell 2%.

Stock Market Notches Distribution Day
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP_3x5_022120-227x300.jpg)The current stock market uptrend encountered a second straight day of selling Friday, following [Thursday's sudden drop](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-recovers-sell-off-four-breakout-stocks-to-watch-dominos-pizza/). The tech-heavy Nasdaq added another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/), as volume slightly increased on the Nasdaq. Volume fell slightly on the NYSE.


Distribution days, or signs of institutional selling, occur when the Nasdaq or S&P 500 fall at least 0.2% on higher volume than the previous session. Many leading stocks fell in heavy volume, casting a cautious shadow on the market action.


So far, the current pullback appears to be relatively normal in the context of the recent sharp uptrend. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both holding above their 21-day moving averages. If that level fails, then further downside could be imminent. For now, the major stock indexes are simply consolidating after a strong rally since Feb. 2. After Friday's drop, the Nasdaq is about 3% off its all-time high (set on Wednesday).


Meanwhile, the CBOE Market Volatility Index (or VIX) spiked more than 20% above its 10-day moving average. A jump of this magnitude can help confirm a low in the market. This [technical sentiment indicator](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) tries to measure the amount of fear in the stock market. Keep in mind the VIX is a secondary indicator, and doesn't supersede the price and volume action of the indexes.


The past two days of sharp losses illustrate the need to constantly be on the lookout for potential profit-taking opportunities. Many leading stocks are well above their [20%-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/).


Top Stocks To Watch: AMD, Nvidia, Domino's Pizza

Many stock market leaders were sharply lower Friday amid the stock market sell-off. [Chip stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) faltered 7% and 4.7%, respectively, in heavy volume.

Meanwhile, one of IBD Leaderboard's new members, **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), held up well Friday, dipping just 0.3% after paring losses. On Thursday, the pizza maker [staged a bullish breakaway gap](http://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-recovers-sell-off-four-breakout-stocks-to-watch-dominos-pizza/) above a [flat base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-growth-stocks-how-to-spot-the-flat-base-amid-long-winding-chart-action/) 299.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The stock's opening price at 362.03 can be used as the correct buy point.

After gapping above its 50-day moving average Friday, the Nasdaq composite snapped a three-session win streak Tuesday, but more growth stocks moved bullishly beneath the surface of the stock market.




The Nasdaq edged lower by 0.1% in higher volume. But a large number of growth stocks in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com) gained well, including **Modine Manufacturing** ([MOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOD)). Modine's cooling solutions are in high demand as heat-producing data centers proliferate around the country.


Modine rallied above a 106.01 buy point in a cup base, but the stock closed just below the entry. MOD still closed near its session high, up 4%.


**Sterling Infrastructure** ([STRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRL)), a member of the red-hot heavy construction group in the building sector, soared out of a nine-week consolidation. Shares jumped nearly 16% and topped a 116.36 buy point. The stock is past the 5% buy zone, but explosive moves like this can often present new buy points. Watch for tight, sideways trading from here. Group peer **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)) joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Monday.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 extended its winning streak to four sessions, rising 0.1% in higher volume. The Russell 2000 led the way, but a midday gain of 0.8% faded to 0.2% by the close.

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) retook its 50-day moving average, rising 0.3%. Meanwhile, the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) rose fractionally and is still below its 50-day line.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also eked out a modest gain of 0.1%. It was a pretty good performance for the blue-chip index in light of a 7% drop for **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)). Disney shares sold off after the company [missed on revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-dow-jones-leader-disney-earnings/) and reported weaker-than-expected subscriber numbers for its Disney+ streaming service.


Decliners had a small edge over advancers on the Nasdaq. The ratio was 5-to-4 positive on the NYSE.

West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $78.38 a barrel, down 0.1%. Oil pared losses on reports that Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said OPEC+ could raise production at its next meeting in early June.


In the exploration and production group, **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) continues to hold nicely at its 10-week moving average. It's the first test of the support level for Diamondback, which cleared a flat base with conviction on Feb. 15.


In the oil transport and pipeline group, **Western Midstream Partners** ([WES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WES)) is trading tightly above its 10-week moving average with earnings due Wednesday after the close.


Also in the oil and gas sector, fast-growing **TechnipFMC** ([FTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTI)) is close to completing a flat base as it holds support at the 10-week moving average.


The 10-Year Yield Eases
-----------------------


Falling interest rates once again brought buyers into the stock market. The 10-year Treasury yield lost ground for the seventh time in eight sessions. Late Tuesday, the yield was trading around 4.45%, down nearly 4 basis points. The yield plunged 17 basis points last week after the [April jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-april-unemployment-rate-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/) came in weaker than expected. The 10-year yield looks poised for a test of the 50-day moving average, currently around 4.39%.


The stock market is still grappling with how many times the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. At one point Tuesday, [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) put the chances at 65% that the first rate cut would come at the September meeting. There's a 57% chance of one more quarter-point rate cut after that before the end of the year. If it holds, that would lower the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5% from its current level of 5.25% to 5.5%.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


Several growth stocks outperformed again Tuesday, leaving stock market bulls feeling pretty good about the nascent rally. IBD raised its invested allocation to 40%-60% Friday after the Nasdaq composite rallied 2% in lower volume for the second Friday in a row.


That said, the index still hasn't confirmed a new uptrend with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-how-to-invest-using-follow-through-days/). Tuesday marked the 12th day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


The good news is that growth stocks are acting a lot better. Besides Sterling Infrastructure, more breakouts emerged.


After a bullish reversal Monday, **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) soared past a 25.16 entry, rising nearly 6% in strong volume. Even though SBLK is still in the 5% buy zone, it's also 10% above its 50-day line. An orderly, low-volume pullback from here could give another entry. Star Bulk is today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dividend-stock-star-bulk-carriers-stock-breaks-out-earnings/).


It's OK to proceed with some new buys, but keep position sizes small to start and wait for positive feedback. Are new buys making progress or not? If they're not, there's no need to be aggressive.


For perspective, the Leaderboard model portfolio is about 48% invested. Out of our four adds since April 30, we're profitable on three of them. The only one slightly underwater is **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)). But after rising 4.3% Monday and 1.5% Tuesday, it's on breakout watch again and less than 3% off its high.


Recent breakouts are also holding well, too. Small-cap **Alkami Technology** ([ALKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALKT)) soared last week after the earnings report. ALKT is still in the 5% buy zone after buyers came in and lifted the stock off lows Monday.

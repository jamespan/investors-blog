A wave of selling hit the stock market on the first day of trading in September as concerns about a slowdown for the U.S. economy went back on the front burner.




Investors bought bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by seven basis points to around 3.84%. At 10 a.m. ET, the ISM Manufacturing index came in at 47.2, above July's reading of 46.8 but slightly below the 47.5 consensus estimate. Readings below 50 signify contraction. Indexes extended losses when the report was released.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Russell 2000 small-cap index and the Nasdaq composite fared the worst with losses of 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively. Volume on the Nasdaq exchange rose from Friday, giving the index its fourth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) since Aug. 22. Of those four days, three showed declines of at least 1.1%.

For the Nasdaq, it was the worst start to a month since May 2020, when the index fell 3.2%. It was also the worst first session of September since 2002, when it fell 3.9%.


Due to the Nasdaq's weak price action, IBD lowered the recommended invested percentage to 40% to 60% from 60% to 80%.


That means it's time to trim some holdings by taking partial profits in some of your winners. You could even take full profits in some stocks that are up at least 20% from your purchase price.


And don't be afraid to cut your weakest performers, even if they haven't trigged the [7% loss-cutting rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


The Nasdaq 100 fell just over 3% in the stock market today, weighed down by a 9.5% drop for **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). Nvidia shares slumped nearly 8% last week despite another strong [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-fiscal-q2-2025-earnings-nvda-stock/). Wall Street most likely wanted a bigger beat-and-raise quarter.


Declining stocks beat advancers on the Nasdaq by nearly 4-to-1. Besides Nvidia, several other chip stocks came under heavy selling in Nasdaq 100. **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)), **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) ended with losses ranging from 7% to 9.5%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) cratered 7.5%.


According to Dow Jones data, Nvidia lost $278.9 billion in market capitalization today. It was the largest one-day market-cap loss for any U.S. company on record, surpassing the record **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) set in 2022.


Nvidia remains a large position in the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio after first joining the Leaders list in February 2023. We currently have the position hedged with the Tradr 1.5x Short NVDA Daily ETF ([NVDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDS)).


The S&P 500 swooned 2.1% and could be poised for a test of the 5500 level, which happens to correspond to the index's 50-day moving average. Volume fell on the NYSE, so the S&P 500 avoided a distribution day. Losers beat winners on the NYSE by nearly 3-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5% and looks poised for a test of its 21-day moving average. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) lagged in the blue-chip index with losses of 7%-9%.


Copper And Oil Down
-------------------


Copper producer **Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500, down 6.6%. IBD's Mining-Metal Ores was among the top-10 worst performing groups, with a decline of around 6%.


Copper was down 3% near the stock market close, while West Texas intermediate crude oil futures gave back more than 4% to just over $70 a barrel.


Federal funds futures traders at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) are still favoring a quarter-point interest rate cut at this month's meeting, with a smaller 34% chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Futures traders think there's a 73% chance of 100 basis points in cuts over the Federal Reserve's remaining three meetings. So that implies a 50-basis-point cut at one of the meetings.


The next big economic report comes Friday with the release of the August jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to be up 160,000 after the economy created a paltry 114,000 jobs in July, well below expectations of 180,000. Based on the stock market's performance Tuesday, Wall Street doesn't want to see a second straight month of weak job growth.


Argentina bank **Banco Macro** ([BMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMA)) performed well in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), up around 3%. It's still trying to clear a cup-with-handle base with a 60.51 buy point.


Leaderboard stock **Freshpet** ([FRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRPT)) outperformed in the stock market early, but a 5.2% afternoon gain faded to less than 1% by the close. Freshpet is today's [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/freshpet-stock-rallies-above-buy-point/).

Stocks Today Close Mixed After Federal Reserve Pauses On Rate Hikes; Why The Nasdaq Could Keep Rising
======================================================================================================

[Stocks today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) showed seesaw action, but ultimately the decision by the Federal Reserve to skip an increase in the cost of money turned into another small victory for tech stocks and a loss for smaller issues.




While the Nasdaq composite closed roughly 0.4% higher, the S&P 500 barely nosed into higher ground, up less than 0.1%.


However, the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average sank nearly 0.7%. A lot of that had to do with a warning from one of its most expensive components (at least on a per-share basis), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)).


The [managed health care behemoth warned](https://www.investors.com/news/unitedhealth-bad-news-hits-unh-stock-insurers-but-sparks-surgery-partners-breakout/) that with more customers deciding to get elective medical procedures, the company's medical cost ratio — a measure of expenses as a ratio of premiums received — is going up. This pinches profits.


The news spurred buying in select medical product makers, including [recent IBD Stock Of The Day profile](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/swav-stock-eyes-another-breakout-and-big-growth-on-a-bevy-of-good-news/) **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)) and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), the leader in transcatheter aortic valve replacement technologies.



UnitedHealth's 31-point drop proved head-and-shoulders above the declines of the other Dow Jones components. At least six more Dow members fell 1 point or more, offset by a surprising 6-point jump by athletic apparel and shoe giant **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)). Nike is struggling to find its own footing, still deep in the weeds in forming a [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


Small Caps Fare The Worst
-------------------------


Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 endured the heaviest hit of the day, losing almost 1.2%. SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) fell almost 0.6%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP061423_2-209x300.jpg)Volume edged higher on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and fell slightly on the NYSE.


Another reason why Wednesday's session proved bullish for the S&P 500? The strength of its advance on Wednesday eliminated the May 31 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) from its 25-session count. Why? At Wednesday's high of 4391, the index rose 5% from the May 31 session's close.


That action implies fund managers have since taken advantage of the dip in prices to load up more on stocks.


As the accompanying Market Pulse table shows, the extent of intense professional selling in stocks today seems to indicate that the bull market still has legs.


Indeed, heading into Wednesday's pivotal session, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have shown plenty of clues that equity funds are accumulating shares in stocks today, not dumping them.


More Accumulation, Less Distribution
------------------------------------


While both showed an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) of B+, the daily charts of these key indexes highlight a sparser population of big declines in heavy or increasing volume.


That's exactly what you want to see in a bull market. (Please track the Accumulation Rating for both indexes as well as the Dow industrials on the General Market Indicators PDF page, found as a link at the bottom of every Big Picture column, or on the [Market Trend landing page](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).)

Breadth Improves Among Stocks Today
-----------------------------------


Also, more stocks today are joining the advancing side, not the declining side.


According to MarketSmith's daily chart indicators page —found under the symbol GMIAB — the Nasdaq's advance-decline line is showing a bullish upward slope over the past two weeks that really hasn't been seen since the strong rebound in January to early February. A new feature on MarketSmith, the advance-decline line now shows a 10-day moving average. See the NYSE's equivalent by punching in "GMIAA" on the daily chart.


This 10-day moving average reveals a notable rise in its slope for the first time in more than four months.


Fed Chief Powell's Points
-------------------------


The morning rise in stocks Wednesday got interrupted by a quick sell-off that began at 2 p.m. ET. The U.S. central bank announced at that time that, after 10 rounds of interest rate hikes worth a total 500 basis points, it would keep the fed funds rate at a target range of 5%-5.25%.


[The far majority of Federal Reserve governors](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-shock-two-more-rate-hikes-seen-sp-500-falls/) also indicated in the bank's SEP (Summary of Economic Projections) that it's quite likely that at least two more quarter-point rate hikes are in the cards.


So, why did stocks today get back some of their footing by the close?


During the news conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell emphatically noted that the meeting did not make any conclusion about what it would do at its next meeting in July. Powell anticipates it will be a "live meeting," perhaps meaning that members of the FOMC interest rate policy committee will actively debate whether or not it's justified to keep raising rates.


For sure, the committee as a whole sees that the challenge of reeling back prices to rise at a long-term rate of 2% will take time, possibly until 2025. Meanwhile, the Fed's median projection for 2023 core inflation went up to 3.9% from 3.6% in March. So did its estimate for U.S. GDP, which is now expected to edge up 1% from a 0.4% increase this year.


Thus, short-term rates will remain high, making the Treasury yield curve stubbornly inverted. That's not good for banks. SPDR Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)), a popular exchange traded fund, slumped 2.9%. That marked its biggest single-session loss since May 4. KRE's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) is still a miserable 14 on a 12-month basis, and a much better yet still mediocre 68 on a three-month basis, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).

Long-Dated Bonds Rise On Fed News
---------------------------------


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond swung from a session high of 3.85% to 3.79%, down 4 basis points.


However, Powell made a strong case during the news conference that the Fed is making the right decision in not only reducing the size of its interest rate hikes — from bursts of 75 basis points at a time early in 2022, to 50-basis-point jumps later that year — but also in slowing the pace of its future hikes.


"The question of speed is different from the question of what level" in which to raise interest rates, Powell noted.


Some market observers appeared to agree with the decision.


"Job openings are on a moderating path, average hourly earnings are trending down and the composition of the CPI inflation report for May is encouraging," Whitney Watson, global co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, wrote in comments sent to IBD.


Watson added that the upside surprise in May's core consumer prices index was driven by used-car prices. But "the Manheim index, a timely measure of the outlook for used-car prices, points to a moderation ahead."


Beyond Stocks Today: Why Fed News Benefits The Nasdaq
-----------------------------------------------------


Since the Nasdaq contains more leading tech companies, a slowdown in the rise of and eventual peak in interest rates may prove a tailwind for these reasons:


1. Tech firms can more easily buy back shares, boosting earnings and shareholder value.
2. It will be less costly to invest in R&D and make strategic acquisitions.
3. Stable interest rates reduce uncertainty regarding future economic and customer demand.


Meanwhile, producer-level prices dropped 0.3% in May vs. the prior month, a much larger drop than a 0.1% dip expected by [Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Year over year, the Producer Price Index rose just 1.1% year over year, also sharply below the consensus view.


Padhraic Garvey, head of global debt and rates strategy at the Dutch financial giant ING, argued that a "one-meeting pause makes little sense given the long lags involved with monetary policy. With the disinflationary trend set to accelerate, we see an extended pause (in raising rates further)."

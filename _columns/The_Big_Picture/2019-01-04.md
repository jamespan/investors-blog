Stocks once again proved they have a mind of their own, as stock indexes Friday delivered lion-size gains.




The Nasdaq and the small cap S&P 600 spurted 4.3% and 3.5% respectively. Large caps as gauged in the S&P 500 advanced 3.4%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.3%.


Volume was higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.


The day's action on the S&P 500 constituted a Day 7 follow-through day, confirming an uptrend is underway.

News was the session's chief catalyst.


Shocker On Payrolls
-------------------


Unlike recent news that have had a stale and repetitive quality, Friday's nonfarm payrolls report was like a new and undeniable blast.


Payrolls rocketed to 312,000 â€” above any estimate from the Street and 73% above the consensus estimate. Manufacturing payrolls increased 32,000 vs. the consensus view for 19,000.


Pessimists were stymied, unable to adjust the focus to the negative blur they prefer.


They took a beating but not just from the payroll data.


In a speech in Atlanta, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said the Fed was ready "to adjust policy quickly and flexibly" if needed.


This is exactly what the Street had been clamoring for.


What If Fed Is Right?
---------------------


Yet in another sense, the payroll data reinforced a contrarian thought. What if Powell and the Fed are right?


Recently stock analysts have pushed the notion that the Fed is out of touch. On Friday, it appeared the analysts were the ones out of touch.


To be charitable, analysts had every reason to be confused. The old Wall Street saying, "Don't fight the Fed" was clashing with another old saying, "Don't fight the market."


At least for now, it appears that the Fed won the latest round, and the market switched sides.


Bullish Factor
--------------


A convincing bullish factor is the recent performance of stocks. Since the indexes' Christmas Eve closing low, many stocks have advanced.


For instance, a scan of [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) shows that 196 are up since Christmas Eve. The one exception is Media-Periodicals, down 1%.


If that continues, bulls are looking at a dart-thrower's market.


This Growth ETF Shows New Life
------------------------------


One drawback is the lack of breakouts. As long as breakouts are scarce, growth investors don't have much to go on.


Exchange traded funds are one possibility. The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is up 8% since Christmas Eve.

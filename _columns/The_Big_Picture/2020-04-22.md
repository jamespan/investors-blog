Nasdaq Rips Up 2.8%, Retakes Bulk Of Tuesday Losses; 7 Reasons To Go Stock Fishing Now
=======================================================================================

Up 1.7%. Up another 1.4%. Then down 1%, down 3.5%. And Wednesday? Back up in a big way, a 2.8% roll higher.




Close watchers of the Nasdaq composite may quickly recognize this is the Nasdaq's daily change over the past five sessions. Two steps forward, two steps back, right?


Look at a [daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) at Investors.com or at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). Does the color pattern of the red and blue price bars remind you of those old-school barber shop poles?


Certainly, a market skeptic may think stock charts and [bullish chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) provide neither rhyme nor reason. But true students of Wall Street would beg to differ.


An Authentic Trading Rally For Nasdaq Growth Stocks
---------------------------------------------------


Since the Nasdaq's [follow-through on April 6](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-multiple-positive-signals-but-short-one-ingredient/), the 9.7% advance simply cannot be dismissed.



Suppose you bought shares of Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which follows the Nasdaq 100, at the end of that important day. You've got a nifty short-term gain. And a leveraged exchange traded fund would make that paper profit big enough to even conclude it's time to [sell on the upside](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/)Â and snatch a short-term profit.


After all, the U.S. economy has, by most folks' accounts, already gone into recession. The global economy is going to throw out some horrible numbers this year. Will the stock market show a truly V-shaped recovery? Or will it be U-shaped? Some have ventured to predict it will look the symbol for a square root: a V, followed by a long horizontal line.


Nobody knows. So, taking some short-term profits seems quite sensible right now.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP042219-260x300.jpg)No doubt, few stocks have risen 20% or more in three weeks or less since the current market bottom. When this happens, the [eight-week hold rule locks in](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/). Why? This [William O'Neil-inspired rule](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) gives your stock a chance to prove itself. Can it be The One?


The S&P 500 followed the Nasdaq's lead on Wednesday. Its 2.3% rise certainly lagged. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, oil and gas, chip, restaurant, mining and software companies helped the cause. But drops of 1% or more, on a price-weighted basis, among department store, airline, movie, steel, hospital, mortgage REIT, airfreight, radio and TV media and jewelry retail companies hurt the large-cap benchmark's performance. (See the full list of 197 industries tracked by IBD, updated around 7 p.m. ET, at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


In the long run, large institutions look at various financial instruments as if they are buckets. Right now, which bucket is going to produce a reasonable return in the next three, five or 10 years?


Compared with the puny 0.6% yield of U.S. Treasury 10-year bonds, U.S. equities have to look more appetizing. Yes, S&P 500 earnings are going to take a big hit this year. But Wall Street estimates also point to a lively recovery of profit growth in 2021. This means the earnings yield for U.S. large-cap stocks still sharply outweighs the yield of long-dated Treasuries.


What about the active trader who is seeking to overcome fear of entering the market waters now and hook a positive return this year? Here are seven points to consider.


Seven Reasons To Go Stock Fishing
---------------------------------


1. Leading stocks are doing even better than the major indexes. [On Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), more than a handful of companies beat the Nasdaq's gain Wednesday. Breakouts are taking place. Not all have hit new highs yet. So if that happens, it's another tell that institutions are putting more capital to work.
2. The leading sectors in the market are chock-full of strong growth companies. Today, one could arguably consider gold miners as a growth sector simply because gold prices are roaring. **Franco-Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)), a mining royalty stream play, is making progress since it boosted past a 122.75 buy point. The Street expects earnings to rise 21% to $2.22 a share this year.
3. On the Nasdaq, winners topped losers by a more than 2-1 ratio. The composite's advance-decline line continues to trend higher since mid-March. More stocks rising than falling gives IBD readers more opportunities to spot new breakouts.
4. The market has not been falling as hard as it did in February and March on negative headlines. Some market observers criticize the new $484 billion Congress rescue package as not enough to save the economy. Others question whether the economy will open up quickly enough to stave off another economic depression. But for now, the market is showing signs of climbing this new wall of worry.
5. Crude oil is rebounding. This is vital for employment in states that rely on the energy sector for jobs. At the same time, low prices ultimately will help consumers.
6. More stocks, such as those in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/), [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) and [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), are constructing the right side of new bases. [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) is highlighting companies with rising relative strength and trading near [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).
7. [Bullishness among market pundits](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) is rebounding, but remains far from dangerously giddy levels. In the past few years, a jump in bullish ratio to 60% in the [weekly Investors Intelligence survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) seemed to trigger a healthy pullback at the minimum. Sometimes, that pullback morphed into an intermediate correction or more. On Wednesday, the bulls ratio hit 43.3% vs. 30.8% for the bears and 25.9% for pundits expecting an intermediate correction.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF jumped nearly 3.2% on Wednesday. While it's still lagging the Nasdaq and traversing the south side of its 50-day moving average, it's also rallied in seven of the past 10 sessions.

The stock market rally found another gear Friday as major stock indexes closed near session highs for the fourth straight session.




But the Nasdaq's outperformance wasn't fueled by technology stocks breaking out of bases. Instead, it was mostly beaten-down software stocks and other former leaders from last year rallying off lows after sharp sell-offs. Nonetheless, the Nasdaq composite followed through on the fourth day of its rally attempt, rising 2% in higher volume.


Utilities, energy and financial stocks generally lagged, but there was plenty of bullish action elsewhere.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) broke out over a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/), closing just below its Feb. 17 high of 133.87. For the week, ANET stock jumped more than 9%.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) also had a good week with a nice bounceÂ  off its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/). The security software leader moved powerfully over a trendline on Feb. 24 before a breakout over a 572.77 buy point. The breakout didn't get far due to weakness in the broad market, but notice how the stock pulled back and quickly found support. The stock's weekly chart still has a bullish look as it gets into position for another breakout try.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP031822-300x261.jpg)Options and futures expired Friday, which gave volume a boost. For the week, the Nasdaq jumped 8%, its best weekly gain since early November 2020. Advancing stocks beat decliners on the Nasdaq by just over 2-to-1.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500, which confirmed a new uptrend Wednesday with a follow-through day, added 1.2% Friday. The benchmark index closed just below its 200-day moving average, just like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rallied 0.8%. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by about 3-to-1. All three indexes still have [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) to work through, but clearly the stock market is acting a lot better.


Headline flow has been volatile lately when it comes to the Russia-Ukraine war, interest rates and the health of the U.S. economy. But stock market rallies can happen when headlines are the most negative.


Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cited a strong U.S. economy earlier in the week when the Fed raised the federal funds rate for the first time since late 2018. But the bond market still seems concerned about a sharper-than-expected slowdown for the U.S. economy amid a flattening yield curve and stubbornly high inflation.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added more than 1% and closed above its 50-day moving average for the first time since November.



Top gainers in the IBD 50 included miner **MP Materials** ([MP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MP)), which surged 7% in heavy volume. It's trying to clear a choppy [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a 47.40 entry.


Chip-equipment firm **Axcelis Technologies** ([ACLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACLS)) topped a 75.10 buy point and soared 27% for the week.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) broke out of its downtrend with a bullish move above the 50-day line. Shares jumped nearly 7% ahead of the company's [Investor Day](https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/events-and-presentations/event-details/2022/NVIDIA-Annual-Investor-Day/default.aspx) on Tuesday.

Stocks showed more holiday cheer Wednesday. The S&P 500 marched to a new closing high and small-cap stocks rose higher than their large-cap brethren.

  

Volume remained light and was lower on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.

  

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both rose 0.4%. The former hasn't quite recouped all of Monday's sharp loss, but is coming close to doing so. The tech-heavy composite index is also within arm's length of taking out its recent high of 4810.

  

The small-cap S&P 600, meanwhile, advanced 1%.

  

The Russell 2000, another key benchmark of stocks with a market value of $2 billion or less, gained 0.9%.

  

The S&P 600 chart is not on the IBD markets page, but it's worth studying. Go back as far as February, and you'll see this index has failed more than half a dozen times in cracking the 680-to-690 price level and pushing higher. Why?

  

Each Wall Street strategist may give you a unique reason. But make no mistake: The action is not abnormal, considering the scorching hot year that stocks had in 2013. That year the S&P 600 rallied 39.7%. Perhaps small caps simply need more time to digest such a wonderful gain.

  

The fate of small caps also lies somewhat in the opinion of the general economy by institutional money managers. If the economy is likely to soften, the big money tends to sell off shares of smaller companies first. They might have weaker fundamentals or a shorter record of stable profits and sales.

  

Today, the U.S. economy is giving more signs of warming up.

  

The November private sector jobs report by ADP notched another month of 200,000-plus job growth.

  

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's beige book gave multiple reasons to cheer. In the summary, the Fed noted that consumer spending "continued to advance" in most of its reporting districts; that tourism trends were mostly positive; and that employment gains "were widespread."

  

Looking beneath the market's hood, the technicals remain fine. More stocks continue to rise than fall. Thus, the NYSE advance-decline line still slopes up.

  

Among the top 25 industry groups, the generic drug, medical systems, gaming software, security software and tech services stocks marked gains of 0.8% or more.

  

Wednesday's IBD 50 showed a solid number of stocks forming bases, too. Should the major indexes keep scaling new highs, expect new breakouts to emerge, ideally in boisterous volume.

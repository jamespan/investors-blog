title: Stocks Surge On Tariff Relief, Making A Bullish Shift In Market Outlook

The stock market rallied Tuesday after China and the U.S. stepped away from the brink of a trade war, causing a bullish shift in the market's outlook.




The Nasdaq surged 2.1% and the S&P 500 1.7%. Volume rose from Monday's levels. Big gains in higher volume marked a follow-through day for stocks, a confirmation of a rally attempt that began a week ago. The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 1.9%.


A follow-through is a bottoming signal, which means IBD's market outlook has changed to confirmed uptrend. It ends a market correction that IBD signaled on March 27, although the indexes peaked March 13. Investors should regard Tuesday's signal as a time to start getting back into stocks, specifically fundamentally sound companies that are in proper buy areas.


Even with a bullish signal at their back, investors need to be cautious as they increase exposure. While the indexes more than satisfied the technical requirements for a follow-through, the market remains volatile and sensitive to headlines.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP041018-275x300.png)Tuesday's powerful move was masked amid the higher volatility. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 printed price bars that were actually smaller than several others in the past many days.


The Nasdaq composite is emerging from a price range that formed over two weeks as it shaped its bottom. It topped its prior high of April 5 but closed below it. Watch for the index to close above that 7112 high as a further sign that the rally is expanding. The March 27 high at 7120 serves as a similar guidepost. Also look for the S&P 500 to make decisive gains above its own March 27 and April 5 highs.


There weren't so many breakouts among top-rated stocks, despite the big index gains.


Wall Street's preoccupation with headlines was evident Tuesday after a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi said China will seek to boost imports and take other steps to bolster international trade and China's financial markets.


It [wasn't a big change from earlier comments China has made](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-xi-only-gave-trump-crumbs/), but investors took it as a significant step toward peace on the tariff dispute with the U.S.


President Trump welcomed Xi's remarks in a Twitter post.


Xi singled out the auto industry, promising "significantly lower" tariffs on auto imports. Automakers were the day's third-best performing industry group, up nearly 5%. **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) rose 3%, **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) 2% and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) 5%.

The energy sector led as [the price of U.S. crude climbed more than 3%](http://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/delayed-quotes/energy.html) to $65.57 a barrel on easing trade worries. Two breakouts came from that sector.


**ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) broke out of a cup-without-handle base in active trading. It closed in buy range from the 61.41 buy point. JPMorgan raised the target price on ConocoPhillips to 64 from 62 and maintained an overweight rating, Dow Jones reported.


**Plains GP Holdings** ([PAGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGP)), a pipeline operator, cleared the 24.52 buy point of a base buried within a much larger consolidation.


The technology-heavy Nasdaq got some help from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). The stock climbed 4.5% in heavy trading as [CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave testimony](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-hearings-stock/) in Congress on the Cambridge Analytica data breach.


[Chip stocks rallied](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-rally-nvidia-micron/).

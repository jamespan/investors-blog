  Indexes Close Little Changed; Is Stock Market Stalling Or Gearing Up For More Gains?

The stock market capped a three-week sprint with a third straight day of mild index moves. In the context of the market's fast rebound this month, that can be encouraging.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 edged up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 2 points.


The stock market's November rally is already the best since the pandemic bear market's low. The Nasdaq just logged its largest three-week advance since April of 2020. For the S&P 500, it's the best three-week stretch since May-June 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


After such a fast pace, Friday marked the third straight day of moves of less than 0.2% in the Nasdaq or S&P. The Dow also was muted the past couple of days, after a 0.5% gain Wednesday. Indeed, most of the stock market's gains the past week came in a single day: Indexes gapped up Tuesday after mild inflation data cut the odds for higher interest rates.


One take-away from the week's stock market is that investors are ignoring opportunities to take profits, and buyers remain committed. Meanwhile, a widening swathe of stocks — not just the Magnificent Seven — are propelling the market.


Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) is keeping up with the market-cap weighted S&P 500. Both are up more than 7% in November. The equal-weight index, however, is testing resistance at the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/).

The latter is up about 10% in November, the ETF is up nearly 9%.


Also important, dozens of stocks have topped [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/), offering investors plenty with which to increase exposure. [MarketSmith](https://get.investors.com/marketsmith/)'s list of recent [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) has swelled to more than 90 stocks, and about three-quarters remain above buy points.


Stock Market Extended?
----------------------


But by some measures, indexes are extended and could use a cooling off. This, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 test their August-to-September highs and the Dow tests the 35,000 level. Although it's rebounded this month, the Nasdaq advance-decline line still lags the index itself. (The gap is narrower in the NYSE's A/D line.)


IBD currently recommends an exposure level of 80% to 100%. After the [Nov. 1 Nasdaq follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-marks-this-bullish-shift-after-fed-chief-powells-decision-to-leave-rates-unchanged/), IBD urged investors to start buying modestly. The exposure level has climbed as the stock market expands its uptrend.


While the major indexes have been calm, small caps are acting just the opposite. The Russell 2000 jumped 5.4% Tuesday, fell 1.5% Thursday and bounced nearly 1.4% Friday. In between, the index met up against resistance at the 200-day moving average in a reversal Wednesday.


The IBD 50 index climbed 3.4% for the week, getting most of that with Tuesday's 2.8% gain.


Fresh Housing Data
------------------


In a quiet day for economic reports, housing market data was cheery Friday. October housing starts rose 1.9% to 1.372 million annualized, the second straight monthly increase. Building permits climbed 1.1% to 1.487 million at an annualized rate.


"Housing starts and building permits both surprisingly climbed in October, suggesting builders may be benefiting from lack of supply in the resale market," Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. "Looking ahead, however, homebuilding activity is unlikely to gain significant traction amid an expected stall in the economy early next year."


IShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) rose 0.7%. Construction is one area to watch in the stock market, with **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), **M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) and others breaking out during the week.

Stocks ended 2014 on a glum note, losing ground and unable to shake the queasy labels that have stuck to the market in the past three weeks.


The Nasdaq dropped 0.9% Wednesday, while the S&P 500 lost 1%. The IBD 50 fell 0.7%.


Volume rose across the board.


The day's action constituted a distribution day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Since Dec. 10, the market has toggled from under pressure to correction to under pressure. During this period, the small-cap Russell 2000 has outperformed the major indexes, inching up 2% vs. a 1% loss for the Nasdaq and a flat performance for the S&P 500.


These narrow differences and the short time since the 10th are too little to draw conclusions, but small caps are worth watching. They're generally considered more aggressive instruments.


While stocks can still be bought during an uptrend under pressure, four factors are making the "pressure" part of that label more convincing than the "uptrend."


•First, the distribution day count is heavy. Stocks don't have a wide margin for error.


•Second, breakouts dried up in December. Among stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or better, the month provided the fewest breakouts since April.


That fact, though, doesn't necessarily have any predictive power. After April's low tally of breakouts, the Nasdaq began rising in mid-May, gaining 10% in about seven weeks.


•Third, sector leadership has shifted to a more defensive tone. As of Wednesday's IBD, the top 10 sectors included Miscellaneous (which is mostly diversified stocks), Utility, Alcohol/Tobacco and Food/Beverage.


These are areas where funds sometimes seek shelter. Bulls like to see defensive sectors tucked low among the market's 33 sectors. Bulls want leadership to come from sectors with more innovative and dynamic potential.


•Fourth, the indexes have been notching new highs in an almost accidental fashion. Volume has been weak, and charts are lacking confident, upward strokes.


It's human nature to look at all this data and feel that the next move in the market will be down. But human feelings do no better than a coin flip in predicting the future.


The four points above pertain to current conditions, which means that individual investors should adopt a cautious stance but remain flexible.


Success in the stock market comes from adjusting your strategy to the current reality, not from guessing the future.


Economic news was mixed Wednesday. Pending home sales were stronger than expected, but jobless claims data and the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index missed estimates.

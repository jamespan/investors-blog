Trouble persisted in the stock market Wednesday, as the Nasdaq's pullback reached 5% since its April high and a test shaped up for the S&P 500.


The Nasdaq chopped off 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each lost 0.6%. The IBD 50 fell 0.6% as well. Volume fell on the NYSE but rose on the Nasdaq.


![MP_050416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP_050416-177x300.jpg)That gave the Nasdaq a ninth distribution day in the past few weeks -- a worrisome number.


Individual investors are probably wise to back off exposure to stocks, unless they find a stock that inspires supreme conviction.


What stock might that be?


Many bulls suspect **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) might be that stock. Amazon delivered a 118% gain last year and has risen more than 40% since its February low.


In terms of fundamentals, the company delivered strong earnings and revenue gains in recent quarters. Earnings are expected to jump 330% this year, an upward revision. Revenue is pegged at 25% growth. Annual revenue has checked in at 20% or better growth for 14 consecutive years.


Still, hasn't that been Amazon's stories for years -- strong sales combined with spotty profits? Well, yes, but experienced investors have seen that before, too. In 2004, just as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) began its fantastic run, the skeptics said that Apple was a company with a talent for screwing up. Apple, though, was changing.


What's happening at Amazon that could help it break free from its half-a-loaf reputation?


One new factor working in its favor is Amazon's cloud computing division, which grew revenue by 64% in Q1. Profit margin in Q1 for the cloud segment more than doubled to 23.5%. At this point, the cloud division accounts for only about 9% of consolidated net sales. However, two years ago, cloud was only 5% of consolidated net sales.


Drawbacks for Amazon include low margins overall and a low return on equity. Also, the current base is third stage. A third-stage base is more likely to fail than a first- or second-stage pattern.


On Wednesday, Amazon edged down less than 0.1% in moderate volume.


Even if Amazon's overall picture is bullish, the stock market is providing headwinds. And that's a problem for all stocks.


Where should investors look for clues to the market's next move?


The Nasdaq remains stuck under its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. That battle to hold above those levels appears lost for now, but the individual investor should watch to see if the Nasdaq can retake the lines.


In a more immediate sense, the S&P 500 is the index to watch. The S&P 500 is testing its 10-week line now and is coming close to the 50-day line. If the S&P 500 can bounce off those lines, then there's a chance the rest of the market will follow. If support collapses, things could get ugly.


Another item to keep an eye on is the put-call volume ratio. On Wednesday, the put-call ratio closed at 1.11, the highest since March 8's 1.21 reading. The put-call is a fear gauge with a contrarian bent. A high reading is considered bullish. After hitting 1.21 in March, the indexes rose about 7%.

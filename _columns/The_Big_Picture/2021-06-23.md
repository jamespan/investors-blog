Late Drop Leaves Stock Market Little Changed As One Sector Makes Some Noise
============================================================================

The air went out of the stock market late Wednesday, as indexes slid in the final half-hour to reduce or erase the day's gains.




It's not that there was much air in the market to begin with. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose no more than 0.5% in the first hour of trading, when indexes saw the day's best results. From then on, indexes held in a narrow price range, until the late swoon.


It wasn't clear what triggered the selling, but it was about the time that news emerged that [Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Congress of "catastrophic" consequences for the U.S. economy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/janet-yellen-says-u-s-could-breach-debt-limit-deadline-in-august-if-congress-doesnt-act-11624477388?mod=searchresults_pos2&page=1) if the U.S. debt limit is not raised or suspended. Yellen, testifying before a Senate panel, said Congress needs to raise the limit as soon as possible. Without raising the limit, the U.S. faces a default in August.


Wednesday's close showed the stock market is still tentative, even though the Nasdaq made record highs Tuesday and again Wednesday. But while there wasn't much follow-on buying Wednesday, indexes did not give up much ground at all. Indexes are testing monthslong resistance levels, and it could be a tough fight to shove sellers out of the way.


Stock Market Outlook Improved
-----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP_3x3_062321-248x300.jpg)On Tuesday, [IBD improved its market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-bullish-step-why-one-money-manager-sees-sp-500-hitting-5000-in-2022/) to "confirmed uptrend" after the Nasdaq hit record highs. Investors should seek higher exposure to stocks or ETFs, moving in measured steps to avoid sticking their heads out too far.


The Nasdaq closed 0.1% higher, as volume finished slightly lower from Monday's total. The Nasdaq's early gain was just enough for a 5% increase from the June 3 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), rendering it irrelevant.


The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close just shy of a record high. NYSE volume appeared to be lower. The S&P 500 lost its May 18 distribution day due to time. On net, the Nasdaq was left with three distribution days and the S&P 500 also with three. That's a manageable amount.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day nearly flat. Down nearly 2% this month, the Dow is lagging the Nasdaq (up 3.8%) and the S&P 500 (up 0.9%). Wednesday's performance would have been weaker if not for strength in the Dow's financial components. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) climbed 0.6% to 1%.


In a day of muddled action, small caps were the nominal winners. The Russell 2000 rose 0.3%. The index is bidding for a ninth consecutive monthly gain, yet it also faces resistance around 2350.


Volume appeared to be lower on the NYSE. Market breadth was moderately positive, with winners 7-5 over losers on the Nasdaq, and by 10-9 on the NYSE.


The IBD 50 added 0.2%.


Notable Moves In Financials
---------------------------


The consumer discretionary and energy sectors helped lead the market. There was noteworthy activity in the finance sector, which saw a 0.2% rise in the Financial Select Sector SDPR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)).



Automakers accounted for much of the consumer discretionary sector's heft, notably **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). The electric-vehicle company jumped 5.3% and shares regained the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Tesla still remains deep in a hole.


In financials, stock market investors could find a few more opportunities.


**Cowen** ([COWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COWN)) cleared a 15-week lopsided pattern in heavy volume. It finished just below a standard entry at 43.27. Investment firm **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)) broke out of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/), though in weak volume. **Paymentus** ([PAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAY)) broke out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 34.01 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


In health care, diabetes monitoring innovator **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) rose past the 429.04 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a cup base, also in light trade. In general, it was a day of light volume among the movers. [The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) following Dexcom's breakout goes up to 450.49.

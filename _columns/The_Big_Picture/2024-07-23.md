The Russell 2000 outperformed again in the stock market Tuesday after regaining the 2200 level Monday. The session served up plenty of strong earnings movers, even though the major stock indexes faded off highs during the final 30 minutes of trading and closed with mild losses.




The Russell 2000 rallied 1%, bringing its two-session gain to 2.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended lower by 0.1% to 0.2%. The Nasdaq had been up as much as 0.7%.


Volume was slightly lower on the Nasdaq and slightly higher on the NYSE. While five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 since June 20 might seem high, keep in mind that only two of those days really had the feel of distribution. One was July 11 when the index fell 0.9%. The other was on July 17 when the S&P 500 slumped 1.4%.


Winners had a slight edge over losers on both main exchanges Tuesday.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 1.4%, helped by a strong earnings report from India-based online travel firm **MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)), which jumped 8% to record highs following its earnings report.


Stock Market Today
------------------


In economic news, existing-home sales in June came in at an annualized rate of 3.89 million units, a little below the 4 million consensus estimate. The data comes ahead of new-home sales data Wednesday.

The big economic data point comes Friday with the release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. On a year-over-year basis, core PCE is expected to come in at 2.5%, down slightly from May's reading of 2.6%. Wall Street will get a hint at what the number might look when the first estimate to Q2 GDP comes out Thursday, because there's a PCE component to the GDP data.


Indeed, core PCE is getting closer to the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. According to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), traders still expect the first interest rate cut at the September Fed meeting. But additional rate cuts at the November and December meetings are far from a sure thing at this point.


Homebuilders continue to be a nice pocket of leadership in the stock market despite concerns about a slowdown for the U.S. economy.


**PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) reported earnings before the open and quickly paid a visit to its [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-10-day-moving-average-2/). But the homebuilder pared an opening loss of 4.5% to nearly nothing by the close. Pulte joined the [Leaderboard model portfolio](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Tuesday when it reclaimed a 122.72 buy point.


Homebuilders are doing well in a lower-interest-rate environment. After hitting a high of 4.49% on July 1, the 10-year Treasury yield is now trading around 4.24%.


The stock market is still showing strength, making it a favorable environment for new buys. Leaderboard raised some cash last week, but it added three names Tuesday, raising the invested percentage back close to 60%.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


Several more stocks joined the breakout ranks Tuesday, including new-issue **Waystar** ([WAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAY)). The software firm cleared an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with gusto,  rising 3.5% in higher volume. The company isn't profitable yet, but revenue growth has accelerated for two quarters in a row. Waystar offers cloud-based software to health care organizations to help simplify payments.


It was an inauspicious debut for Waystar when it went public last month at 21.50. The stock hit a  low of 20.26 on July 10 but has been on a tear since then. It closed Tuesday above a 23.09 entry.


**GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) closed a bit off highs but still scored an [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-aerospace-earnings-q2-2024-ge-stock-dividend/) breakout. GE rallied 5.7% in heavy turnover and closed just above a 170.80 buy point. Group peer **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) soared 5.6% to a 52-week high after reporting earnings. **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) and **RTX** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)) report Thursday.


IBD's aerospace and defense group was one of the day's top performers, rising just over 2%. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ([ITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITA)) jumped nearly 3% to an all-time high and is still in buy range from a 137.49 entry.


Other breakouts in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com) included **Badger Meter** ([BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)) and **Trinity Industries** ([TRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRN)).


Badger Meter shares were volatile Friday after the company reported a 47% rise in earnings and 23% increase in revenue. But buyers pushed the stock off lows Friday, and shares topped a 202.81 entry Tuesday.


In the transportations sector, railcar maker Trinity Industries topped a 32 buy point in strong volume.

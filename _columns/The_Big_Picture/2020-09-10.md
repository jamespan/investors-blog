The stock market ended sharply lower Thursday, after giving up solid gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose as much as 1.4%, but sold off after the coronavirus stimulus bill ran into a roadblock.




The Nasdaq ended 2% lower, underperforming the other major stock indexes after the Senate failed to advance a Republican coronavirus stimulus plan.


The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 1.2%. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%, while the Dow Jones industrials traded down 1.45%, or 405 points. Heavy losses in shares of tech giants **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) weighed on the Dow. Apple fell 3.3% and is pulling back to its 50-day line, while Microsoft is finding resistance as it tries to rise above its 50-day line after breaking below the support level on Tuesday. Shares dropped 2.8%.


Leading growth stocks underperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) declined nearly 2%. In the IBD 50, **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) fell just 0.7% and is in the 5% buy zone above a 470.71 entry in a flat base. The stock is trying to recover from a round-trip sell signal. Elsewhere, tech giants **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) tumbled 3.6% and 3.9%, respectively.

Nasdaq, S&P 500 Add Distribution Day
------------------------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both fell sharply Thursday in higher volume, adding a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The Nasdaq now has three, while the S&P 500's count rose to five. The increase in distribution days, along with the big sell-offs, indicate the market's character has changed for the worse.


After Thursday's loss, the Nasdaq is more than 9% off its all-time high. On Tuesday, the tech-heavy composite closed below its key 50-day moving average for the first time since the confirmation of the new uptrend on April 2. The Nasdaq found support there Wednesday in a day of sharp gains.


With the market uptrend now under pressure, investors should be more focused on locking in profits and cutting losses short. Another easy way to reduce risk is to move off margin. Be careful with new buys. The increased risk in the market should give you pause.


Meanwhile, focus on stocks that are holding up the best during the weak market environment, like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)). Amazon saw a bearish reversal Thursday, though it held at the 50-day line.

Stock Market Earnings: Chewy, Peloton
-------------------------------------


**Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)) fell 1% after the close Thursday despite [reporting better-than-expected fiscal Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chewy-stock-earnings-second-quarter-chwy/). The company was expected to widen per-share losses to 15 cents from 10 cents a year ago on revenue of $1.64 billion.


Chewy stock closed Thursday more than 27% above a 47.65 entry in a cup base, following a breakout on June 2.


**Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) jumped over 8% in extended trading after reporting better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. [Peloton earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/peloton-earnings-q4-2020-peloton-stock/) came in at 27 cents a share, its first ever adjusted profit. Revenue skyrocketed 172% to $607.1 million.


Peloton stock hit an all-time high Thursday before reversing 3.75% lower. Shares ended Thursday more than 130% above a double-bottom-with-handle's 38.18 buy point.



Stocks To Watch: Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor
---------------------------------------------


Despite market weakness, Amazon and Taiwan Semiconductor are near buy zones.


Amazon remains below a 3,344.39 entry in a flat base, according to a [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares are rebounding from their 50-day average. The stock fell 2.9% Thursday.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Amazon stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) has a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


[Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tsm-stock-holds-tight-rough-market/), Taiwan Semiconductor, appears to be tracing a new flat base. The buy point would be 84.10. Shares moved down 0.6% Thursday.


Taiwan Semiconductor is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watch list. According to IBD Leaderboard commentary, "The high on July 27, or 83.40, plus 10 cents could also act as the entry point. That session marked the highest close since the start of its recent mild correction. A flat base should reveal a dry-up in volume, and that can be seen in August."

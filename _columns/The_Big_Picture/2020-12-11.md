The Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes ended the week on a slight down note Friday but closed near session highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, buoyed by an over-13% surge in shares of **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)).




The Nasdaq fell just 0.2% after tumbling as much as 1.3%, while the S&P 500 edged 0.1% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.2%. Among the Dow 30, Disney soared 13.6% on [bullish Disney+ prospects.](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-streaming-video-investor-day-after-warner-bros-shocker/) The stock is more than 30% above a [double bottom'](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/)s 131.46 buy point, offering investors an [opportunity to lock in some profits.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/)


The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.6%, while leading growth stocks were flat, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded unchanged on Friday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **National** **Beverage** ([FIZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIZZ)) was one of the worst performers ,with a 4.1% slide. Shares broke down through their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in heavy volume. The stock also made a round-trip sell signal.


Volume was modestly lower compared with Thursday's session on the Nasdaq, and also appeared to be lower on the NYSE.


Nasdaq Recovers From Sharp Drop
-------------------------------


![MP121120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP121120-253x300.jpg)After Friday's slight fall, the Nasdaq lost 0.7% for the week, ending a three-week win streak. The S&P 500 lost 1% and the Dow Jones industrials slipped 0.6% for the week.


The past week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 added one distribution day — [on Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-a-hit-stimulus-talks-drag-on-doordash-soars-in-debut/) — but further weakness has yet to materialize. In fact, the Nasdaq looked to head sharply lower Thursday and again Friday, but was able to rebound and close near session highs on both days. The Nasdaq's close on Friday was above Wednesday's close.


Amid a still modest [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) — the Nasdaq has two days of institutional selling, while the S&P 500 has four days over the past few weeks — investors should remain exposed to stocks. New breakouts seem to occur every day, a sign of a solid stock market uptrend.


But elsewhere, some of the hottest stocks in the market are cooling off. **Corsair Gaming** ([CRSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSR)) is 35% off its high of less than three weeks ago. **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) is about 20% off its highs, though it bounced the past couple of sessions. **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) is already more than 15% off its 52-week high in just four sessions. All three IPO stocks remain above their 10-week lines.

The stock market uptrend continued Thursday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended the day with solid gains, easily outpacing the other major indexes. Strong earnings from tech giant **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) helped propel the composite.




The Nasdaq closed with a 0.8% gain and at session highs. The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrials closed with a 0.1% loss, or 28 points. A 4% sell-off in shares of **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The [blue chip](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/blue-chip-stock-dow-dia-warren-buffett/) reported weaker-than-expected sales early Thursday.


Volume rose modestly across both main exchanges vs. Wednesday's session.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied 1.7%, easily outpacing the main indexes. The index of top growth stocks is climbing back toward the 200-day line after spending most of the past month below it.


Current Stock Market Rally
--------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP102419-234x300.jpg)Last week, the stock market powered higher, causing IBD to [upgrade its market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-stocks-surprising-gains-market-outlook-shifts/) to a confirmed uptrend. The major indexes are about 2% or less off their all-time highs.


With eight [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) across the Nasdaq and S&P 500, progress has been very limited; however, the market has also been resilient. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq fell 0.7%, but gains over the last two trading sessions more than made up for that loss. Q3 earnings results are the new focal point instead of recession fears or U.S.-China trade talks.


Amid a continuing uptrend, investors should be on the hunt for top stocks breaking out above proper buy points in heavy volume.


[Earnings season](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-when-to-buy-growth-stocks-earnings/) is in full swing. Be particularly mindful of buying stocks ahead of earnings releases. On the upside, strong results can send stocks surging, often staging [bullish breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/). On the downside, weaker-than-expected earnings can result in sharp breakdowns. For example, former [top growth stock](https://www.investors.com/research/twitter-stock-buy-now/) **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) plunged nearly 21% Thursday after weak earnings, just one day after triggering the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) from a 41.02 entry in a cup with handle.


IBD 50 Stocks Outperform: Microsoft Nears Buy Point
---------------------------------------------------



Our index of leading growth stocks — the IBD 50 — heavily outperformed the major stock indexes Thursday amid solid gains from Chinese stock leader **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)).


New Oriental Education gained nearly 7% to regain a 115.98 entry in an ascending base, just two days after falling more than 7% below that level. The company [reported earnings on Tuesday.](https://www.investors.com/news/new-oriental-education-earnings-china-stock-tal-education-earnings/)


Kirkland Lake Gold nearly reclaimed its key 50-day line Thursday with a 5% advance. Shares continue to form a consolidation with a 51.18 buy point.



On the downside, underperformers were **MasTec** ([MTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTZ)) and **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)). MasTec slid 3.6%. Shares are pulling back to their 50-day line and are still in the [20%-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) from a 53.01 entry in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).


Arista Networks fell 3% as it continues to consolidate. Shares are nearly 30% off their 52-week high.


Microsoft, Thursday's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-ibd50-stock-to-watch-continues-basing-earnings-win/) pick, regained its 50-day line in today's stock market. Microsoft stock is approaching a 141.78 buy point in a flat base after a previous breakout above that level. Meanwhile, the software giant is on the verge of completing a new five-week flat base with a 142.47 buy point.

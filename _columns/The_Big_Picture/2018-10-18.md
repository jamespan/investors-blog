title: Stock Market Hit Hard, But One Indicator Is Signaling A Bottom

Bulls on Thursday again failed to wrest control of the stock market from the bears' grip.




The stock market indexes continued a fight to stay above their 200-day moving averages, a key area for support.


On Thursday, the Nasdaq skidded 2.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively. Small caps came in 1.9% lower on the S&P 600.


The S&P 500 closed basically at its 200-day line and the Nasdaq slightly below it. If the 200-day lines fail to hold, it isn't clear where the next natural support level would be. The market will then be playing a game akin to tennis without a net. Finding clear support then becomes more difficult to gauge.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MP10181818-259x300.jpg)The last time the 200-day line failed in a big way for the major indexes was in January 2016. The Nasdaq fell as much as 14% under its 200-day line before starting to recover.


The S&P 500 dropped 11% under its 200-day line back then, and then shifted to repair mode.


A drop like that now would take the indexes either into or near bear market territory — the 20% decline that traditionally defines a bear market.


Bulls like to say there's always a bull market somewhere. Their faith, however, is stronger than the evidence right now.


Over the past four weeks, gold mining stocks and tobacco stocks were the best gainers, according to IBD data.

That would leave the fearless bulls in the odd position of playing fear-based stocks.


For those who insist on playing that game, 2017 initial public offering **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) is shaping a cup-without-handle base.


Kirkland is the only gold-mining stock with an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-the-eps-rating/) and Relative Price Strength Rating above 90. A rating of 90 puts a stock in the top 10% of all the stocks in IBD's database.


In the tobacco space, not one stock scores 90 or better on both the EPS and RS ratings.


The problem with playing defensive stocks is that their life cycle is usually short. When a new uptrend begins, they fade fast.


What To Watch For
-----------------


Rather than wasting time hunting for short-term plays, the investor could be preparing a watch list of highly rated stocks. They could prove more profitable — when the market turns up — than the defensive plays.


One thing to watch for is the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/apple-trillion-value-stocks/), which measures price performance vs. the S&P 500. Stocks with RS lines at or near highs include: switching systems provider **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)); managed health care provider **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)); insurer **Progressive** ([PGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGR)); **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)); and **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)).


Study such stocks to see if they deserve a place on a watch list for possible future purchase, especially the ones still forming bases.


In this market, cash is the preferred position. It's also easier on an investor's mental state.


Investors who ride a stock all the way down are not in position to act rationally when a new uptrend begins. They likely will be too shell-shocked to buy quality stocks when a new uptrend is confirmed.


On Thursday, the [put/call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) signaled that a market bottom may be near. The ratio closed at 1.24, well above the 1.15 level that can identify a bottom.


World News
----------


In news Thursday, the European Union Commission scolded Italy for breaking EU rules on debt and government spending.


Meanwhile, a sell-off in the Shanghai Composite dragged the index to almost a four-year low. China is in a bear market amid worries that the trade dispute with the U.S. is hurting its economy.


On Friday, China's government will report production, retail and third quarter GDP numbers.

The Philadelphia Fed's business survey came in 11% stronger than expected. First-time jobless claims were 2% fewer than expected.

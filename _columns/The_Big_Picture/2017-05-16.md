 The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index made record highs Tuesday but finished mixed as technology stocks kept the Nasdaq on an upward path.


The composite climbed 0.3% and closed at its session high thanks to leadership in the semiconductor and internet sectors. Chip manufacturers, designers and equipment industry groups rose 0.7% to 1.5%. Some Nasdaq-listed Chinese internet and social media companies made impressive gains.


The S&P 500 fell 0.1% but ended a hair above 2400 for the second day in a row. Yet even after posting a new high, the S&P's upward trend remains significantly flatter than the Nasdaq's.

The market's mixed performance reflected the low volatility that's characterized the indexes this spring. That calm behavior, though, is masking big moves among many leading stocks, most of it sharp reactions to earnings reports.


Chinese web stocks proved that point Tuesday.


**Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), the internet portal company, soared 18% in huge volume after first-quarter earnings and revenue topped Wall Street's expectations. Sina broke out of a base and quickly became extended. **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), a Twitter-like service that's majority-owned by Sina, roared 25% to an all-time high in big volume after it too beat estimates.


Indeed, the day seemed to belong to Chinese companies, which accounted for seven of the 11 top stocks [rising in unusually heavy volume](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=up) Tuesday. Online retailer **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) vaulted 15% and rival and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) added 2%, both in robust trade. Alibaba reports earnings Thursday.


In the chip sector, analysts raised price targets on chip-equipment makers **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)). Chip designer **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) rose 12% on news of a tech licensing deal with **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)).


Retail stocks were mixed, as some of the day's most ghastly sell-offs occurred in that sector. Again, it was brick and mortar chains that posted disappointing quarterly results. **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) gapped down to a 14% loss, to the lowest level since June; **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) tumbled 4% in heavy trading.


**Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), which reports Thursday, slid to the lowest since August but pared losses. **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) dropped more than 3% and fell below its 50-day moving average in more than triple its usual volume. It announces earnings May 25.


A good investor must stay in tune with shifting sector moves. But on a broader scale, the market's underpinnings are good.


By measurements of price and volume, there are clear signs that institutional demand is still very much in force. The S&P and Nasdaq have only three distribution days. (The April 10 stalling day is now too old to count, but that still leaves the number of distribution days unchanged.)


The Accumulation-Distribution Ratings of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at about B, indicating net buying (see the ratings on the general market indicators page by accessing the special link at the end of this story). Breaking down the IBD 6000 broad index, more than 50% of the stocks have A or B Accumulation-Distribution Ratings. Only one-fourth have bad ratings of D or E, and the rest are in neutral C ratings.


But the market is having to advance without much contribution from small caps, one of the main engines of growth. The Russell 2000, up nearly 0.1% Tuesday, has risen only about 2.8% this year and is basically at the same place it was in mid-December. That's a significant lag compared with the major indexes.


Homebuilders also were one of Tuesday's top groups, despite mixed housing data. Housing starts fell in April, largely due to a drop in multifamily construction. Building permits also fell, but permit requests have outpacing starts for three months, which bodes well for May's report, said economist Joel Naroff.

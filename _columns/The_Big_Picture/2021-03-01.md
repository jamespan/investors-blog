Is the Biden Bounce still in play?




Judging by Monday's action, one could certainly venture that equities still remain an attractive option for global investors. The market also reminded IBD readers for a second straight day that another market — specifically, long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds — still matters greatly.


The Nasdaq composite rose 3%, easily its biggest gain in a single trading session in 2021 so far.


But the size of that rebound perhaps pales in comparison, technically speaking, with these two other details:


One, the Nasdaq retook its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) after spending two sessions below this intermediate-term support-and-resistance price level.


At 13,588, the Nasdaq has soared 105% from its March 2020 coronavirus market crash low of 6631 and risen 38% from its February 2020 peak of 9838 before the crash.


The Biden Bounce
----------------


Two, the two-day Friday-and-Monday advance almost took back all of Thursday's real drubbing.


![MP030121](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP030121-220x300.jpg)On that day, the tech-centered index got body-slammed with a 3.5% fall. Volume grew vs. the prior session. This marked a [fourth distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the books for the premier index of growth stocks.


If the market truly was getting weaker, you'd normally see the major averages reluctant to recoup major losses so quickly, as they did Monday.


Meanwhile, a healthy array of true growth stocks also enjoyed solid buying.


Zoom Is Rebounding
------------------


**Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), a 9.6% winner on Monday in the regular session, notched another big gain after hours after the videoconferencing platform spanked Wall Street's forecasts. The FactSet consensus view showed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 79 cents a share. Zoom posted a net profit of $1.22 a share, up 713% vs. a year earlier.


That torched even the most bullish view of 86 cents among 24 analysts polled.



Zoom is still in [base-building territory](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). But support last week at the long-term 200-day moving average was timely.


Nio ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)), on the other hand, slid nearly 4% in extended-hours trading on its Q4 results and a [first-quarter outlook suggesting a slower growth rate of future EV deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/nio-earnings-q4-2020-nio-stock/). The all-electric SUV and sedan maker in China was one of the top stocks in 2020, bolting 570% after returning to a double-digit share price in a huge breakout the week ended July 10 that year.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. Friday. Trading, in fact, has quieted down significantly since a rampage of individual and institutional traders produced quite a spectacle in mid-January to mid-February as the WallStreetBets brigade on Reddit.com spearheaded a charge into heavily shorted names including **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **BlackBerry** ([BB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BB)) and **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)).


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rallied 2.4%, one day after briefly undercutting its own 50-day line Friday. At 3901, the large-cap benchmark stands about 1.2% below its all-time high of 3950. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed almost 2%.


The Jan. 22 distribution day on the S&P 500 got snuffed out due to time. Thus, the Market Pulse shows one less meaningful institutional-quality sell-off over the past 25 trading sessions for this index vs. the Nasdaq.



Small caps roared loudly again. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), which entered [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) on Monday morning, jumped 3.6%.


Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) soared 5.6%.


For now, the market stays at "uptrend under pressure." Yet, further gains by the key indexes and strong action by growth stocks may lead to a revision in the outlook.


When The Biden Bounce Started
-----------------------------


Those who read this column each day know that the current rally kicked into high gear on Nov. 4.


On that day, the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials both staged a key [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).


The Nasdaq was not far behind; this index did the same thing the very next day.


Of course, some [follow-through days turn out to be head-fakes](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). Yet it's hard to dispute more than 120 years of stock market research that show just how powerful a strong follow-through acts as a market-timing signal.


Now, the action of individual stocks should also reflect a newfound urge among banks, state and local pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance giants to accumulate stock. So at this point, pay attention to how companies on stock lists including the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) behave.


Watch For More Economic Reopening Signs
---------------------------------------


Clearly, the debut of a one-shot, easy-to-store coronavirus vaccine from **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), sharply falling new cases of Covid-19 across America, President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion economic aid bill, and continued solid Q4 operating results among S&P 500 firms all add to the bullish argument for stocks. But one should keep a close watch on the cost of money too.


Corporations have borrowed heavily over the years to fund stock repurchases, maintain or boost cash dividends, and acquire new technologies or companies to invest in future growth. Do you remember all those stories in recent years about how equity funds suffered major outflows, yet U.S. stock prices kept going up? Credit corporate buybacks as a major reason.


On Monday, the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond showed a yield of 1.45%, down 9 basis points from Thursday's year-to-date peak of 1.54%, Treasury Department data showed. The drop appeared to boost a stock market concerned about the fast climb in the yield.

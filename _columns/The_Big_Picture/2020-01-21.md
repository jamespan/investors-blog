Why The Stock Market Today Showed A Decline That Hid This Bullish Move
=======================================================================

On the bulls side, virtually no one would or should expect the stock market to go up every day. Yet on the bears side, Tuesday's drop likely left this class of investors feeling far from satisfied.




A decline of less than 0.2% for the Nasdaq composite certainly wouldn't be called a "sell-off" by either camp on Wall Street. But for the new reader, the exact size of this decline actually mattered. Why?


With volume rising on the all-electronic exchange vs. Friday, a 0.2% loss or more, without rounding, would have qualified as a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) — IBD speak for a serious bout of selling by fund managers. Based on IBD research on decades' worth of bull and bear market cycles, any drop of less than 0.2% just doesn't cut the mustard.


Selling on the S&P 500 also lacked any meaningful kick.

The large-cap index fell nearly 0.3%. A 3% slide by **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and new 52-week lows helped depress the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5% lower. NYSE volume rose 10% vs. Friday. That signals a third distribution day for the S&P 500 over the past 25 sessions. This total should not raise alarm. 


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP_3x1_01212020-229x300.jpg)One could generally get a sense of the absence of serious institutional money heading toward the exits by also looking at how true market leaders acted.


As the Market Pulse table shows, more [CAN SLIM](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/)-quality names actually rose significantly in price in a boost of volume than those that fell in heavy turnover. So in this third full week of trading in 2020, large portfolio managers seem to still be putting money to work.


What Really Took Place In The Stock Market Today
------------------------------------------------


[Tuesday's Stocks On The Move table](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) also showed no lack of growth companies making solid gains in above-average turnover. IBD readers can capture excellent breakouts by routinely sifting through this list.


Fear over the potential impact on businesses in China amid an outbreak of the so-called coronavirus definitely hit some China ADRs and ADSs on Wall Street. **Luckin Coffee** ([LK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LK)), **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) took hits in the 2% to 5% range.


At the day's close of 47.67, Luckin still holds a robust 75% gain since it cleared a 27.22 entry point in a 16-week base. That pattern also contained elements of a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), which furnished a lower buy point at 23.04.


But hotel chain **Huazhu Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) gapped down hard at the market open. Despite some bargain-hunting later in the day, the stock failed to rebound back above its 50- and 200-day moving averages.



Wait For This Action, Then Buy
------------------------------


Take a close look at Huazhu's daily chart. You'll see that you could have sidestepped Tuesday's sell-off if you had waited with discipline for a [true breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past a 43.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), 10 cents above the handle's high. Sure, last week's [rebound off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) (on a weekly chart) looked bullish. But that in itself did not produce a good entry.


Pullbacks to the 10-week moving average only count as a [potential follow-on buy opportunity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) after a sound breakout from a [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), not before.


Small caps certainly took it on the chin on Tuesday; the Russell 2000 fell 0.8%. At 1685.90, the popular small-cap gauge saw its year-to-date gain cut to 1%. But Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), home to numerous small-cap and midcap true growth stocks, closed unchanged to hold a 5% advance since Jan. 1.



**XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)) of Brazil, the focus of today's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-xp-stock/), is trying to clear a new buy point in its [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). With a $22 billion market value, it's big enough to possibly earn a spot in a list such as [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


The brokerage got discussed in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live). In the past three quarters, cumulative earnings of 30 cents a share doubled vs. the same nine-month time frame a year earlier. Revenue in Q3 leapt 84% to $325.5 million.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond sank 6 basis points to 1.78%; two-year notes yield 1.53%, down 5 basis points vs. Friday.

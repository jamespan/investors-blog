The S&amp;P 500 hit a fresh 14-month high. Many stocks flashed buy signals from a variety of sectors, including Nvidia, HubSpot and JPMorgan. But is the Nasdaq already extended again?","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/www.investors.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/SWBIIl76-640x360.jpg","contentUrl":"https:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/manifests\/SWBIIl76.m3u8","uploadDate":"2023-06-30T13:39:06+0000","duration":"PT1135.87S","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ALISSA CORAM, ED CARSON"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Investor's Business Daily","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":false},"url":"https:\/\/www.investors.com"},"keywords":""}</script>
<p>The Nasdaq composite powered 1.5% higher, with its weekly lift an impressive 2.2%. The tech-heavy index has gained in nine of the past 10 weeks. In addition, its 31.7% gain so far in 2023 made it its best first half of a year since 1983. It now has a cushion above all its short-term and major moving averages.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 was no slouch either, popping 1.2%. It actually outshined the Nasdaq on a weekly basis, with a 2.3% gain, and is also clear of its short-term moving averages. The benchmark index is up about 16% so far in 2023 and sits at a new 52-week high.</p>

Volume also ran higher on both indexes, another positive.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes, but still rose 0.8%. It was a day to remember for component <strong>Apple</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL" target="_blank">AAPL</a>) as it closed with a $3 trillion market cap after rising 2.3%. <strong>Walmart</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT" target="_blank">WMT</a>) and <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT" target="_blank">MSFT</a>) also outperformed.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>
<p>Small caps underwhelmed, however, with the Russell 2000 lifting a puny 0.4%. Growth stocks outperformed though, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY" target="_blank">FFTY</a>) jumping 1.9%.</p>
<h2>Mild Inflation Boosts Indexes, Sparks This Bullish Switch</h2>
<p>Stocks were bolstered after the Commerce Department released its personal income and outlays report for May. Personal income rose 0.4%, in line with estimates. The PCE price index rose 0.1% on the month, with an annual increase of 3.8%. Both numbers met estimates.</p>
<p>Crucially, the core PCE price index data, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, was encouraging. It rose 0.3% on the month and 4.6% year over year, both cooler than analysts expected.</p>
<p>The report saw the 10-year Treasury note yield edge lower. The disinflation process appears to remain intact, and the Supreme Court decision Friday to block the Biden administration's $430 billion student-loan debt forgiveness plan should put further pressure on consumers.</p>
<p>With indexes looking bullish and the market in a confirmed uptrend, IBD is raising recommended exposure levels to 80% to 100%. However, investors should take care when adding exposure, taking stock of current market levels and increasing at a measured pace. It is also key to remain nimble in case there is a pullback.</p>
<p>Next week will not be entirely quiet, even with markets being closed July 4 to mark Independence Day. Wednesday sees the release of the latest Fed minutes, while the June unemployment report is due Friday.</p>

<h2>Solar Stock Market Group Shines</h2>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 sectors all ended the session in positive territory. Technology and consumer discretionary led the upside, while energy and real estate made the slimmest gains.</p>
<p>The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave further insight into the stock market action.</p>
<p>Computer hardware stocks, solar companies and oil &amp; gas drillers and field services plays were among the best performers.</p>
<p>On the flip side, wholesale food stocks, mail-order retailers, truck transportation plays and cable stocks lagged.</p>

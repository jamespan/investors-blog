Traders were still in party mode on a post-Thanksgiving Friday as stock market indexes ended the day, week and month higher. Up next, the latest jobs report is among the key events just around the corner.


The Nasdaq composite ended Friday's shortened session up 0.8%. This allowed the tech-heavy index to post a weekly rise of 1.1% and notch a 6.2% increase for November, its best month since May. The Nasdaq has climbed in three of the past four months and has climbed 28% for the year so far.




The S&P 500 closed at record highs after ending the session up 0.6%. Its weekly lift came in at 1.1%, which helped escalate it 5.7% for the month. It notched its best monthly improvement since November 2023. The benchmark index is clear of all its moving averages and is now up 26.5% in 2024.


Advancers led decliners by almost 2-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges due to the truncated trading day.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 45,000 level for the first time after rising 0.4% Friday. This helped it to a muscular monthly lift of 7.9%, also its best since the previous November. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) turned in the best gains on the much-watched index.


Small caps moved up as well, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.4% Friday. A monthly chart underlined its stellar recent performance, with the index booking an 11% jump. Still, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) left it in the dust, rising 2.4% and surging 19.6% for the month.


With election uncertainty out of the way and indexes sitting above short-term and major moving averages, the signs are looking positive for more gains in the final month of the year.

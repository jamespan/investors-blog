S&P 500 Hits A Record High, And 2 Factors That Could Trip The Market
=====================================================================

The S&P 500 rose to a record high Monday, a new sign the stock market is shedding inhibitions despite a powerful move so far this year.




Despite closing off session highs, the S&P 500 topped the previous high notched on Sept. 21 at 2940.91, as a three-month bear market emerged.


The Nasdaq composite last week topped its Aug. 30 prior high, so the two main indexes have wiped away all losses from the 2018 bear market.


The two indexes are showing little hesitation to extend their 2019 advance, a good sign for the market's outlook.

For the Nasdaq, the 8000 level is farther back. The S&P 500 took a few weeks to solidify itself above 2800, but is now well above that level. On Monday, the Nasdaq rose 0.2% and the S&P 500 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added a fraction. Volume was lower.


As indexes extend gains, the number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is quickly dropping. The March 22 and March 27 distribution days on the S&P 500 no longer in the count — because of time passed or index gains. One stall day (April 16) also dropped off because it makes little sense to count this type of distribution when the number of regular distribution days is smaller.


Follow all that? Good, because the stall day may come back into play if the S&P 500 sustains more distribution in the coming days. Relax — the bottom line is that the market is not facing any serious institutional selling. The Nasdaq already had whittled down its distribution to just one day over the past five weeks, and the S&P has just two.


Small caps outperformed, another positive element Monday. The Russell 2000 rose 0.4% for a second straight day of outperformance. The Russell is still lagging other main indexes this year. Small caps are much more of a domestic-growth indicator, so investors have reason to cheer a healthier small-cap space.

CLOSE




Earnings, Fed Pose 2 Risks
--------------------------


Earnings and the Federal Reserve's meeting are key events for Wall Street this week. The Fed is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday and will announce its latest view on monetary policy Wednesday afternoon.


With one of the busiest weeks for earnings announcements, the market faces multiple nerve points. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reports Tuesday after the close and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) came out after Monday's closing bell. Alphabet sold off in extended trading after [sales missed views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-google-stock-q1-2019/). Nasdaq futures fell on the news.


Overall, S&P 500 companies are surprising on the upside. With nearly half the 500 companies announced, 77% have topped the consensus profit estimate, which is above the one-year and five-year average, according to FactSet.


Still, the S&P 500's year-over-year earnings are down 2.3% on the whole, and it's on track for the first year-over-year decline in net profit margin since Q4 of 2016.


Leading stocks were in line with the market. The IBD 50 inched up 0.1% Monday, with technology stocks offsetting weakness in some retail and real estate components.


The software sector is still climbing, hitting new highs. Breakouts Monday from **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and **Mimecast** ([MIME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIME)) reinforced [the No. 1 sector's prowess](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-apr-26-2019/). Some of those breakouts came in mediocre volume and Salesforce.com closed below its [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Financials led, as the SPDR Financial ETF added 1%. Communications services also was a top S&P sector. It's been rising mainly because the three largest components are rallying: **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and (until Monday evening) Alphabet.

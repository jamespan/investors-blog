Big Gains For Stocks, But Beaten-Down Names Lead The Charge
============================================================

Stocks kicked off the week with strong percentage gains, but for growth investors, Monday’s session left a lot to be desired. The Nasdaq jumped 1.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 added 1.4%. Small caps lagged a bit with the Russell 2000 up 1.2%. The IBD 50 rose 1%.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Friday’s levels. Options expired Friday, which tends to increase trading. But volume Friday was only slightly above average on the NYSE and average on the Nasdaq.


On the NYSE, advancing stocks topped decliners by more than 3-to-1. The ratio was better than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


![MP022316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP022316-224x300.jpg)The S&P 500 closed at 1945.50 Monday, just below its 50-day moving average at 1951.69, a potential resistance level. Because the index has rallied for a week and a half, the 50-day line could turn into a ceiling. The Nasdaq is 2% below its 50-day line, so it has more room before that line become a potential issue.


Most of the day’s top-performing groups came from beaten-down areas of the market. The Mining-Metal Ores group led the way, up around 7%. Oil drillers, coal and steel stocks also outperformed.


March-delivery crude oil settled at $31.48 a barrel, up $1.84, or 6.2%. Wall Street liked news of an IEA forecast that called for a decline in U.S. shale production this year and next.


Health insurers were among the day’s top performers after the government proposed raising payments next year for Medicare providers.


Big gainers in IBD’s managed care industry group included **WellCare Health Plans** ([WCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCG)), **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) and **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)). Most stocks in the group are still far off their 52-week highs. WellCare looks the best at only 8% off its high.


The market looks just fine after the Nasdaq’s follow-through last week, but is it a market that’s ready to ditch a defensive posture in favor of growth names? If the price action in **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)) Monday is any indication, the answer is no.


Ellie Mae tried to clear a base with an 83.02 buy point but came up well short. The breakout looked good early as shares rose 2%, but the stock ended with a loss of 2.5% in heavy volume.


**Fiserv** ([FISV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FISV)) extended gains after clearing a 96.66 buy point last week, but it’s been a low-volume breakout so far. Same with **Hawaiian Airlines** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)), which cleared a 40.23 entry Monday in light trade.


Judging by the action in recent breakouts, plus the fact that some potential leaders are still early in the base-building process, the market’s message is pretty clear right now for growth investors. Buy candidates are still sparse. If the market is truly strengthening, the breakouts will come in due time. Be patient for now.

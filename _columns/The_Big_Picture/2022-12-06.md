Stock Market Losses Build After S&P 500 Hits Resistance Levels; What Investors Fear
====================================================================================

The S&P 500 is fulfilling investors' fears as the index retreats from resistance levels on its chart, which leaves the stock market's uptrend limping.




The blue chip index fell 1.4% Tuesday, erasing all gains from Wednesday's 3.1% burst after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech. This week's losses dropped the index back below the 4,000 level and the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) — two important guideposts for the stock market.


The Nasdaq composite sold off 2% as technology and internet sectors suffered greater losses than most other sectors. The Nasdaq is testing the 11,000 level, where it found support twice in November. But it has also given up every penny of last week's Powell-inspired surge.


The Nasdaq's 50-day moving average marks potential support as well, just below the 11,000 level. In a positive sign for the indexes, that line has been flattening out after gliding downward since September. The S&P 500's 50-day average is now bending higher.


Indexes Fall From Resistance Levels
-----------------------------------


Yet, index charts haven't escaped heavy selling pressure since the S&P 500 hit resistance levels. Investors should be cautious, given the weak short-term outlook


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for that index. Volume appeared to be higher on the NYSE as well.

Small caps and leading growth stocks took heavy hits as well.


The small-cap Russell 2000 slid 1.5% while the IBD 50 index fell 2.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1%. Just like in August, the industrial average is rolling over after lifting above the 34,000 level.


Investors grew apprehensive Monday when economic data indicated the Fed has room to continue increasing interest rates. The producer price index (PPI) and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey come out this Friday.


After leading the stock market in October and half of November, the energy sector has become the worst performing of the 11 S&P sectors this week, down about 6%. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) closed below the 50-day moving average Tuesday for the first time since Oct. 3.


Sector woes follow weakness in oil prices. West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 3.5% to $74.25 per barrel, its lowest close in almost a year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Energy Sector Runs From Rest Of Stock Market
--------------------------------------------


The energy sector emerged the leader in a year of big divergences for the stock market, at least for the first three quarters. As of last week, it more than doubled the performance of the S&P's communications services, 2022's biggest laggard.


That's the widest annual dispersion since at least 1995, and nearly three times the historical average, says Larry Adam, chief investment officer of the Raymond James Private Client Group.



Today's charts of the leading energy stocks suggest the sector — or at least many of its leaders — have topped out. Specifically, some oil-stock bases in the MarketSmith 250 index are deeper than normal and deeper than their prior bases. Some bases are getting into [late stages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).


**APA Corp.**'s ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)) latest base was more than 40% deep and a third-stage pattern. Its three earlier bases were no bigger than 26%. **Marathon Oil**'s ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) June into early October base also sank more than 40% and was third stage. Marathon is now below its 10-week line.


A late-stage breakout for **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) has failed. The stock is below the 10-week line after rebounding for several weeks. **Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) has a similarly bad chart. **Magnolia Oil & Gas** ([MGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGY)) is forming a late-stage base.


**Halliburton**'s ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) current base measures 47% in depth; **Tidewater**'s ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) is 39%.


And even when bases weren't so deep, [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) for **Oneok** ([OKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKE)), **Murphy Oil** ([MUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUR)), **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)) are still faltering.


Deep, Late-Stage Bases
----------------------


IBD 50 oil equipment maker **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) is forming a 46%-deep base, but its four prior bases went no bigger than 28%. France's **TotalEnergies** ([TTE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTE)) is trying to break out from its deepest base since the 2020 Covid bear market.


The problem with deep bases: it leaves stocks with too much work to do to reach new highs. And when they do hit new highs, stocks are tired and more likely to pull back. Under IBD's investing philosophy, proper bases should be no deeper than about 33%. Deep bases often form in bear markets, but energy patterns seem to be messier than in other sectors.


Also, first- and second-stage bases are best for buying breakout stocks. Odds of a good run from later bases are smaller.


Even outside the energy sector, stock buying is dangerous because breakouts are often falling apart.


In the IBD 50 Tuesday, **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) erased all gains from its 148.94 buy point. **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) sank back to its entry as well. Solar stock **Shoals** ([SHLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHLS)) failed last week. **Clearfield** ([CLFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLFD))  hit a sell signal this week, days after a breakout.


Since the stock market made a follow-through rally confirmation Oct. 21, IBD has cautioned investors to limit exposure to stocks. The success of growth-stock breakouts determines much of the market uptrend's health. And so far, relatively few stocks have made sizable gains from buy points.

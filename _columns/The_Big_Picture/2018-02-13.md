  Stocks Extend Recovery, But Now Face These Key Tests

The stock market extended its rebound Tuesday and now must find signs that it can turn the bounce into a lasting rally.




 Indexes have done a good job rebounding since the S&P 500 touched its 200-day moving average Friday. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite added 0.5%, the S&P 500 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.2%. Volume fell from Monday's totals.


While the day's gains paled vs. the two previous sessions (which had all topped 1%), chart readers could take encouragement from each day's price behavior. Indexes have closed near session highs during the three-day bounce, an indication that buyers are controlling the trading pits, or brokerage terminals, throughout the day.


But it's one thing to make a temporary bottom, and quite another to mount an enduring advance. That's where the market is still lacking critical elements.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP_021318-292x300.png)The next test for the indexes is the [50-day moving averages](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). Indexes remain below that price trend indicator, and a move back above them would leave the market on better footing to continue climbing.


Regardless of what happens in the next few days and weeks, this month's sharp volatility is not likely to dissipate quickly. Jolts such as these can take a while to stabilize, just like earthquakes are followed by aftershocks.


Whenever the market gets back to a confirmed uptrend, investors need to be ready to add stocks. The first days or even hours of a confirmed uptrend sometimes produce some sizable leaps in true market leaders.


Investors can use the downtime of a market correction to study stocks with superior fundamentals and solid charts. Create a shopping list with the best choices, and be ready to buy at proper entries.


The pace of breakouts has slowed as the market struggles, but many top-rated stocks now are finding support at the 50-day moving average. These setups could be the most immediate buy opportunities once the market's green light goes back on.

It's important for small caps to participate in a rebound, but they've lagged slightly. The Russell 2000 is up 4% from its low, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up 5% and 6%, respectively. It's not a big difference, and on Tuesday the Russell 2000 kept up with the S&P 500 and the Dow.


Financial, technology, health care and industrials are the largest sectors in the Russell 2000, and those sectors, among others, are bouncing about.


During the market's advance in 2017 and January of this year, Wall Street didn't appear to react dramatically to various U.S. economic reports. The economy continued its moderate expansion and there was no real threat of a slowdown.


But the market's sensitivity to data is increasing, ever since Friday's employment report sparked worries of inflation after hourly wage growth surged 2.9%, the fastest pace since 2009. A pickup in inflation could lead the Fed to [raise interest rates faster than planned](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-edge-up-nasdaq-up-7-4-in-january-will-large-caps-keep-leading/). Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the [central bank will "remain alert"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/powell-says-fed-will-be-alert-to-any-developing-financial-risks) to any risks to financial stability as it seeks to calibrate monetary policy.


The first inflation report since then is coming out Wednesday, when the [consumer price index for January](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists' consensus estimate is an increase of 0.3%.

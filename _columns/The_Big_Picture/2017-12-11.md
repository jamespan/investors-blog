A day of outperformance for the Nasdaq composite Monday was helped in part by strength in select biotech names after several positive headlines came out of the American Society of Hematology annual meeting.




 The market took news of a botched terrorist attack in New York City in stride as the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 marked all-time closing highs again.


The Nasdaq composite added 0.5%, the S&P 500 gained 0.3%, and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.2%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.1%. Nasdaq volume was nearly identical to Friday's total, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE also close to Friday's levels in the [stock market today](http://www.investors.com/stock-market-today).

The Market Pulse graphic currently shows five [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq composite and one for the S&P 500. Clearly, it's not a market under distribution, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 above their 50-day moving averages and near highs. If it were, leading growth stocks would be breaking down in spades, and that's just not happening.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) outperformed in the Dow, rising 2% to 172.66 on news that the company will acquire Shazam, a popular music-recognition app. Terms weren't disclosed, but [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/11/apple-shazam-deal/) reported the deal could be worth as much as $400 million.


Technically, Apple looks solid, getting support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/) for the first time after a breakout over a 160.97 buy point.


Monday's performance for the stock indexes came after the Dow and S&P 500 scored record closing highs Friday after another solid jobs report. It was a goldilocks report — not too hot, not too cold — with nonfarm payrolls up 228,000 in November, topping expectations of around 200,000.


It's no surprise why the stock market is in such a good mood these days. [The economy continues to improve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tax-cuts-fuel-economic-growth/) with no real threat of inflation on the horizon, and the outlook for corporate earnings remains solid — and will be even more so if corporate tax cuts become a reality.


The Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday with a decision on interest rates due at 2 p.m. ET. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate to 1.25% to 1.5%, although the path of rate hikes in 2018 is still fuzzy.



**Bluebird** ([BLUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLUE)) and partner **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) were big winners in the biotech space after Bluebird reported positive trial data for a CAR-T therapy for patients with advanced multiple myeloma. Shares of Bluebird soared 18% to 201.80, while Celgene added close to 2% to 108.


CAR-T drugs are made using a patient's own extracted immune system cells. The cells are reprogrammed to seek and destroy cancer cells. Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Bluebird to 309 from 186. Biotechs, however, were mainly lower, with the group down 0.6%.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, rising more than 4%. It showed bullish technical action, breaking out over a trend line and closing above the 50-day moving average for the first time since Oct. 18.


Earnings reports to watch this week included **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)). Both report Thursday after the close. Adobe is seeking support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout in October. Costco is extended at this point, but the top-performing retailer continues to trade tightly near highs after a breakout over a 173.19 handle buy point (see daily chart). Both names were featured in latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/adobe-systems-costco-oracle-earnings-reports-due-in-coming-week/) column, which highlights potential option trades.


With the market still in a confirmed uptrend, it makes sense having some exposure to stocks. If you're still holding on to some nice gainers that aren't showing anything in the way of sell signals, go ahead and hold for now and watch how they act around a key support level like the 50-day moving average on a daily chart or the 10-week line on the weekly chart.


When it comes to new buys, it's probably best at this point to target stocks finding support for the first time after a breakout. Inside the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), names that fit the mold include **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH))and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), among others.

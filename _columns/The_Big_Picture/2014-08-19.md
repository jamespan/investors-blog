Stocks stayed in rally mode Tuesday, cheered by strong earnings and a bullish outlook from Dow component **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), benign inflation data and better-than-expected housing data.


The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each rose 0.5%, while the Nasdaq picked up 0.4%. The Nasdaq extended its winning streak to five sessions, while the S&P 500 closed within 10 points of its July 24 all-time high of 1991.


NYSE volume rose slightly from Monday's level. Nasdaq volume fell a bit.


Breadth was once again solid on the NYSE, with advancing stocks topping decliners by nearly 2 to 1. On the Nasdaq, it was less impressive, with winners topping losers by a 7-to-6 margin.


The summer doldrums are typically not the time when institutional investors pour money into the market, but it's never prudent to argue with the trend of the market, which is upward for now.


The IBD 50 rose 0.5%, helped by a strong showing from **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)). The drugmaker soared 16% after the Wall Street Journal reported that **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) has approached Salix about a possible merger to fend off a hostile $53 billion offer from **Valeant** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)).


The market liked news that July housing starts surged 15.7% to an annualized 1.093 million, well above expectations and the highest level since December's 6-1/2-year peak. Building permits, a gauge of future demand, also rose more than expected.


With the market back in a confirmed uptrend, it's important to target leading stocks in leading industry groups. Homebuilders do not currently fit the bill despite a day of outperformance Tuesday. Headed into Tuesday, IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group ranked 177th in IBD's 197 Industry Group Rankings (see table on B4).


**Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) is an institutional-quality name in the group, but it's still below its 50-day moving average after recent signs of institutional selling.


Tuesday's session yielded some strong moves. Chip designer **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) vaulted out of a 10-week base, rising 4%. It closed nearly 3% above a 53.41 buy point.


Meanwhile, **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) is a speculative China growth play, but it has several positive traits as it sets up in a cup-with-handle base. The Internet company operates an online classifieds marketplace in China.


Earnings are due Thursday before the open. Earnings are seen rising 33% from a year ago, with sales up 78% to $62.65 million.


Mutual fund sponsorship increased in the latest reported quarter, while the number of funds that added to their position outnumbered those that reduced their position.


IBD 50 component **Bonanza Creek Energy** ([BCEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCEI)) added 1% in light volume. It's working on a base-on-base pattern with a buy point of 63.04. The fast-growing oil and gas producer has operation in lesser-known areas such as the Wattenberg Field in the Rocky Mountains and the Cotton Valley sands in Arkansas.


Plenty of growth names are working now, but it's important not to get complacent. If a recent breakout that's working stops working, be diligent and don't let a big gain fade away. Just as important, don't let a small loss spiral out of control.

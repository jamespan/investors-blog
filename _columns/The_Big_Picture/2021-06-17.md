  Stocks Today Show Mixed Action; Will The Nasdaq Take Back The Lead?

Um, is there such a thing in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) as reverse-bifurcation?




The stock market has a knack for throwing people for a loop, and especially when there's meaningful news on stuff like interest rates, the Federal Reserve's view on monetary policy, and what inflation could look like down the road. Thursday was such a session.


You simply cannot judge stocks today as having a dull summer session when the S&P 500 ended the day down 2 points, or less than 0.1%. And the session carried even more meaning than the fact that the Nasdaq composite, up 0.9%, happened to mark its second highest close in history.


Rather, Thursday may have marked the start of a reversal in 2021 fortunes for major sectors â€” ranging from the metals plays to health care to old fashioned computer and information technology. The Market Pulse highlights a big scoop of both emerging new leadership and stocks that are quickly losing their strength.


Stocks Today: Watch The Rotation
--------------------------------


![MP061721](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP061721-180x300.jpg)


Preliminary data found that at least 15 of IBD's 197 industry groups rallied 1.5% or more. They include solar, enterprise software, fabless semiconductor, security software, medical services and internet retail issues.


A far larger number of industries, however, tanked 3% or more. Oil, steel, superregional banks, metal ores, gold mining and ship transport firms sold off hard as money went back into long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year government bond yield dropped nearly 6 basis points to 1.51%, Cboe data showed.


The iShares Transportation ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) ETF slid 2.1% and has barely a gain for the second quarter. (Please use the latest industry groups table at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to see more detail on the key rotation during the session.)


Year to date, the major indexes all hold decent gains after double-digit returns for most benchmarks in 2020. But while the Nasdaq has now revved its advance in the second quarter to nearly 6.9%, the gains by blue chips are souring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, dropping 0.6% on Thursday for its fourth straight loss, has now seen its Q2 rally get squeezed to 2.5%.


What a change vs. only a month ago.


On May 12, the Nasdaq got pummeled like a boxer on the ropes. It certainly looked like the tech-heavy composite index would breach the 13,000 level and go back to a loss for the year. In contrast, SPDR S&P 500 ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) dropped to its 50-day line, but still showed a respectable 8% rise since Jan. 1.


Dow Jones: Losing Steam
-----------------------


Meanwhile, the SPDR Dow Jones ETF ([DIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIA)) closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the second time in a row. That hasn't happened since early November.

The [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) remains an excellent tool in which to time your sells.



Take **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)). The fertilizer giant broke out in fine form right before Thanksgiving last year; shares bolted past a 20.30 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a relatively shallow cup. Six months later, the gains reached 88%.


But as a daily chart shows now, sellers hold the upper hand. On the weekly chart, the selling carnage might even look worse. Mosaic has now fallen 13% below its rising [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).


Leaders No Longer
-----------------


As noted in Thursday's [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live-Free-Access&intcode=hpspt%7Ccms%7Cibdlvfr%7C2021%7C05%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C749906&src=JA3813), careful observers of leading growth stocks saw [round trips of post-breakout gains](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/key-sell-signal-saved-stamps-com-stock-investors-from-posting-big-losses/) galore. Just view the likes of **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) and **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)).


Meanwhile, toy giant **Mattel** ([MAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAT)), **Westlake Chemical** ([WLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLK)), **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) and **Avient** ([AVNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVNT)) are showing weakening action. They all are getting thumped below their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).



On the flip side, companies such as **SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), and China EV innovator **Xpeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) are making more progress on [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). (Xpeng's pattern is pretty deep, though.)


**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), which took back a large chunk of losses in the prior two sessions, jumped nearly 3% after hours on May-quarter results that topped the consensus view. The [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) is aiming to stretch further past a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 525.54 in a [small cup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) lodged within a longer pattern.


Small caps underperformed on Thursday. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fund sank 1.2%. Midcap stocks fared worse; SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) slumped 1.6%.

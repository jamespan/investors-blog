With another milepost on interest rates coming later this week, the stock market took an opportunity to buy some beaten-up shares Monday.




Indexes spent most of the day making minor moves, but strengthened in the final hour of trading. The Nasdaq composite closed 0.8% higher. The S&P 500 rebounded 0.7% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%.


The three main indexes patched up Friday's losses, thanks to the late rally.


After gapping down on Friday, indexes have now closed at session highs for two days in a row. That's positive action, but too short-term to change the market outlook.


On Friday, IBD lowered its outlook from "uptrend under pressure" to "market in correction." This requires investors to raise cash, be quicker with sell signals and hold off on buying stocks until conditions improve.

In the MarketSmith 250 index, there's relatively few stocks up significantly from breakouts over the past several weeks. Many others have stalled around their entries. That's pretty typical for a market in correction, and it separates the great stock-pickers from everyone else.


Stock Market: Tanker Stocks Make Waves
--------------------------------------


Shipping tankers have been bucking the downtrend due to the European energy crisis, lifting into the third slot out of 197 industries. **Teekay Tankers** ([TNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNK)), **Tsakos Energy Navigation** ([TNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNP)) and **Frontline** ([FRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRO)) rallied about 6% to 12%. All three are extended from buy points.


Also typical of weak stock markets: imperfect bases. **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDX)), **Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) and **SM Energy** ([SM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SM)) are examples of [handles](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) that are getting a bit droopy.


Through Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had picked up more than a half-dozen [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).



Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq, although the Monday after a quadruple witching session always finds a drop-off in trading activity. Still, Nasdaq and NYSE volume Monday was below average.


Treasury Yields Hit 11-Year High
--------------------------------


The stock market bounced back, even as Treasury yields made multiyear highs.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed 4 basis points to 3.489%. That's the highest yield since April 12, 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The two-year yield of 3.946% was the highest since Oct. 17, 2007.


Last Tuesday, a hotter-than-expected consumer inflation report sparked a stock and bond sell-off. Investors face another key test Wednesday when the Federal Reserve announces its decision on interest rates.


Most traders expect the Fed to make another three-quarter point rate hike, bringing the Fed Funds rate to a target range of 3%-3.25%, from the current 2.25%-2.5%. More important will be Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments on the tightening path.


Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note Monday the firm expects the Fed's economic projections to indicate more rate hikes, slower economic growth and higher unemployment.


Data Not Supportive Of Fed Goals
--------------------------------


The latest data hasn't been friendly to Fed mandates for price stability and full employment, she says. That included last week's CPI report.


"The broad-based nature of this increase raised fears that inflation is becoming entrenched," Marcelli said. "We still think that underlying trend is toward slower inflation, but at this point it does not appear as though the Fed is on track to hit it's 2% inflation target on an acceptable timeframe."


IBD 50 climbed 0.5% — a small bounce for an index that's about 45% below its November peak. While its energy stocks were mostly lower, there was offsetting strength in a mix of other stocks.

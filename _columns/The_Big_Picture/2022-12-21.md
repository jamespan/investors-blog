Stock Market Gets Much-Needed Holiday Cheer; What These 5 Stocks Say About 2023 Outlook
========================================================================================

Do you believe in the Santa Claus rally? The stock market on Wednesday did not snuff out that idea, at least for a day.




After barely halting a mean-spirited four-session slide with a one-point gain on Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite's 162-point rally was good for a 1.5% rise Wednesday, perhaps putting Mr. Scrooge in the uncomfortable spot of standing next to the Wall Street bull and underneath some mistletoe.


Yet it's too early to tell if Old Ebenezer is ready and willing to embrace stocks.


For starters, one can see the Nasdaq remains well below the 50-day moving average on the daily chart, despite Wednesday's advance.


In a cheery stock market, the Nasdaq and its fellow indexes work their way above their 50-day lines, then stay above them for weeks or even months at a time.



Stock Market Today: Buried Under This Key Level
-----------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP122122-210x300.jpg)Plus, at 10,709, the tech-heavy index would still need to march at least 9.7% higher just to make a run at its downward-sloping 200-day moving average.


Jan. 14 was the last time the Nasdaq stood over this key long-term technical level, when the index closed at 14,893.


Meanwhile, the stock market on Wednesday saw the Russell 2000 outperform the Nasdaq, up almost 1.7%. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)), up 1.9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 1.6%, also outperformed. The Dow industrials gave thanks to component **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), with a 12% jump in heavy volume standing out as its largest single-day gain in 2022 so far. The Beaverton, Ore., sports and athleisure apparel and equipment giant surprised the Street in more than one way with its [November-ended fiscal second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-earnings-q3-nke-stock/).


The S&P 500 matched the Nasdaq's gain. At 3878, the large-cap benchmark closed one point above its own [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Volume shrank vs. the prior day on both main exchanges.


West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures enjoyed a 2.9% rally to $78.42 per barrel. Copper edged up 0.5%. The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond held steady at 3.68%.


To get a general sense of where relative strength lies within the stock market, compare the price action between the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 since Oct. 1.


Tale Of The Q4 Tape
-------------------



Since Oct. 1, the 500 holds a healthy 8.2% gain. Annualized, that would equate with a truly rosy-cheeked bull run. Plus, since Nov. 10, the index's 50-day moving average stopped falling and has bottomed out. It began to rise, albeit slowly, three weeks ago.


And what about the Nasdaq?


Through Wednesday, this key stock market benchmark has eked out just a 1.3% gain in the final quarter of the year.


Rebounds like that hardly eat into sharp losses for the year, which at one point topped 35%. The Nasdaq's 50-day line has bottomed, a good sign, but its advance-decline line is lacking vigor once again. See it on the large daily chart of the Nasdaq in IBD's General Market Indicators PDF, found at the bottom of every Big Picture column.



Leading Industries In Stock Market Today
----------------------------------------


Looking at the top 40 industry groups lately, you surely are not seeing Santa's sleigh filled with technology. Within the top 10, contract electronics and computer hardware stand out. Computer networking ranks 11th. The contract electronics group headed into Wednesday's session up 5.1% year to date, while computer hardware was off 14.6% and networking down 13.9%.


Meantime, energy, industrial, retail, food, medical and mining-related stocks pretty much round out the rest of the current leadership.


What about individual stocks? What do current leaders tell investors to do right now?


Consider these five names, all members of the MarketSmith Growth 250.


**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), up 2.4% on Wednesday: The large cap homebuilder has rebounded 51% since carving out the bottom of its long base at 59.25. Could builders keep rising even though the Federal Reserve has jacked short-term interest rates up from nearly zero at the start of the year, to a 4.25%-4.5% target range last week? The whole group deserves close watch.


**Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), up 1.6%: The steel producer refused to touch its 50-day line during last week's pullback. Gains have already hit 25% since it cleared a new base at 88.72.


**Sarepta Therapeutics** ([SRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRPT)), up 3.1%: The biotech has exited the 5% buy zone after clearing a 120.33 pivot point. The developer of RNA-based therapies is not yet profitable, but sales growth has ranged from 19% to 45% over the past eight quarters.


**Nutanix** ([NTNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTNX)), down 7% for the week so far: The member of IBD's gigantic and struggling enterprise software group has more than doubled since hitting lows near 14 in the summer. Can it form a new base within its ultradeep cup pattern?


**Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)), up 2.4% for the week: The fierce Nike rival recently hit its highest level since March. Could it break out to new 52-week highs before Nike does? The Manhattan Beach, Calif., shoe firm is expected to turn a 12% profit decline this year into a 34% gain to $3.05 per share in 2023.

Inflation Watch On Friday
-------------------------


Meanwhile, the new rally attempt faces another inflation data test on Friday. Before the stock market opens, the last traders manning equity desks across the country ahead of the three-day Christmas holiday will be eyeing closely the November personal consumption expenditures figures.


[Econoday shows a consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 0.2% growth in the PCE price index vs. October. That would mark deceleration from a 0.3% increase in October. Deceleration in inflation is expected year over year at 5.5% in November for the same index, vs. a 6% bump higher in October.


"The main thing we're watching is how strongly consumer spending continues to buttress inflation," Daniel Berkowitz, senior investment officer at Prudent Management Associates, told IBD. The Philadelphia-based firm has $1 billion in assets under management. He added that continued wage gains and a strong labor market could "keep a higher floor on where inflation will level off."


Berkowitz, who performed research on factor investing and alternative investments at Vanguard before joining Prudent Management, notes that his team sees the picture "darkening slightly" for corporate earnings in the fourth quarter. Currently, S&P 500 consensus estimates call for a 2% drop year over year. It would be much worse if you exclude the energy sector.


But he feels valuations for equities heading into the new year are "far more attractive" both in the U.S. and overseas.

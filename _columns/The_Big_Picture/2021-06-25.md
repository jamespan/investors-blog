The stock market capped off the week with mixed action Friday, as Treasury yields rebounded. The S&P 500 hit all-time highs for a second straight session, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaimed a key level.




The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded more than 3% Friday, settling above 1.53%, but still a far cry from its 1.76% March high. For the week, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed nearly 6%, snapping a five-week losing streak. Financials, which tend to benefit from rising yields, were the best performing S&P sector, up more than 1%.

The Nasdaq inched lower, while the S&P 500 gained 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrials outperformed with a 0.7% advance. The small-cap Russell 2000 moved up less than 0.1%. Leading growth stocks ended moderately higher on Friday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.4%. IBD 50 stock **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) advanced nearly 2% Friday, moving closer to a 486.82 buy point in a cup base. Roku is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watchlist, which identified an earlier 397.79 buy point.


Volume soared on the Nasdaq and the NYSE compared with Thursday's figures as the annual [Russell index reconstitutions](https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution) went into effect.

Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The past week's action underscores how quickly the stock market can change. Last week, the S&P 500 sold off 1.9%, closing below its key 50-day line. Now, the S&P 500 has hit record highs as the [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average bullishly regained its 50-day moving average, while the Nasdaq composite remains just off Thursday's record highs.


Following Friday's mixed action, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both have three distribution days, a modest amount of institutional selling. Investors should feel confident increasing their market exposure by purchasing top stocks with strong breakouts.


[IBD's stock market forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-next-six-months-poses-new-risks-for-investors/) for the next six months notes how shifting leadership may continue this year.

Stock Analysis: Nike
--------------------



[Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/nike-stock-nike-q4-2021-earnings/), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), is in buy range past a 148.05 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) following Thursday's [blowout earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-nike-q4-2021-earnings/), according to [IBD MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares surged 15.5% Friday, closing in the 5% buy zone that runs up to 155.45.


Late Thursday, Nike earned 93 cents a share, crushing estimates for 51 cents and swinging from a year-ago loss of 51 cents a share. Revenue soared 96% to $12.3 billion, topping views for $11.03 billion.


From a technical perspective, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) spiked to its highest level since mid-March.Â According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [NKE stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-nike-inc-cl-b-nke.aspx) shows a mild 52 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/), but that will surely improve after Friday's surge.

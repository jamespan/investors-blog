The stock market capped June with mild action, almost anticlimactic for a month that saw solid gains.




The stock market traded in a narrow price range in the final session of both the month and the second quarter.


The Nasdaq composite eased less than 0.2% Wednesday. The quiet session belied a strong June for the Nasdaq. It rose 5.5% — its best month since December. The index climbed seven of the past eight months.


The 2021 stock market is making nearly historic gains. Q2 marked the S&P 500's largest five-quarter percentage gain since the second quarter of 1936, according to Dow Jones. It's the longest winning streak since the fourth quarter of 2017.

The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 6% for the month and 11.7% in Q2. By comparison, iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) fell 2.5% in June and 4.7% in Q2. In the first quarter, the value fund was rocking, up 10.8%, while the growth ETF rose a paltry 0.8%.


No question, the technology sector was a big reason for the Nasdaq's June bloom, as software re-emerged as a market-leading sector. The iShares Exponential-Tech Software ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) jumped 8.7% in June after a lackluster performance earlier in the year. Software did better than chips, one of the [year's winning sectors with about a 25% gain](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jun-29-2021/). The iShares Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) rose 5% in June.


Underscoring the chip strength, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) jumped nearly 5% in heavy trading. Rival **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) is delaying production of a new chip, [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-delays-new-chip-in-first-setback-for-ceo-gelsingers-turnaround-effort-11624988292?mod=tech_lead_pos2) reported. Intel shares fell more than 1% and remain deep in a slump.


Dow Leads Stock Market
----------------------


The small-cap Russell 2000 also added less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 rose slightly more than 0.1% Wednesday. It was up 2.2% for June.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, nearly flat for June, led with a 0.6% increase Wednesday. The Dow closed above its 50-day moving average last Friday and every day this week so far. Still, it lags the other major indexes. Dow component **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) rose 2.7%. The retailer started selling its [private-label insulin at prices 50% lower than brand names](https://www.barrons.com/articles/now-on-sale-at-walmart-insulin-thats-cheaper-than-brands-from-lilly-sanofi-or-novo-nordisk-51624986367).


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared higher on the NYSE. The final session of a month or quarter often brings busy stock trading.


The S&P 500's May 25 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) got wiped off because it's now too far back in the calendar to have any relevance. That leaves this index with just two distribution days, and the Nasdaq with three. That's a tolerable amount of heavy institutional selling, and about expected for a stock market trading near all-time highs. The Nasdaq's drop was too small to be regarded as distribution.


The IBD 50 was down 0.6%. Several IBD 50 stocks fell more than 2%, including **Overstock.com** ([OSTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSTK)), off 5.5%.


With the stock market muted, only a couple of stocks made noteworthy breakouts.



Thinly traded **Lands' End** ([LE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LE)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in heavy volume. **SLM** ([SLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLM)), better known as Sallie Mae, cleared the 20.92 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/). Volume was flat, although the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is near highs.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) tried to break out of a [shallow cup with no handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), but hesitated. Shares closed at 136.96, below the 137.17 buy point, and volume was well below normal. Investors should be a bit more patient and wait to see if Apple can rally to new highs.


Chinese stocks were mainly lower despite the fact that the largest Chinese IPO since **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) in 2014 took place Wednesday.


China's largest ride-hailing company, **Didi Global** ([DIDI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIDI)), [went public](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/didi-ipo-uber-of-china-launches-initial-public-offering/) and met with gains. Shares opened at 16.65, 19% above the IPO price of 14 a share. Didi closed at 14.14, up 1%. The IPO raised about $4.4 billion, giving Didi a market capitalization of more than $67 billion. Often called the Uber of China, Didi has backing from Uber, **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) and **Softbank** ([SFTBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFTBY)).

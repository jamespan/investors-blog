  Indexes Reverse Higher, Repeat This Bullish Theme In The Stock Market

The stock market erased or trimmed losses Monday, extending a two-week rebound that follows the latest in a series of brief pullbacks in an otherwise superb run so far this year.




The Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% after wiping away an early loss of 0.6%. The composite has been rising smartly since it made a six-month high on April 1. At that time, the index put away the latest of several hiccups in which indexes have sold-off sharply, only to get back on their feet quickly.


March 22 was the latest trip-up, when the Nasdaq plunged 2.5%. Others sell-offs arrived on March 6-8 and Feb. 7. On Jan. 22, the Nasdaq had a fright of a 1.9% drop. In all these cases, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 erased losses and were back to making short-term new highs within a couple of weeks.


That's how the Nasdaq now finds itself nearly 20% higher since Jan. 1 and up a remarkable 28.5% from the Dec. 24 low. The S&P 500 is up 15.5%, after Monday's 0.1% increase. Trade uncertainty, worries of a global economic slowdown, an expected decline in S&P 500 profits and other issues have failed to knock the market off stride for long.

Institutional Selling In The Stock Market
-----------------------------------------


The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is diminishing. The March 4 distribution day on the Nasdaq was deducted because enough time has elapsed. That left the S&P 500 with five days of high-volume declines and just three on the Nasdaq.


But while indexes behave well, there's been a dry-up in the number of leading stocks breaking out of [good bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). That's depriving the market of some oxygen, but most leaders have not broken down.


Most of the top stocks made their moves to new highs in the first couple of months since the market bottom, as what historically tends to happen.


Enterprise software leaders **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) hit buy points in February and March, respectively. Large-cap software firms **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) are testing support at the 50-day moving average, which may create a [follow-on buy area](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) for these enterprise software leaders if they can rebound.


Boeing Hurts The Dow
--------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, its rebound falling short of the other major indexes. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) accounted for all of the Dow's nearly 84-point decline. Boeing shares slid 4.4% in heavy volume after the company decided to temporarily [slow production of the Boeing 737 Max](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-crash-ethiopia-report/) while the jetliner remains grounded and some customers reconsider orders.


Small caps also lagged, as the Russell 2000 fell 0.2%. But the index broke a trend of lower highs on Friday after it cleared the March 19 high. It is still about 9% below its prior high, well below the major indexes.


Profit And Sales Forecasts For Q1
---------------------------------


Earnings season is looming, and analysts are expecting weaker results. The market's reaction will be key in determining how much further the 2019 rally can extend itself.


First-quarter earnings are expected to fall 2.3% from the year-ago period, according to [Lipper Alpha Insight](https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/2019/04/sp-500-17q1-earnings-dashboard/?utm_source=Eloqua&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=00008DL_NewsletterLipperAlphaInsightWeekly&utm_content=Newsletter_InvestmentWeekly_9Apr2019&elqTrackId=54668fbbdce04e4484cc6b8fe9270b9f&elq=aba13d2540a045f4b0cf64503b7e48a6&elqaid=45102&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=165). Excluding the energy sector, earnings growth is estimated to drop 1.2%.


That's a big change from the 16.9% earnings increase for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter, and the 26.6%, 24.9% and 28.4% increases in the other three quarters of last year. Last year's big corporate tax cut, of course, helped boost those gains.


The revenue side isn't so bad, with expectations for a Q1 blended revenue increase of 4.9%. Excluding the energy sector, the revenue growth estimate is 5.5%. Revenues grew 5.1% to 9.5% in the four quarters of 2018, according to Lipper.

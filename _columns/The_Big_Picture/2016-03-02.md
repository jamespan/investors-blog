Will it be Hillary? Or will it be The Donald? Perhaps the market doesn't really care.


A day after strong results for both presidential candidates during Super Tuesday's primaries, stocks acted as they should during a confirmed market uptrend: Stumbling start. Strong finish.


The Nasdaq composite chipped away at a Wednesday morning loss that never topped 0.5% and closed up 0.3% in lighter trade. That's impressive action in light of Tuesday's 2.9% jump in heavier volume by the tech-heavy index.


The S&P 500 rose 0.4%. Small caps prevailed; the S&P 600 rallied 0.8%.

It's true that on Wednesday, the Dow utility average beat the majors, rising 0.7%. Yet consider these new developments:


-- Last Friday, the medical and consumer sectors shared the top spot in IBD's new high list, not utilities. On Monday and Tuesday, the electronics sector grabbed the crown.


-- Among the top 40 IBD industry groups, a fistful of nondefensive groups have climbed sharply over the past six weeks, from No. 19 industrial machinery (read the Industry Themes piece in Wednesday's IBD) and No. 21 wood products (see today's [Sector Leaders column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/top-building-stocks-work-on-bases-as-market-rebounds/)) to No. 30 computer hardware and No. 40 wireless telecom services.


-- The Dow transports are now fractionally higher year-to-date.


-- The NYSE advance-decline line continues to pump higher, following a more than 2-to-1 winners-to-losers ratio on that exchange Wednesday. As seen on the S&P 500 chart on Page B2, the line looks poised to take out its late-December peak.


With mild distribution so far on the books since the market's [Feb. 17 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-stages-another-follow-through-but-new-stock-highs-still-look-wafer-thin/), the overall action should boost the confidence of alert investors aiming to profit from strong breakouts out of good bases. Keep in mind that the wild gyrations of December and January have led to a few double-bottom bases, from **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) to IBD 50 names such as **AMN Healthcare** ([AHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AHS)) and **Citrix Systems** ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)).


Yet others, notably small caps in the building, materials, consumer and retail sectors, are also working on cup-style bases. They include some of the stocks noted in today's Market Pulse.


A strong February private-sector jobs report from ADP and news that China is restructuring its glut-producing steel industry (see today's Global Leaders story on Page B10) helped the U.S. stock market advance. Oil, steel and mining groups flooded the top of the day's best-performing industry groups as crude oil jumped 1%.


Investor psychology, meanwhile, is not overly bullish. The weekly Investors Intelligence survey found that roughly a third of pundits polled still do not believe that we are in a bull market. Worrying is good; major uptrends always climb a wall of worry.

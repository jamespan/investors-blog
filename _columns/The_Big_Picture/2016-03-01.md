Stocks Soar, Help To Solidify Uptrend; Nasdaq Up 2.9%
======================================================

Stock indexes surged Tuesday, providing a solid boost just when the market seemed ready to pause.


The Nasdaq composite led with a gain of 2.9%, its largest single-day advance of this year and the biggest since Aug. 26. The S&P 500 roared 2.4% higher.


Volume swelled, a sign that institutional investors aggressively acquired shares. Winners led losers by about 9-to-2 on the NYSE and by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq -- bullish numbers to be sure.


The IBD 50 rose 2.3%, which was its largest advance since Jan. 29.

The way the indexes ended Monday, it seemed like sellers would return to the warpath. The S&P 500 had closed back below its 50-day moving average, while the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 hit resistance near their 50-day lines.


But those anxious moments dissipated early Tuesday as indexes quickly added 1% in early trading and kept rallying into the close. The Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 punched through their 50-session averages, while the S&P 500 finished 2% above the 50-day line.


It was also a relief that Tuesday's rally came after back-to-back distribution days. The Nasdaq stalled Friday, and both indexes fell in higher volume Monday.


Still, if the indexes are doing their part, leading stocks haven't exactly been shouldering the load.


A screen of breakouts in the past few weeks shows most are still within 5% of their buy points, and a few have slid below entries. That's made the new uptrend frustrating, except for those who've used index ETFs to ride the advance.


The new breakouts are emerging from a different part of the market than in the last big uptrend. The former big-cap leaders such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are still recovering, while smaller stocks are asserting themselves.


Medical products, insurance, real estate investment trusts, utilities and retail are some of the industries with new leaders. The ones trading above buy points are overwhelmingly small-cap and midcap. Some big caps have topped buy points, although they tend to be defensive companies such as **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Coca Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **Altria Group** ([MO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MO)).


Encouraging reports from Asia and the U.S. helped spark the buying.


In India, a new budget from Prime Minister Narendra Modi sparked optimism, as the Sensex burst more than 3% higher. On Monday, China's central bank cut the reserve requirement for banks for the fifth time in a year.


On Wall Street, a solid construction spending report showed a 1.5% increase for January, above expectations for a 0.5% rise. That helped make heavy-construction stocks among the day's best performing segments. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index rose in February.


Auto sales in February were strong for most manufacturers, with **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) reporting a 20% leap in sales from the year-earlier period. But sales at **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) fell 1.5%, and scandal-hit **Volkswagen** ([VLKAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLKAY)) had a 13% drop in sales.

U.S. stock indexes piled on more losses Friday, as the S&P 500 initiated a crucial test at its 200-day line.




The Nasdaq fell 2.4% and the S&P 500 2.1%, while the Dow lost 1.8%. The small cap Russell 2000 fell 2.2%.


Volume rose across the board, according to preliminary data.


The S&P stopped its descent just above its 200-day moving average. The Nasdaq has a little more elbowroom, but both charts look troubled.


Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 suffered distribution Friday, which points to institutional selling.Â The negativity was sufficient to keep the uptrend under pressure.


Pressure From Trump
-------------------


President Trump provided most of the pressure on the stock market during the week.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates a quarter point, but the market's reaction was calm. The market appeared ready to coast into the weekend, but Trump soon provided the storm after the calm.


Trump on Thursday moved the U.S. closer to an all-out trade war as he slapped tariffs on China.


On Friday, Trump threatened to veto a $1.3 trillion spending bill, which would've led to a government shutdown Saturday. But later Trump signed the bill, citing the need to finance the military.


Lost In The Noise
-----------------


Lost in the Trump noise was a strong durable goods report. New orders on a month-to-month basis rose 3.1% vs. the consensus estimate of 1.7%.


The Trump-created noise was so strong that even Trump did not tweet about the durable goods report, which showed the biggest gain in eight months.


Stocks, meanwhile, did the best they could under the circumstances but there were few winners for the week.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, only seven posted a weekly gain. Five were energy-related. The others were gold miners and media periodicals.


The biggest losers were a mixed bag: steel, internet, air freight and superregional banks.


Put/Call Ratio
--------------


The put/call ratio closed at 1.25. Readings at or above 1.15 often point to a short-term low.


Coming up: The third take on Q4 GDP will be released before the market's open Wednesday. The previous two readings were 2.6% and more recently 2.5%.


Breakout attempts Friday were a study in frustration.


Variety retailer **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), oil and gas explorers **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) and **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), and industrial supplier **DXP Enterprises** ([DXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXPE)) all cleared buy points and then reversed to end under the entry.

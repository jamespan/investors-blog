Vicious Selling Whacks Stocks, But Put-Call Ratio Hints At Low
===============================================================

Stocks found nowhere to hide Thursday as losers led winners by a wide margin on both major indexes. The Nasdaq dropped 3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively.


The IBD 50 slid 2.5%.


Volume rose across the board.


Decliners led advancing issues by a more than 6-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and NYSE. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, only gold miners and alcoholic beverages rose 1% or more.

Certainly the usual rules apply: Avoid new buys; sell all stocks that drop 8% below the buy point; and sell any winning stock that threatens to become a loss.


However, some investors might be concerned about a bigger issue. Is a recession in the cards for 2016? Is that what this is about?


So far, the correction in the Nasdaq has reached 9% from its high in early December, while the S&P 500 has fallen 8% from its high in early November.


Those percentages alone aren't a huge concern. They are in line with the mostly mild pullbacks in 2013-15.


More disturbing, though, is the erratic action.


The Nasdaq chart has more the look of a Whac-a-Mole than an orderly retreat.


Even stocks that showed nonchalant sideways action, while bears ripped the rest of the market, are getting whacked now.


**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), which had been sketching a normal-looking flat base, slashed sharply south Thursday. Rival **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) had also been drawing a flat base. On Wednesday, it lost its 50-day moving average; on Thursday, it skidded to its 200-day line.


Some stocks are far enough off their highs that it's hard now to consider them leaders. For example, **Imax** ([IMAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMAX)) is 29% off its high.


However bad things look now, though, fear has an upside.


The put-call volume ratio closed at 1.23 Thursday, a level often associated with short-term bottoms.


Also, consider this: On a day when the Nasdaq lost 3%, only about 1 of every 3 stocks in the IBD 50 lost ground in rising volume. Shouldn't the bears have claimed more high-volume victims to accompany a 3% loss?


That could happen yet, but this is a time to stay calm and try to see clearly. Don't let either fear or hope guide your trades. Rely on proven rules based on research.

Nasdaq, China Stocks Lead Drop; Why This Factor Is Bigger Than Trade War, Trump News
=====================================================================================

The stock market underscored its weakened stance Friday, six weeks since the Aug. 13 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). A relatively mild morning decline instantly worsened on news that the White House is mulling additional hardball measures to get China to make a fair trade deal.




What factor, meanwhile, could spell more trouble for equities? Watch the truckload of economic data arriving next week. More whiffs of a serious slowdown may hurt sentiment even more.


Roughly two hours after the market open, the Nasdaq had a good shot at erasing mild opening losses. Then Bloomberg News reported at around 11:35 a.m. ET that the Trump Administration is thinking of ways to [limit investments from the U.S. into Chinese companies](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-white-house-portfolio-stock-flows-china/), including stripping Chinese firms from U.S. stock exchanges.


In the span of five minutes, the Nasdaq composite slid 47 points en route to a loss of more than 140 points at session lows. A mini-rally in the final 90 minutes provided little solace. The Nasdaq fell 1.1% Friday in higher volume to cap a 2.2% slide for the week. The Nasdaq added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) but also lost the Aug. 22 [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) due to time.

CLOSE




The tech-rich index dropped further below its 50-day moving average and posted its lowest close since Sept. 3. The S&P 500, off 0.5%, stayed on the north side of its 50-day line. NYSE volume rose.

The Russell 2000 dropped 0.8%. The Dow transports sank nearly 0.7% for a 1.1% weekly loss.


The rush of news from the White House came just a day after a key China trade official commended his U.S. counterparts for easing up on tariffs on Chinese imports.


Beyond China Stocks: Small Cap Sell-Off
---------------------------------------


Small-cap and midcap growth companies felt the most pain. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 2.6% to 32.03, marking its lowest close since June 3. The ETF saw its year-to-date advance shrink to 15.8%.


Blame **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) for much of that drop. The Paula Abdul-endorsed plastic surgery equipment innovator plunged 16% in the heaviest turnover in weeks.



China's online game and e-commerce behemoth **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and [former Leaderboard name](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Huya** ([HUYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUYA)) fell 2%, 6% and 9%, respectively.


The trio of stocks also saw volume pick up much heavier than usual.


Sellers pounded SPDR S&P China ([GXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GXC)) more than 2.2% lower as the ETF slumped further below its downward-sloping 50-day moving average.



Long-term holders of New Oriental Education, a large-cap consumer spending play, will want to especially keep an eye on how the stock handles itself after [undercutting the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in more than double its 50-day average turnover.


It's The Economy, Mr. President
-------------------------------


Friday's report of lower than expected 0.1% rise in U.S. consumer spending in August certainly did the market bulls no favors. Keep in mind, too, that earlier in the week, Wall Street strategists from coast to coast lamented the terrible reading on the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index last month.


Core capital goods orders, meanwhile, fell 0.2% in August vs. the prior month. That missed an [Econoday forecast of zero change](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). {Plus, core capital spending dropped 1.7% vs. year-earlier levels, a negative sign. The inventories vs. sales ratio reached a four-year high. (See more details on durable goods orders at the top of page A2 in the new IBD Weekly newspaper.)


Remember that the market is the sum of millions of investors' real-time decisions. If the smartest men and women on Wall Street sense the chances of recession are going skyward, we could see more high-volume selling. The S&P has already logged [four sessions of unusually heavy institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) in the past 10 sessions. One of them, Sept. 20, however was skewed by quadruple witching day of expiring options and futures.


[The economic calendar](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) is busy again the coming week as a new month rolls in. Watch for the September manufacturing survey from ISM and construction spending on Tuesday, the ADP private sector payrolls data on Wednesday and the September unemployment and payrolls report Friday.

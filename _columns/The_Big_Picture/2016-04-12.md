Just when the market uptrend was teetering, buyers came in to prop it up and keep it going at least one more day.


The major indexes erased early losses of as much as 0.5% and rallied into Tuesday's close.


The Nasdaq rose 0.8%. It not only made a bullish price reversal but it also climbed back above the 200-day moving average. The composite has yet to firmly establish itself above that line; buyers and sellers have skirmished around it for a couple of weeks.


The S&P 500 added 1% after erasing a small early loss. The Russell 2000 also climbed 1%. It's always encouraging when different classes of stocks participate in a day's advance. Just like the major averages, the Russell's advance has stalled. Its relative strength line has yet to show a clear upward trend, but at least it is making higher lows.


Volume rose, which helped the buyers' side.


![MP_041216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP_041216-153x300.jpg)The market has been advancing in below-average volume, a sign that institutional investors lack a big appetite for shares. Yet, the cumulative effect of price and volume may not be so bad:  The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at good levels, as show on their charts on Page B4.


While the market could breathe a sigh of relief Tuesday, growth-stock investors remain in a precarious position.


Indexes have come under some distribution. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have broken below price channels that started with the February lows. Leading stocks continue a mostly lackluster performance.


The global economy's outlook is cloudy. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund cut its world expansion forecast. It sees a prolonged period of slow growth and the risk of stagnation worldwide.


In the U.S., optimism among small-business owners [sank to a two-year low](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/nfib-small-business-confidence-hits-2-year-low/) -- a possible sign of a recession.


Energy stocks have steered the rest of the market much of this year, and it was the same on Tuesday. A report said Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed to freeze oil output unilaterally. Crude prices jumped to a four-month high.


But the technology sector lagged after a poor report in the networking industry.


**Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)) preannounced quarterly results that missed estimates and management cut its Q1 revenue outlook. Shares of the networking company tumbled 7% in heavy trading, deepening a long price correction.


Besides networking, software and chip industry groups were among the weakest.


It wasn't a sparkling session for leading stocks. The IBD 50 rose 0.5%, about half the business that the major indexes did.


Only a few high-rated stocks rose in substantial volume, while many more fell in active trading.


**Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) surged nearly 7% in volume more than 60% above average. The new issue is a rare winner among growth shares, up 14% from a breakout March 18. **Prestige Brands** ([PBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBH)) is up 5% from a 53.67 entry.

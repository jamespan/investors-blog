The pullback in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) perhaps cannot be understood without looking at the action in other key markets — namely long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds, crude oil and natural gas.




Yet while the decline in equities no doubt was broadly based, it lacked the qualities of sell-offs earlier this year that devastated the market's efforts to spark a new uptrend.


Early data on ThinkOrSwim showed falling stocks outpacing rising ones by almost a 3-1 ratio on the NYSE. But on the Nasdaq, losers upended winners by a much thinner margin of 5-4.


Stocks Today: Small Caps Hit Harder
-----------------------------------


Smaller companies led Wednesday's decline. That's typically the reaction to growing fear of a recession — or what's plaguing stocks today, the threat of long-term stagflation.


The Russell 2000, which rose above its falling 50-day moving average for the first time since mid-April with a 1.6% advance on Tuesday, fell 1.5% on Wednesday. Giving back nearly all of the prior session's nice gains? Disappointing for sure. Yet perhaps the small-cap gauge was due for a pullback. Heading into Wednesday's session, the Russell had rallied 4.4% since a [follow-through day in the Nasdaq composite on May 26](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-this-bullish-shift-3-top-stocks-that-look-intriguing/). The Russell had also climbed as much as 12.8% from its May 12 low.


Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund sank 1.9% on Wednesday. That nearly doubled a 1.1% drop for the S&P 500. The Nasdaq outperformed for the day, down 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average backtracked 0.8%. Volume rose 7% on the Nasdaq vs. Tuesday, marking a second distribution day. NYSE turnover edged nearly 4% lower.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP060822_2-222x300.jpg)MDY also got stiff-armed at its own [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Keep in mind that technically speaking, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have yet to challenge resistance at their 50-day lines. Such a test fared badly back in early April.


Earlier this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testified to Congress that the administration now thinks inflation will "remain high" much longer than initially thought in January. Meanwhile, the World Bank and the OECD have sliced their full-year economic growth forecasts. The former cut its 2022 growth estimate to 2.9% from 4.1%. In 2021, the global economy rose 5.7%.


Beyond the action in stocks today, West Texas Intermediate oil futures ramped up another 2.5% to surpass $122 a barrel. Oilprice.com reported that the Energy Information Administration is forecasting an 18% cut in oil output by Russia, a major producer, by the end of next year. But natural gas took a break from its white-hot streak. Futures dived 7% to $8.63 per million BTU.


Despite that drop, gas futures still show an astounding 143% gain since Jan. 1.


Meanwhile, institutions raised cash again in long-dated U.S. government bonds, sending yields up sharply. The yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year note closed above 3% again, rising 5 basis points to 3.02%. Already, higher interest rates are leading to a sharp cooling in mortgage lending activity.



Direxion Shares 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3X ETF ([TMV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMV)), which is leveraged to move three times the inverse of prices in 20-year bonds, turned in the day's best result on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). The half-size position jumped 2.4%.

Sell-Off Shakes Up This Industry Group
--------------------------------------


IBD readers who have done well in shipping transport stocks received a loud shot across the bow. Leaders in this group, led by a 14.7% hammering of **Zim Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) of Israel, dropped hard in heavy volume. Besides Zim, **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) (down 10.7%) undercut the 50-day line in heavy turnover.


A continued drop below this important level of technical support may justify taking profits and guarding against serious losses in newly bought shares.



**Eagle Bulk Shipping** ([EGLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGLE)), **Genco Shipping** ([GNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNK)) and **Golden Ocean** ([GOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOGL)) also deserve close monitoring. None of them closed below their 50-day moving average on Wednesday, but they all fell 7% or more. Eagle Bulk's turnover on Wednesday of 1.06 million shares jumped 135% above the stock's 50-day average. It also marked the heaviest volume on a down day for EGLE since its breakout from a saucer-style pattern on Feb. 10.


Was the sell-off driven by the plunge in natural gas? One cannot be totally sure. But waiting for the exact reason before selling can have severe consequences for your portfolio. That's why [sell rules for leading stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) are based mainly on technicals.


According to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), IBD's Transportation-Ship industry group turned in the day's worst decline, off 8.7%. Dairy products was second worst, falling 8%.


Other industry groups meeting a buzz saw of sellers included agricultural chemicals, trucking, specialty steel and alloys, steel producers and metal product distributors. These groups slid 4% or more.


Watch This Data
---------------


Going beyond the action in stocks today, investors will focus on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index, a key U.S. inflation report on Friday before the open.


[Econoday's consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) calls for a 0.7% rise in consumer prices for May vs. the prior month and an 8.2% year-over-year increase. In April the CPI index rose 0.3% vs. March and 8.3% year over year. Core consumer prices are also likely to show outsize gains.

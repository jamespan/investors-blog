Will it? Or won't it?


Does it really matter?


The financial media — as well as a few baseball cap-toting floor traders on the NYSE — love to celebrate and hype up the possibility of Dow 20,000. While it's fun to do so, the far more important discussion should revolve around whether the market is showing healthy action or is ready to take a break.


With just six trading sessions left in 2016 and trading clearly slowing down ahead of the three-day Christmas holiday weekend, making a conclusion may be a little challenging.


However, regardless of the market schedule and the time of the year, an astute investor can make a reasonable judgment on the proper amount of exposure to the market each day, based on what the market is actually doing on a daily basis.


On Wednesday, the small decline across the board in lighter turnover was pretty much the type of downside action that long investors should prefer.![mp122116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP122116-215x300.png)


The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.2%, and the S&P 500 fell the same. Small caps surrendered roughly three times that amount, as the Russell 2000 fell 0.6%.


Yet the stocks with market caps ranging from $500 million to $3 billion or so certainly have a lot more gains to give back in 2016.


The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial firms in that all-electronic exchange (that is, you won't see any Nasdaq floor traders wearing "DOW 20,000" hats), edged 0.1%. lower.


The Dow industrials, making an intraday high of 19,986, fell less than 0.2%.


The Russell 2000 is up 21% since Jan. 1, while the Dow 30 blue chips are up 14%.


As seen in the IBD Market Pulse table, IBD had to really scrape the bottom of the barrel to find "leaders up in volume" or those that fell in heavy trade. Most of the names featured are not among the real market movers.


The broader view of the market, however, gives the sense that leading sectors, industry groups and individual stocks appear to have the right blend of fundamentals, technicals and institutional sponsorship required to keep the rally going into 2017.


No question that some commodity-linked stocks have been taking more than a quick breather following the euphoria-like rush into stocks in the first several days after the Nov. 8 elections. The sharp drop in copper prices and the pause in WTI crude oil futures reflect continued strength in the U.S. dollar and uncertainty of demand in various regions of the world.


Yet stocks such as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) (extended far past recent buy points), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) (gearing for a potential new breakout), recent new Stock Spotlight name **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)) of China, chip equipment leader **Applied Materials ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT))**, recent new software IPO **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and many others represent robust strength in the tech sector.


The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) give you good yardsticks for how leaders are acting.


Have you looked at the big runs by Dow 30 components **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) lately? Even while it makes complete sense to pocket some gains following their late summer to early autumn breakouts, one would be justified in sitting on shares until clear institutional selling emerges.


At 241.44, Goldman is up 40% past a 172.52 buy point within a long bottoming base pattern (see links below to related stories in IBD's Investor's Corner column). Morgan has flown 33% past a 65.08 cup-with-handle entry within its own long bottoming base. Both ranked in the [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), available in the IBD Weekly print edition and every day at Investors.com (look under the [Stock Lists](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) section).


As noted in several Stock Market Today columns this week, the market will closely eye a raft of economic data on Thursday. Watch to see how that affects the bond markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield continues to hover near its September 2014 peak.


In the early 1980s, former Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker jacked up interest rates furiously in order to cure the economy of its hyperinflation flu. Today, as the Fed envisions perhaps three additional rate hikes in 2017, the pace of increase in the cost of money is likely to be much milder this time around.


Yet in the eyes of Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at Los Angeles-based money manager Payden & Rygel, the "biggest scare in 2017" is the possibility that inflation will turn sharply higher.


"It seems like just yesterday that all we would hear about was lower inflation and the ever-present threat of deflation. Ah, the memories," Cleveland wrote in a note shared exclusively with IBD. "With oil prices hovering well above year-ago levels by Q1 2017, we expect to see an 'inflation scare' spook financial markets. Questions will abound as to whether the Fed is 'behind the curve.' "


Cleveland also declares that amid the continued progress seen in the labor market, wages still have plenty of room for growth. Higher pay has been seen as the "missing piece" of the labor market recovery, yet Cleveland expects "2017 to feature the best wage growth in a decade. Implications: great for the consumer and overall economic growth prospects."


In other words, there are reasons for optimism and caution in the next year. Let the market sort investors' emotions out, one day at a time.

  Stock Market Sinks Amid Rising Treasury Yields; Will The Bond Sell-Off End The New Uptrend?

[The stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) can act wacky, sometimes, right? You've likely heard that bad news on the economy is sometimes good for equities? Perhaps Wednesday's session illustrated how good news can be bad.




Stocks had a soft start, then began tanking roughly 30 minutes into the session. At that moment, the ISM services index came in stronger than expected. A 54.5 reading for August jumped well ahead of the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 52.4. It also accelerated from a 52.7 for July. With 50 as a neutral reading, the data suggested that the American economy has no intention of slowing down — at least in the short term.


And that "good news" ended up being "bad" for the stock market. Why?


Bond investors reacted negatively to the good news on the economy. They sold long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note up to as high as 4.30%. The yield ended at 4.29%, up 2 basis points. For the third quarter, the 10-year yield has jacked up as much as 55-one-hundredths of a percentage point, or 55 basis points.


When interest rates go up, bonds get more competitive with stocks. The annualized dividend yield for the S&P 500? A paltry 1.5%.


Also, the cost of money, in other words, rose as the economic news spurred a higher chance that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates by at least a quarter point at their November meeting.

Stock Market Today: Rates Matter A Lot
--------------------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP090623-235x300.jpg)According to CME FedWatch calculations, while the probability of a rate hike is near nil at the central bank's meeting on Sept. 20, it climbed to almost 50% at the meeting slated for Nov. 1.


Currently, after four rate hikes so far this year, the fed funds rate stands at a 5.25%-5.5% target range. That's the highest level since January 2001.


Back then, the stock market was in the middle of its worst declines ever, at least for Nasdaq-listed technology companies.


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq composite lost nearly 1.1%, a little worse than a 0.9% slip by the Nasdaq 100. The latter index compiles the action of that exchange's 100 largest nonfinancial firms.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 0.7%, much bigger than a 0.3% dip by the Russell 2000. Another small-cap gauge, the S&P SmallCap 600, edged 0.2% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.6%.


Volume cooled by a touch vs. the prior session on both main exchanges.


Technically Speaking
--------------------


While the S&P 500 finished off its intraday low, at 4465 it still dropped below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The stock market is widely considered to be healthy when the major indexes are trading above their [50-day lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), not below them.



Over the past three weeks, the S&P 500 actually spent quite a lot of time beneath the 50-day moving average.


That wasn't considered to be so negative. Since March, the S&P 500 had advanced nearly 21% over a 4-1/2 month period. That's an excellent run, no doubt. It and the rest of the stock market needed to take a break. That said, after Wednesday's action, the Dow industrials, Dow Jones transportation average, Russell 2000 and S&P SmallCap 600 are now all below their respective 50-day lines.


How about the Nasdaq composite? At 13,872.47, it stands a mere 8 points above the 50-day line. But the fact that it has eaten away all of its modest gains after the [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) took place on Aug. 29 has to be at least a little discouraging.


So, while the indexes themselves are actually not trading too far from year-to-date highs, stock pickers may benefit from being cautious in adding exposure.


Indeed, the [IBD current outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) still calls for a recommended stock market exposure of 20% to 40% for now.

Problems For Retailers?
-----------------------



The stock market sell-off actually looked a lot worse at around 1 p.m. ET. An hour afterward, stocks continued their mild bounce following the Fed's release of its latest Beige Book survey of regional economic activity. Indeed, the summary painted a mixed picture.


While tourism spending was "stronger than expected," the report noted "other retail spending continued to slow, especially on nonessential items." Plus, some districts "highlighted reports suggesting consumers may have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending."


Considering how the stock market acted Wednesday, these anecdotes really matter for IBD readers.


Among IBD's daily monitoring of 197 industry groups, some of the day's worst performers came from the retail space. They included home furnishings, down 2.8% based on early data; internet retail, off 2.3%; automakers, falling 1.9%; department stores, sliding 1.8%; and leisure products, losing 1.5%.


Other industry groups taking hard hits Wednesday included regional banks, solar energy, agricultural chemicals, generic drugs and metal ores. (Please see the entire data on all 197 industries at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)

Will Spending Cool?
-------------------


"With job growth being subdued and businesses struggling to pass along cost pressures to a tapped-out consumer, the cursory announcement of a higher GDP expectation for Q3 becomes a real head scratcher," Alex McGrath, chief investment officer at NorthEnd Private Wealth in Greenville, S.C., said in a comment emailed to IBD.


"Should these conditions continue to persist, it is our belief that the markets will struggle to close out the year as consumers continue to find themselves under spending pressure with increases in everyday goods, student loan payments restarting and all excess savings from the Covid era all but wiped out," he added.


Viewing the year-to-date performance, one could conclude there's a dichotomy within the gigantic retail and consumer spending sectors of the stock market.


More than two dozen of IBD's industry groups show a price-weighted gain of 30% or more since Jan. 1. Travel booking, movies, homebuilding and retail automobiles make this list.


Also, don't count out the tech sector just yet. The No. 1 performer right now: Computer-Hardware/Peripherals, up 114% year to date. Database software (up 54%), semiconductor equipment (up 52%), desktop software (51.7%), internet content (44.7%), data storage (39%) and design software (36.6%) have also performed fabulously.


Breaking Bad
------------


What about the bearish end of the spectrum?


The worst industry group year to date? Drugstores, a tiny group of just five stocks. Yet it's down 33.6% since Jan. 1.


Other poor performers include superregional banks (down 33.3%), jewelry retailers (-23.7%), discount and variety retail (-19.4%) and specialty retail (-13.8%). Other regional bank and telecom groups have also done badly in 2023 so far. The electric power utility industry group is down 15.1%, vs. a 16.4% rise by the S&P 500.


Looking at the sector-classified IBD stock tables, the Retail sector ranks in the top half of 33 broad industry sectors at No. 13, with an 11.6% lift so far this year on a price-weighted basis.

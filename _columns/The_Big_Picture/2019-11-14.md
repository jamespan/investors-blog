The stock market ended Thursday's trading session well off the day's lows. The S&P 500 closed with a modest gain, while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrials finished just below their break-even levels.




The Nasdaq composite edged less than 0.1% lower after falling as much as 0.5% at its session low. The S&P 500 rose nearly 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a slight loss of just one point.


In the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/), strength in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) — up 1.4% — helped make up for [sharp losses](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-earnings-csco-cisco-stock-q32019/) in **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)). [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock [Disney](https://www.investors.com/research/disney-stock-buy-now/) notched a record high Thursday, but reversed 1% lower by the close. The media giant ended just below a 147.25 buy point. Meanwhile, tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) suffered a [rare analyst downgrade](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-lower-earnings-walmart-cisco-apple-stock-downgrade/).


Volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE was lower relative to Wednesday's turnover.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP111419-249x300.jpg)](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) gained 0.4%, easily beating the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. The index of top growth stocks is nearing its highest level since Oct. 15, as it looks regain its 200-day moving average after spending more than two months mainly below that key level.


On Tuesday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 notched record highs, while the Dow hit a record high on Wednesday. On a positive note, there hasn't been any [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) (distribution days since Oct. 31. The market's advance may have slowed, but it's not exactly threatened so far.


IBD 50 Handily Outperforms
--------------------------


Our index of leading growth stocks — the IBD 50 — easily outpaced the major stock indexes Thursday amid strength in [IPO stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) and **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)).


InMode rallied more than 6% to hit an all time-high. Shares are well-extended beyond a 29.48 buy point. It makes sense to take some profits in the new issue given its volatile nature.


[Stock Spotlight stock](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/stocks-to-watch-copart-stock-finds-key-support-level/) Copart found support at its 50-day line on Monday. Shares reached a new high, rising more than 2.5%. Brazilian payment processor StoneCo extended a win streak to five trading sessions with a 2.7% gain.


Stock Market Lesson — Universal Display Stock
---------------------------------------------



It can be intoxicating to buy a stock before the proper buy point because "you just know" it's going to go higher, so why wait for the real entry? With that "precognition" in mind, it can be difficult to exhibit patience when dealing with a top growth stock. But rules are rules. Take a look at IBD 50 stock **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)). The stock appeared to break out above a handle on Nov. 12 with a 203.56 buy point.

But take a closer look and you'll notice that there are only four trading days in the handle area. A handle requires at least five trading sessions to be considered proper. Meanwhile, the weekly chart shows no handle at all. This was an aggressive entry, no doubt.


The stock's price action has eased since Tuesday and potential buyers on that day are sitting with a small loss. Meanwhile, a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) appears to be emerging. If the current week closes with a weekly loss, then a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) will form with a 208.11 entry. Remember, as an investor, you don't want the lowest price — you want the right price at the right time.


Another potential downside is the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). It is sharply off its old highs. Look for that to improve in the near future.

Bulls And Bears Both Find Reasons For Hope In Market
=====================================================

Stocks kept to a tight range Friday as the indexes added small gains.

  

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 0.2% each, while the small-cap Russell 2000 popped 0.8%. The IBD 50 gained 0.3%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

If bulls were looking for hope this week, they found it in the way the indexes recovered from Monday's whipping. The Nasdaq opened the week with a 1.3% loss and then reduced it to a sliver. The S&P 500 erased Monday's 0.7% loss to pencil in a 0.4% gain.

  

Bears had to be disappointed with the lack of follow-up selling, but they too found consolation.

  

Namely, recent hesitation in the market is leaving chart watchers wary.

  

The market appears incapable of anything beyond small daily gains. It's been five weeks since the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 notched a daily gain of 1% or more in rising volume. This suggests that institutions are not accumulating shares heavily.

  

If the uptrend is to avoid rolling over, the indexes are going to have to show more life.

  

On Friday, there were a few breakouts but some of dubious quality. **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) retook a 17.51 buy point in fast trade. **SunTrust Banks** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)) gapped past a 40.05 handle in big trade. Thinly traded **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) found late volume after previously clearing a 47.84 entry.

  

The day's quality move probably belonged to **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)).

  

Starbucks thrust to a new high in 65% stronger volume. On Nov. 24, the Big Picture alerted readers to Starbucks' late-volume breakout the session before. The stock could have been bought at the next day's open less than 3% above the 77.77 buy point.

  

An investor who bought would now be up 4%. Granted, that's not much to cheer about.

  

Starbucks' action, though, points to one of the difficulties of this uptrend. Opportunities are fleeting and require quick action under foggy circumstances.

  

Once action is taken, it may take weeks to discover if the opportunity truly was fruitful.

  

Breakouts in recent weeks have been slow to build a decent cushion. This makes the stocks tougher to hold because small gains can vanish in a flash.

  

Economic news was bullish Friday. November payrolls rose 321,000, surpassing the consensus estimate by a stunning 40%. But October factory orders were worse than expected.

  

The coming week features quarterly earnings reports from home furnishings retailer **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and homebuilder **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)).

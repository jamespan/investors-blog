Stock Market Ends Week With A Flourish But Note This Flaw; Inflation Data Lifts All Boats
==========================================================================================

The stock market heads into the Memorial Day holiday weekend on a high note after some encouraging inflation data aided sentiment. But there are still indicators the current bullish action could be fragile.




Volume was split, rising on the Nasdaq and, based on early data, declining on the New York Stock Exchange. The fact that it was not aggressively higher is a disappointment. It certainly has to show more upside conviction if this is to be more than a mere relief rally. At the same time, volume tends to fall on the day before a holiday weekend.


Nevertheless, overall market action was pleasing. The Nasdaq benefited in an outsize way, closing the session up 3.3% amid outperformance by tech stocks. It has now clambered above the 21-day exponential moving average, though it remains 6% below the key 50-day moving average. It closed the week with a meaty 6.8% gain.


The S&P 500 also had a good day as it closed up 2.5%. While it remains rooted below its major moving averages, it is now soundly above the 21-day line. The index is now positive for the month, an encouraging sign given recent turmoil.


[The S&P sectors all made progress.](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP052722-272x300.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) The beaten down consumer discretionary area actually fared best, a mere hair ahead of technology. The defensive consumer staples and utilities sectors turned in the lightest gains.


The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was the weakest of the major indexes. Even so, it rose 1.8% Friday.


Small Caps Shine On Positive Inflation Data
-------------------------------------------


Small caps have a long way to go to recovery in 2022. However the Russell 2000 shone Friday as it gained 2.7%. The index has a long ways to go before it retraces its loss of nearly 16% so far for the year. Growth stocks also battled back, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) popping 2.3%.


Stocks were aided Friday after core personal consumption expenditures — the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation indicator — rose 4.9% in April, slower than March's 5.2% increase.


With economic data also softening of late, this raises hopes the Federal Reserve may slow the pace of fiscal tightening.

These Industry Groups Shine; What To Do Now
-------------------------------------------


Keeping track of the best performing industry groups can offer crucial clues as to what areas could outperform amid a new uptrend.


On Friday, specialty retail, auto manufacturers, solar energy and computer software design industry groups all had good days. Fabless semiconductor stocks were also strong.


At the other end of the scale, coal stocks, which have been relative winners in 2022, office supply retailers, newspapers and tobacco were among the worst performers.


The fact stocks have now snapped a seven-week losing streak is encouraging, but investors should continue to exercise appropriate caution as they look to take advantage of the nascent uptrend.


Look to take out smaller pilot positions in strong leaders that are breaking out of strong bases. More than ever, earnings are important. Speculative growth stocks that have yet to turn a profit have been beaten down badly and remain among the most vulnerable to any downturns.

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 pushed into new high ground Friday as the stock market generally liked what it saw in the June jobs report. Inflation fears stayed on the back burner, fueling another drop in the 10-year Treasury yield. It fell 5 basis points to 1.43%, the lowest level since early March.




The Nasdaq 100 also hit a new high, up nearly 1.2%, on news [the economy added 850,000 jobs in June,](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-heats-up-in-june-jobless-rate-rises-sandp-500/) much better than the consensus estimate of around 700,000. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 5.9%. Economists expected a decline to 5.6%. Wages increased 0.3% from May. Year-over-year, wages rose 3.6%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average marked an all-time closing high, rising 0.4%, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 gained 0.8% each. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 1%. Volume fell from Thursday's levels ahead of the three-day weekend.


Stock Market Leadership
-----------------------


![MP070221](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP070221-260x300.jpg)Large-cap technology stocks continue to see the bulk of the money flow. [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks like **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) are trending nicely.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), meanwhile, ended the week still in buy range from a 137.17 buy point, but it's been a low-volume breakout so far. Apple suppliers **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) have also been attracting buyers lately.


The VanEck Vector Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) held up well even after the Federal Trade Commission accused computer chip supplier **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) of illegal monopolization. Broadcom shares reversed lower on the news, but the stock held support at its 50-day moving average. Broadcom is a top-10 holding of the chip ETF.

The ETF still looks good technically as it holds near highs and above short-term support levels and the 250 level. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line might be flattening out, indicating weaker breadth, but leadership continues to broaden out in the chip sector.


Some Growth Stocks Pressured
----------------------------


If your growth portfolio has been struggling lately, you're not alone. While there's still plenty of healthy stock charts out there, Friday was a mirror image of Thursday, when several top-rated growth stocks came under pressure. After falling 1.5% Thursday, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost another 1.7% Friday after heavy selling in several stocks.


**Cricut** ([CRCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRCT)), **Smith & Wesson** ([SWBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWBI)) and **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) suffered double-digit percentage declines in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), while 360 **DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) slumped nearly 8%.


No doubt it's become a more challenging environment for growth investors. Tread cautiously with new buys and don't be afraid to cut bait if a new buy doesn't turn out as planned.


The second quarter was a busy one for [IPOs](https://www.investors.com/iponews), the busiest since 2000 in fact. Some might argue that a large number of IPOs indicates market frothiness and raises the likelihood of a stock market pullback. Maybe so, but having a watchlist of high-quality IPOs still makes sense.


Enterprise software firm **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)), featured in Friday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/monday-com-stock-of-the-day-forms-ipo-base/), just completed a three-weeks tight pattern, while other new issues like **ZipRecruiter** ([ZIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIP)), **Procore Technologies** ([PCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCOR)) and **Semrush** ([SEMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEMR)) continue to show strength.

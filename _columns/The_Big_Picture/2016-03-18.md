Stocks posted moderate gains Friday as the major indexes rose for the fifth week in a row.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each advanced 0.4% Friday, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.7%. The IBD 50 edged up 0.1%.


Volume rose sharply on both major exchanges. Friday was a quadruple expirations day, which usually boosts trade.


The S&P 500 wiped out its sole distribution day because of price gains. That leaves the Nasdaq as the only source of distribution, five days days on that index -- a rather odd divergence.


Yes, the indexes have gone up for five weeks in a row. The Nasdaq has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 over the five weeks, up 11% vs. 10% for the S&P 500, even as the Nasdaq picked up far more distribution days over that span of time.


The indexes also are behaving somewhat differently in relation to support lines.


The S&P 500 is 2% above its 200-day moving average after rallying above it the past week, while the Nasdaq remains 2% below its 200-day line.


What should investors make of these divergences?


![MP031816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP031816-140x300.jpg)Generally, when the word “odd” accurately describes the stock market, it’s not a good sign. However, rather than strain for a conclusion, individual investors might want to be ready for either a market pullback or at least a pause.


In the past three years, the Nasdaq has risen five weeks in a row five times. Only twice was there a sixth up-week. But what’s a week worth?


More important, investors might wonder what happened in a broader sense. In one case, a roughly 15% gain followed after the fifth weekly gain. Another time, sideways action followed. But three times, losses of roughly 10% to 17% followed.


So, individual investors should be ready to take profits if necessary.


Leaders showed more action on the up and down sides Friday, as the Market Pulse above shows.


Several scored new highs, or even breakouts in the case of retailer **Ollie’s Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and home and condo builder **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)).


For the week, the Dow gained 2.3%; the IBD 50, 1.5%; the S&P 500, 1.4%; and the Nasdaq, 1%.


On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the final figures on Q4 GDP. The first take in January was 0.7%, which was revised to 1% in February.

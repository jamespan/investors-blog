Stocks rebounded Monday, but the session showed some underlying softness.

  

The S&P 500 climbed 1%. It closed near its session high and erased nearly half of last week's loss. But the Nasdaq closed near the low of the day's trading range, with a 0.8% gain. The tech-heavy index was up as much as 1.3% at Monday's high.

  

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average rallied 1.1%. Small caps lagged, as the Russell 2000 rose 0.6%.

  

There wasn't much change in the Ukraine-Russia situation. But the New York Fed's Empire State index rose to 5.61 in March, below forecasts, but new-order and shipment gauges also increased. The Fed's industrial production survey for January topped expectations.

  

Breadth was positive Monday, with winners beating losers more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE and a little less than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. New highs vastly outpaced new lows.

  

But volume tumbled across the board from Friday's pace. Trade ended below average on both major indexes. The Nasdaq saw its lightest session since Feb. 10.

  

Whether you're dealing with an individual stock or a major market index, volume is a sign of conviction behind a move. So Monday's volume wasn't inspiring, suggesting that big buyers did not return to the market after last week's sell-off.

  

Monday marked only the third increase on the Nasdaq in the past nine sessions, and all three gains have come in lower volume than the prior day.

  

But Monday's light trading may have been due to nervousness ahead of the Fed's two-day meeting that starts Tuesday. Investors will be waiting to see if the central bank will stay on course to trim bond purchases by $10 billion a month.

  

Monday saw some lackluster action in a few highly rated stocks. **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) and **Sierra Wireless** ([SWIR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWIR)) tried to break out. Old Dominion had decent volume, but closed slightly below its buy point at 57.10.

  

Sierra lacked proper volume for a breakout and also closed below the 24.75 buy point.

  

The IBD 50 jumped 1.3%, with 44 components higher on the session. But only 14 scored gains in above-average trade.

  

**Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) hit a new high in heavy trade. It's now 13% past a 48.10 buy point from a cup-without-handle base. 

  

**Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) also scored a new high in above-average turnover and closed back above the 60 level, where some resistance had developed.

  

So, despite Monday's strong price rebound, the market's uptrend remains under pressure.

  

Investors are still OK to buy leading stocks coming out of bases or from secondary setups. But there is higher risk until the market outlook improves.

A global stock sell-off Tuesday spread to Wall Street, deepening this month's decline in the U.S. indexes.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 skidded 1.7%. Both indexes closed at session lows as the S&P 500 erased all gains for the year. It was the second tumble of more than 1% in three days for the major indexes.

  

Volume rose sharply, which meant Tuesday's losses resulted in a new distribution day. That made it five times in the past eight sessions that at least one major index fell in higher volume. That indicates a rapid exit from stocks by institutional investors.

  

Tuesday's selling was heaviest in European bourses, where the FTSE 100 tumbled 2.5% and France's CAC 40 slid 1.1%. Asian stocks also were broadly lower.

  

The European Central Bank began its stimulus program, as bond yields hit record lows in several European countries, according to data from electronic trading platform Tradeweb.

  

Although the case can be made that the U.S. economy is on better footing, there's a strong association between U.S. and foreign stocks. The S&P 500 has an 86.2% correlation to Europe, Asia and Far East equities, according to research from Convergex.

  

On Wall Street, losing stocks topped winners by roughly 3-to-1.

  

Fear surged, judging by the heavy trading in put options. The put-call volume ratio spiked to 1.13.

  

That actually could be a good omen: For more than a year, market bottoms have tended to coincide with elevated readings in the put-call ratio. (The ratio is plotted below the [Nasdaq chart](https://www.investors.com/pdf/GMI_031115.pdf).)

  

On another level, there's some reason for hope in the behavior of leading stocks.

  

Few leaders have flashed clear sell signals, and a solid majority of those that broke out in the past couple of months are trading above the buy points.

  

Trouble is, there are plenty of lower-quality stocks that haven't been able to get airborne from their entries, and some others that have fallen below those critical levels. Sizable winners are scarce.

  

On Tuesday, **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) plunged after **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) announced it would launch its own version of clobetasol, Akorn's best-selling skin cream. Akorn shares erased all gains from a 44.40 handle buy point, triggering a sell signal.

  

The IBD 50 fell 1.2%, which reflected the leaders' relative strength. Volume was below average for more than half the stocks. On average, volume on the IBD 50 increased 14%, although that includes huge increases for Akorn and **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), which was off 3%.

  

Remember, the market is under pressure. Because the broad indexes lord over individual stocks, institutional selling tends to spill over to the leading stocks.

  

Thus, investors should be making adjustments. One way is by taking some profits, especially stocks in which they have a profit of 20% or more. Cutting losses short is imperative.

  

Just as major selling was limited in the IBD 50, the [IBD Leaderboard stocks](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) also held up well. Six of the nine fell less than the broad indexes, and most of those saw below-average volume.

  Indexes Reverse Higher As Leadership Is Rocked; Did Market Put In A Bottom?

There was some relief for investors Monday after the major indexes reversed higher, but stock market leadership convulsed in a bad day for cyclicals.




The S&P 500, which had sunk as much as 1.7% midday, closed 0.6% higher. The Nasdaq composite turned a 0.9% loss into a 1.3% gain as it led the market's rebound.


Market optimists will appreciate that the S&P 500 bounced around the 4200 level, roughly where the index made lows in January, February and March. The Nasdaq's low Monday also occurred in the neighborhood of its February and March bottoms.


That suggested the stock market could have found a bottom. But it's too early to tell. The market must first start a rally attempt.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP042522-235x300.jpg)It's also true that indexes appeared oversold and were due for a bounce after the Nasdaq slid 10% the past three weeks. That's the equivalent of a market correction, and the composite is still more than 20% below its November peak — what Wall Street typically calls a bear market.


The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) jumped to 1.08 on Monday. While that's not excessive, it was the most bearish ratio since Jan. 21. Remember, this contrarian indicator tends to flag bottoms when it climbs to extreme levels such as 1.15 or higher.


Stock Market Still Faces Risks
------------------------------


To be sure, the stock market has suffered deep wounds and faces formidable risks, including geopolitical strife, inflation and rising interest rates. (Even a 75-basis-point rate hike or two is in discussion.) For now, investors should raise cash and avoid new stock purchases.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average made its own bullish reversal, ending with a 0.7% gain. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher in the NYSE also.


Sentiment appeared to improve in afternoon trading as **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) announced it [agreed to a buyout deal](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-jumps-as-it-agrees-to-deal-with-musk/) from **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) CEO Elon Musk valued at $44 billion. Just days ago, Twitter had adopted a poison pill to thwart the deal. But the social media company embraced the offer over the weekend and confirmed it at 2:50 p.m. ET. Twitter closed 5.7% higher.


There was more to the story of Monday's trading in individual stocks. Dozens of stocks in energy, fertilizers, insurance, steelmaking and other sectors that had been leading the stock market as late as last week came apart Monday.


Energy Stocks Roiled
--------------------


In the energy sector, **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), **Suncor Energy** ([SU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SU)), **Murphy Oil** ([MUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUR)), **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Oneok** ([OKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKE)) gapped below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Oil stocks pared losses, but there were many more down in volume.



Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) slid 3.3%, gapping below its 50-day moving average. The ETF is also below the 80.32 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) it cleared last week.


Nymex crude for June delivery fell 3.5% to $98.54 a barrel, the first close below $100 since April 11. Crude fell on worries about the global economy, and investors fled into bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 8 basis points to 2.83%.


Shipping stocks got crushed. The industry group — which started the day at No. 16 out of 197 — sold off more than 5%. **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)), **Global Ship Lease** ([GSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSL)) and **Matson** ([MATX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MATX)) gapped below their [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). **Golden Ocean Group** ([GOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOGL)), **Costamare** ([CMRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMRE)), **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) and **Genko Shipping** ([GNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNK)) also took heavy blows.


Stock Market Hits Fertilizers And Metals
----------------------------------------


Fertilizers, the No. 1-ranked group within the stock market (based on six-month relative price-weighted performance), saw continued selling. **Nutrien** ([NTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTR)) gapped down in heavy volume and now looks for support at the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). **Sociedad Quimica y Minera** ([SQM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQM)) gapped below its 50-day average. Others gapped down, too.


Steel and mining leaders extended losses. **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)), **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)) and **Franco-Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)) offered examples in that part of the stock market.


Are Defensive Havens Safe?
--------------------------


Even the utility sector, which had quietly climbed to [No. 6 among 33 IBD stock market sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-apr-22-2022/), sold off. The four utility industry groups fell 0.7% to 1.8%.


Consumer stocks led the market's gains Monday. Casino, lodging, travel booking, RVs, home furniture, department stores and a few other retail groups climbed more than 1.5%.


Chinese stocks continued to melt down. The Shanghai Composite plummeted 5.1% in the largest one-day drop for the index since Feb. 3, 2020. The index made its lowest close since June 15, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Chinese shares came under more selling as [authorities impose lockdowns in many cities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-markets-tank-as-investors-worry-about-covid-19-lockdowns-11650876174), and residents of the capital, Beijing, prepared for a possible lockdown. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index plunged 3.7% Monday. Its 7.7% five-day decline is the largest since March 15. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Index fell 1.9%.

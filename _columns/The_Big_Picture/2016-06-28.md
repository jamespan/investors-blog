After two straight sessions of sharp losses, buyers dipped their toes in the water Tuesday, but that was about it as major averages ended with decent gains in lower volume.


The Nasdaq led the way, rising 2.1%, the S&P added 1.8% and the Dow picked up 1.6%. Small caps kept pace with the Dow, as the Russell 2000 rose 1.6%.


The solid gain and close near highs got a variety of tags from market pundits. Some called it an oversold bounce. Others called it a dead-cat bounce. Still others called it a sucker's rally. Whatever it was, it's too early to say the selling has run its course. The market still needs to prove itself more, with less reliance on utility, gold and REIT names for leadership.


A similar theme repeated as much of the leadership came from beaten-down names. Shares of biotechs, banks, and oil and gas did well. So did semiconductor stocks, but when it comes to actionable charts in these areas, there's not much around. In the biotech and oil spaces, for example, it's common to find stocks 40% to 50% off their highs after nasty sell-offs.


![MP062816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP062816-178x300.jpg)Oil stocks got a lift as August West Texas Intermediate crude  rose $1.52, or 3.3%, to settle at $47.85 a barrel.


At least one chip stock turned in a bullish session Tuesday. After giving up a 66.34 cup-with-handle buy point Friday and extending losses Monday, **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) jumped nearly 5% Tuesday in heavy volume, reclaiming the entry by a penny.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has proved itself an institutional-quality leader. Shares gapped up Tuesday, finding support at the 50-day moving average. Volume was heavy early but trailed off.


Advancers walloped decliners on the NYSE by a nearly 6-to-1 margin. The margin was a bit less on the Nasdaq, but still respectable, at nearly 4 to 1.


The IBD 50 outperformed, rising 2.1%. Headed into Tuesday, it was down 8.4% for the year, mostly in line with the Nasdaq's 8.2% loss.


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) added 4% in slightly above-average volume. It's getting support at its 50-day moving average for the first time after reclaiming a 56.01 buy point.


Other IBD 50 names that have held up well during the market's recent pullback include **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)), **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)).

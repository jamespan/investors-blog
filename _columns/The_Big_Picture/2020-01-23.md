By end of day, the stock market recovered from sharp losses at the open Thursday on fears of the spreading China virus, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 219 points. But the major stock indexes staged a bullish rebound, ending well off their early morning lows.




The Nasdaq composite closed with a 0.2% gain after falling as much as 0.5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 ended with a 0.1% increase and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a 0.1%, or 26-point, loss. The IBD 50 — a computerized list of leading growth stocks — gained 0.4%. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Stock Market Hits More Highs
----------------------------


With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 setting more all-time highs this week, the current [stock market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) continues to show strength. The Nasdaq is already up 4.8% in January, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 2.9% and 2.2% in 2020.


The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count is showing positive signals, with just one on the Nasdaq and three on the S&P 500.


The stock market's best stocks continue to perform well, although Chinese leaders have been weak in the wake of the spreading coronavirus. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) fell five of the last seven sessions. **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) extended a losing streak to four sessions, dropping more than 1.5%.

Amid light institutional selling in the major indexes, investors should feel free to remain on the offensive. Earnings season is in full swing. Be on the lookout for bullish [breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/), as the result of strong earnings results. On the downside, disappointing results or guidance can send stocks plunging. To help mitigate the risk of earnings results, it is prudent to avoid holding a full position before earnings are announced, unless you have a solid profit cushion. Other investors may decide an [options strategy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/) during earnings season makes sense.

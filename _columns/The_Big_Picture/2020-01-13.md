  Stocks Hit Record Highs Again, But Is The Market Overheating?

The stock market extended its rally with another day of record gains and continued good fortune for leading stocks. While it's hard to find fault with the market, a key test now looms.




After a late burst of buying, the Nasdaq added 1% and the S&P 500 tacked on 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a more modest 0.3%. Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. the prior session.


Buyers are not just in the driver's seat, they're stepping on the accelerator. In a sign of market strength that is rarely seen, the [Accumulation/Distribution Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at A's. Last week, the Nasdaq 100 climbed above an upper-channel price line that spans many weeks, and the Nasdaq on Monday started doing the same. That's a sign of overheating.


The latest Market Pulse shows a skimpy number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) in the past several weeks. The Dec. 18 stalling type of distribution on the Nasdaq was erased Monday after the composite rose more than 5% from that session's closing price. When an index can surge 5% in less than four weeks, you know the stock market is turbocharged.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP011320-227x300.jpg)After soaring in 2019, investors may wonder how much more the market rally can extend itself. But keep in mind that 2019's fantastic performance started at an advantageous position, namely the bottom of a brief bear market.


The Nasdaq did not get back above its pre-correction peak until late April. The market traded largely sideways until early October. From a long-term perspective, that's when the market really started to add to its prior gains.


So in a historical context, the three-month rally is not so surprising. Still, excessive speed is dangerous, so the market may need to slow to keep itself from losing control. Investors cannot afford to be complacent when everything looks so bubbly.


Stock Market's Big Test
-----------------------


A major test now comes for the stock market, with the start of earnings season. Tuesday morning will bring the first wave of important quarterly reports, when financial heavyweights **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) announce results. **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) also will announce results, the first major transportation company of this earnings cycle to do so.


FactSet notes that S&P 500 companies are estimated to see an earnings decline of 2% for the fourth quarter on a year-ago basis. If true, it would mark a fourth straight quarter of earnings declines. The last time this happened, according to FactSet research, is the period of Q3 2015 to Q2 2016. Other research firms [show a different trend](https://www.investors.com/news/sp-500-earnings-preview-q4-2019-energy-sector-triggers-earnings-recession/): two straight quarters of decline.


Revenue for the S&P 500 is estimated to rise 2.6% in Q4, which would be the smallest gain since Q2 of 2016. Revenue fell 0.2% that quarter.


For now, Wall Street is partying.


Chinese stocks were among Monday's winners. Sources told Bloomberg that the Trump administration [plans to lift its designation of China as a currency manipulator](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-13/u-s-to-lift-china-currency-manipulator-tag-ahead-of-trade-deal?srnd=premium). That removes an obstacle to a phase-one trade agreement between the U.S. and China set to be signed on Wednesday.



The IBD 50 jumped 1.4% Monday, outperforming the broad market. Chinese stocks **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) contributed. Some software and consumer leaders also had increases of more than 2%.


After lagging the market earlier in its uptrend, the IBD 50 is now near its July highs. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which tracks the index with a different weighting, cleared the July high. Chart readers would identify a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from a six-month pattern.


One stock that reflects the stock market's newfound energy is **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). Shares of the electric-car manufacturer surged nearly 10% Monday, topping the 500 price level. Up 59% since December, Tesla is looking overheated.

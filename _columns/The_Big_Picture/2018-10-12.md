Bulls Erase Some Losses, But Small Caps Lag
============================================

Stock-market bulls got their predictable bounce Friday after two ugly sessions.




Indexes seemed ready for a rebound after two straight days of big losses. The day involved several reversals, but the indexes closed on a strong note.


Small caps were the day's orphans, falling 0.2%. The S&P 600 is 12% below its prior high as small caps show weaker behavior than other indexes.


In the meantime, the Nasdaq rose 2.3% and the large-cap S&P 500 added 1.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 1.1%.

A half-hour into the session, the bulls cheered as the Nasdaq jumped 2.5%.


The gains came as three major banks reported Q3 earnings.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) [grew adjusted earnings 33%](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-earnings-q3-jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo/). The earnings were 4% better than expected, but an early gain reversed to a 1.1% loss.


**Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) stoked EPS growth 23%, which was 3% above the consensus estimate. The stock surged as much as 4% but reversed to pocket a 2.1% gain.


**Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) traded sloppily after earnings missed views, rising about 3.5% before settling for a 1.3% gain.


If bulls were hoping for leadership from the bank sector, Friday's reports suggested they look elsewhere.

Where might that elsewhere be?


Lackluster Changes
------------------


Per the week's final data, the shuffle among [IBD's 33 sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-oct-11-2018/) featured some uninspiring changes.


Through Friday's session, the utility sector rose 13 places — from No. 25 to No. 12. The bank sector advanced seven places in the standings — from No. 24 to No. 17.


On the downside, the computer sector fell seven slots — from No. 23 to No. 30. Chemical also slid seven places — from No. 14 to No. 21.


Investors might find it hard to believe that utilities could lead the market anywhere, especially as interest rates rise. But in 2016, the utility sector outperformed the major indexes.


What Investors Should Do
------------------------


With the current market in correction, individual investors should be raising cash.


They also should recognize longer-term positive factors that could turn the market around.


Some positives are undeniable. The U.S. economy is strong. Trading policies with the U.S., Canada and Mexico have been more or less settled, leaving only China as the main obstacle.


Economic News
-------------


Earnings season will intensify in the coming week.


Also, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will release the minutes from its Sept. 25-26 meeting.


The coming week will also feature a heavy load of data from China, including Q3 GDP, retail sales and industrial production.


China's retail sales are expected to rise 9%, matching the previous number.

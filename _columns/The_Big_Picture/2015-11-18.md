Stocks started strongly and finished even stronger Wednesday, marking a positive shift in the market outlook. Wednesday's big move knocked off the pressure on the market uptrend.

  

Thanks in part to a 3% jump in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), the Nasdaq outperformed with a 1.8% gain and had its best day since bolting 2.3% on Oct. 23. Goldman Sachs added the maker of iPhones and iPads to its Conviction Buy List.

  

The S&P 500 rallied 1.6% for its best performance a 1.7% surge Oct. 22.

  

Meanwhile, the Dow industrials climbed 1.4%, with all 30 of its components rising. Small caps also had a big day, as the Russell 2000 rallied 1.6%. The IBD 50 gained 1.5%.

  

Volume rose on the Nasdaq, but fell on the NYSE. Breadth was also strong, with winners mauling losers by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

  

New lows again swamped new highs. But those that slumped to new lows were concentrated in beaten-down energy and mining issues. A number of retailers also hit new lows Wednesday.

  

Overall, Wednesday's solid snapback was a clear sign that buyers came back, prompting a change of the IBD market outlook back to confirmed uptrend, from uptrend under pressure.

  

The recent weakness looked to be a normal pullback after a big rally for the major indexes. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 bolted a whopping 15% and 13%, respectively, from their September lows. Some kind of digestion period or retreat can be expected after such large and fast gains.

  

Wednesday's pop in the market served to fix a lot of the weak action seen Tuesday, when indexes made bearish price reversals and met resistance at key levels. Percentagewise, Wednesday's gains were much larger than any of the recent down days, another positive. And the Nasdaq and S&P 500 didn't even get to their 50-day lines during their latest pullbacks.

  

Stocks were strong all session long despite a big drop in October [housing starts](http://news.investors.com/economy/111815-781361-housing-start-fall-why-builders-are-not-building.htm). The homebuilders' industry group even rallied 1% Wednesday.

  

The main indexes further improved after the minutes from the Fed's October meeting showed that the majority of officials prefer hiking rates at their Dec. 15-16 meeting. Fed members have called for gradually increasing rates from rock-bottom levels that have been in place since December 2008.

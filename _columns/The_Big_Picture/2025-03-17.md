Indexes finished in positive terrain on Monday, building on stock market gains for a second straight session. The action kept up hopes for a rally attempt after Friday's broad gains, when both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq advanced more than 2%.


On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average led the major indexes with a 0.9% gain while the S&P 500 rose 0.6%. The Nasdaq faltered at first, but reversed higher in late trades and finished the day up 0.3%.




**Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) were among Monday's winners on the Dow. **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) GTC conference for developers got underway on Monday but that didn't seem to help the artificial intelligence giant. Nvidia stock fell nearly 2%.


Volume was mixed as the New York Stock Exchange saw more trading compared with Friday, while the Nasdaq saw less. Advancers led by more than 4-to-1 on the NYSE and nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. However, more stocks hit new lows vs. those that made it to new highs on Monday.

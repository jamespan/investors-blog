  Stock Market Fights Back After Early Downdraft, But Sellers Hit Leading Growth Stocks Again

The stock market took a modest step back Tuesday but closed well off lows as top-rated growth stocks faced another round of selling.




The Nasdaq composite fell 1% intraday but trimmed the loss to 0.2% by the close. It also closed 1 point above the Aug. 29 follow-through day's low. A close below that low would've been an unwelcome development for stock market bulls. That's because IBD research has consistently shown that a close below the follow-through's low often presages more weakness.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, with losers beating winners by less than 2-to-1.


**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) was one of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100, along with other top-rated growth stocks like **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). But Amazon showed constructive action by closing off lows and holding support at its 50-day moving average.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 also fell 0.2% after paring losses. Volume rose, giving the index a mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The index was weighed down by weakness in **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) as well as leading oil and gas stocks like **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)), **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)), **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)) and **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)). The latter five ended with losses of at least 2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP091923-262x300.jpg)The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) gave back 0.4% and closed in the bottom half of its daily range. The small-cap index undercut its Aug. 25 low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%.


West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $91.20 a barrel, down 0.3%, after hitting an intraday high of $93.74. Oil prices have been on a tear, which has sparked higher prices at the pump.


Amid fears of a recession, consumer spending has held up relatively well. But spending could slow in coming months as Federal stimulus money dries up. Higher gasoline prices and the resumption of student-loan payments in October could also curb spending.


A stubbornly high 10-year Treasury yield and strength in the U.S. dollar are also holding the stock market back.


The two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway Tuesday, and the policy statement will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Traders are virtually certain that the Fed will leave the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. And they're growing more confident that the Fed will leave the fed funds rate unchanged until the end of the year.


Growth Stocks On The Move
-------------------------


**Fluor** ([FLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLR)) was a bright spot among top-rated growth stocks. The provider of engineering and construction services cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 37.20 buy point. That said, it's still a challenging environment for breakouts.


**ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) was one of the worst performers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), down more than 10%. ELF barely held its 10-week moving average last week. It's now firmly below the 10-week line, which had been a support level since the stock's last breakout in early February.


In the health care space, **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) slumped more than 6% and closed below its 50-day line. China-based retailer **Miniso** ([MNSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNSO)) suffered its third straight heavy-volume decline and fell below its 21-day line.


The weak action in leading growth stocks, along with three harsh distribution days for the Nasdaq since Sept. 7, are the two main reasons why IBD's invested percentage is at 20%-40%. There's just not a lot out there to buy right now. Even when setups emerge, most stocks aren't making much headway, and some have sunk below buy points.

Keep Exposure Light
-------------------


The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio is currently around 45% invested after we cut ties with **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)) and **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)). Both were added in late August but never made meaningful progress from our entries. It's important to get positive feedback from new purchases in the early stages of an uptrend. If you don't get it, it's usually best to keep losses small and move on.


**Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)), which joined Leaderboard on May 1, outperformed with a 2.3% gain in higher volume. It's carving a cup-with-handle base with a 49.19 buy point.


Other setups to watch include **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), which is close to breaking out over a trendline as the biotech approaches an 847.50 entry.

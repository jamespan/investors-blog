Nasdaq Jumps 16.5% In Q1, Led By Top Stocks In Software Sector
===============================================================

Major stock indexes closed out the first quarter with more gains Friday, capping a strong quarter that saw the Nasdaq composite rise 16.5%. Top stocks Friday included semiconductor names, which bounced back after recent weakness. China stocks also outperformed.




The Dow Jones industrials and Nasdaq composite added 0.8% each. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Russell 2000 edged up 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Thursday, indicating some conviction behind the buying. The S&P rose 13.1% in the first quarter, its best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2009.


Fears of an [inverted yield curve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/inverted-yield-curve-good-news-for-dow-jones-economy/) subsided, at least for a day. The three-month Treasury yield on Friday was around 2.38% with the 10-year at 2.4%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP032919-240x300.jpg)The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rebounded 1.6%, but top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 like **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) still have weak charts. **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) is interesting as it works on a cup-with-handle base, but a 42% pullback and handle forming below the 10-week moving average are serious flaws.


Market technicals continue to look good. The Nasdaq is holding comfortably above the 7500 level, a logical support level to watch since it mostly corresponds with the Nasdaq's 200-day moving average. The Dow Jones and S&P 500, meanwhile, also aren't far from breakout areas.


While the market remains under pressure and investors must remain cautious, the market showed some improvement the past few days. Indexes closed near the week's highs, and some buying is reappearing.


Top Stocks On The Move
----------------------


Shares of **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) faded in their debut. The stock closed at 78.29, above its offer price of 72 but well below its open price of 87.24. It's always best to let an IPO trade for several days before buying. Breakouts from [IPO bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) can deliver big gains. It's best to see a new issue consolidate a bit, though, to increase the odds of a bona fide breakout.


Top stocks in China did well Friday as the Shanghai Composite soared 3.2%.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) cleared a 96.25 handle buy point, surging nearly 14% to 105.12. Elsewhere, **Huazhu Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) cleared a very deep cup-with-handle base, rising 4.8% to 42.14. Shares of **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) added 1% to 36.08 as it sits just below a 36.67 buy point. But the true leader in TAL's group is [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) name **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), which already broke out and is holding comfortably above the 85.04 buy point.



In the [software sector,](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) where top stocks abound, **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) is getting support at the 10-week moving average after a recent breakout. IBD's enterprise software group rallied 31% in Q1, easily outperforming the major stock indexes. Besides Paycom, the group was led by **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) and **Zendesk** ([ZEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEN)), among others.

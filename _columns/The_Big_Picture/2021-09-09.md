Stock Market Reverses Lower As Jobless Claims Hit New Pandemic Low; 2 Leaders Near Buy Points
==============================================================================================

The stock market reversed lower Thursday to close at session lows despite pandemic-low jobless claims, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 extended losing streaks to four sessions.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The stock market received a boost at the open Thursday following the latest report on jobless claims. The Labor Department said [jobless claims fell](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-09-09-2021-11631136633?mod=hp_lead_pos2) to a pandemic low of 310,000, beating Econoday estimates for initial filings of 344,000.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 closed down 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. The Dow is still looking for much-needed support at its 50-day moving average. The index closed below that line Thursday. The small-cap Russell 2000 inched lower, extending a losing streak to four days.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose slightly on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers. The rise in NYSE volume meant a [new day of institutional selling](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the S&P 500, just as it lost one.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP090921_4-249x300.jpg) The Aug. 4 distribution day on the S&P 500 was removed from the overall count due to time. With a still-modest amount of institutional selling, investors should remain optimistic about the current uptrend. But don't be complacent. [Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-steps-back-after-strong-rally-small-caps-growth-stocks-lead-downside/) discussed the importance of analyzing your current holdings for signs of weakness.


Leading growth stocks showed solid gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.9%. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) rallied nearly 2% Thursday. The top apparel stock found strong support at its 50-day moving average on Wednesday.


Elsewhere among top growth stocks, **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) continues to trace a flat base with a 1,650.10 entry, but is below its 50-day line following Wednesday's nearly 4% sell-off. **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) briefly broke out past a cup-with-handle's 229.99 buy point before paring gains; it's a new [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock. EV giant **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) extended a win streak to four sessions and is in buy range past a 730 aggressive buy point.


On the downside, **Mercado Libre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) gave up its 1,899.43 buy point in a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) after a 1.2% decline. **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) this week has closed below its 50-day line for the first time since June 16. The stock is close to triggering the [7%-8% loss-cutting rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 267.87 buy point.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: PayPal, Under Armour
---------------------------------------------


Amid this week's back-and-forth action, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)) traded near buy zones.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock PayPal is trading about 7% away from a [flat base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) 310.26 buy point. Meanwhile, an [aggressive entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) looms at 296.80, or a dime above Wednesday's high.


On Wednesday, PayPal [announced the acquisition](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-up-as-it-acquires-japanese-buy-now-pay-later-startup/) ofÂ Japanese "buy now, pay later" consumer financing startup Paidy for about $2.7 billion.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [PYPL stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-paypal-holdings-inc-pypl.aspx) shows a solid 94 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) and was [Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/paypal-stock-claws-back-from-ebay-worries-on-upbeat-views/)


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Under Armour continues to build a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) that shows a 26.12 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The stock also is rising from support at the 50-day moving average.


On the downside, the stock's relative strength line is far from its old highs despite a recent upswing. The RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day, confirming the stock as a market leader.


Under Armour shares rallied over 4% Thursday amid strength in the retail sector fueled by **Lululemon**'s ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) [strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/lulu-stock-lululemon-earnings-report-amid-pandemic-revival/). LULU stock surged over 10% to hit a new high after the company handily beat Q2 earnings and sales estimates late Wednesday.

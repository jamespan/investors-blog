The stock market Friday was a microcosm of the week, essentially moving little in price as it continued searching for direction.


The Nasdaq made a bullish price reversal, erasing modest losses to close with a 0.3% gain. The S&P 500 wiped out a 0.5% decline and ended the day with a minimal loss. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.


But narrow price ranges made the  bullish moves seem lost in the dull charts of the major indexes.  For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.8% as the indexes continued to paint more or less a near-term directionless pattern.


![mp102116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP102116-195x300.png)The composite is at the same level it was at its August highs. The S&P has now closed six of the past seven weeks below the 10-week moving average, and the line is starting to bend lower.


No doubt, the market is treading water. But some historical perspective suggests it is at a normal stage.


Since the market broke out to new highs in July, its advance has been about average compared with other periods when the indexes emerged from long consolidations, according to William O'Neil + Co. research analysts Cornelio Ash and Kenley Scott.


Their study, which took a snapshot of the market through the end of September, also noted that indexes need to show some improvement soon to avoid becoming one of history's lagging examples.


The analysts also noted that over the past 45 years, the fourth quarter tends to be the strongest for stocks, but not necessarily in an election year. Indexes do a bit worse than average. All sectors also tend to be weaker, but transportation does much better. Technology is the worst. In 11 election years, the sector outperformed the S&P only four times, the analysts said in a webinar on the [Panaray](http://www.panaray.com) product by WON + Co., an IBD sister firm.


A couple of positive changes did occur Friday.


The Nasdaq closed above the 50-day moving average after a few failed tries the past several days. Also, the Sept. 16 [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) on the S&P 500 became too aged to count any longer. That left the S&P and Nasdaq with nearly the same number of days of higher-volume selling, as noted in the Market Pulse table.


The IBD 50 rose less than 0.1%. In a positive trend, some leading stocks have gapped up powerfully on earnings reports, and some have held or even added to those gains.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) roared 19% Tuesday and added 7% the next three days.


On Friday, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) leapt 10% to a record high in heavy volume, while **National Bank Holdings** ([NBHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBHC)) gapped to a 7% increase, breaking out of a cup with handle.

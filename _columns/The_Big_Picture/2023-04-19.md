  Stock Market Indexes Yawn But Battered Bank Stocks Rally; Is This Industry Group Waking Up?

Sometimes, a dull day in the stock market can get a pat on the proverbial back. But during earnings season?




History has shown that investor reactions to quarterly reports can get wild and woolly. Yet major indexes on Wednesday posted mild closes. Even the intraday price ranges proved thin.


Sure, some stocks vaulted â€” a good thing. However, even as the Market Pulse displays, in this first major week of earnings reports, investors appear to still tread cautiously. It perhaps reflects lingering concerns over this year's biggest issues facing the stock market. They include inflation, interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve and the chances of a hard economic landing.


The Nasdaq composite continues lead the major benchmarks this year. At 12,157, the tech-centered index inched less than 4 points higher, or significantly less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq 100, which has no financial companies, edged less than 0.1% lower. The composite marked its fourth day in a row in which the daily move was below 0.5%.


Overall, you could argue this is bullish. Five sessions ago, the Nasdaq rallied 2%. Volume squeaked higher. So, from the IBD lens, such a stout gain in heavier turnover simulates a subsequent follow-through day.


The Nasdaq still leads all key indexes with a 16.1% lift year to date. This gain reflects a pair of traditional [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-leads-bullish-turn-in-stock-market-but-still-must-clear-these-potential-pitfalls/) that occurred on Jan. 6 and March 29.


Stock Market Today: Still Mainly Sideways
-----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MP041923-240x300.jpg)Meanwhile, the S&P 500 continues to trade rather calmly. Down just 0.35 point for the day, it continues to trade near the top of a 380- to 390-point trading range since the start of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 0.2%, mainly due to an 18-point roasting of **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), which recently rejoined [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/).


Small caps outperformed mildly.


The Russell 2000 rose 0.2%, while SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) nearly matched that small gain.


Volume edged up on both main exchanges.


Of course, the tiny move by these stock market indexes do not at all expose the wilder moves seen at an industry level.


Leading Wednesday's upside? Smaller banks. [Preliminary data on MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) showed at least 10 of IBD's 197 industry groups rose 2% or more. They included west and southwestern banks, southeast banks and superregionals.


**Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), which saw earnings plunge 42% to $1.28 a share but generated 54% growth in revenue to $911 million, soared 24% in the second highest day of turnover this month. Shares still face a big uphill road to reclaiming key technical levels, including the 200-day moving average.


IBD's Finance-Consumer Loans industry group performed very well on Wednesday, up 2.8%. Airlines rebounded, up 2.8% as a group on a price-weighted basis. The group is also an early star, up more than 16% year to date.


The yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year note rose 3 basis points to 3.60%, the highest close in nearly a month. CME futures traders are indicating an 86% chance that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates to a 5%-5.25% range in early May.


Despite the stock market's quiet action, breadth was negative. Early data showed losers beating out winners on the Nasdaq by nearly 300 issues and by roughly 200 on the NYSE.


Is This Industry Group Going To Lead?
-------------------------------------


Nonetheless, IBD's medical systems and equipment group also shined. The industry group rose 2.1% on Wednesday, improving its advance since Jan. 1 to 9.2%. The 75-member industry group contains no fewer than 15 companies that host a Relative Strength Rating of 85 or higher and trade at least 10 a share. This elite group includes hot spinoff **GE Healthcare** ([GEHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEHC)).


On the downside, wholesale electronics firms, albeit a small industry group within the stock market, got pummeled after **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)) [gave disappointing sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cdw-stock-cdw-tops-earnings-goal-but-sales-miss/). Shares gapped down 13% to a four-month low in the heaviest volume so far this year and the most vigorous turnover in more than two years.

More Themes To Invest
---------------------



CDW's warning naturally set off an avalanche of selling within the industry. Just check out **Insight Enterprises** ([NSIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSIT)). The midcap growth stock delivered a sell signal, falling nearly 9% and [slicing right through its rising 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in heavy turnover for the first time since its breakout at 105.47.


The IBD system encourages taking at least partial profits on the way up; that is, once Insight reached the 20%-25% profit zone from that breakout point, or 126.56 to 131.84, it was a great time to bag some gains. The stock closed Wednesday in that profit-taking zone.


Take a close look at your holdings. Make sure they have the [CAN SLIM fundamentals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) that are often necessary to fuel truly strong price moves. Insight did not possess such crazy good fundamentals. Earnings in the fourth quarter rose 25%. That's nice. But revenue cooled, down 2% after slowing to 4% growth in Q3 last year.


Meanwhile, the consumer spending sectors appear to be holding up well so far in 2023.


**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)), Wednesday's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch profile](https://www.investors.com/research/draftkings-stock-approaches-new-buy-point-amid-83-percent-rally-in-2023/), rallied for a fifth straight session. The stock is threatening to clear a shallow eight-week cup with a 21.72 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



In the area of chronic disease, insulin giant **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) is having a spectacular 2023 so far as it generates new revenue streams with weight loss medicines. The theme of obesity and diabetes got some airplay in [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A).

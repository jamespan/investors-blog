Stock indexes stepped higher in the first hour and a half of trade Thursday and then reversed to a third straight loss. The Nasdaq's dent was 0.5%, while the S&P 500 took a 0.6% hit. The IBD 50 was flat. Volume rose modestly on the NYSE and eased on the Nasdaq.

  

The action slapped the S&P 500 with a distribution day, lifting its net change to two adds since the uptrend resumed July 16. The Nasdaq's net change is zero in the same period.

  

Thursday's negative reversal was a worrisome sign. Bad markets start strong and finish weak.

  

Another bad sign: The S&P 500 fell back to its 50-day moving average, setting up yet another test.

  

Losses among miners, railroads and utilities weighed on the S&P 500 on Thursday. That's been the trend and might serve bulls well as an excuse for a while, but at some point accumulation is needed to keep an uptrend alive.

  

Economic reports were bullish. Jobless claims fell to 255,000, the lowest level since November 1973. The Chicago Fed's national economic activity index for June was stronger than expected. Leading indicators for June also topped expectations.

  

The market, though, showed little interest in the data. Earnings continue to be the focus.

  

Reactions were mostly in line with results â€” beats and higher guidance were rewarded, and misses were punished.

  

Apparel marketer **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) swaggered 7% higher after reporting beats on the top and bottom lines. The company pointed to 40% growth in shoe sales.

  

Chip designer **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) beat the Street's estimates on earnings and revenue, and raised guidance. The stock surged 16%.

  

**Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) surpassed estimates on earnings and revenue, and raised guidance. The stock gapped up 6%, clearing a shallow cuplike base.

  

For the second straight day, blue chips weighed on the Dow.

  

**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) matched EPS views but missed on sales. The stock dug 4% lower. Cat has been in a downtrend for 12 months.

  

**3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) edged above views on earnings but missed on revenue. The stock fell 4%.

  

After hours, the bulls found some grounds for hope.

  

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) surprised the Street with an unexpected profit. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) delivered a top- and bottom-line beat. **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) also beat on earnings and revenue, and announced an increase in its share-buyback program. All three stocks surged in late trading.

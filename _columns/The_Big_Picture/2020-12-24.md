Small caps took a break in a shortened session Thursday. But the bulls continued to drive Santa Claus's sleigh higher.




As the IBD outlook remains in a [confirmed uptrend since Nov. 4](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/), iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) dipped 0.1% but ended up 1.8% for the Christmas holiday-shortened week.


The S&P 500 gained 0.4%; growth stocks in air freight, homebuilding, consumer electronics, chip equipment, carmakers, paint and tool firms led the cause. The Nasdaq, which logged a [mild distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) Wednesday, virtually mopped up all of that day's loss with a nearly 0.3% gain. The Nasdaq 100's 0.5% rebound helped shave its weekly loss to 0.2%.


The S&P 500's Nov. 18 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) expired on time; the count is more digestible. Plus, volume in the Dec. 18 distribution day saw a boost from the "quadruple witching" expiration of stock and index futures and options.


The Russell 2000 ETF rose for an eighth week in a row, up an astounding 30% over that period.


The year proves that amid a once-in-a-century pandemic and extreme polarization in politics, the stock market can keep an upward bias. Knowing this gives you an edge. Here are five ways to stay ahead next year.


5 Tips To Succeed In 2021
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP122420-254x300.jpg)Tip No. 1: Stay on the right side of the [market trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). Great opportunities emerged for stock pickers after the S&P 500 staged a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on April 6. Since then, the large-cap barometer has flown 61%. [True CAN SLIM stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) have gained twice, thrice that amount or more following good breakouts.


No. 2: Don't get psyched out by [psychological gauges](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/). Bullishness has certainly gotten to frothy levels. The Investors Intelligence survey still shows a bullish ratio north of 60%. But this is a secondary market indicator. Ultimately, Wall Street is a daily balance of supply vs. demand. So keep an eye on what the major indexes and leaders are doing in terms of price and volume. A sharp sell-off, such as a [vertical violation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/), signals heavy institutional selling and likely market top.


No. 3: Embrace companies with [something new](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/new-product/). **Onto Innovation** ([ONTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONTO)), which cleared a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) at 39.57 on Nov. 9, is a new small-cap leader in the chip equipment space. It serves customers across the flat panel, AI, VR, auto, health care, datacenter and mobile device markets. The Street sees earnings per share ramping 35% to $1.87 a share this year and up 38% in 2021.




No. 4: Don't let a good gain turn into a [round trip](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/). **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) shares sank 4%, undercut the 50-day line in heavy volume, and gave back a 25% gain from a 41.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **PennyMac Financial** ([PFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFSI)) has trimmed its 15% profit from a 61.04 entry in a [cup with hard-to-spot handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


No. 5: Take plenty of gains on the way up. Eventually, top stocks pull back and come to an area in which you might have taken [profits at 20% or 25%](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/), or a bit more. At the same time, [keep your watchlists fresh](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/). Through Dec. 21, [Leaderboard stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) generated a 58% portfolio-weighted return. The S&P, through Thursday, rose 14.6%, excluding dividends. Stocks in the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) have altogether risen 38% on a price-weighted basis since Jan. 1.

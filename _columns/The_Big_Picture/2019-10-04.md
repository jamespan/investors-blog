Stock indexes extended their rebound with solid gains Friday, as the September jobs report gave Wall Street just enough to keep the bulls content.




Payrolls [increased by 136,000 last month](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-private-hiring-wage-growth-slump-dow-jones/). It was a number good enough to believe the U.S. economy is not tanking. But the growth missed forecasts and kept hopes alive of another interest-rate cut at this month's Fed meeting, even though bets for a cut actually fell. [Odds for quarter-point rate cut](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) this month fell from nearly 90% Thursday to 75.4% Friday.


Still, the jobs report was a desirable outcome for a stock market looking at the Fed to keep a softening economic expansion from worsening.


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each added 1.4% as buying continued into the close. The S&P 500 and Dow closed back above their 50-day moving averages, a positive step.

Few stocks rose in active trading, as the [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=downs) table shows. But breadth was bullish, with advancing stocks over decliners by nearly a 3-1 ratio on the NYSE and by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


The Russell 2000 erased morning losses to rise 1% Friday. The small-cap benchmark's 11.3% gain for 2019 is nearly half of the Nasdaq's 20.3%.


After a two-day rebound, some leading stocks are escaping danger. **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) found support around its 50-day moving average and closed back above a 79.84 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)), shaky since its Sept. 18 [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), made it back above the 120.92 entry.


[Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) fell as much as 6% below its 141.77 buy point but jumped back above the 50-day line Friday. It still has about 2% to go before regaining the entry, but at least it stepped back from the brink of a [sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


The IBD 50 rallied 1.7%, a great day for the index although many leaders need further repair. The average IBD 50 stock is 11% below its prior high. Sixteen stocks on Thursday's list came near or even below the 200-day moving average, a last line of defense.


That's part of the reason there haven't been many new buy areas on leaders' charts. Keeping exposure limited remains a good investment strategy. If the Nasdaq can rally back above the 50-day line, it would help the market shake off its slump. The market has gone through a period of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/)that still poses a risk.

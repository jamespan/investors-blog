It was a dull, listless session for the stock market Monday, but for many, it was a welcome development after recent volatility. The Dow and S&P 500 lost 0.4% while the Nasdaq gave up 0.3%. Volume fell from Friday's levels, partly due to the start of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.


Breadth was weak again, particularly on the NYSE, with declining stocks beating advancers by 2-to-1. The ratio was a little better on the Nasdaq, with losers topping winners by 8-to-5.


The IBD 50 fell 0.4%. 


**Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)) led the way, rising more than 2%. After a bullish support week during the week ended Aug. 28, Cambrex is trying to reclaim its 10-week moving average.


The IBD 50 is up 5.8% year to date, broadly outperforming the S&P 500.


It's still home to plenty of strong performers, but a distribution day Sept. 9, one day after a follow-through rally confirmation, means the bulls still need to tread cautiously, especially ahead of this week's Fed meeting.


Meanwhile, the bond market hasn't exactly been moving in lockstep with Fed expectations. In late June, the yield was around 2.47%, but it breached 2% in late August.


Concerns about the underlying health of the U.S. economy are still out there, especially amid slower growth in China — and fears the world's second-largest economy could slow down even further.


If last week's follow-through day amounts to something, investors have a decision to make. Buy institutional-quality growth stocks as they find support at the 10-week or 50-day moving average, or wait for new bases to complete.


Aggressive investors might opt for the former while more conservative ones will be patient and wait for bases to complete. There's a lot of base-building going on at the moment.


There's been a lot of talk lately about a "higher interest rate environment," but housing and construction-related stocks continue to perform well in spite of it.


The message here could be that even if the Fed starts raising interest rates, it won't be enough to curb housing demand or crimp the economic recovery.


Homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) is holding comfortably above a 28.80 buy point. Building materials producer **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) is back near highs, and two construction-related small caps — **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) and **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) — continue to hit new highs.

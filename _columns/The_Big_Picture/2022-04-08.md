Tech Stocks Smacked, But These Sectors Shine
=============================================

Another day, another exodus of money from the once-mighty regime of tech stocks.




In 2020, the tech sector ruled. Then in the final three months of that year, the tables turned, very quietly at first. But in 2021, the full-on rotation from high-priced technology stocks — especially those with zero bottom lines — got into full swing.


Also in 2021, energy, agriculture, steel, chemicals and other cyclical areas of Wall Street lit up like a pinball machine that just went tilt. And while banking and financial stocks have mostly turned into laggards, the 2022 cyclical bull market lives on.


Tech Stocks Today
-----------------


Fast-forward to Friday, and the song has pretty much remained the same.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP040822-292x300.jpg)The Nasdaq, down 1.3% on Friday, finished with a 3.9% loss for the week. That ate considerably into the composite index's three-week 11% rebound. Another big drop could lead to a fresh break below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). In a good bull market, that's a technical no-no.


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF fell 3.5% for the week; it holds a thin 0.4% cushion above the 10-week moving average. At least eight chip- and software-related industry groups sank 2% or more on Friday.


The S&P 500 edged nearly 0.3% lower to close the week 1.3% lower. Small and midcap stocks had a rougher time; SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) dropped 3.5% for the week, while sellers chopped iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) 4.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.4% Friday, cut its weekly loss to 0.3%.


SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) marked a third straight week of 1.9% to 3.7% gains. Gains from a 69.56 buy point in a double bottom have hit 11%. Sure, interest rates are going up, leading to higher costs for the utilities. But their stable dividends and pricing power are positives during an economy that risks slowing down.


Volume fell on both main exchanges, keeping [the distribution count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) at a moderate level for now.


With first-quarter earnings season coming into full bloom over the next three weeks, institutional investors will be combing the reports and conference calls for clues on how companies are dealing with these core economic issues: 1) inflation; 2) the supply chain; 3) the impact from China, South Korea and other parts of Asia suffering from a new spike in Covid-19 Covid cases; and 4) what impact rising U.S. interest rates will have on their financing costs.

Leaders Outside Of Tech Stocks
------------------------------



Defensive issues, including utilities, continued to gain ground.


**AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)), the drug distribution titan, rose 5.7% for the week and extended gains past as 129.64 [cup-without-handle entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) to 27%. Taking even partial profits is sensible. Supermarket chain **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)), another defensive play, has caught fire. It's now risen 20% from a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


3 Weeks Tight A Bullish Pattern
-------------------------------


**General Dynamics** ([GD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GD)), a [topic of discussion in Friday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live), just completed a three-weeks-tight pattern. Shares have done well since moving past longtime resistance near 200.



So in short, a few sectors are offering intrepid investors some new buy opportunities, but not in tech stocks right now.


Stay on the lookout for when big winners in the top sectors fall hard in heavy volume. When they rip below their 10-week moving average and fail to rebound, then you'll know that the market may be considering another rotation. The 197 industry groups table and stock research table, both at [Data Tables in Stock Lists at Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), plus the [Stocks On The Move](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) screen provide an easy-to-use guide.

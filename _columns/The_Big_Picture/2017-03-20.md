title: Stocks Limp, But IBD 50 Shows An Important Signal

The stock market closed mixed Monday, and while indexes have been movingÂ sideways, leading stocks are sending a significant signal.


The Nasdaq composite rose by millimeters for the third straight session, masking Monday's record high. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% as financials and utilities were some of the weakest stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%.


The Russell 2000 was weaker, falling 0.5%. The small-cap benchmark also remains below its March 1 peak but at least was able to rise above its 50-day moving average last week, which refuted some doubts about the small caps.


Volume fell, but that was almost a foregone conclusion following a quadruple witching session Friday that saw volume swell 70% more than normal.

It's difficult to make any analysis when the indexes don't show any clear inclination. Wall Street folklore is that you never short a dull market. So take that as a positive sign, for now.


The number of distribution days is normal. Lacking red flags, investors have no reason to limit their exposure to stocks. Indexes may be tired but are far from breaking down. One signpost to watch is the March 9 lows. If the Nasdaq or S&P 500 fall below that level before they make new highs, there would then be a pattern of lower lows and a possible break in the uptrend.


But while the market is finding its way, leading stocks have picked up the pace. That may be as encouraging as any market indicator.


The Nasdaq started making new highs in November while the IBD 50 index didn't do the same until late January. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have been trendless in March, the IBD 50 has kept making new highs. Any time leading stocks can do better than the general market, it's a good omen.


At the same time, a shift is unfolding in the IBD 50's leadership. The best stocks in the past couple of weeks have been in semiconductor, software and other technology companies. Regional banks and other financials have been pulling back and are now off 3% to 12% from 52-week highs. That's also occurring in the broad market.


Chips led the general market Monday. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) regained its 50-day line, although its direction remains uncertain after a series of mixed signals on its chart. Several high-rated stocks in the group are in buy range or are forming bases, which makes the group fertile with opportunities. **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) is in buy range from a 91.86 entry. **Silicon Labs** ([SLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLAB)) and **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) are basing.


Sector rotation in the market is bringing some fresh leadership.


Homebuilders were No. 38 in the IBD Weekly Edition, improving from No. 106 six weeks earlier. Construction products climbed to No. 29 from No. 122. Fiber optics are No. 15 from No. 51. **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)) has held up best in the group.


Biotech has also made a move (No. 8 from No. 58) but investors have to research those companies carefully because many are unprofitable. Also, political pressure on high drug costs has rattled the industry in the past.


Again, there were some defensive industry groups leading Monday, including magazine publishers and paper products in the top 10 of 197 industry groups.

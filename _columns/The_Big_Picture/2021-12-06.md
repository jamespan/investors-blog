After last week's shellacking, the stock market looked due for a bounce. The major indexes delivered broadly. Monday's action also offered more paragraphs to the script on Wall Street's 2021 history â€” a script that perhaps deserves this title: >-
  "Rotate, Sectors, Rotate!"




As some business software stocks sank further, more money cycled into the real estate and building sectors. Transportation and some retailing stocks have also showed more robust action lately. Recent features and screen results in [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) and [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/) highlight this investing shift.


Small caps continue to underperform this year. But iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ruled the roost for at least a day. Up 2%, the popular ETF still finds itself well below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The shorter-term [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), at 226, has been sloping lower for two straight weeks.


The S&P 500 trailed small caps, rising 1.2%; that topped gains of 0.9% by the Nasdaq composite and 0.8% for the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund. Some sector funds also outperformed the S&P 500. SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) rose 1.5%. SPDR S&P Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) galloped 2.6% ahead, but fell short of climbing back above the 50-day moving average.


In other words, investors, having gotten burned by widespread profit-taking in the ultrahot enterprise software sector, may have sought greener pastures in areas of the stock market that also pay a steady dividend.

Stock Market Today: Which Sector Will Rebound Faster, Sharper?
--------------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP120621-225x300.jpg)In general, value outperformed growth on Monday.


From the lens of the Russell indexes, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rebounded 0.9% while iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) hopped 1.4% higher. But the latter still needs more buying oomph to retake its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


The growth index ETF, trying to find a floor at its 50-day line, stands 5.3% below its November peak; the value ETF trades just 3% beneath its 52-week high.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.6%, making it four losses in the past five sessions. While the ETF moved well off its session low, the weakness among highfliers this year is glaring.


The accompanying Market Pulse table highlights a crowd of CAN SLIM-quality leading stocks that fell sharply in significantly heavier than normal volume.


Obviously, the scare of Covid-19's latest variant of concern, omicron, has pushed the stock market back into the court of the sellers. But IBD readers may also want to view this new correction in equities as an adjustment to the monetary stance of the U.S. central bank.



Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, fresh from securing a Joe Biden nomination to hold the chair role for another four years, highlighted his willingness to avoid using the term "transitory" to describe inflation in the U.S.


Powell's talk also hinted that he is ready to dismantle the "quantitative easing" program of monthly bond buys more quickly than the original schedule of commencing in June or July of 2022.


"The Fed is in a pickle now," Gene Goldman, CIO at Cetera, told IBD in an interview. "It wants to try to raise interest rates, but it cannot fix the supply chain problem. That's why we are in kind of a stagflation-light economy."

A View Into 2022
----------------


Some observers have used the word "stagflation" liberally. But Goldman cautions against that word, mainly because he sees the economy still chugging along. In fact, economists at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank continue to see economic activity growing 9.7% on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter.


"The Fed is willing to sacrifice some economic growth to battle inflation," Goldman added.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose 9 basis points to 1.43%. That's a lot. But relatively speaking, it still pales vs. the 35-basis-point plunge seen over the prior seven trading sessions.


In 2022, Goldman still favors value equities over growth in the stock market. One reason? Unlike the slow-burn economic recovery that officially lasted more than 120 months after the financial crisis of 2008-to-early-2009, this current recovery from the coronavirus recession of 2020 has not only been a lot faster paced. It also has featured higher inflation, and Goldman thinks that benefits value-oriented sectors, including financials, hard infrastructure and industrials.


Case in point? The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1.9% jump to 35,227 almost matched the Russell 2000's gain Monday.


The Dow industrials need only a 70-point gain to retake the 50-day moving average. But so far, the blue chip average still has quite a ways to go to recoup four straight weeks' worth of losses.


What To Do In December
----------------------


For the moment, IBD's market in correction status in no way does it mean you should sit still and focus on new egg nog recipes.


In fact, now is a fantastic time to update your watchlist. Identify those companies going against the market's bearish grain.



On Monday, [IBD's Stocks On The Move table](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx), one of the oldest screens since the start of IBD in April 1984, shows 20 companies that rose significantly in heavier than usual turnover.


They include **Green Brick Partners** ([GRBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRBK)). The specialist in single-family homes in the Dallas and Atlanta metro regions rallied 11% in the highest volume in more than six weeks. Shares catapulted past a 28.01 entry in a long base that contained the [elements of a cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Green Brick shares moved quickly out of the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/), which went up to 29.41.


GRBK also triggered the [RS Line Blue Dot feature on MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) as its relative strength line shot to the highest level since November.


The Plano, Texas, firm's earnings per share have grown 19%, 24%, 128%, 119%, 87%, 65%, 55% and 40% vs. year-ago levels over the past eight quarters. Sales lifted 24%, 26%, 27%, 32%, 10%, 10%, 61% and 24% over the same time frame.

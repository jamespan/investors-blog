Let the breakouts roam free.


That appeared to be one of the messages relayed by the stock market on Tuesday as investors generally gave a big thumbs up on the latest batch of quarterly results and fast action by President Trump.


The president signed executive orders to continue progress on two key energy pipelines, making good on his campaign pledge to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.


The Nasdaq composite led the key indexes with a nearly 0.9% gain, better than gains of 0.7% by the S&P 500 and 0.6% by the Dow Jones industrial average. Strength in the semiconductor, fiber-optic and computer sectors may have given the tech-rich Nasdaq an edge. Having pierced the 5600 level, the composite is now up 4% since Jan. 1.


More importantly, large money managers rushed to gain more exposure to a wide range of sectors outside technology.


Some of the day's best performing industry groups included specialty steel alloys, heavy construction, metal ores, tires, wood products, diversified operations and cement and concrete, all of which stormed 3% higher or more. Oil drilling, chemical, paper, machine automation, construction gear and telecom infrastructure firms also rallied sharply, goring the bears.


No wonder the Russell 2000, a broad index in terms of sectors, shot more than 1.5% higher for the day.


![MP_a_012417](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP_a_012417-163x300.png)Volume grew on both exchanges. That's exactly what a [CAN SLIM-minded investor](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) wants to see when the market is rising. Today's Market Pulse table reflects the broad strength of stock market leadership.


Tuesday's volume was also above average on the NYSE, another positive. In contrast, none of the S&P 500's six down days so far this year showed heavier than normal turnover.


While the Nasdaq lost the Dec. 15 stalling day due to time, the distribution-day count remains high at 7. However, this column has frequently noted that the character of institutional selling has been notably light.


Good earnings results are reaffirming the latest data showing that the U.S. economy is still growing. On Tuesday, the Richmond Federal Reserve's business survey vaulted to 12 in January vs. 8 in December. That follows a big jump in the Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing survey for January.


Crude oil futures, meanwhile, continue to hold above $50 a barrel and the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond jumped back above 2.46%. Translation: Inflation is picking up steam, which may further justify the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates again this year. That, in turn, could help boost earnings in the banking sector.


If you've bought stocks at correct entry points over the past few months since Trump's earthshaking presidential win on Nov. 8, then you're likely pretty pleased about the results so far. If you find that your portfolio is up more than the key indexes, then not only are you buying the right names, but you are also confirming the fact that for now, the year 2017 is acting like a stockpickers' market.


The General Market Indicators page, found by going to the link at the bottom of this story, tells a similar yarn. So do some of IBD's proprietary screens. Here are a few facts to consider:


One, the IBD Mutual Fund index, a good proxy for active professional fund managers, was up 2.4% through Monday's close, well above the Dow Jones industrials' 0.2% advance.


Two, IBD's [Sector Leaders screen](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) has expanded from just three names at the start of January to seven today.


Three, the market is rising even without the help of many medical, defensive and certain retail stocks. Year to date, IBD's department store chain group is down more than 11%; generic drugs have sunk 10%. Water utilities have gushed more than 4% lower.


Four, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) has expanded its leaders list from seven on Jan. 1 to nearly a dozen stocks.

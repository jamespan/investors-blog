  Stock Market Surges, Commands This Outlook Boost As Data Keeps Soft-Landing Thesis Alive; These Sectors Thrive

The stock market proved on Wednesday that it's still sensitive to news on the economy and inflation. Wall Street expressed collective relief that the latter is not getting out of hand.




As at least three major indexes thrust into new highs, it makes sense for investors to expand exposure into growth stocks.


As the Market Pulse shows below, the current outlook calls for a boost in stock exposure to an 80%-100% range, up from 40%-60%. The last time IBD suggested getting this level of stock market exposure? Feb. 12.


The Nasdaq composite commanded the stock market advance. A 1.4% gain led to a new closing high of 16,742. Just a day before, the tech-rich index wiped out the only two [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on its count since it showed follow-through-day-like action on April 26.


Amid a broad rally that saw meme stocks **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) and [AMC Entertainment](https://www.investors.com/news/amc-stock-sheds-debt-gme-stock-meme-stocks-reverse/) ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)) actually fall, it's definitely encouraging to see Wednesday's rally to show breadth and depth. The S&P 500 jumped 1.2% for its eighth gain in 10 sessions, while the NYSE composite made a 0.9% advance for its ninth gain in 10 days. Both indexes rolled to all-time highs.


With Nasdaq volume surging on Wednesday vs. Tuesday, count Wednesday's action as an [official follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) that arrived on the 18th day of a new rally attempt.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9% and notched an all-time closing high of 39,908. Seven of its 30 components hold a Relative Strength Rating of 80 or higher. Small caps did a little better; the Russell 2000 rallied 1.1% and got closer to marking a multiyear peak.

Inflation Relief
----------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP051524-208x300.jpg)The S&P 500 wiped out the April 30 and May 1 distribution days due t to gains of more than 5% from those down sessions. Only the May 7 stalling day stays on the books for now.


IBD research has found that every major stock market bottom featured such a follow-through. Now, follow-through days do not always confirm a guaranteed rally. They can fail. However, the combination of strong technical action among major indexes, good breakouts and more stocks setting up in bases, and a simultaneous cooling in the cost of money appear to suggest these two things:


One, the pullback in March and April gave the stock market a well needed break.


Two, the general bull run, which really kicked into gear with a follow-through day on Jan. 6, 2023, still has legs.


Consumer prices in April [roughly met expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-april-retail-sales-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/). A 0.3% month-on-month increase matched the Econoday consensus forecast and slowed from a 0.4% gain in March. Meanwhile, core prices that exclude food and energy jumped 3.6% year over year. That's still well above the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2%. However, it did mark a deceleration from a 3.8% gain in March. Plus, some observers highlighted other signs that inflation is sticking to a cooling trend.


The LPL Take
------------


Jeffrey Roach, LPL Financial's chief economist, pointed out that core CPI excluding housing rose 2.13% in April vs. a year earlier. That's the lowest figure since a 2.02% gain in October. He noted that grocery prices fell in April, providing relief to buyers of meat, fruits and veggies.


However, Roach pointed to the zero change in April U.S. retail sales vs. the prior month, missing views for a 0.4% increase, as something to monitor closely. He also noted that a separate report found that the control group of retail sales fell 0.3% in April and suggested that "consumer spending downshifted in the beginning of the second quarter," according to a note emailed to IBD.


"The 'soft landing' narrative is still a possibility but not a guarantee," Roach added. "Markets will be looking for more confirmation, and the weak retail sales report did not help."


Retail sales rose a downwardly revised 0.6% in March vs. the prior month, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).

Stock Market Today
------------------


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond sank 8 basis points to 4.35%. That's the lowest close since 4.30% on April 4.


On [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge), you can study the moves in long-term interest rates by viewing the CBOE 10-year yield using the symbol zero-TNX. After the yield peaked at 4.99% in October, it dropped to 3.78% by December. Since then, the 10-year yield has notably traded in a range. More recently, it has traded within a band of roughly half a percentage point since April.


Is that good for the stock market?


One might argue yes. Stabilization in interest rates leads to less uncertainty for corporations in making business and financial decisions. Wall Street's sell side analysts have less to worry about how changes in the cost of money may impact earnings.


Breadth Good, Breakouts Expand
------------------------------


Amid this sharp drop in the 10-year yield, a number of industry groups did well.


At least 21 industry groups among the 197 tracked each day by IBD rolled 2% higher or more. They included a fistful of software, semiconductor and building-related fields. For sure, lower interest rates benefit these industries thanks to a lower cost of capital to invest, make acquisitions and issue stock buybacks.


The stock market showed winners topping losers on the NYSE by a roughly 5-2 margin. Again, this is bullish for the longs. On the Nasdaq, gainers beat decliners by a nearly 5-3 ratio.


Meanwhile, as noted on the [IBD Live show Tuesday](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/), the 10-day moving average of Nasdaq stocks making new highs exceeded the 10-day average of new lows last week. Headed into Wednesday's action, the 10-day average of new highs rose to 119 vs. 72 new lows.



[On MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF), go to "NYEXG" on the daily chart and you'll see a large spike in the 10-day moving average of NYSE issues making new highs vs. new lows. NYSE-listed **Ares Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)), an investment manager, jumped 3.4% to 149.82 and exited the 5% buy zone after a breakout past 139.48.


**KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), which also resides on the NYSE, surged 5.4% in heavy volume. It too hit new highs as a breakout from a narrow cup with handle at 70.58 succeeded.


Ares and KB Home are new members of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


A Lagging Industry Group In The Stock Market
--------------------------------------------



Of course, the miraclelike results of appetite-controlling medicines have spurred fantastic gains by some members of the biotech and ethical drug industries. Yet, biotech has been lagging. Check out iShares Biotech ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)), the ETF that gained 1.4% on Wednesday. At 137.34, it's still 23% below an August 2021 peak.


"It's been an interesting year for biotech," Adam Posner, partner at Boston-based HighVista Strategies, told IBD. "One characteristic of biotech is that it's more sensitive to interest rates than other sectors, which as we have seen can create heightened volatility and opportunities for investors."


HighVista, which has $10 billion in assets under management, pursues a diversified strategy in strategically identifying investments within the vast biotech sector. It ranges from innovative and early-stage companies that have game-changing technologies and new therapies to searching for fallen angels with significant cash and potential asset value relative to their market caps.


**Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), which is rushing to create its own weight-loss treatment, rallied 2.4% in accelerating volume. The innovator of blockbuster treatments in the 1990s to treat anemia in patients undergoing chemotherapy, Amgen is close to busting past a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and its 322.60 entry.

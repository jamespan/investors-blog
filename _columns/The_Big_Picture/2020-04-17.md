Was it a final rush of short covering? Or some frantic last-minute fills of large buy orders for institutions? Either way, Friday's late-hour wave of buying neatly capped a solid week for the major equity indexes.




Amid a seesaw session, the Nasdaq's late rally propelled the leading index of growth stocks to a 1.4% gain en route to a 6% gain for the week. Since it marked a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on April 6, the composite index has jumped 9%. The S&P 500, a 2.7% winner Friday, padded its advance from its own April 2 [confirmation of a new market uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to nearly 14%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose almost 5.8% for the week.


Volume jumped on both main exchanges. Weekly and monthly options on equities and indexes expired, boosting turnover. Still, it's refreshing to see no fewer than six days of Nasdaq gains in above-average turnover since April 1; these six gains averaged 2.8% each day.

What's Next For The Coronavirus Stock Market Rally?
---------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP041719-260x300.jpg)The nearly four-week rebound has been swift-footed after Covid-19 unleashed the fastest course to an authentic bear market. The market's next move may hinge on these five issues, and more.


1. Eye earnings results. The next two weeks are brim-full. The big question: Will companies beat already lowered estimates?
2. Trace the technical action. As noted in [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) this past week, the Nasdaq has held above a key technical level, the 21-day exponential moving average, for days now. The relatively smooth climb lately suggests buyers are in control right now.
3. Follow breakout stocks. Will they hold up? Some of the FAANG plays pulled back Friday, but the declines looked orderly. Volatility is still high, though, as can be seen in **Tradeweb** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) and in home health care play and [Leaderboard watchlist stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) **Amedisys** ([AMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMED)). Meantime, **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) finished the week above buy points.
4. Search for signs of [sector leadership](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-apr-16-2020/). Last week underscored the problems that money center banks have. They're boosting loan loss reserves. Near-zero interest rates squeeze their profit margins. But companies fighting the coronavirus made big strides. See stories on **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)), **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) in [Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), and IBD's [Technology section](https://www.investors.com/technology/).
5. Survey sentiment indicators. [The Cboe Market Volatility Index, or VIX,](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) hit 85.47, its second-highest level ever just a month ago. On Friday, it dove 5% to 38.06. Less volatility may encourage more institutions to dip their toes back into the market.

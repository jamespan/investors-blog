  Stock Market Bounce Improves With Solid Moves In These Top Stocks

The stock market is quickly shedding its Covid-19 fears, choosing riskier assets while leaving leading stocks on better footing.




The S&P 500 is the story this week. After Wednesday's 0.8% increase, the index bounced further from the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). If this rebound holds, it would be at least the seventh time this year the S&P 500 has bounced back after pulling back to the 50-day line. That makes for a reliable low, although the question is how much will the S&P 500 climb from here?


Of course, that's impossible to tell. The S&P 500 is aiming for its sixth consecutive monthly gain and the eighth in nine months. At some point that streak will end. But bullish action among many leading stocks should be taken as a positive sign, for now.


The Nasdaq composite added 0.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8%. Both indexes are back above their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


![MP072121-](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP072121--219x300.jpg)Small caps led as the Russell 2000 added 1.8%. The index found support around 2100 this week. Meanwhile, that price level held as support for the index twice in March, which should give investors some confidence about this low.


The Russell 2000 also is respecting its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


Small Caps, Leading Stocks Hold Key Levels
------------------------------------------


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 2.3%. Much like the Russell 2000, the ETF found support at a familiar level. It's made lows around 40 since December.


The support for [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and small caps is a sign that investors are willing to stick with growth and more-speculative stocks. (About one-third of the Russell 2000 companies are unprofitable.) Still, institutional investors have taken some money off the table, as the high number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) suggest.


Six of the S&P 500's seven distribution days came in the past couple of weeks. Thus, IBD's market outlook remains at "uptrend under pressure." That means investors need to be more guarded.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE as well. Winners outnumbers losers by nearly 3 to 1 on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


If the stock market was fearful of a Covid resurgence Monday, it wasn't on Wednesday. Airlines, hotels, casinos, restaurants and travel booking industry groups climbed more than 3%. Those groups, all sensitive to pandemic restrictions, stumbled Monday.


The bond market also seems to view the virus threat as overblown. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 8 basis points to 1.28% Wednesday afternoon.


Stock Market Bets On Covid-19 Vaccines
--------------------------------------


Hopes for a full return to economic activity rest largely on vaccinations, and investors are buying those stocks. **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) broke out of a new six-week [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/). **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), another Covid vaccine maker, climbed to a new closing high. It's up about 40% in the past week and a half.


But **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), whose one-shot [vaccine may not be as effective against the delta variant](https://www.barrons.com/articles/j-j-stock-earnings-study-vaccine-efficacy-delta-51626870074?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D86767752584359609670535559432365936577%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1626892829), is little changed this week. The company reported a [49% jump in earnings this morning and reached a settlement](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-johnson-johnson-earnings-q2-2021/) over opioid claims. Shares rose modestly.


Earnings reports generally cheered the stock market, and some sparked the session's best moves.



**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) shot up 11.5% to a record high after [the restaurant chain beat profit expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-stock-chipotle-earnings-q2-2021/), and same-store sales jumped 31.2% in Q2. The stock gapped up in heavy trading. Shares broke out past a 1,579.62 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) on July 7.


Advertising company **Interpublic Group** ([IPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPG)) broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) at 34.53 on strong Q2 results and a better outlook.


The stock market's shakeout left some leading stocks in bullish price areas. **Sprout Social** ([SPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPT)), **Cricut** ([CRCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRCT)), **Skyline Champion** ([SKY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKY)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are finding support after pulling back to the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Auto Stocks Rev Up In Stock Market
----------------------------------


Auto stocks were rolling. Dealer chain **Lithia & Driveway** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) rallied more than 4% after the company beat second-quarter expectations. Revenue more than doubled to $6 billion. **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) followed through on its breakout from a 107.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) after Monday's earnings report. It's now extended.

Auto dealers face limited inventories due to chip shortages. But the short supply has forced auto prices higher and the supply crunch also means dealers are paying less interest on loans to finance floor inventory, [the Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-dealers-can-keep-rolling-after-supply-crunch-11626891917).


**Bill.com** ([BILL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILL)) broke out of a c[up with a new, narrow handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and a 197.81 buy point. The B2B payments firm is [today's IBD 50 Stock To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/best-ipo-stocks-b2b-stock-bill-unprofitable-but-sales-soar/).


The energy sector was the day's strongest. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) jumped 3.5%. Nymex crude for September delivery rallied 4.6% to $70.30 a barrel. It was the largest dollar gain since March 24, and the largest percentage gain since April 14, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

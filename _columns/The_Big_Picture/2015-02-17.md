Stocks edged higher Tuesday, the start of a week that may shed some light on the strength of the market's resolve.


The indexes languished in afternoon trade, but buyers swamped trading desks in the final five minutes. That left the broad indexes near session highs at the close, something that's become a habit since this month's lows.


The afternoon gyrations were hardly discernible in the indexes' daily charts, because indexes traveled no more than 0.3% in either direction all day. The Nasdaq closed with a gain of 0.1% and the S&P 500 up less than 0.2%.


Volume fell, which was unusual for the day after a three-day weekend on Wall Street.


After a robust couple of weeks, it would not be surprising for the market to give back some ground. What's important is to see how the market reacts. Will it hold its gains, or even add to them? Will it retreat? If stocks do fall, will it be a gentle consolidation?


The indexes are making higher highs and higher lows â€” the textbook definition of an uptrend. The number of distribution days in the IBD Market Pulse is still high. But some of those higher-volume losses are more than a month old, and the number figures to get smaller if the market can avoid new distribution days.


The behavior of leading stocks also is important to watch at this juncture, and that's where some question marks exist.


The IBD 50 lagged last week, rising 1.4%, while the Nasdaq jumped more than 3% and the S&P 500 2%. There were few bad stocks to blame, such as the sell-offs in **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) and **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)). Most just made quiet progress.


But Tuesday, the IBD 50 performed a lot better. The index climbed 0.6%, thanks to strength in many of its technology and medical components.


More than a dozen members of the IBD 50 have broken out of bases this month. Better yet, the majority have advanced more than 5% from their entries.


The progress of those breakouts also will help illuminate the market's path.


A few more high-rated stocks broke out Tuesday.


Most impressive were drugmaker **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)), which cleared a cup-shaped base at 59.54 in more than double its usual volume, and chipmaker **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)), which topped a 58.09 cup buy point in nearly three times average volume.


Breadth is another area to watch, and one where the trend could be turning for the better.


The NYSE advance-decline line (plotted on the S&P 500 chart on the previous page) is making new highs.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is testing resistance levels from November and December. On a longer time frame, the Nasdaq line remains in a downtrend, which is what makes this indicator one to watch.


Energy, medical and consumer stocks led the market Tuesday.


Oil & gas industry groups are ranked low in IBD's table of 197 groups, but the energy sector has been rebounding as the price of crude also rebounds.


Transportation and industrial stocks lagged.


Reports on the housing market and New York-area manufacturing didn't move stocks much.

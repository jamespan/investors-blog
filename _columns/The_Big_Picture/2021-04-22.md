The stock market ended sharply lower Thursday following a Bloomberg report that President Joe Biden seeks to hike capital gains taxes. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 ended near session lows.




Midday Thursday, [Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy) that Biden "will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals to 39.6%, which, coupled with an existing surtax on investment income, means that federal tax rates for investors could be as high as 43.4%." The report swiftly sent the major stock indexes to session lows.


The Nasdaq fell 0.9% Thursday, while the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 also moved down 0.9% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 dipped 0.3%.


Leading growth stocks outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down just 0.2%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 9-ranked **MarineMax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)) surged over 7% Thursday in the wake of the company's strong quarterly earnings and sales results.


![MP042221](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP042221-242x300.jpg)Volume ended higher on the Nasdaq and NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The Nasdaq looked to add to Wednesday's 1.2% advance until the Bloomberg report sent the index stumbling. The tech-heavy composite continues to see resistance around the 14,000 price level. Meanwhile, the Dow and S&P 500 gave back the entirety of Wednesday's solid gains. All three major stock indexes remain just off record highs.


Despite falling three of the last four sessions, the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, although the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both added a [day of institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) Thursday. The overall distribution-day count remains light. The S&P 500 holds three distribution days, while the Nasdaq now has two.


With modest levels of institutional selling, investors should feel confident in buying stocks breaking out past [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). However, some recent breakouts aren't faring very well.


Graphics-chip maker **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) fell further below its 615 buy point in a cup base amid Thursday's 3.3% decline.


**Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) tumbled over 4% despite the company's [strong quarterly earnings and sales results](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/lrcx-stock-news-chip-gear-maker-beats-march-quarter-targets/) late Wednesday. The stock is still above its 603.70 buy point, but it had been as much as 10.8% above it on April 8. Further weakness would trigger a [round-trip sell signal.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/key-sell-signal-saved-stamps-com-stock-investors-from-posting-big-losses/)

Boston Beer ended Thursday just above a 1,236.67 buy point in a [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). Shares closed down 0.7% to 1,246. In extended trade, the stock jumped more than 7%.

Stocks To Watch: New Buy Points For PayPal, Square
--------------------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is adding a handle to a cup base, moving the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from 309.24 to 277.96, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares lost 1% Thursday, but they remain above their 50-day line.


According to Leaderboard commentary, "Three up weeks in a row is encouraging. Yet it's key to watch now how the stock holds those nice gains. The current base is third stage ... The Relative Strength Rating is improving but has not reached 80 in a long while."


Rival **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) is also building a cup-with-handle base, though the handle is a bit deeper than ideal. The new buy point is 278.23. Shares eased lower Thursday, as they try to find support around their key 50-day moving average.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Square stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-square-inc-cl-a-sq.aspx) boasts a strong 97 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).

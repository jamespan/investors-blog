The Nasdaq composite scored a fourth gain in a row and racked up new all-time highs on Wednesday. And this time, it didn't require heavy lifting by the megacap techs like the FAANG stocks.




Car (think **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which is in basing mode), agricultural chemical, generic drug, integrated telecom, RV, metal ore and construction gear companies garnered the heaviest buying. Meanwhile, three of the [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) actually fell.


The Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% and scaled to as high as 7691, a gain of 11% since Jan. 1. The Nasdaq 100 also delivered new highs as the index of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange rallied 0.6%.


The S&P 500 and the S&P 100 outperformed with 0.9% gains. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF edged up nearly 0.3% to 36.33.


The Dow Jones industrial average topped them all, rising 1.4%. Volume rose on both exchanges vs. Tuesday, another positive sign. Why? The solid advance in heavier volume points to especially busy buying by institutional investors, such as pension funds, college endowments, banks, mutual funds and the investment divisions of large corporations.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MP_060618-193x300.jpg)A strong bull market brushes off negative news. That law of Wall Street ruled on Wednesday.


Stocks dipped a touch into the red after the government reported a 0.4% seasonally adjusted rise in nonfarm U.S. productivity on an annualized basis for the first quarter. That sharply missed the [Econoday view](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of up 0.7%. Plus, unit labor costs rose 2.9%, higher than expected. That number reaffirmed the return of inflation. Higher inflation means the Federal Reserve could become more hawkish on the cost of money.


In fact, Treasuries did sell off. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond jumped to 2.97%, the highest so far in June. Yet U.S. equities rebounded into the black by around 11 a.m. ET and never looked back.



None of the three [FAANG companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) that fell on Wednesday suffered any significant damage. Even **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) showed little damage despite reports of potential antitrust punitive action by the EU. The Google search engine and Waymo self-driving technology company is working on a new base.


Meanwhile, retail and consumer-related sectors are really heating up.


You would have already known that if you simply peeked at IBD's stock research tables. Through Tuesday's close, the consumer, apparel, leisure and retail sectors all ranked in the top 10 among 33 sectors. (See the current rankings by going to Stock Lists on the home page of Investors.com, click on "[IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/)," then choose "Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables."


Leading Stocks, A Sign Of Market Health
---------------------------------------



[Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) soared more than 17% in extended-hours trading after the innovative discount retail chain smashed Wall Street's consensus fiscal Q1 earnings view. Earnings on an operating basis jumped 133% to 35 cents a share, well above the Thomson Reuters estimate. Sales rose 27% to $296.3 million.


The stock [entered IBD Leaderboard as a call option play](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Tuesday.


The stock has now rallied more than 25% past a 71.69 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and up 14% past a 78.38 [flat-base entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).


Five Below is not an isolated case.



Consider **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Tiffany** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)), all of which are also currently featured in [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). They are just a few more examples of how well-picked individual stocks can help a savvy growth-stock picker hammer the return of the S&P 500.


Market Risks Beyond The Horizon
-------------------------------


The gradual push higher in interest rates at some point will be an even greater concern for equity investors because of the consequences it may have on corporations that issue a lot of bonds. Why?


Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for SPDR Sector ETF products at State Street Global Advisors, a division of **State Street** ([STT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STT)), says he's closely monitoring the rapid buildup in corporate debt issuance amid signs that the "global synchronous economic growth" story is likely to start cooling next year.


Arone notes that some $4 trillion in corporate bonds will need to be refinanced over the next five years. And almost half of investment grade debt issued by U.S. companies is rated triple B, just one step above junk.


During the equity market's bottom in 2009, that figure was roughly a third.


Keep in mind that it was in part a crisis in fixed income that began to take hold in 2007 that presaged a massive bear market in equities the next year.


"The quality of investment grade bonds is declining, and in the future if you get downgrades on debt, then institutions will be forced to sell bonds," Arone told IBD in an interview by phone. "It makes sense. We saw this in the previous debt crisis. As the economic cycle progresses, the quality (of fixed income assets) deteriorates."


Yet for now, in addition to solid action in general by leading companies, here are four more reasons why the market uptrend continues to upend the bears.


One, the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the key averages are improving. Through Tuesday's close, the Nasdaq scored a B-, much improved from a D as the market went back into "confirmed uptrend" on May 10. (Check the current ratings by seeing the General Market Indicators PDF link at the bottom of this article.)


The S&P 500's Acc./Dist. rating, which tracks price-and-volume interaction over the past 13 weeks, edged up to a D+.


Good Breadth
------------


Two, the NYSE's advance-decline line has now risen for five weeks in a row. Good. It means that more issues are participating in the rally.


On Wednesday, winners thumped losers on the Nasdaq by a nearly 2-1 ratio.


Three, the S&P 500 is still a laggard in 2018. Yet as its daily chart shows, notice how it's now spent four solid weeks above its 50-day moving average. That's the longest period of time since January.


Technically speaking, that's good. It means the rally is accelerating.


Four, [the new highs list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jun-05-2018/) continues to dominate the new lows. On Tuesday, 427 stocks on the Nasdaq and the Big Board made IBD's screened list, vs. 75 names making 52-week or all-time lows.


Five, more stocks, such as Alphabet, are building bases. This means more stocks are putting themselves in the position of potentially hoisting themselves out of these bases and snatching new highs.


And except for the short sellers, when a stock hits new highs, every shareholder is grinning.

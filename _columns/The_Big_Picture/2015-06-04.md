Nasdaq, S&P 500 Suffer Some Dents, But Has Put-Call Ratio Pegged Low?

Stocks stayed in the indexes' recent trading range Thursday but still posted sizable losses. The Nasdaq dropped 0.8%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.9%. The IBD 50 fell 0.6%. Volume rose across the board. The price of West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil dropped almost 3% each, knocking oil stocks and adding drag to the S&P 500. Forty of the stocks in the index are oil-related, and all 40 fell.

  

Both major indexes added a distribution day. Distribution involves a loss in a major index in rising volume. Such action is the footprint of institutional selling.

  

The current distribution count is a concern but not yet strong enough to launch a correction. More worrisome than the count, perhaps, is the bunching. The indexes have incurred either distribution or stalling (a subtle form of distribution) in three of the past five sessions.

  

Last year, the Nasdaq suffered pullbacks in the 10% range twice — at the April and October lows. So far this year, pullbacks have stayed in the 5% neighborhood.

  

Shallow drops and lackluster gains, however, have made for a challenging environment for market-timing growth investors.

  

Market timers would rather see emphatic declines and vigorous rebounds.

  

Over the past three weeks, the Nasdaq has sketched tight weekly closes in fairly narrow ranges. The S&P 500 had been showing similar action, though it closed below its 50-day moving average Thursday.

  

If bulls were looking for a bright spot Thursday, the put-call volume ratio provided it. The gauge closed above 1.0, a level often associated with short-term market lows.

  

By itself, Thursday's action wasn't terribly significant. However, the bunching of distribution and loss of the 50-day line could make the market more vulnerable to Friday's news lineup.

  

The employment situation will be released Friday before the open. Also on Friday, OPEC will meet in Vienna to weigh oil production, and Greece's unpaid debt mess continues to swirl.

  

Neither the U.S. economy nor Greece nor OPEC seems likely to offer more of anything — except more of the same.

  

On Thursday, breakouts among top-rated stocks were scarce. Quartz countertops provider **Caesarstone** ([CSTE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSTE)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base, but volume was only 29% above average. The stock is thinly traded.

  

Despite the thin trade, Caesarstone has attracted some fund support. Over the three quarters through March, the number of funds holding shares grew from 156 to 193, and the total fund stake rose 18%.

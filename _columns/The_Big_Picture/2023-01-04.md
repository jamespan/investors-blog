Stocks Today Show Some Resilience; Why These Energy Stocks Issued Sell Signals
===============================================================================

Well, well, one up day out of two so far in 2023 might not seem like a big deal. Small sample size? Yes. A bitter aftertaste given by [stocks today](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), given that all of the key indexes finished well off their session highs? Absolutely.




But amid this bear market, Wednesday's action showed a hint of promise. For starters, consider what happened exactly a year ago.


Stocks Today Vs. Early 2022
---------------------------


The Nasdaq composite started 2022 off right, rising 1.2% after a solid 21.4% advance in 2021. But in the second day of trading in 2022, the Nasdaq reversed hard. It fell 1.3%, giving back all of the prior session's advance and then some. Volume climbed, indicating intense professional selling. That [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) helped warn of an avalanche of selling that proceeded over the next 13 sessions. The Nasdaq nose-dived 16% over that period, from the Jan. 4 close of 15,622 to the Jan. 24 low of 13,094.


So, what's the situation in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/)?


The first trading day of 2023: not pleasant. The Nasdaq sank almost 0.8%. But the still-tech-heavy composite index, rising nearly 0.7% on Wednesday, nearly wiped away all of that opening-day loss.


The S&P 500, which lost 0.4% on Tuesday, rebounded with more force on Wednesday, up almost 0.8%.


It certainly would have benefited stocks today even more if the S&P 500 had finished near its session highs. At one point, the index gained as much as 1.3%. Of course, it's still too early to tell if institutions are simply scraping for some bargains or buying stocks in earnest. At the very least, the large-cap benchmark quietly marked its highest close in eight sessions.


And as seen in the Market Pulse table, Wednesday's gains do not change the outlook for stocks. This means buying stocks still harbors outsize risk. But forget about your most ambitious 2023 resolution now. Rather, today is the best moment to track leadership in terms of sectors, industry groups and individual stocks.

Small Caps Win The Day
----------------------


Yet on the bright side, the gains by the indexes — including a nearly 1.3% rise by iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) and a 1.5% lift by SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) in a day of outperformance by smaller equities — came amid a backdrop of data that pointed to a still-strong labor market.


The monthly JOLTS survey of job openings and labor turnover for November handily exceeded the [Econoday consensus estimate](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Plus, the October figure of U.S. job openings got a revised bump up. Meaning? Employers still are having a tough time filling vacant positions. They may have to increase pay even more to get desirable candidates. This upward pressure on wages is going diametrically opposite the inflation path desired by the Federal Reserve.


Meanwhile, stocks got a bit of a jolt right after the minutes from the December Fed meeting on interest rates came out at around 11 a.m. PT. Market veterans noted that the tone of the discussion among the central bank's decision makers still hit plenty of hawkish notes. At that Dec. 14 meeting, the Fed decided to raise the fed funds rate by half a point, rather than 75 basis points, to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%.


Bond investors, meanwhile, did not flinch at the day's news.


The CME Fed Watch survey of bond traders showed a 71% chance that at the upcoming Feb. 1 meeting, the U.S. central bank will taper its rate hikes again with just a quarter-point gain to 4.5%-4.75%. That's the highest probability in a month. Meanwhile, chances for a second straight 50-basis-point hike have stayed low at 29%.


The Fed raised short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a point for four straight meetings last year, before the latest hike in December. On Wednesday, investors loaded up on long-dated Treasuries again. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell 8 basis points to 3.70%. That's well below 4.55% for 3-month T-bills and 4.36% for two-year notes.


At least for now, the government bond market is telegraphing this message: The Fed has likely done enough monetary tightening for now to give prices a chance to cool even further this year. Ultimately, the "terminal rate" for the short-term cost of money may not actually reach 5% or 5.25%.


These Energy Plays Wither
-------------------------


Meanwhile, other financial markets showcased signs that inflation will come down.


Crude oil got whacked again. Front-month ICE Brent futures plummeted 5.2% to $77.84 a barrel. Dow Jones Market Data says this marked the largest one-day dollar decline since Sept. 23. It also highlights a 47% plunge from the all-time high of $146.08 seen on July 3, 2008.


Oil is in a bear market, down about 40% from its March high. Even the Nasdaq hasn't fallen that far off its all-time peak of 16,212.



Take a look at the daily charts of **Scorpio Tankers** ([STNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNG)) and **Torm** ([TRMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRMD)). They've joined a few other oil plays, such as **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) and **Equinor** ([EQNR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQNR)) that have given up support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Scorpio sliced through its 50-day line Wednesday, falling 10.4% in the heaviest turnover for a down session since July 6. This action justifies at least selling some of a position. Wednesday's decline was also the biggest point loss since the stock's breakout in March 2022. Treat that as another [key sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-signal-biggest-1-day-point-loss-can-mark-the-top/).

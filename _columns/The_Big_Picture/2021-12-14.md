Not all bounces in the stock market are the same — at least on an index-to-index basis. This is also true among [top stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/).




A late-afternoon rebound attempt did not garner many style points among Wall Street's bulls. But on the merrier side, some key equity indexes refused to undercut their recent lows — at least for a day.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average actually finished near the lows of its session. Yet Tuesday's 0.3% drop, or 106 points, proved more restrained. The Nasdaq composite ended in the upper half of the day's range, but still lost 1.1%.


Looking at the true trading range after accounting for the index's gap-down, the Nasdaq's close of 15,237 settled within the lower half of the day's low of 15,097 and Monday's close of 15,413.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP121421-235x300.jpg)The stock market's negative action marked the eighth time since Nov. 22 in which the Nasdaq fell 1% or more. And in most of those occasions, the index saw volume increase. The daily price-and-volume chart of the Nasdaq bespeaks classic institutional distribution. Meanwhile, the Market Pulse also highlights heavy selling among key stocks.


Volume rose mildly on the Nasdaq. Early data showed flat volume on the NYSE.


All Eyes On The Federal Reserve Wednesday
-----------------------------------------


Was the selling muffled as equity traders await [confirmation by the Federal Reserve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-stock-market-ready-for-faster-taper-but-not-this/) at the end of its interest-rate policy meeting that it will aim to wrap up quantitative easing faster than originally planned? George Mateyo, chief investment officer for Key Private Bank in Cleveland, thinks the recent profit-taking could be an adjustment to growing expectations of possibly three hikes in the fed funds rate in 2022.


The Fed funds rate has stood at 0% to 0.25% since the spring of 2020, when the coronavirus grew into a pandemic.


"The Fed is behind the curve. We're kind of in a wage spiral now," Mateyo told IBD. The U.S. economy is "well ahead of trend" in terms of growth in retail sales. But he does not think the U.S. central bank is trying to position interest rates to a level that would lead to turmoil in the economy. Rather, expect some "indigestion" on the market's reaction to the current inflationary environment.


"It's not a time to be ultra-defensive," he said. "The economy is not contracting. But selectivity in the stock market is going to be more important. I see equities as hot and crowded."


Stock Market Tomorrow: Will Bank Sector Win In 2022?
----------------------------------------------------


Smaller issues performed worse than the Dow on Tuesday, but not as poorly as the Nasdaq.


While the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) eased 0.4%, iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) slumped 0.8%. At the day's low of 213.31, the small-cap ETF didn't quite take out its Dec. 3 low of 212.71. The S&P 500 slumped 0.7%, or less than half of the 1.5% sell-off in Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)). The IBD 50 ETF has dropped 18% from its Nov. 9 peak.


Mateyo likes the banking sector going forward, as the U.S. Treasury yield curve maintains a positive slope, even though rates in the middle area of the curve have recently gone up.


The benchmark 10-year bond's yield rebounded to 1.43% on Tuesday, but the rise has remained modest in recent weeks. That yield still compares positively with 0.67% for two-year notes, 1.23% for five-year bonds and 1.82% for 30-year bonds as of Monday's close, according to U.S. Treasury data.


Less than a dozen industry groups rose 1% or more in the stock market. They include department-store chains, steel, fiber-optic telecom gear, meat and consumer-loan issues. Investment bank, money center and superregional bank stocks gained 0.7% to 0.8%.


Inside The IBD 50
-----------------



Looking at the IBD 50, **Customers Bancorp** ([CUBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBI)) has rallied 43% in the fourth quarter with less than three weeks to go in 2021. The tight, sideways action since Nov. 8 is taking the shape of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/).


That pattern comes on top of a cup-style base that formed from June to September, originally generating a 43.96 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Revenue at the West Reading, Pa., regional lender has grown 22%, 13%, 10%, 10%, 13%, 32%, 31% and 63% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters. Customers' earnings tanked 24% to $1.92 a share in 2018, but has increased each year since then to an expected $9.21 this year. The bank is discussed in today's [Breakout Stocks column](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stock-watch-customers-bancorp-eyes-another-breakout-after-cryptocurrency-success/).


Also among stock market leaders, **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) soared nearly sixfold since bottoming at 20.90 in March 2020. Shares have slid back into the heart of a long, messy consolidation that formed over five months since the stock peaked at 109.84 in April.


Support at its still-rising 40-week moving average is critical. The midcap growth stock holds a tiny cushion above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) as well. A perfect [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99 highlights the stock's sterling quality. But the relative strength line — drawn in blue on IBD's stock charts — has been fading for eight straight weeks. Among stocks to watch, a rising RS line is preferable.

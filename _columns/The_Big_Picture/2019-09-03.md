title: Nasdaq Down, Dow Utilities Soar; What The Stock Market Sell-Off Lacked

Investors on Tuesday wasted no time in dumping more shares after the Labor Day holiday weekend. They also rushed into assets deemed safe havens — no surprise as the market spent its 13th day in a state of "uptrend under pressure."




Gold, silver and defensive stocks (think food, soap and utilities) in the market all rose. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond did another swan dive, this time hitting as low as 1.43%. Even bitcoin rallied.


However, the sell-off did not hit leading growth stocks especially hard. A huge sell-off among the best stocks in the market usually marks the end of a major market run, and the market lacked that Tuesday.


The Nasdaq composite fell 1.1%, erasing a sizable chunk of its 2.7% rebound last week. The S&P 500 eased 0.7%, helped in large part by gains in electric utility, diversified utility, gold and silver mining, packaged food, water supply, sweets and soap companies.

Both indexes remain below their 50-day moving averages, but haven't fallen far below their 52-week peaks.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped 1.2%. At 33.63, it continues to beat the S&P 500 with a 21.7% rally since Jan. 1. The S&P 500 is up 15.9%.


The Russell 2000 gave up 1.5%, worse than a 1.3% drop by the Dow Jones transportation average.


Fear over the economic outlook commanded virtually the entire session.


A New Recession Indicator?
--------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP090319-261x300.jpg)Two days after the U.S. and China both set into motion higher tariffs on each others' imported goods on Sunday, stocks fell en masse right at the opening bell.


A rebound in the first half-hour got stymied at around 10 a.m. ET, when a worse-than-expected print on the Institute for Supply Management's monthly survey of manufacturers indicated that factories actually showed a contraction in activity last month.


The 49.1 reading not only missed the [Econoday forecast of 51.3](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) by a mile. It also undercut the lowest estimate of 50.5 held by Wall Street economists. A 50 reading is neutral; any number above 50 denotes expanding activity in the nation's manufacturing sector.


Keep in mind that the last time the ISM manufacturing index plowed beneath 50 came in August 2016. That year, the Nasdaq corrected as much as 19.5%, nearly falling enough to trigger the technical definition of a bear market.


Given that some discount retailers, including [a couple of names on IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), have shown some hefty price gains in recent weeks, investors will likely keep a laserlike focus on the upcoming [monthly ISM service sector survey](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), slated for Thursday.


The Street currently sees a 54 print, well above the 50 neutral reading.

Volume grew on both main exchanges. That doesn't really come as much surprise, given that Friday's session came ahead of a long weekend.


Nonetheless, the recent price-and-volume trends should continue to worry IBD readers. For starters, each of the past three up days by the S&P 500 came in below-average volume on the NYSE (IBD studies volume changes in that main exchange rather than simply the S&P 500 companies). The S&P 500 hasn't risen in above-average turnover since Aug. 16.



Looking at all of August, the Nasdaq scored seven down days in heavy volume, vs. just four up sessions in above-normal activity.


Granted, in two of those down days (Aug. 9 and Aug. 15), the Nasdaq rebounded off its session low, ending in the upper 60% of the day's trading range. Such action denotes institutional buying support rather than [outright distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


However, market bulls would much prefer to see more evidence of enthusiastic buying among mutual funds, banks, hedge funds, insurers and college endowments. For now, a D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating for both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 affirms the elevated [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) as seen in today's Market Pulse table.


Beyond The Nasdaq
-----------------


Income investors likely relished Tuesday's action. The Dow Jones utility average surged 1.8% and made a new all-time high. At 860.85, the 15-stock index pushed 20.7% ahead for the year.


That almost matches a 22.1% gain since Jan. 1 through Friday's close for the IBD Mutual Fund Index. (The bottom of each Big Picture column and the [Market Trend web page](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) both contain a link to the General Market Indicators PDF, where you can track the daily performance of this index.)



On the other hand, a decent number of individual growth stocks continue to lead. Longtime [IBD Leaderboard play](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Fiserv** ([FISV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FISV)), video streaming innovator **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) and **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) are trading at new highs or not far below them.

The action [in stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) did not quite match the exploding shoe incident that sent Duke University basketball phenom Zion Williamson to the bench during several weeks of the regular NCAA season. Yet a backsliding of stock prices on Tuesday — particularly in bank and transportation stocks — underscored Wall Street's lingering concerns about the future of the global economy.




Nonetheless, decent upside action among a healthy posse of true market leaders prevented the session from becoming an absolute shambles.


The Nasdaq composite wasted an early advance of nearly 0.7% to finish with a 0.1% gain. It closed well within the lower half of Tuesday's intraday range. Volume rose vs. the prior session. The price-and-volume action pointed to [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), a form of distribution in which large fund managers sell heavily into market strength.


The stalling day raised the Nasdaq's distribution count back to five over the past 25 trading sessions. On March 13, the Nasdaq shaved off a Feb. 7 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) to its recent strong advance.


Four other instances of unusually strong profit-taking have taken place a lot more recently: Feb. 28 (down 0.3%), March 4 (-0.2%), March 6 (-0.9%) and March 7 (-1.1%).


In terms of time, it won't be until April 4 before any of these four distribution days would expire. Yet as the size of these declines suggests, they mostly did not match the severity of intense selling that sent the market into a serious decline in October to December.


The S&P 500 behaved in similar fashion to the Nasdaq. It surrendered a decent intraday gain of almost 0.7% to edge less than 1 point lower by day's end. That drop wasn't severe enough to meet the minimum definition of a distribution day, or a drop of 0.2% or more.

The Biggest Losers In Stocks Today
----------------------------------


The Dow transports rolled 1.3% lower as trucking companies fell the hardest. The rise of crude oil prices in 2019 is certainly one factor for this group's struggles. Yet what might matter right now? Some news wires report that China is pushing back against some U.S. demands in leveling the playing field in the game of global trade.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones utility average slumped 1.1%. A further flattening in some areas of the U.S. Treasury bond yield curve may have also let the air out of the recent rallies in money-center, superregional and regional-banking shares. West and Southwest lenders, Southeast banks, superregionals and Midwest financial institutions all ranked within the 10 worst-performing groups, one day ahead of a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates.


Recreational-vehicle, logistics, leasing and railroad shares also performed dismally.


Interestingly, none of the above-mentioned industry groups rank within the top 40 of IBD's daily ranking of [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


2019 Is A Year For Great Stock Picking
--------------------------------------


The overall action points to a generally healthy climate for stock pickers.


[In IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Tuesday, as many as seven companies rallied 0.5% or higher, easily outrunning the major indexes. They include **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), which has thrust more than 40% past a [prime buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 48.34. Diabetes play **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) also rose nicely.


Dexcom is trying to clear a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) while testing institutional buying support at the 50-day line.



4 Things To Avoid Doing Now
---------------------------


While the first quarter of 2019 has been a boon for savvy readers who follow the rules of [CAN SLIM investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), now is not the time to get overconfident or sloppy.


Here are some common mistakes to sidestep:


**1. Don't buy way above the proper buy point**. It's so easy to get swept up by the madness of crowds. That's why buying with discipline always counts.


Take **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), one of the Cinderella stories of this emerging new bull run.



The highly profitable gold miner broke out of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) at 23.96 back on Dec. 10. That was the right time to buy. Since then, the midcap from Toronto has jumped 53%. But lately, the stock is showing some heavy-volume sell-offs and is getting closer to a test of support at the 50-day moving average. If you bought near the top of the current rally at 36, you'd be forced to [cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


**2. Don't settle for No. 3 or No. 4 in the industry**. The best stocks in a top sector or industry will tend to clear bases and hit new highs first. They will show superior Composite, EPS and Relative Strength ratings at the start of their runs. A few corporate turnarounds may offer an exception or two.


**3. Don't buy a new IPO on the first day of trading**. Jeans maker **Levi Strauss** ([LEVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEVI)) is determining a price range for its upcoming initial public offering. Don't buy on the first day. Wait for a trading range to emerge. A [good IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) may develop, too.


**4. Don't buy before the breakout.** Just look at what **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) did today.



The stock fell more than 2% in triple its average volume and took out both its 50- and 200-day moving averages in one fell swoop. For a while, it looked as if the entertainment giant was going to soar out of a cup with handle in much the same way as its Marvel movie superheroes.


Disney is facing the immense challenge of digesting a huge amount of assets from Fox Studios, and faces a lot of scrutiny over whether its all-digital entertainment offering will prosper in a new market created by **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).

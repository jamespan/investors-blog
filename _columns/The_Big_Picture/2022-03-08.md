  Nasdaq, S&P 500 Slide A Fourth Day In A Row; Will This Oil Giant Take A Break?

A day after the Nasdaq suffered one of its worst single-day percentage losses in a long time, bargain hunters appeared to jump back into stocks on Tuesday.




The end result? Not good.


For a short period of time, the stock market looked like it was flexing some newfound strength amid a morass of negative news stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war. Not long after President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. would unilaterally prohibit the import of any Russian-made oil and gas, the major indexes shook off the early-morning sellers. By 1:15 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite staged a 3.9% bounce off its session low and a 2.5% lift from Monday's bearish close.


But as traders on Wall Street returned from lunch, the rally once again went up in smoke.


While the Nasdaq, for now, never came close to taking out its year-to-date low of 12,587, the tech-centered index ended down 0.3%, notching a fourth straight decline. Volume zoomed to the highest level since at least Jan 24.


The S&P 500 tracked a similar bearish trajectory. Up as much as 1.8% in early-afternoon trading, the large-cap benchmark gave back all of that solid advance to fall 0.7%. Meanwhile, iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF snapped its three-day losing streak. But a 0.6% gain hardly puts a dent on its loss of 12.5% year to date. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.2%.

Time To Take Profits In Chevron?
--------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped another 0.6%. Crude oil play **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) surged for an eighth straight day as U.S. crude oil futures climbed 3.6% to $123.70 a barrel. Both Chevron's 29% gain over that eight-day period and a gap-up in price Tuesday meet at least two parameters of a [climax top](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/).


But fellow Dow 30 component **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) fell for the sixth time in seven sessions and closed deeper below its 200-day moving average. The hamburger and chicken nuggets chain joined an ever-expanding band of multinational companies pledging to cut or reduce business ties with Russia.


Government bond traders also got swept up in the jittery session. As investors took profits on the recent rally in 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, the yield on the benchmark note jumped 12 basis points to 1.87%, according to Cboe data.


No Leadership Change Yet
------------------------


Overall, breadth has been shrinking bearishly since early November. You can see that easily via the advance-decline line for both the Nasdaq and the NYSE in the General Market Indicators page, linked to every Big Picture at the bottom of the story and also accessed at [Market Trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).


Yet, in a small divergence, the ratio of winning stocks vs. losing ones actually tilted slightly in favor of the former. Data on eTrade Financial showed 2,463 issues rising on the Nasdaq and 2,286 falling. On the NYSE, the total number of losers edged winners by 34.


The accompanying Market Pulse continues to highlight heavy buying in the oil and gas, coal and infrastructural engineering areas of the market. **Fluor** ([FLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLR)), which cleared a 25.78 cup entry point and moved past an [early trendline buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) near 24 on Monday, raced 4.5% higher on Tuesday in surging turnover.



[The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) in the expert in construction and maintenance of oil and gas, petrochemical and mining facilities goes up to 27.07.


As noted in [Monday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/indexes-look-more-like-a-bear-market-after-recession-fears-spark-another-sell-off/), the Nasdaq has officially met the definition of a garden-variety bear market. That is, the composite has fallen at least 20% from its all-time peak of 16,212. The premier index for growth companies has also given back all of its gains since May 2021.


Looking Beyond The Nasdaq
-------------------------


Is the market pricing in a lot of the economic consequences of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine? Certainly. Are the biggest fund managers on Wall Street raising cash and sitting more on the sidelines, waiting for clues from the Federal Reserve on how quickly the central bank will raise interest rates in order to tame inflation? Quite possibly.


The first major step will be the announcement at the end of the March 15-16 Fed meeting. But before this takes place, keep an eye on investors' reaction to Thursday's report on U.S. consumer prices for February.


According to [Econoday's consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), economists expect the CPI index to rise 0.7% vs. January and accelerate 7.9% vs. the same month in 2021. That would mark a faster rise in inflation from January's 0.6% month-on-month gain and 7.5% increase year over year.


Also, watch to see if the [Investors Intelligence survey of market pundits](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) shows a further drop in bearishness. Heavy pessimism is ultimately good for stocks. When almost everyone is negative, it means these folks have sold their shares and are expecting stock prices to fall even further.

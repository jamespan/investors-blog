Broad selling in the final 45 minutes of trading took the shine off an initially decent rebound on Wall Street on Wednesday. The weak finish hinted that the possibility of a true bear market has not diminished.




A 3% drop by personal care products and ethical giant **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) and a negative reversal by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) squelched an early 0.8% rally by the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow, which [caved more than 1,000 points in the prior two sessions](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-falls-1000-points-growth-stocks/), ended down less than 1 point.


The Nasdaq composite overcame a tiny loss by Apple to finish 0.9% higher. The Nasdaq 100's 0.8% gain reflected strength in some tech sectors, particularly in software, chips and biotech.


Small caps did better. The Russell 2000 gained 1.3%. The S&P SmallCap 600 advanced almost 1% vs. a 0.3% lift by the S&P 500.

Friday will likely be a quiet session too as Wall Street is scheduled to close early at 1 p.m. ET.


State Of The Nasdaq Composite
-----------------------------


Take a look at a [daily chart of the Nasdaq](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), and it's clear that fund managers are divided about the future.


The rebound from Oct. 30 was swift and substantial enough that the market eventually posted a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). Yet as IBD has written over the years, follow-through rallies can fail.


The latest downdraft of selling took the Nasdaq a bit closer to a 20% correction, the classic definition of a bear market.


At Tuesday's session low of 6830, the Nasdaq has now fallen 16% below its all-time peak of 8133. ThatÂ nearly matches the 16.2% fall by the Russell 2000. The S&P 500 has dropped 11.5% below its Sept. 21 peak.


Meanwhile, growth stocks already hit bear-market territory before Tuesday's downgrade of the current market outlook to "correction" from "uptrend under pressure." The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF, a 1.9% winner on Wednesday, still lies 25% beneath its Oct. 1 high of 38.79.


Innovator IBD 50 roared 34% higher in 2017.


Potential Bear-Market Triggers
------------------------------


The current correction embodies concern on numerous fronts. Will global trade decline? Is the world economy headed to recession in 2019? Is the Federal Reserve going too fast in raising the cost of money? Will the nose-dive in crude oil prices hurt spending in the energy industry?


Some observers, meanwhile, are looking to the possibility of good news on the trade front during a G-20 summit that starts in Buenos Aires on Nov. 30. Truth is, it's hard to know what piece of news will define the end of a major decline.


Keeping abreast of the news is always important. But for the CAN SLIM investor, it's ultra-key to find signs that institutional demand is ready to exceed supply. So for now, watch these three critical market factors, as well as a future [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), hinting that major indexes could be ready to bottom.


One, watch the new-lows list. On Wednesday, hundreds of companies on the Nasdaq and NYSE together still hit new 52-week or all-time lows. When the new-lows list shrinks smartly, it will be a good sign for bulls. It indicates that more stocks have bottomed out and are building bases.


New Stock Leaders Need To Emerge
--------------------------------


Medical, consumer, telecom, some retail, and perhaps a helping of select leading techs across numerous industries might help the market bottom out. **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) have corrected normally. But they still have tons of work to do on their current bases.


Few stocks are breaking out lately. These days, the action by **Innoviva** ([INVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVA)), recently highlighted in the [IBD Stock of the Day column](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-innoviva-stock-respiratory-medicines/), is a rarity.


Two, the stock market must end its spate of big drops in heavy volume. A repeat of big sell-offs seen in recent weeks would definitely send U.S. equities closer to a bear market. Instead, keep an eye out for quiet clues of institutional accumulation.


A 'D' Grade
-----------


Through Tuesday's action, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating of the S&P 500 was a terrible D on a scale of A to E. The Dow Jones industrials showed a D+, the Nasdaq a C-. This rating gets recalculated each day and covers 13 weeks' worth of action.


Future advances in higher or above-average volume, combined with declines in lower or thin turnover, will help these ratings improve.


Three, overall breadth in the overall market must improve. Today, it looks ugly. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been in a pronounced downtrend for more than 12 weeks.


On Wednesday, winners beat losers by a nearly 5-to-2 margin on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, gainers outmatched decliners 3-to-1.

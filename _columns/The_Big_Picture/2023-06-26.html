<p>This is the final week of June and of the second quarter. Institutional investors will be making portfolio adjustments, which could make for volatile or unpredictable trading this week, besides the usual market-moving stuff.</p>
<p>Wall Street will have its eyes and ears trained on Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday. He is scheduled to speak at the European Central Bank on a discussion about central banking. Later that same day, he holds a public chat with the governor of the Bank of Spain.</p>
<p>Housing and durable goods reports come out Tuesday morning. On Thursday, jobless claims and the final report on Q1 GDP (1.4% growth is expected) are due out. Then Friday, the May personal income and spending report comes out. It includes the core personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index, the Fed's most trusted measure of consumer inflation.</p>
<p>If the stock market was hoping for a relatively calm week ahead of second-quarter earnings and the Fourth of July holiday, it probably won't get it.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>
<h2>Stock Market Majors Mostly Lower</h2>
<p>The Nasdaq composite fell 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 nearly 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat.</p>
<p>The so-called Magnificent 7 stocks that control much of today's stock market had an off day, causing a drag on the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA" target="_blank">TSLA</a>) skidded more than 6%, <strong>Nvidia</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA" target="_blank">NVDA</a>) fell 3.7%, <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL" target="_blank">GOOGL</a>) 3.2%, and <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META" target="_blank">META</a>) 3.6%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8490377 size-medium" src="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062623--259x300.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="300" srcset="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062623--259x300.jpg 259w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062623--768x888.jpg 768w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062623-.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px" uia-uid="0|1">The Nasdaq is on course to test its <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/">21-day exponential moving average</a>. That could be the first area of support for the index. If the composite breaches that level, the next possible bottom could be around 13,200. The index nearly topped this price level in August. And 13,000 is a major round number that can act as a psychological magnet of sorts.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 is already near its August peak at 4325. Its 21-day average is at 4311. Beyond those levels, 4200 makes sense as a possible bottom for multiple reasons. First, it was a level of resistance earlier this year and often resistance becomes support. Second, the <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/">50-day moving average</a> is right around 4200. And third, it's another big, round number for the index.</p>
<p>The stock market and traders in other financial instruments have <a href="https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-shrug-off-wagner-coup-attempt-prigozhin-flees-these-stocks-could-surge-if-putin-is-overthrown/">shrugged off the crisis in Russia</a>, where the head of the Wagner Group paramilitary force first seemed set on staging a rebellion, then quickly backtracked.</p>
<p>Crisis-sensitive assets such as crude oil, gold and the U.S. dollar saw little change Monday. The iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITA" target="_blank">ITA</a>) fell 0.2%. The exchange traded fund shows a minuscule gain of only 1.4% for the year so far.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, domestic-focused small caps did outperform.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns medium-8 leftchart"><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=IWM"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Russell 2000 closed 0.1% higher, although it was up more than 1% in early trading. Roughly 80% of the Russell 2000's revenue comes from the U.S. By comparison, 41% of the S&amp;P's revenue comes from abroad, according to FactSet.</p>
<p>Indexes fell but avoided a <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/">distribution day</a> thanks to a trading anomaly. The Russell index rebalancing caused volume to soar late in Friday's session, which made it almost impossible for volume to rise Monday. Monday's volume was still lower than on Thursday, if we want to remove the effect of the rebalancing.</p>
<h2>Cruise Stocks Take On Water</h2>
<p>There's a trickle of earnings reports this week, but one announcement Monday morning sparked worries about a key part of the travel-stock rally.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns medium-6 leftchart"><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=ccl"></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Carnival</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL" target="_blank">CCL</a>), the world's largest cruise company, beat May-quarter expectations. But the company said costs are rising and are expected to exceed previous estimates. Carnival shares slid 7.6% in heavy trading. <strong>Royal Caribbean</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL" target="_blank">RCL</a>) fell 0.7% and <strong>Norwegian Cruise Line</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH" target="_blank">NCLH</a>) 4.5%.</p>
<p>However, the damage appeared to be contained: Airlines and travel booking groups both rose 0.3%.</p>
<p>Within the stock market, the homebuilding industry continues to impress. On Monday, 10 of the group's 23 stocks made new highs. That's far more than any of IBD's 197 industries.</p>
<p>The IBD 50 fell nearly 0.8% Monday. Carnival was the IBD 50's worst performing stock. <strong>Lantheus</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNTH" target="_blank">LNTH</a>), <strong>Symbotic</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYM" target="_blank">SYM</a>) and Tesla also contributed to its decline.</p>

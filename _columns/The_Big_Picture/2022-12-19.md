The stock market indexes struggled out of the gate on Monday, booking a fourth consecutive down day on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. In addition, nearly all benchmarks closed lower than their opening prints for the fifth day in a row, dropping broad-based relative strength readings into oversold levels.




Tech stocks and small caps underperformed once again, dropping the Nasdaq composite 1.5% and the Russell 2000 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up the best, shedding just 0.5%. The S&P 500 lost 0.8%, closing below its 50-day moving average for the second day in a row. Major index ETFs are filling big Nov. 10 rally gaps.


Volume fell sharply from Friday's elevated weekly and monthly option expiration-boosted levels, according to early closing data.


The 10-year Treasury yield surged higher, gaining almost 10 basis points, or nearly 3%, to 3.58%. Crude oil settled higher as well, above $75.50 per barrel, but natural gas got slammed almost 12%.


In crypto-related trading, **Coinbase Global** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) fell almost 4% to another all-time low. Bitcoin looked weaker by the minute, dropping to a three-week low near $16,500.

The fabled Santa Claus rally denotes the period between Christmas and the first two trading days of 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has averaged a 1.38% gain for this period since 1950 while the S&P 500 has averaged 1.32%, according to data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data. Both indexes traded higher around 78% of the time.


There are still no signs that buyers are willing to catch falling knives into year's end, but skepticism may be high enough to ignite a few short squeezes.


A little good news would certainly go a long way at this point.


On the flip side, many investors are carrying big annual losses, raising odds for aggressive tax selling through Dec. 31. However, this bearish influence is harder to predict these days, with so much money sitting in automated portfolio accounts that execute sophisticated tax loss harvesting strategies throughout the year.


Too Late For Value; Too Early For Growth
----------------------------------------


The uptrend remains under pressure after the fourth quarter rally failed to rise above major resistance levels.


The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 are all trading below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is outperforming the broad market, still situated above its 200-day moving average. However, it undercut the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) for the first time since Nov. 9 on Monday, before bouncing into the close.


This megacap strength is masking broad weakness in other capitalization levels, encouraging many folks to feel underinvested. Of course, that's been a prescription for failure since the stock market topped out in 2021.


Thankfully, we're getting closer to saying goodbye to 2022's terrible ticker tape. It's certain that 2023 will look nothing like this year because the stock market adopts a new personality every January. However, it could become just as easy for impulsive traders to follow their emotions into another round of painful losses.



Value stocks outperformed in 2022, with sleepy household names like **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) and **Kellogg** ([K](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=K)) posting double-digit annual returns. But safe havens and other defensive plays have become expensive after this year's run-up, making a repeat performance unlikely.


Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve looks poised to raise rates through most of 2023 and that means more bad news for growth stocks. These fast-moving issues, which form the core of Investor's Business Daily's market strategies, need to hear Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's magic words, "We're done," before they blossom again.


What's Up With The Homebuilders?
--------------------------------


A number of homebuilders have popped up on the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), [IBD Screen Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/) and other proprietary tools that search for emerging market strength. The [Homebuilder Stocks Shine Despite Rising Mortgage Rates](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/inside-the-50-homebuilder-stocks-shine-despite-rising-mortgage-rates/) story on Friday examined this development, as did Monday's **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) [Screen of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/homebuilder-stock-builds-base-in-challenging-interest-rate-climate-offers-entry/) feature.



The Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has lost 21% in 2022 but has come off lows since bottoming out in June. Leading homebuilders show around the same annual deficit as this composite chart.


Amazingly this sector is now a top 10 performer in the [197 IBD industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), mostly due to superior price performance compared to the S&P 500.


This buying interest suggests that housing supply and demand are slowly coming into balance, in both inventories and mortgage rates. Although many folks have been priced out of the market, the unrelenting wave of millennials hitting their nest-building periods is likely to keep a floor under this group for years to come.


Stock Market: Monday Movers
---------------------------


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rallied more than 6% in the premarket after CEO Elon Musk said he would leave Twitter if a poll said he should go. Sellers took back control after the mercurial executive backtracked, saying no one wanted the job. TSLA stock fell to another two-year low before closing virtually unchanged.



Dow Jones component **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) sold off nearly 5% after box office receipts for the Avatar sequel failed to meet first weekend expectations. Many folks who grew up with Disney have been walking away for a variety of reasons, perhaps for good.


Also in the Dow Jones, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) traded within two points of June's bear market low at 129.04. The long-term chart could complete a double-top pattern in that price zone. Here's an unusual statistic: AAPL stock hasn't touched its 50-month exponential moving average — covering a little more than four years' of action — since the end of 2018. Meanwhile, the [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) has dropped to a dismal 34, according to Investors.com.


According to MarketSmith, Apple's three-month RS Rating is even worse at 19 on a scale of 1 to 99.

Distribution Count Rises, But Indexes Cut Losses
=================================================

The market suffered another session of intense institutional selling Wednesday. Or did it?

  

The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both fell 0.4%. Volume climbed on both exchanges, albeit minimally.

  

A decline of at least 0.2% in higher volume is known as [distribution](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), where fund managers in the market are "distributing" shares to the general investing public. They're taking profits and building cash due to concerns about the economic future or the financial system.

  

Right now, as IBD's Market Pulse table shows, the distribution count has risen to nine on both the Nasdaq and the 500.

  

That's the highest level in at least three years at any time the current outlook was at "Uptrend under pressure."

  

Certainly, there have been times when the distribution count was this heavy â€” after the outlook was already downgraded to "Market in correction," the prime time to raise cash.

  

Yet a close look at the major indexes and an analysis of the true market leaders give the impression that not all the heavy hitters in the market are throwing in the towel on stocks.

  

First, the market cut its early losses Wednesday, and the Nasdaq finished well in the upper half of the day's trading range. It was down almost 1% following negative surprises on the ADP private-sector jobs data and the ISM manufacturing survey.

  

Second, the Nasdaq also found support after poking below the key 50-day moving average, which continues to rise.

  

Third, the Nasdaq is concentrated in large- and mega-cap stocks. Nearly a quarter of the Nasdaq's market value is weighted by the seven largest companies, including **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)). (See the top of the Nasdaq chart on page B2.)

  

None of these three are market leaders now. Rather, small caps are winning. The S&P 600 has a respectable 3.4% gain year-to-date; the S&P 500 is up fractionally.

  

The Russell 2000, off less than 0.1% on Wednesday, sits just 1% below its 52-week peak of 1268.

  

Still, it's wise to play the market cautiously. Breakouts remain limited in number. Plus, Wednesday's gainers were a motley crew of defensive names (think gold mining and tobacco) and beaten-down oil and gas plays.

  

The biotechs continue to take a well-deserved rest. IBD's biotechnology group is 8% off its March 20 peak.

Selling was fairly muted in the major stock indexes Tuesday, but small caps got hit hard, with the Russell 2000 down 1.3%. The index is nearing a test of the 50-day moving average, currently around 1469.




The Nasdaq composite lost 0.3%; the Dow Jones industrial average ended with a fractional gain and S&P 500 closed with a fractional loss. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and was flat on the NYSE compared to Monday's levels.


Worry points for the market seem to be contained for now, but negative headlines are always a risk. If you've been having some success playing offense, stick with the strategy but also realize that maintaining exposure while raising some cash isn't bad strategy, either.

It currently shows five distribution days, but it's not a market under heavy distribution by any means. Of the Nasdaq's five distribution days, one was a stalling session. The other four showed losses ranging from 0.3% to 0.6%. For the S&P 500, its only distribution day in the past few weeks was on Oct. 25 when the index lost 0.5%.


Weakness in chipmakers weighed on the Nasdaq. Retail-related groups lagged across the board, with department store operators leading the downside. Financials and airlines also underperformed. Defensive areas of the market like utilities, food and tobacco stocks outperformed.


In economic news, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index hit an [eight-month high](https://www.investors.com/news/ibdtipp-poll-economic-optimism-rises-but-its-mainly-high-earners/) in November, rising 3.3 points to 53.6. The index has been in optimistic territory for the past 14 months. The one thing the market isn't worried about is slack consumer confidence. The consumer has been confident for a while now.


Among the day's movers, **Weight Watchers** ([WTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WTW)) gapped up over a 48.29 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point after reporting its third straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Shares jumped 13.5% to 50.87.


Meanwhile, China-based [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) name **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) reversed higher after reporting earnings early Tuesday. Shares jumped 10% to 64.88. Sales growth decelerated for the third straight quarter, rising 5% to $233.1 million, but did beat views. Adjusted earnings per share of 60 cents, up 58% from the year-ago quarter, also beat views.


The IBD 50 edged down less than 0.1% Tuesday, buoyed by strength in **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) and **National Beverage** ([FIZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIZZ)), which showed gains ranging from 2% to 4%.


In IPO news, China-based search engine **Sogou** (which will trade under the symbol SOGO) was set to price Tuesday night and start trading Wednesday. **Sohu.com** ([SOHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOHU)) is a large shareholder. **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) also owns a stake.


Elsewhere, oil and gas name **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) popped nearly 5% on strong earnings early, but the stock closed with a whimper. Shares rose 0.5% to 28.32. The exploration and production name is still well within buy range from a 27.97 cup-with-handle buy point, although Tuesday's action was disappointing for the bulls.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures for December delivery marked the first decline in four sessions, down 15 cents, or 0.3%, to $57.20 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield edged lower by 1 basis point to 2.30%.


On the downside, **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) plunged nearly 14% after an earnings beat was offset by a weak outlook. The online travel titan had been finding support at the 50-day moving average ahead of the results, but it's a broken stock now, with Monday's gap down below the 200-day line.


After the close, **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) reported solid earnings. After an ugly session that saw shares fall 4.5% in higher volume, shares were up 4% in early after-hours trading.

Stocks Fall, But End Well Off Day's Lows
=========================================

Stocks lost ground Monday, but showed resilience by ending well off the day's worst levels.

  

The Nasdaq slipped just 0.1% after sliding 1.1% in the opening minutes. It briefly touched positive territory. The S&P 500 pared a 0.9% loss to 0.3%.

  

Both of the major indexes closed above their 50-day moving averages, the latter by just a hair. The indexes started slipping below that line last week, although they closed below it just on Thursday.

  

Monday marked the second straight session in which the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed near their session highs. On Thursday, the indexes suffered their biggest losses in nearly two months.

  

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average and small-cap Russell 2000 also ended well off their session lows, down 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The IBD 500 eased 0.1%.

  

Stocks opened with heavy losses on news of unrest in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng slumped nearly 2% to its lowest level since July.

  

Volume climbed on both U.S. major exchanges from Friday's light pace. The Nasdaq's loss was too small to be a distribution day.

  

The S&P 500's loss meant it added a distribution day, but the strong close pointed more to supporting action than heavy institutional selling.

  

The S&P 500 added two distribution days at once because the Sept. 17 stall day has now come into play. Under complex rules for stall days, some stall days cannot be counted until there's a larger number of regular distribution days.

  

Despite the mild losses, Monday's action had some positive for the market.

  

Leading stocks sustained little damage. **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)), **Harman International Industries** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)) and **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) were among the few leaders down in heavy trade in the IBD 50.

  

A few leading stocks posted solid gains. **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) ramped to another new high after unveiling new cameras. (See story on Page A1.) **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), which makes chips for GoPro and other cameras, also hit an all-time high.

  

The market uptrend remains under pressure, so investors should continue to take a cautious stance.

  

Buying leading stocks is still OK, but investors may want to cut losses sooner, say at 5% rather than the normal 7% or 8%. Profits should also be taken before the usual 20%-to-25% range.

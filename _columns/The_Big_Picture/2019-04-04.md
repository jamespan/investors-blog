title: Stock Market Diverges With Sharp Sell-Offs Among Top Software Stocks

Tech stocks came under selling pressure Thursday, even as the Dow Jones industrials sharply diverged to finish the day with solid gains. Leading software stocks — the stock market's biggest winners during the current uptrend — were hammered, with cybersecurity leader **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) plunging as much as 11.5%.




The Dow Jones industrials gained 0.6% — led by **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) — and closed near the highs of the day. The S&P 500 moved up 0.2%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, home to many of the stock market's top technology stocks, edged less than 0.1% lower. Still, the Nasdaq closed well off the day's lows. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Wednesday.


Despite the sharp selling in the software sector, the Nasdaq's modest losses indicate that the selling did not spill over into the rest of the technology sector. Perhaps Thursday was simply a sign of sector rotation, where institutions take hefty profits in software leaders after big gains and place their bets elsewhere. A quick review of top-performing industries Thursday showed a variety of groups, including apparel retail — home to Leaderboard stock **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP040419-250x300.jpg)The IBD 50 declined 0.7%, sharply underperforming the major stock indexes and indicating top growth stocks faced strong selling pressure Thursday.


The Feb. 28 distribution day on the S&P 500 was deleted because 25 sessions have passed since then. The Nasdaq lost two distribution days Wednesday because the composite's gain from both days exceeded 5%.


Zscaler Leads Software Names Lower
----------------------------------


According to the [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) research tool, a slew of software industries were among the worst-performing industry groups in today's stock market. Many leading software names find themselves in the top 10 of the IBD 50, including **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Paycom** **Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)). Zscaler, meanwhile, is one of the IBD [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and was removed from IBD Leaderboard Thursday.


Atlassian, Fortinet and Paycom declined 4.5%, 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively, while Veeva lost 1.4%.


Zscaler plunged as much as 11.5% before paring losses to 8.7% by the close. Volume surged over 250% above average, as institutional selling took hold. Even though the cybersecurity leader's action is attention-getting, switch over to the weekly chart to smooth out some of the daily volatility.


There, Zscaler seems set to test its [10-week moving average,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) priced around 58.50. Many leading stocks successfully find support near that moving average several times during the course of their entire move.



The automakers industry fell 6.9%, led by losses in electric-auto maker **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). Tesla stock crumbled 8.2% after the company's [disappointing vehicle delivery report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-first-quarter-deliveries/). Tesla's action reinforces two key concepts: Cut losses at 7%-8% and don't buy on the way down.


Tesla stock's most recent breakout was in early December, when it surpassed a cup with handle's 366.85 entry. During the stock market's ensuing sell-off, the stock triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule on Dec. 18, around the 341 price level. The stock closed Thursday at 267.78, about 22% below that loss-cutting level.



Top Retailer Offers Some Respite From The Selling
-------------------------------------------------


Despite the strong selling among many of the stock market's leading stocks, top retailer **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) offered a refuge. Bullishly, Lululemon's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is near its highs after reaching a new high on March 28 when it staged a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) above a 158.77 flat-base entry.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock Lululemon regained its breakaway-gap entry price of 169.15 with a 3.1% gain. Lululemon shares closed at 171.37, in the 5% buy zone that tops out at 177.61.


On Monday, the stock market outlook was raised back to confirmed uptrend after spending less than a week at an uptrend under pressure. Thursday's sharp sell-off among top growth stocks should give investors some pause.


While today's action may have been painful for some investors, however, it's because they were in the stock market's best names, which have gone up a tremendous amount since the follow-through day in early January.

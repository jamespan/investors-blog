Leading technology companies in the stock market Monday suffered a St. Patrick's Day hangover as the Nasdaq composite fell 1.8% in lower volume, but below the surface, the damage wasn't too bad.




Weakness was broad-based among top-performing semiconductor stocks, biotechs, oil and gas companies, steel players and networking names, resulting in a change in market outlook, although chart damage to leading growth stocks was minimal.


The change in market outlook to uptrend under pressure doesn't mean it's time to go to 100% cash, but it does mean that a defensive posture is best at this point. Don't be afraid to take partial or full profits in some of your holdings. If conviction in a stock is strong, and it's still comfortably above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/), it's OK to give it more room to work. As always, tread cautiously with new buys. Keep them on a tight leash.


Top decliners in the Nasdaq 100 included chip names **KLA-Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), with losses of nearly 4%. Nvidia hasn't broken down yet as it tests support at the 50-day moving average.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP031918-221x300.png)The S&P 500 gave up support at the 50-day line, falling 1.4%. NYSE volume came in lower than Friday. That's not surprising since volume was more than double its average Friday due to options expiration. Nasdaq volume was also lower.


The Dow Jones industrial average and NYSE composite had been getting resistance at their respective 50-day lines ahead of Monday's sell-off. The Dow fell 1.3% and the NYSE composite lost 1%. The Russell 2000 also dropped 1%.


Breadth was weak Monday, with NYSE decliners trouncing advancers by 11-to-3. Nasdaq breadth wasn't quite as bad, with losers having the edge on winners by an 11-4 margin.


Investors were fearful Monday, but not overly fearful, as evidenced by a put-call volume ratio of 1.06, but that's not an excessively fearful reading that would indicate a bottom could be near. Investor fear has been seen near many market bottoms in the past. Fear was also on display in the Cboe Volatility Index: It surged 20%.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) dominated the headlines as shares plunged nearly 7% to 172.54. The stock is testing longer-term support at the 200-day moving average near 172.50. Shares were weak after reports over the weekend surfaced that Cambridge Analytica, a data mining and analysis firm used by President's Trump's 2016 campaign, collected data on millions of Facebook users without their knowledge.

No doubt it was an ugly session, even though sell signals among leading growth stocks were few and far between. Outside of Facebook, which has been lagging the market for some time now, other FAANG stocks took hits, but damage was minimal. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) eased 1.5% but held above the 50-day moving average. It's reportedly working on [next-generation MicroLED screens](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-display-development-news-hits-universal-display-shares/) for future iPhones as well as the Apple Watch.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) lost 1.6%, but it's still well above its 50-day line. Same with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which fell 1.7%.


IBD's computer networking group took a hit, falling around 4%, hurt by weakness in shares of **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)). Arista slumped nearly 6%, hurt by a Deutsche Bank downgrade to sell from hold. Arista is also testing support at the 50-day line.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) fell 1.3% Monday, weighed down by weakness in **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), **Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)), but all four names closed above their respective 50-day lines. Shares of HealthEquity rose in Monday's after-hours session on [better-than-expected earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/top-stock-healthequity-aims-to-maintain-momentum-with-earnings-due/).


The two-day Federal Reserve meeting gets underway Tuesday and a decision on interest rates will be out Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. It's Jerome Powell's first meeting as the new chairman of the Fed. The market is widely expecting the Federal Open Market Committee to raise the federal funds rate to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%.

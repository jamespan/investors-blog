U.S. stock indexes reverted to their indefinite trend on Friday, as small losses followed Thursday's big gains.


The Nasdaq fell 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.3%. But one positive sign for the market is the action on the Russell 2000 chart. A trend line drawn from the highs since March shows the Russell has broken above the trend line.

The Nasdaq looks like a somewhat irregular flat base, staying near highs but finding resistance. But the S&P 500 has slouched under its 50-day line and can't seem to solve it.


Bulls were hoping that Thursday's shift to a higher gear would be a prelude to more gains. Instead, the higher gear proved to be the wrong gear, with small losses Friday acting like clutch chatter that called for an immediate downshift.


Weak follow-up has been the pattern after a big, daily percentage gain this year.


News broke that President Trump would soon push a tax-cut package with the tax cuts the biggest of "any tax cut ever." Trump said he would have a big announcement Wednesday on tax cuts, but the White House immediately suggested it would not be ready Wednesday.


The inability to get much done on either repealing or replacing ObamaCare, tax cuts for individuals and companies, and an infrastructure program has hurt the parts of the stock market that would benefit from such steps.


Leaders moving up in volume were scarce Friday and also scarce for the whole week.


When the A team isn't getting the job done, it's sometimes useful to look for up and comers on the B team, meaning those that are good but lack superior fundamentals.


In the past week, four stocks with less than ideal fundamentals improved their ratings. (All ratings listed below are preliminary.)


Medical robotics company **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) scored a 6% weekly gain, its biggest percentage pop in 18 months. The stock began the week with a Relative Price Strength Rating of 78 and bumped it up to 84. That's still not a great rating.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) popped 5% for the week, broke out and raised its Composite Rating from 80 to 84.


**Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) rose 5% for the week as it broke out of a base and hit a new high. The paint supplier started the week with an 82 Composite Rating and raised it to 90.


**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) gained almost 3% for the week but lost courage when it tried to hold a new high Friday. Visa earned a spot in the Big Cap 20 recently. The past three quarters Visa's earnings rose 26%, 25% and 26% — the best three-quarter package in at least five years.


Visa broke out Feb. 3 and then found support in its first trip to the 50-day line.


**Coming up**: Economic news will be plentiful in the coming week. Gauges will include those measuring manufacturing, housing, consumer confidence and durable goods. Friday will highlight the week with the first reading on Q1 GDP.


The coming week also will be loaded with blue chips reporting. Dow components reporting include **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) on Tuesday; **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) on Wednesday; **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) on Thursday; and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) on Friday.

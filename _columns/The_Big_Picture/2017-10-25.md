  Indexes Cut Losses, But Distribution Grows; This Fear Indicator Does A Mini-Spike

For those who had complained that investors are being overly complacent, such feelings likely took a back seat on Wednesday.




Major indexes dropped broadly, fear among options investors jumped sharply, and leading stocks (especially those from China) took it hard on the chin. And on top of that, the market got saddled with another day of intense professional selling, known in IBD coverage as [distribution](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/).


The Nasdaq composite looked like it would return to the 6500 level as the tech-heavy index fell as much as 1.2% during the first three hours of the 6-1/2-hour trading session on Wall Street. But in the afternoon, the leading market index of 2017 bounced off its intraday low of 6517 to end at 6564, down a little bit more than 0.5%.


The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both fell nearly 0.5%. The Nasdaq 100 was off less than 0.4%.

Volume jumped more than 20% on the Nasdaq and 13% on the NYSE. What's more, sellers slapped the Nasdaq with its fifth distribution day, including four in the past six sessions.


Nasdaq turnover rushed sharply above average and was the heaviest since Sept. 15, a day of intense trading due to "quadruple witching."


A clustering of distribution days is a hint that fund managers sought to nail down profits and raise cash, even though we are still in the thick of third-quarter results. A heavy distribution-day count can often mean the end of a bull market.


However, are stocks truly ready for a severe correction?


Leading stocks always act as an excellent barometer in addition to the actual price-and-volume action of the key indexes. For sure, top names such as those in the IBD 50 took a heavier beating. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fund dropped 1.8% to 33.04, much heavier than any of the declines by important indexes. The ETF is still up more than 36% for the year.


Looking at the recent distribution days for the Nasdaq, the average size of the decline is modest at less than 0.4%. This includes the stalling session on Oct. 18, in which the Nasdaq rose fractionally.


Nonetheless, investor fear appeared to rise amid a growing spat taking place in the public arena between key members of the GOP establishment and President Trump. This only increases the concern among investors that meaningful reform on taxes and deregulation will be further delayed.


The CBOE Market Volatility Index closed at 11.52, a nearly seven-week high. At one point, the VIX hit a high of 13.20. A rising VIX is actually good for equities because it indicates a healthy growth in fear. When people are fearful, they're usually heavily in cash. Such cash could later end up going back into the market.

The S&P 500 now has two distribution days; the first one came on Sept. 25.


The Dow transports fell 1.6% amid some heavy selling among airlines including **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)), down 13% after posting modest earnings-per-share growth in the third quarter. Alaska also triggered a follow-on short-sale entry.


A few industry groups paced the upside and mainly came from defensive or lagging areas of the market. They included office-supply, drugstore-chain and toy stocks.

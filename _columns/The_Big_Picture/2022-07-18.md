  Stock Market Reverses Lower After Key Test; Apple News Fuels More Worries About The Economy

Early gains faded for the stock market Monday, hurt in part by news that **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) plans to slow hiring and spending in some divisions next year. That fueled more concerns about a slowdown for the U.S. economy.




Investors sold bonds again in the stock market, sending the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 3 basis points to 2.96%. After a strong move above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) on July 8, the 10-year yield marked its sixth straight close below the 50-day line Monday.


A strong earnings report from **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) helped spark an early 1.1% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but the blue-chip index closed near its session low, down 0.7%, after rallying close to its 50-day line.


Goldman Sachs gapped above its 50-day line and the 300 level, but sellers knocked GS stock to session lows as well.


Stock Market Today
------------------



**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) also ceded a strong gain in the stock market today. Buyers pushed BA stock higher in early trading after **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) announced plans to buy 100 of Boeing's largest 737 Max planes. Boeing soared above the 150 level and rose 5.5% intraday, but shares ended fractionally lower.

Monday's weak session was another reminder that sellers are still around. Even when stock indexes were near session highs, the stock market wasn't serving up much in the way of buy candidates.


Sitting in a healthy cash position with limited exposure to individual stocks makes the most sense at this point. When institutional money starts coming in from the sidelines again, that's when you'll see better candidates. Until then, tread cautiously.


The Nasdaq composite gapped above its 50-day moving average but stopped short of retaking its July 8 intraday high of 11,689. It closed with a loss of 0.8%. Volume rose from Friday, giving the index a second [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


But growth investors looking for actionable charts were once again left disappointed as many of the Nasdaq 100's biggest percentage gainers were stocks far off their recent highs. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rallied for the fourth straight session and rose 2%, but the chip bellwether got turned away at its 50-day line.


Despite the Nasdaq's weakness, declining stocks only had a slight edge over advancers.


S&P 500 Today
-------------


The S&P 500 fell 0.8% as cruise line operators, solar stocks, and oil and gas stocks outperformed. The silver lining? Winners had a slight edge over losers on the NYSE.


WTI crude oil futures settled at $102.60, up 5.1%.


Oil drillers outperformed, including **Patterson-UTI Energy** ([PTEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTEN)), which found support at its 200-day moving average, rising 8%. **Helmerich & Payne** ([HP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HP)) jumped 7.5% after coming close to a test of its 200-day line last week.

The S&P 500 avoided a distribution because preliminary data showed lower volume on the NYSE.


**Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) was one of the top gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), but the solar stock is prone to volatile price swings. After shaving an 11% intraday loss Friday to 1%, ENPH rallied nearly 6% Monday.


But Monday's session also highlighted the risk in buying technical breakouts.



After soaring past a 50.10 entry last month, **Legend Biotech** ([LEGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEGN)) lost ground for the eighth time in nine sessions. LEGN slumped more than 6% and closed below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).

**Verra Mobility** ([VRRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRRM)) topped a 16.83 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/), but the stock pared gains by the close and ended below the entry. [VRRM is the IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/vrrm-stock-pops-verra-mobility-growth-strategy-spotlight-investor-day/).


Meanwhile, after a low-volume rally Friday, emerging stock market leader **Acadia Healthcare** ([ACHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACHC)) topped a conventional entry of 76.79, but shares reversed lower.


A couple of staffing firms in the health care space also scored big gains in the MarketSmith Growth 250. **Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)) is quickly forming the right side of [deep cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/). Shares jumped 6.5%, but after nine straight weekly gains it's best to wait for a potential pullback before buying.


**AMN Healthcare Services** ([AMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMN)) added 3%. It's near the top of the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) after a volatile breakout last week over a 115.85 [handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/).



Among China stocks, **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) jumped 1.9% to 39.16. Volume grew to 17.4 million shares, 38% above the stock's 50-day moving average. Headed into Monday, the Chinese EV maker had been trading tightly after soaring 23% during the week ended June 24.

Monday was a setup day as stock market investors prepared for two days of market-moving headlines. And more potential shakers are coming later in the week.




At least on Monday, investors acted like they didn't have immediate worries as indexes saw their best day of December so far.


The Nasdaq composite rose 1.3%, the S&P 500 added 1.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.6%. The Russell 2000 rose 1.2% and found support at the 50-day moving average.


Indexes are in an indecisive phase, trading above support levels but also testing resistance. The Nasdaq remains above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) and the 11,000 level. But the S&P 500 met resistance at the 200-day moving average and has yet to regain the 4,000 level.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, a positive sign. NYSE volume appeared to be slightly lower, according to preliminary data.


Leading growth stocks outperformed. The IBD 50 jumped 2.5%, its best day since Nov. 21.


**Box** ([BOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOX)), the document-sharing company, rallied after JPMorgan upgraded the IBD 50 stock to overweight from neutral. The stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and closed in the 29.57 to 31.05 buy range.


Analyst Pinjalim Bora [raised the price target to 34 from 31 and said Box is excelling](https://www.barrons.com/articles/box-stock-upgrade-51670871046?mod=md_stockoverview_news) with a single document platform that offers data security, compliance and governance. That's helping the cloud computing company overcome competitive threats.


However, breakouts continue to generate mixed results. Relatively few stocks are more than 5% above their most recent buy points, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) tabulations.


Recent example **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) is already below the 123.46 entry of last week's breakout. When a breakout from a good base can't get traction, it tells growth investors the stock market remains treacherous.


Health Care Helps IBD 50
------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP121222-248x300.jpg)Health care stocks powered the IBD 50 on Monday.


**Catalyst Pharmaceuticals** ([CPRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRX)) climbed back above the 16.76 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) vaulted 4%, quickly forming the right side of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


Biotechs outperformed as well.


The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF ([XBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XBI)) rose 2.6%, edging above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. A major industry deal appeared to spark interest, with **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) [agreeing to acquire](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hznp-stock-rockets-as-amgen-agrees-to-buy-horizon-therapeutics/)Â **Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) for roughly $28 billion.


Inflation Data Next For Stock Market
------------------------------------


The November consumer price index is due out ahead of Tuesday's opening bell. Economists expect a dip from October's 0.4% pace, slowing to 0.3% and on a yearly basis 7.3%, down from 7.7%.


Even if the CPI comes in cooler, it may not satisfy the Fed.


As [IBD reported today](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fade-the-cpi-this-new-fed-inflation-chart-is-key-for-sp-500/), Chair Jerome Powell has called the personal consumption expenditures index the most important inflation gauge. That index gives greater weight to the prices of services rather than goods. Services have been showing greater upward price pressure than goods through most of 2022..



The bond market is gearing up for a possible bad surprise on inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 4 basis points to 3.61%. It is up more than 20 basis points in the last three sessions.


Nationwide chief of investment research Mark Hackett says that while Tuesday's CPI reading is unlikely to materially shift the Fed's tone, "investors would do well to buckle up and be patient. The market reaction to recent meetings has been negative, as Chair Powell has leaned hawkish in comments during his press conference."


Keep in mind, Hackett adds, that negative market reactions tend to be temporary while positive reactions typically are more enduring.


Stock Market This Week
----------------------


On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on monetary policy. While most traders expect a half-point rate increase, the outlook for the Fed's next steps could be more important. The Fed is [struggling to find consensus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation-11670859520?mod=hp_lead_pos5).


November retail sales, weekly jobless claims and industrial production reports come out on Thursday. Friday's premarket composite purchasing managers' index will look at broad economic activity.


After Monday's close, there was some good news for the tech sector: **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) reported earnings that [beat analysts' estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oracle-stock-climbs-on-quarterly-earnings-beat-oracle/). The stock rose nearly 3% in extended trading.

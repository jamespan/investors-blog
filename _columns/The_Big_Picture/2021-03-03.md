Stock Market Rally Teeters Amid Growth Sell-Off; Polaris Forms Base-On-Base Pattern
====================================================================================

The stock market didn't look too bad Wednesday if your focus was on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But if your attention was squarely focused on the Nasdaq, the stock market looked downright awful as leading growth stocks sold off again.




Oil and gas stocks outperformed again, along with steel, financial and airline stocks. April crude oil futures settled at $61.28 a barrel, up 2.6% ahead of a key [OPEC meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-rise-ahead-opec-meeting-russia-saudi-arabia-roll-over-cuts/) Thursday.


Software stocks suffered sharp losses. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) slumped 4%, with **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) a notable component. Zoom Video reversed sharply lower Tuesday on earnings, and the former leader crashed below its 200-day moving average Wednesday, falling another 8%.


The 10-year Treasury yield spiked higher again, rising 9 basis points to 1.48%. While rising interest rates have fueled outperformance for financial stocks, they've also spooked the stock market. The 10-year yield was around 1% in late January.


The Federal Reserve has made it clear it's not worried about inflation, but the bond market is taking the other side. Rising interest rates are the bond market's way of saying it's concerned about a stronger-than-expected economic recovery that could spark inflation.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite fell 2.7% and breached the 13,000 level. The weakness comes after the index got turned away at its 21-day exponential moving average earlier in the week.

The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) lost 2.9% and fell below last week's lows, which brings a test of the 300 level into play. QQQ is still comfortably above its 200-day moving average near 284.


Don't get too down on the market, though, because the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small-cap index are still holding above their 50-day lines. The S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Russell 2000 lost 1.1% and the Dow Jones eased 0.4%.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose from Tuesday, giving the S&P 500 and Nasdaq another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/).


For now, IBD's market outlook is staying where it is, at "uptrend under pressure." But a decisive break of the 50-day line for the S&P 500 and an undercut of Friday's low could be enough to move the market outlook to a correction.

The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is elevated. What's more of a concern is the dismal price action in leading growth stocks.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) removed four more names Wednesday. Profits were taken in three stocks, and **ZoomInfo** ([ZI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZI)) flashed a sell signal by erasing a double-digit gain from an early entry of 50.31. But the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ([SQQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQQQ)) hedge is working nicely.


Several other leading growth stocks have flashed sell signals with sharp breaks of their 10-week moving averages. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped 3.5% as it tests support at the 10-week line. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) components **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)), **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), **Logitech** ([LOGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGI)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), among others, have broken below support levels.


The Great Rotation
------------------


With the stock market uptrend under pressure, it's best to keep exposure light. Taking profits in growth stocks makes sense as money rotates into other areas of the market like financial, oil and gas, infrastructure, mining, cyclical and agriculture stocks.


**Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) jumped 12% to 30.83. An initial breakout over a 26.30 buy point stumbled, but shares are up 25.5% so far this week. Leadership is broad-based in the mining sector. **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) is holding gains nicely after a breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). The buy point was 87.


**Granite Construction** ([GVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GVA)) continues to perform well after a breakout over a 35.22 entry, while auto retailers **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) and **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) are trading tightly near highs after January breakouts.


Movers And Shakers
------------------


Two stocks bucked the trend Wednesday with chart breakouts.


In the plastics group, **Avient** ([AVNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVNT)) closed near highs after a breakout from an eight-week consolidation.



In the steel producers group, **Ternium** ([TX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TX)) followed through after topping a 34.09 buy point Tuesday. The stock closed off highs but still rose 6% to 36.58. Group peer **ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)) is a breakout candidate as it forms a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


ATV maker **Polaris** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) is forming a classic [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/) structure with a 129.10 buy point.


Meanwhile, **Flagstar Bancorp** ([FBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBC)) broke out over a [trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) Wednesday as it forms a flat base with a 48.02 entry. Shares closed at 45.95, up 3%.

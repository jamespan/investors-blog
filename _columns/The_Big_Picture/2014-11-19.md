Nasdaq, Small Caps Absorb Most Of Day's Selling Heat
=====================================================

Small caps took a body blow. Big-cap techs got peppered with some jabs of selling. Yet Wednesday's session showed light selling overall.


A day of rest was warranted for the market. The Nasdaq, which has climbed as much as 14.4% from its mid-October low of 4116, gave back nearly 0.6% on Wednesday in slightly lighter volume vs. the prior session. The IBD 50 lost 0.4%.


Light pullbacks are key to keeping investor exuberance from getting out of hand.


The release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's Oct. 28-29 meeting drew contrasting interpretations within the financial press. Some highlighted Fed governors' concern over long-term price stability; others noted the central bank's acknowledgment of a strengthening economy. Ultimately, the minutes seemed to have little sway over the day's results.


Trading has been outright dull for weeks. You'd have to go back to Nov. 5, when the Nasdaq sank less than 3 points, to find a day in which the leading market index declined in higher volume.


The S&P 500 sank less than 0.2% in higher NYSE turnover. The drop was too small to treat as an authentic distribution day.


The 500's decline masked strength in the retail, apparel and consumer areas of the market. (See the day's top-performing industry groups in blue in the Industry Groups table on Page B2.)


A smaller-than-expected 4% decline in fiscal third-quarter earnings at discount chain **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) may have helped spur buying. Target grew sales 3%, the biggest increase in seven quarters.


The small-cap S&P 600, however, dropped 1%. That's the third heavy decline in five sessions. The S&P 600 has shown choppy trading. Since the close on March 3, the index has virtually no gains to show. Yet it's also made extended moves of more than 5% either up or down at least six times over the March-to-October span.


The Nasdaq's sizable advance since its Oct. 15 low and powerful follow-through four sessions later may not have cast a warm and toasty glow on all individual investors' portfolios. The size of one's gains depends on the individual holdings, especially when the positions are concentrated.


Stocks that have made numerous bases are having a tougher time ramping up. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), which got its mojo back with a breakout at 29.17 in July 2013, has flattened out. **Vipshop** ([VIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIP)), one of the fastest growing e-commerce firms in China, is down 8% this week despite reporting a 167% jump in Q3 profit.

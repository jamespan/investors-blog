The stock market rally continued Friday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq led the major stock indexes higher with a 1.6% advance.




The S&P 500 rallied 1.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average followed up with a 1.1% rise. Leading growth stocks underperformed the Nasdaq and S&P 500: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) gained 1.2%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq from Thursday's session. Preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 traded more in line with the Nasdaq, rising 1.6%.


Stock Market Uptrend Continues
------------------------------


After [Thursday's sharp downside reversal](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-rally-failed-coronavirus-drug-trial-apple-stock-new-buy-point/) in heavy volume, more declines Friday would have been expected. But after a volatile open, the indexes strengthened throughout the day, ending with strong gains. Friday's rebound demonstrates the stock market's resilience. Meanwhile, the [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remains at a bullish zero. But the S&P 500 continues to battle with its 50-day moving average, a key resistance level, and hasn't decisively cleared that level yet.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP042419-250x300.jpg)The Nasdaq led the stock market rally Friday with strong gains from semiconductor and biotech stocks. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index reversed from early losses driven by **Intel**'s ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) cautious outlook to rise 2.3%. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) was up 2.1% and held above a still-declining 50-day line.


Meanwhile, top stocks continue to break out past new buy points. In the IBD 50, **Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)) broke out past a 70.29 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an odd-looking [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in heavy volume and is in the 5% buy range. The company will [manufacture a coronavirus vaccine](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-deal-jnj-sends-emergent-stock-flying/) in the U.S. being developed by **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) if it gains approval.


On the downside, **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) reversed from big gains to end the session down 6.1%. Shares tumbled from their highs after **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) announced a number of new video calling features, including free video calling for up to 50 people.

2 New Cup With Handles: Adobe, Tesla
------------------------------------



Two top stocks added handles to their cup bases this week: **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) Adobe is about 3% away from a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/adobe-stock-gets-handle-coronavirus-market-recovery/) 350.48 buy point, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Tesla is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watchlist stock. After a sharp gain since March 18, the electric-auto maker is finally taking a breather to add a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) to its deep cup base. The new buy point is 775.05.


According to IBD Leaderboard commentary, "The extremely deep correction within the current base poses as a key risk. In most cases, a cup with handle shows a decline of no more than 33% to 35%. In Tesla's case, however, the stock had an unusually big run after breaking out at 361.30."


Meanwhile, the coming week includes many [earnings reports from major companies](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/apple-stock-near-buy-point-as-earnings-report-approaches/) including **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Both tech giants report Thursday after the close.

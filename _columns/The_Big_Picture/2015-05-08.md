Stocks rallied in lighter volume Friday, with the major indexes retaking their 50-day moving averages.


The S&P 500 drove 1.3% higher while the Nasdaq tailgated at 1.2%. The IBD 50 lagged with a 0.4% gain.


Volume eased across the board.


The 50-day moving average has been a battleground area since late March.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 popped above the line Friday after losing and regaining the line a handful of times in recent weeks.


So far, the indexes haven't been able to decisively resolve the issue.


With IBD's market outlook spending most of the past six weeks under pressure and now in a correction, investors should accept the negativity and wait for a follow-through day to signal a new uptrend is underway.


Friday's price gains might tempt the bulls, but gains don't mean much without rising volume. It's like the difference between rowdy cheers and polite applause.


In the past 11 sessions, the Nasdaq has had only one day with a price gain in rising volume.


Meanwhile, five of the past seven down sessions have come in rising volume.


Perhaps more disturbing are the big losses among leaders on earnings disappointments or sometimes no news. This continued Friday for two more leaders.


**Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) missed on earnings and sales late Thursday, and in a flash turned a nice-looking flat base into a knife attack Friday. The stock stabbed 10% lower in heavy volume.


**Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) gapped up 16% Tuesday in heavy volume on strong quarterly results, then dropped 2%, 6% and 3% the next three days in heavy volume. The net result was a rowdy 16% spurt turned into a polite 3% gain.


When will this frustrating market action end?


The put-call volume ratio has been a reliable identifier of short-term bottoms over the past year or so when it reaches elevated levels. But that ratio hasn't reached 1.0 or higher since March 31. This would imply the market may have more pain ahead before it hits a short-term bottom.


The tone of the market must change if growth investors are to find credible buy opportunities.


Doubts about the stock market were piling up for weeks before Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen added to the pile Wednesday.


Yellen said stock market valuations were "quite high" and that this raises "potential dangers."


The problem with the valuation game — as IBD founder William O'Neil points out in "How to Make Money in Stocks" — is that "you always have the question" of how bad or good things can get "before everything finally turns."


Still, if the Fed is true to its usual marksmanship, Yellen's comments might be a contrarian indicator.


In July, Yellen's "stretched" valuation comments on biotech and media stocks proved ridiculously wrong, and even Alan Greenspan's famous "irrational exuberance" comment was off the mark by about three years.


Whatever skills Federal Reserve heads have, analyzing the stock market isn't one of them.


Fortunately, there is a better alternative: the market itself. The market is constantly giving feedback, and those clues are more useful than individual opinions.

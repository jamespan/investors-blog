  Nasdaq Leads Upside In Mixed Day, But This Sector's Leaders Slide

Pick one word to describe the latest rally by the Nasdaq composite since the [Aug. 29 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-powers-higher-on-jolts-data-unlocks-this-key-shift-apple-stock/). Would it be languid? Lackadaisical? Or simply light?




Seasoned IBD readers would likely be able to find plenty of other words in the English lexicon to paint what is going on in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?). Yet overall, both bulls and bears could drum up multiple arguments to support their position.


So for now, a cautious approach to taking on new positions, but keeping a crisp and fresh watchlist, may ultimately pay off later in the year.


Nasdaq Vs. World Of Stocks
--------------------------


A mixed report on U.S. consumer prices seemed to encourage mixed action by not just the Nasdaq but other principal market averages.


The Nasdaq, up nearly 0.7% at around midday, settled for a 0.3% gain at the close. That measly advance recouped less than a third of Tuesday's 1.1% decline. At 13,813, the composite index is up almost 32% for the year. Yet it also closed beneath its flattening 50-day moving average for the fourth time in five sessions.


Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), tracking the Nasdaq 100, finished 0.4% higher and held above its 50-day line.



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP091323-193x300.jpg)The S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher. That's obviously better than losses of 0.2% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 0.6% by the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund, and 0.8% by the Russell 2000.


Banking, airline, oil and gas, building and metals-related stocks paced the downside. They accounted mainly for the laggard performance on Wednesday by the above-mentioned indexes vs. the Nasdaq.


However, a daily chart of Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) reveals a lack of true outperformance vs. a broad-based barometer such as the 500. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/), painted in blue on all IBD charts, has been going sideways since mid-July.


Ultimately, the monthly charts of the key indexes may offer the clearest view.


Market pundits and media love to remind investors that September can be a cruel month for returns. Yet as the accompanying chart shows, so far it's been a pretty light decline with 12 trading days left in the month. In August, QQQ fell as much as 8.3%. The volatility surrounding earnings season likely had a role to play. But the popular ETF for tech investors also boosted off its lows for the month and closed July out with a much smaller decline of 2.2%.


Not The Nasdaq In September 2022 â€” Yet
--------------------------------------


Rewind the clock back to August and September of 2022. The Federal Reserve was actively staging one of the sharpest series of rate hikes in nearly a century. The Nasdaq swooned 5.2% and nose-dived 10.6% during those two months.


But today? Pretty quiet. The Nasdaq 100, just like QQQ, so far is sculpting an "inside month" of action.



That is, the high and low prices for September, so far, stand inside their respective points from August.


The earnings news mill, meanwhile, has virtually ground to a halt. It won't pick up action for at least a month.


Going back to Wednesday's [highly touted inflation news](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-picked-up-in-august-but-sp-500-futures-hang-tough/), Wall Street observers generally commented that the data would not lead to a hike in interest rates at the Fed's Sept. 19-20 meeting. But one might expect a more hawkish tone at the post-meeting news conference.

Janus Henderson's Bond View
---------------------------


"We continue to expect some reduction in the number of participants projecting further hikes, but probably not enough to move the median projection of one more rate hike," Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed income at Janus Henderson Investors, wrote in a comment emailed to IBD. "That said, we believe that we have likely seen the last rate hike for this cycle, as the economic data that the Fed will see over the coming months will keep them on hold and allow the impact of 5.25% of prior hikes to slow the economy and inflation."


The yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond ramped up to 4.34% before turning tail. It closed at 4.24%, down 1 basis point, according to Cboe data. Crude oil futures also swung from early gains to close the session practically at break-even, at $88.85 a barrel.


The probability for a quarter-point hike in the fed funds rate next week to a 5.5%-5.75% target range has down-spiraled to 3%, according to CME FedWatch data. But those chances jumped to 41.6% for the following meeting that concludes Nov. 1.


Some sectors within the stock market, however, reaffirmed IBD's cautious stance in its current outlook for stocks.

Character Change?
-----------------


As seen in the above Market Pulse table, a small handful of industrial products giants outside the Nasdaq realm fell hard.



**Flowserve** ([FLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLS)), which has occasionally gotten a mention on the daily [IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/), dropped 4.7% in volume that jumped 143% above its 50-day average. At 38.46, the expert in engineered pumps, valves and mechanical seals ended 3 pennies below its steadily rising 50-day moving average.


A steep drop through the 50-day line would indicate sellers are more anxious to take profits and raise cash in the stock.


Industry peer **Ingersoll Rand** ([IR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IR)) fell 3.8% to 65.73 and clipped its 50-day line in heavy turnover. It marked the biggest single-day point decline since the stock barged through resistance at 60, a psychologically important price level. Further losses would force newer shareholders to consider selling shares to protect recent short-term gains.


Industrial Select Sector SPDR ([XLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLI)) forged its sixth decline in seven sessions. The ETF, down almost 0.7%, sank below recent support near 105. XLI may be building a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/base-on-base-chart-pattern-turns-a-disappointment-into-a-success/). That could be constructive. But it has also wiped away all the mild gains from a breakout at 104.18 on June 13.

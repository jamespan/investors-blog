Stocks Fall Modestly, And What The IBD 50 Is Saying About The Market
=====================================================================

The stock market started September with losses, but there was some underlying strength as indexes climbed off session lows and leading stocks outperformed.




Indexes trimmed losses and closed near session highs. That was a sign that buyers were pushed out of the way only temporarily. The Nasdaq was down as much as 0.8% but closed only 0.2% lower.


The session's graph had a "W" look to it as a morning rebound faded, then indexes bounced back in the afternoon. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average only a fraction.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which gave the composite a new [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). Losses in higher volume are indications that institutional investors are selling heavily. Yet, true distribution days don't look like Tuesday's session.

So it didn't take much to get higher volume Tuesday. NYSE volume was higher Tuesday. Volume climbed Friday ahead of the long holiday weekend, but remained below average.


Small caps lagged some, with the Russell 2000 off 0.4%. The index is still in a moderate uptrend that began when it made a new high on Aug. 21.


Leading stocks have been particularly impressive, and they're another reason to believe institutions aren't unloading shares excessively. [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is up 24.6% this year and widening its lead over major indexes.


The index of top-rated stocks is on a two-week rally, with earnings reports igniting a number of leaders into strong gains since August. They've helped the IBD 50 increase its outperformance against the Nasdaq since about Aug. 20. From that date, the IBD 50 is up more than 7% and the Nasdaq about 4%.


On Tuesday, the IBD 50 added 0.5%. The [Innovator IBD 50 ETF](http://innovatoretfs.com/etf/?ticker=ffty) ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which uses a weighted portfolio, rose nearly 0.6%.


A handful of leaders from various sectors have carried the IBD 50 through its August burst.



In software, **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) are running ahead as if they were on high-octane fuel. In retail, [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) stalled for about two months after its June 7 earnings surge and started a new leg higher early in August.


In construction, **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) surged July 31 on strong earnings and keeps extending gains. In insurance, **Health Insurance Innovations** ([HIIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIIQ)) started a 59% surge with its Aug. 1 earnings report.


Amazon.com Makes History
------------------------


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rose 1.3% to 2,039.51 and in a brief moment during the day, it [reached $1 trillion in market capitalization](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-1-trillion/). It became the second stock in history to top the $1 trillion plateau after **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) did it about a month ago.


With the largest online retailer making history, the retail sector again was strong Tuesday. Specialty, department store, auto parts, internet and discount retail chains all finished in the top seven of IBD's [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). Financials also led, with banks turning in a good performance.


The energy sector was mixed. Oilfield services, exploration & production groups were lower. Refining and pipeline stocks rallied.


[Oil prices reversed lower Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-tropical-storm-libya-transocean-acquisition/). Prices initially rose as Tropical Storm Gordon headed toward the Gulf Coast. Also, Libya disruptions sparked supply concerns. But oil prices faded.


In another headline for the energy sector, **Transocean** ([RIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIG)) said it will buy **Ocean Rig** ([ORIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORIG)) for $2.7 billion, including debt.

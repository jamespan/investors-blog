The Market Outlook Has Changed: Here's Why
===========================================

The month of January was a solid one for the major stock indexes, but February got off to a rocky start as the Nasdaq composite ended near its session low after early strength, falling more than 0.3%.




 It wasn't an outright bearish session by any means, but recent weakness in several leading Chinese stocks, three shaky sessions to start off the week and the Nasdaq struggling for support at the 10-day moving average, resulted in a change in [IBD's market outlook](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/tracking-trends/) to "uptrend under pressure."


The Nasdaq eased 0.3%. The S&P 500 gave back less than 0.1% but marked its third straight close below the 10-day moving average. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Modest gains for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on Wednesday, but closes near lows in higher volume, had the look of stalling but didn't quite fit the parameters to count as [distribution](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). But the session came after two straight distribution days Monday and Tuesday. Clearly, the risk level is elevated as many leading growth stocks come under pressure.

For individual investors, it means that playing defense with a portfolio is better than offense at this point. Taking some profits and being more selective with stock buys will help investors get through a rough patch.


The bulls would like to see higher-volume gains from here and lower-volume declines. That would mean the market uptrend might still have staying power. Keep in mind that as of Thursday's close, the Nasdaq still needs to pull back 4.4% just to get to the 50-day moving average, a key support level for the index for some time now.


Meanwhile, investors sold bonds again Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 7 basis points to 2.78%. Some viewed Thursday's Fed statement as slightly more hawkish, with the prospects for rising inflation a key talking point. The Federal Open Market Committee's next meeting is in March and will be Jerome Powell's first as Fed chairman. According to [CME Group FedWatch](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/), futures traders thinks there's an 83% chance the Fed will hike rates by a quarter point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.


The January jobs report is due Friday at 5:30 a.m. ET. Nonfarm payrolls are seen rising 175,000 with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.1%. The ADP employment report on Wednesday showed private payrolls up an impressive 234,000, nicely above the consensus estimate of 195,000.


Earnings flow from top-rated growth stocks was fast and furious Thursday.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) jumped 3% to 193.09, overcoming pronounced weakness in Wednesday's after-hours session. Investors were jittery on news that changes to the social network's core News Feed product were hurting the amount of time people are spending on the site. Wall Street found solace in the fact that advertisers are paying more per user. Facebook is making some progress after a hesitant breakout over a 184.35 flat-base entry.


Elsewhere, sellers were in shares of **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) despite another quarter of robust earnings and sales growth for both.


Shares of PayPal slumped 8% to 78.40, hurt by news that former parent **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) will end its relationship with PayPal in 2020 in favor of Amsterdam-based Adyen, another digital payments provider. Despite Thursday's weakness, PayPal's chart did not trigger sell signals. It closed just above the 50-day line, but below a 79.48 buy point.


Alibaba lost nearly 6% to 192.22, but similar to PayPal, it hasn't completely fallen apart. In fact, it's just testing a prior buy point of 191.85. China stocks were weak overall as names like **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) and **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) ended with losses of 3% to 4%.


Breakouts were scarce, but IBD 50 name **Meritor** ([MTOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTOR)) rallied again after surging 13% Wednesday on earnings. Shares rose another 8% to 29.53. It's still in buy range from a 28.06 buy point of a shallow cup-shaped base.


**Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) also turned in a solid showing. Strong earnings fueled a breakaway gap over a 121.124 buy point of a shallow cup-shaped base. In this case, the open price of 123.95 was a legitimate entry.


In other news, the price of Bitcoin fell apart again, down 10% to 9,171 after hitting a low of 8,564, after [India said it does not recognize cryptocurrency](https://www.investors.com/news/bitcoin-tumbles-below-9000-as-india-snubs-cryptocurrencies/) as a legal form of payment.


After a recent break of the 50-day moving average, Bitcoin Investment Trust ([GBTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBTC)) is now nearing a test of longer-term support at the 200-day line. Shares lost 16% to 13.11.


Thursday's after-hours session included earnings reports from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). **QQQ** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ))was virtually flat in after-hours trading despite a nearly 6% gain for Amazon in after-hours trading. Alphabet fell 3% and Apple slipped 1%.

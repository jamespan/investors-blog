Nasdaq Leads Upside; Apple Sinks After Hours; Monitor These 4 Stock Market Factors In 2019
===========================================================================================

If the first trading day of 2019 provided any insight into what the new year will bring investors, it may be this: Expect volatility in the stock market to be more like the relatively wild 2018, not the placid 2017.




In a seesaw session that started off awfully weak, the major U.S. indexes actually ended pretty well. The S&P 500's 0.1% gain doesn't sound appetizing. But just five minutes into Wednesday's session, the 500 dived nearly 1.6%. The big-cap benchmark also closed near session highs.


Meanwhile, small caps and a small cadre of big-cap techs dominated the upside. The Nasdaq composite turned an opening drop of nearly 2% into a closing advance of up almost 0.5%. The Nasdaq 100 also rose nearly 0.5% as it marked the fourth gain in five sessions. The Nasdaq composite rose for a fifth straight day; that marked the longest rally since an eight-day upswing that ended Aug. 9 last year.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MP010219-300x289.jpg)The Russell 2000 rose 0.5%, matching the Nasdaq's performance. The S&P SmallCap 600 lifted 0.4%.


The S&P MidCap 400 slumped 0.3%, but overall market breadth was positive. Winners easily topped losing issues by more than a 2-1 ratio on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Plus, volume grew vs. Monday's session on both main exchanges.


All of these factors point to a relatively rosy start for U.S. equities after the major averages lost ground on an annual basis in 2018 for the first time in a decade. However, volatility, particularly among those stocks that have led big time over the past several years, is set to remain fierce Thursday as well. Why?


Nasdaq Member Apple Falls Hard After Hours
------------------------------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) shares got halted after the market close, then dropped around 7% in extended-hours trading. In a letter to shareholders, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that revenue for the December-ended fiscal first quarter would be approximately $84 billion. That falls well short of Wall Street's consensus forecast of $91.49 billion.


Cook noted a slew of reasons for the shocking report. They included a strong U.S. dollar that created foreign-exchange headwinds, supply constraints, and economic weakness in some emerging markets that "turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected."


"While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China," Cook noted in a news release. "In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100% of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad."



At the beginning of the day, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) helped spark jittery selling when it [reported deliveries of the Model 3 sedan that missed analysts' views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-model-3-deliveries/). Tesla, which outperformed the major U.S. equity indexes in 2018 with a 6.9% gain, briefly dipped below 300 for the third time in six sessions. Shares ended Monday down 6.8% to 310.12 and below the flattened 200-day moving average.


4 Stock Market Factors To Watch Closely
---------------------------------------


Apple had served as a marvelous megacap member of leading stocks that helped pace solid gains since early 2017. But the sell-off in the fourth quarter of 2018 basically removed all wind from Apple's sails. IBD readers will benefit by using various stock lists, from [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) to the [Growth 250 screen on MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), to see which companies can pick up the slack.


In other words, keep your eyes open for the emergence of new stock market leaders.


A second factor to watch: a [potential follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). The market offered two follow-through rallies in November. Both failed. This is normal. Head-fake rallies show up frequently as the market tries to carve out a bottom. A third, fourth, or even fifth uptrend confirmation should do the trick. And as IBD founder Bill O'Neil liked to often say, the market loves to prove everyone wrong.


Market Bullishness Plunges Last Week
------------------------------------


This past week, bullishness among newsletter editors plummeted, as seen in IBD's [Psychological Market Indicators section](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/). What's especially notable? The 29.9% figure fell below the 34.6% figure of bearishness, according to the weekly survey by Investors Intelligence.


This is actually a rare occurrence. And IBD research has found that when the [bears exceed the bulls](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-hopeful-signs/), a true stock market bottom is near. Such a phenomenon took place in both the summer of 2002 and the summer of 2008. It happened again in the fall of 2011, another time when the major indexes fell at least 20% from their 52-week highs.


However, keep in mind that the bulls-bears ratio is a secondary indicator of the stock market's general direction. At this point, the day-to-day price-and-volume action of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 is still the most important gauge for IBD readers. Please view the General Market Indicators page PDF at the bottom of this article for the big daily charts of these two key benchmarks.


Third, watch for signs of sector rotation. Right now, the Consumer, Utility, Media and Food/Beverage sectors dominate the uppermost echelon of IBD's stock research tables. But among the [33 broad industry sectors ranked each day](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-dec-31-2018/), the top third also includes some traditional "growth bastions" of the stock market.



The IPO Picture
---------------


Last, keep an eye on the IPO market. A number of tech unicorns are reportedly eyeing a market debut in 2019. How strong will the IPOs be this year?


On the [Leaderboard watch list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), **Tencent Music** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) fell for a third straight session. Yet the stock remains within a relatively narrow price range of 12 to 14.75. Watch for a [potential IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) to form.


The spinoff from former huge market winner **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) grew earnings 100% to 10 cents a share in the third quarter on a 65% lift in revenue to $722 million.


[The IPO LeadersÂ stock list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) looks a little bit like the cupboard of Old Mother Hubbard lately. Watch to see if the list expands in the coming months.

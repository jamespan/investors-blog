As Stocks Fall Below Would-Be Support Levels, How Low Can They Go?
===================================================================

Stocks plunged anew Monday, dashing hopes for a rebound and knocking indexes below levels where there was once a chance at a bottom.




The Nasdaq composite plummeted 2.7% and has erased all gains for the year. It's not the first time the composite has undone all its work for 2017. The Nasdaq did just that during the early February sell-off. On Monday, the Nasdaq fell below 7000, where some support appeared last week.


The S&P 500 slid 2.2% and closed below the long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since June 27, 2016. The index seemed to act like it would bottom above that moving average last week, but that's no longer the case. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.9% and touched its own 200-day line, also for the first time since June 2016.


The Russell 2000 skidded 2.4%. The index has wiped away all gains from its low made a month ago and also is down for the year. At 7.6% below its prior high, the small-cap benchmark is doing better than the other major indexes.


Volume fell from Thursday's levels on the Nasdaq, and rose on the NYSE. Decliners led advancers by 4-to-1 on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP04021818-300x290.png)With the S&P 500 and Nasdaq violating support levels, there's a new sense that there's no imminent bottom for stocks.


A pair of rebounds last week on Monday and Thursday gave the appearance of bottoms in the making. But both quickly unraveled. So the market must try again. Indexes must climb at least a few days before a rally confirmation can appear.


Investors should be mostly or entirely in cash by now, but they should also be monitoring top-rated stocks for possible buy opportunities after the correction is over. Gauges of investor fear have reached elevated levels, but indexes so far haven't rebounded with those signals.


Leading stocks haven't been spared much pain. The IBD 50 is down about 10% from its high, so it's fair to say leaders are in a correction of their own.


A trade war is causing much of the stock selling. On Monday, [China retaliated against new U.S. tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-surprise/) with duties on 128 American products, including fresh and dried fruit, wine, pork, and some steel products.


But the selling has spread to sectors that, for now, would seem to have little or no impact from tariffs, including technology.


In fact, the selling in the past seven sessions has been most severe in semiconductor, biotech and other technology shares, based on the performance of sector ETFs. Most stocks in the so-called FANG trade have been coming apart. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) was one of the first to falter, and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has fallen below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume.


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) added to the tech rout, off 6% in heavy volume, on a Bloomberg report that Apple plans toÂ use its own chips in Mac computers rather than Intel's. Intel fell through its 50-day line but closed above it.

Gold, a haven type of asset, was one of the few places for shelter Monday. SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) rose 1.2% and the ETF is near a new high. Gold mining was one of the few industry groups higher on Monday.


The worst-performing groups included retailers, biotechs, generic drugs, autos, fiber optics and airlines.

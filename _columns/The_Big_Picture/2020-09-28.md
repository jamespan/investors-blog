  Stocks Surge But Key Element Is Missing From Otherwise Bullish Day

The stock market gave favorable signals Monday, as it sought to snap out of its September slump. But a critical element was missing from an otherwise bullish day.




The Nasdaq composite led with a 1.9% surge after it gapped back above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 rose 1.6% and closed practically at its 50-day line.


The [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) is a commonly followed indicator on Wall Street, which made Monday's gains more significant. To be sure, it was not the best moving average to track the market's April-August run. That distinction belonged to the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which marked multiple Nasdaq lows during that period.


Still, Monday's moves at the 50-day line were nothing to brush off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also jumped back above its 50-day average, rising 1.5%.


![MP092820_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP092820_2.jpg)The Russell 2000 was even more impressive. The small-cap benchmark surged 2.4%, taking back more than half last week's 4.5% tumble in a single day. Market watchers consider small caps as the more speculative section of the market.


Leading stocks did their part. The IBD 50 rallied 1.9%.


Despite multiple positive signs, the stock market came up short in a critical factor. Lower volume kept the Nasdaq from a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) that would have signaled a likely market bottom.


For [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) wonks, this is how it breaks down: The Nasdaq's rally attempt that began with the Sept. 21 low was long enough for a follow-through. But for a follow-through, index gains must be well above 1% and volume must be higher than in the prior session. Nasdaq volume dropped nearly 5% Monday vs. Friday's level, early data showed.


NYSE volume increased. But the S&P 500 is only three days into a rally attempt, starting with Thursday's low. Follow-throughs, in almost all cases, cannot happen until the index is at least four days from a low.


Where Does Stock Market Go From Here?
-------------------------------------


So, where does that leave investors? In short, waiting for a follow-through. For now, continue to treat stocks with caution and avoid new purchases.


Precious few top-rated stocks were up in volume in Monday's Market Pulse table. If a follow-through happens, expect that list to be much longer. But with a bottoming signal closer to reality, it is especially important to have a watchlist ready and updated.

Many other leaders are finding support at the 10-week moving average.


No doubt, the stock market certainly faces key risks. Third-quarter earnings season will start soon. But some early signs are positive. Although more than 100 S&P 500 companies have withdrawn profit guidance due to coronavirus uncertainty, there's a positive trend among those giving forecasts. FactSet says the number of S&P 500 companies issuing positive earnings guidance for Q3 is running at 36% above the five-year average at this point.


Political risk is also present. The election is five weeks away, and the first presidential debate is Tuesday night in Cleveland. Not only is the White House and make up of Congress at stake, but many analysts worry that results may be delayed or contested.

Stocks Fall Broadly; Is A True Correction Near?
================================================

Just when you thought things might turn euphoric, the market begs to differ.


The major indexes cut a four-week run with vigorous selling for a second straight session on Friday, one day after IBD downgraded the current outlook from a confirmed uptrend to "uptrend under pressure." The Nasdaq composite fell 2% and the S&P 500 dropped more than 2.1%.


 The last time the market outlook adopted the cautionary stance was in the middle of August.


The Dow Jones industrial average, seeing at least 12 of its 30 components lose 3 points or more, fell 2.5% on Friday and closed the week 4.1% lower. The Nasdaq, down 3.5% for the week, took its biggest weekly hit since the week ended Feb. 5, 2016. The S&P 500 sank 3.9%; the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF slid 6.3%.


Volume climbed on both exchanges Friday, marking a fifth distribution day for the Nasdaq and a fourth for the S&P 500. A true cluster of heavy institutional selling has formed, with the Nasdaq falling in higher trade in four of the past eight sessions.

The recent rush of selling alone does not mean the bull market is over. The economic and earnings picture remains bright. Some big-cap techs sold off after posting results that likely failed to meet the highest expectations. It's not clear if the bulk of top stocks are finished rallying. But one can expect at least some true market leaders to finally cool off and begin base building again.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which on Thursday notched its fourth quarter in a row of mild double-digit earnings growth, slumped more than 4% on Friday and is challenging its long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since November 2016. Yet while Apple is now 10% below its 180.10 peak, meeting the definition of an intermediate correction, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 currently lie around 3% below their respective peaks.


Friday's sell-off was so widespread that more than nine stocks fell for every one that rose on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, losers beat winners 5-1. Gaming software led the week with a fine 3.1% gain over the past week, but just eight other industry groups out of 197 tracked by IBD rallied for the week.


On [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/), five names exited the list this week. But none of the five triggered the [golden rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), which is to cut losses at 7% to 8% or more. Pullbacks to the buy point are nothing new in the stock market. If you get shaken out, be ready to re-buy if conditions are warranted.


The Nasdaq hasn't touched its 50-day moving average since late September, though it's come pretty close.


The Dow utility average fell less than the major averages, down 0.7%. But it remains in an intermediate correction. Don't treat the sell-off as a chance to go bargain-hunting as companies show bigger yields. If government bond prices keep falling, capital losses could wipe out the dividend income and then some. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.85%, closing in on the 3% level last seen in January 2014.

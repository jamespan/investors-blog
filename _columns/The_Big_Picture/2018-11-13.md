title: Stock Market Erases Sizable Gains, As These Signs May Hold Key To A Bottom

A morning rebound evaporated Tuesday, dashing hopes for an immediate bottom for the sputtering stock market and leaving stocks' outlook still clouded.




The Nasdaq composite jumped to a 1.6% gain in the first two hours of the session, but that's when sellers made their way back to the trading terminals. The composite kept sliding almost into the close, ending exactly where it closed Monday.


The S&P 500 suffered a similarly reversal, only worse. The index closed 0.1% lower after erasing a 1% increase. It closed below the 200-day moving average for a second straight day. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.4%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and was indicated higher on the NYSE.

The Nasdaq's decline from its prior high exceeds 10%, which is how Wall Street defines a market correction. IBD's market outlook is less pessimistic, standing at "uptrend under pressure."


Dark Notes In The Stock Market
------------------------------


Certainly, there are bearish signals to ponder.


After Monday's rout, a bounce from oversold levels seemed plausible. But buyers showed trepidation. Tuesday's negative price reversals and higher volume indicated that bargain-hunting did not tempt institutional investors.


TheÂ 50-day moving averages of the major indexes are curving lower and 200-day lines are flattening. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is now matching the low from two weeks ago. The NYSE's advance-decline line is headed for a new low.


Last week's [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) is on the ropes, with indexes now trading underneath the lows of that signal last Wednesday.


Yet, indexes remain above the October lows. Despite the maligned performance of the main indexes, there's been only one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) since the follow-through.


Investors trying to study the market's direction would learn much from the current activity of leading stocks.


The IBD 50 climbed 0.1% Tuesday and is down nearly 20% from its prior high. Once an index falls more than 20%, it's generally considered to be in a bear market.


Breakouts In Question
---------------------


A number of new breakouts are sputtering if not failing, including **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)), **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) and **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)).


Some of the stocks that made an upward impulse last week are now giving back some of their sharp gains. **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)), **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) are among those.


At the same time, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) and a few other IBD 50 breakouts are working just fine.


It's no coincidence that some of the best-performing breakouts in the IBD 50 are real estate investment trusts **CareTrust** ([CTRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRE)) and **Medical Properties Trust** ([MPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPW)). These dividend-heavy investments are winning favor as growth stocks take investors on a wild ride.


While it's impossible to divine the market's next move, it is fairly clear that buyers and sellers are locked in a battle. Until that's resolved, investors must remain guarded. Save new stock purchases for exceptional stocks and chart action. Trim some exposure, and be sure to [sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Where's The Stock Market Leadership?
------------------------------------


One big problem for the market is that it lacks clear leadership. The FANGs and other major tech stocks are gashed.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) closed below the 200-day line Tuesday. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is right back below its 200-day line. **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) 50-day line is about to cross below 200-day line. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is still putting up a fight.


Health care and consumer stocks have displayed some leadership, and those sectors need to be watched for new opportunities.


Don't expect the energy sector to lead anytime soon. Seven of the 15 worst performing industry groups Tuesday were oil and gas groups, hurting the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials. Crude oil extended its bear market after [futures tumbled 7.1% to $55.69 a barrel](https://www.investors.com/news/permian-basin-endeaver-buyout-news-exxon-chevron-shell/), the lowest level of the year.

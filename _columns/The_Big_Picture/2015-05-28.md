Stock Indexes Step Back A Bit; Carter's, Epam Software Break Out
=================================================================

Stocks sagged into the red early Thursday, and except for one minute on the Nasdaq, never saw the break-even line the rest of the day. The Nasdaq stepped back less than 0.2%, while the S&P 500 eased 0.1%. The IBD 50 was flat.

  

Volume declined on both major exchanges.

  

For bulls hoping that this uptrend would lead to a decisive break from months of rangebound action, the situation is looking like more of the same.

  

The market's current difficulties are not much different than what has been the case so far this year. Traction, for the most part, has been missing on both the downside and upside.

  

Here's a statistic that puts things in perspective: Thursday was the 101st trading session of 2015, and 50 of those days have been spent with the Market Pulse in the under-pressure zone.

  

When was the last time indefiniteness ruled to that degree? Never, if the test is the same period in past seven years.

  

In the first five months of 2014, only 13 sessions were in the indefinite zone. In 2013, the number was 11. In 2012, it was six. In 2011, it was 22. In 2010, it was seven. And in 2009, the number was 19.

  

Why should this matter?

  

Market timers have an easier time making money in a clear uptrend and an easier time avoiding losses in a clear downtrend. A correction is a time to bring money to the sidelines. An uptrend is a time to increase exposure.

  

While the market is now in an uptrend, it's folly to think the year's bent isn't coloring this uptrend a paler shade of green.

  

On Thursday, some top-rated stocks topped buy points, including **Epam Software** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) and children's apparel firm **Carter's** ([CRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRI)).

  

The uptrend has not shortage of breakouts. However, it does have a shortage of strong follow-up action after the breakout. About half of the top-rated stocks that broke out in the past two weeks are still loitering in the 5% buy zone. The rest are either under buy points or gripping gains at the 5% to 9% level.

  

News provided the market with something to grapple with Thursday. China's Shanghai Composite plunged 6.5%, but the U.S. market shrugged. The Shanghai climbed 15% over the previous seven sessions and gave back almost half Thursday. Perhaps the U.S. market decided the giveback was appropriate.

  

On Friday, the market will have fresh data to weigh. The focus will be on the government's second take on Q1 GDP. The consensus view expects a 0.8% decline, but the range of estimates runs from minus 1% to minus 0.2%.

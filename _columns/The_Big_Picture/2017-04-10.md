Stocks Nearly Flat; Which Groups Are Emerging In Sector Rotation?
==================================================================

Stocks were erratic Monday, as the market still couldn't quite make up its mind which way to go.


Indexes opened slightly higher, but tumbled near midday. A report that China had moved 150,000 troops to its border with North Korea seemed to stimulate selling, for a while. Whether there was a mobilization or not, buyers soon stepped in and indexes barely held on to gains.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 closed less than 0.1% higher and well off session highs. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. For the Nasdaq, its stalling mannerism was bearish. But it won't be added as a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) unless more institutional selling piles up later on.

Indexes are reluctant to make new highs, but not breaking down either. Even big headlines such as Friday's disappointing job growth fail to motivate traders.


With mixed signals, it makes sense to keep an evenhanded portfolio strategy. That's why IBD's market outlook remains at uptrend under pressure. A half-dozen distribution days on the S&P 500 and almost as many on the Nasdaq is enough to keep investors on guard, too.


Small caps technically are in a downtrend. Since its March 1 peak, the Russell 2000 has been in a moderate downward price channel. It still is trading below the 50-day moving average. Yet, on Monday it outperformed the major indexes with a gain of less than 0.2%.


The S&P 500 also is in a similar price channel. The Nasdaq is basically sideways since March. But its advance-decline line is trending slightly downward. Ideally, the line should be near highs just like the index, and by contrast the NYSE chart does show its Advance-Decline line making new highs even as the index consolidates.


While the indexes are in a no man's land, sectors can make their own moves. Investors who study those can spot opportunities, often before the market is back on its feet. Sector rotation has brought homebuilders, many tech companies, biotechs and other industries to the forefront.


Breakouts remain iffy, but some technology leaders are rising from support at 50-day line. **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)), **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)), **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) are IBD 50 stocks in support areas. Watch industry groups that have moved into the top 40 from the bottom half of the list.


Chinese internet stocks were more buoyant than usual Monday. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), the huge online retailer, cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 110.55 buy point. Social media company **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) surged 7% to a record high.


Earnings season kicks off and may give stocks some direction. Analysts believe S&P 500 earnings per share might top 10% by the time all companies report. **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) announce results later this week. After rallying since the Nov. 8 election, financials have slumped. But analysts are expecting good things for Q1.


"Financials are a standout this season, with EPS projected to grow 18%," noted RBC Capital Markets. "The (year-over-year) rebound in capital markets activity, net interest margins, and asset prices are benefiting the big-5 banks, insurers, and asset management companies. By contrast, regional bank earnings remain tepid on uninspiring loan volumes."


**MasTec** ([MTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTZ)) broke out past the 41.30 buy point of an odd base. But volume was only 14% above average and shares of the heavy construction company closed below the buy point — two potentially  deleterious factors for the breakout.

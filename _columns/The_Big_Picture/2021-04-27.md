[Stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) ended mixed, with investors bracing for a mega-load of earnings results.




Even if you looked at only the major indexes, you still likely couldn't appreciate just how jumbled the action was at a granular level. But perhaps you already expect that during the high tide of corporate earnings news.


On the upside, iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF inched up nearly 0.2%. So did SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)). On the downside, the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund eased 0.4%. Given how QQQ lifted nearly 1.9% in the prior two sessions, Tuesday's decline appeared normal.


All of the other key indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average, finished even more mildly. Higher volume on the Nasdaq gave the composite a new [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).

Back To Stocks Today
--------------------


There's a clear reason why IBD still slices and dices the market into 197 industry groups: to spot key shifts in institutional money flow. While one day's action hardly makes for a trend, strong moves up or down can help the individual investor make sound decisions in the quest to maximize returns.


[MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), in its reports section, saw the weakest action, on a price-weighted basis, among automaker, cable and satellite telecom, education services, soap, non-alcoholic beverages, water utility and gold and silver mining stocks. All of these industry groups fell 1.7% or more, early data showed.


What did well? Check out air freight, consumer electronics retail, department store, shoe, home furnishings retail, apparel maker, gaming, international oil and gas exploration, staffing and agricultural chemical shares. These groups rallied 2% or more.


(Please see the entire performance of all 197 industry groups at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Clearly, a 10% gap-up by **UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)), part of the air freight industry group, bespeaks volumes about the recovery of the economy. UPS [smashed profit expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/ups-stock-ups-earnings-crush-views-fedex-adobe-ecommerce-pact/).


Still Living And Investing With Coronavirus
-------------------------------------------



The headlines in India regarding coronavirus remain awful. Based on current rate of that country's daily new infection cases, the biggest democracy in Asia could potentially surpass the U.S. in terms of total Covid-19 infections in two months or even less. But the stock market seems to continue to favor investment in re-opening plays of various stripes, from construction to home improvement, retailing to commodities, entertainment to stay- and work-from-home enablers.


UPS offered a few weeks' opportunity to buy at or near the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [meandering flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) at 176.04. Yet buying before quarterly results always carries an extra load of risk.


That's why the [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) highlights an alternate buy point that has emerged as a result of the two-decade-old Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure). Reg FD has skewed a lot of the stock market's action toward quarterly earnings, resulting in more or larger surprises.


5 Hot New IPOs To Watch Now
---------------------------


You're likely going to see more stories, as the market hits new highs, that explain why stocks are getting overheated. And that's good. Occasional pullbacks help temper traders' expectations. But now is still a good time to search for new stocks today that, while acorns now, could grow into big oaks on Wall Street. Here's a few possibilities:


**Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)): The cryptocurrency platform, which opened with a reference price of $250 and now sits near 300, sports impressive fundamentals. In Q4, earnings soared to 90 cents a share vs. a net loss of 14 cents a year earlier. Sales catapulted 495% higher to $585.1 million. But the stock needs a lot more time to build a [good IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/many-tech-ipos-can-fail-on-their-first-breakout-just-like-emc-did-in-1986/).


**Cricut** ([CRCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRCT)): The South Jordan, Utah-based firm makes next-generation tools for the arts and crafts market. The stock suffered quite a shakeout one day after surging out of a very narrow IPO base with a 21.02 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Earnings jumped 600% in the fourth quarter to 28 cents a share. Sales more than doubled to $371 million, a quarterly best.


**Leslie's Pool And Supply** ([LESL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LESL)): The home improvement play is carving out a second cup. Shares retook the 50-day line in April. Will a [perfect handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) form? Strength in industry peer, [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) member **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)), justifies a close look.


2 More IPOs To Watch
--------------------


**UiPath** ([PATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PATH)) was discussed in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A). The software bot expert, debuting on the NYSE at 56 a share, needs more time to develop a trading range.


**Yalla Group** ([YALA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YALA)): The United Arab Emirates-based internet content firm has reclaimed a spot on the watchlist of key stocks exclusive to [IBD Live show subscribers](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A). Watch to see if it can put more substantial work on the [right side of a new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).

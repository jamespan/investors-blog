Stock Market Closes Out Week With A Bang, But Nasdaq Still Faces Key Test; ASML Gives Buy Signal
=================================================================================================

The stock market ended the week on a high note Friday despite disappointing retail sales data before the open. The Nasdaq composite jumped 2.3% in lower volume. But after finding support near the 13,000 level Wednesday, the index lost 2.3% for the week and is still below its 50-day moving average.




April sales were flat vs. views for a 1% gain. But March data was revised higher to 10.7% vs. an initial reading of 9.8%. The data comes after hotter-than-expected consumer prices and wholesale prices earlier in the week.


The Nasdaq 100 gained 2.2% and closed slightly above its 50-day moving average. But the index is still on a downtrend and its [21-day exponential moving](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) average at 13,549 is still a potential resistance level to watch.


Advancing stocks trounced decliners on the NYSE by 8-to-1. Winners topped losers on the Nasdaq by more than 4-to-1.


![MP051421](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP051421-287x300.jpg)Chip-equipment firm **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, up 4%. It's arguably the best-looking chart in the chip equipment group at this point after another successful test of its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/). IBD's chip-equipment group was up 3% for the day.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones closed above its 21-day line Thursday and retook its 10-day line Friday. The blue-chip index added close to 1.1%, but the 35,000 level remains a potential resistance level.


The S&P 500 gapped above its 21-day line, rising 1.5% in lower volume. Small caps led the charge, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) up 2.4%, but it's still below its 50-day line.


The Dow held up well Friday despite a sell-off in **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) stock. Disney reported a big beat on the bottom line, but sales missed, hurt by weaker than expected subscriber growth for its Disney+ streaming service. Weakness in Disney was offset by strength in **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), which jumped nearly 3%. It's near the top of the 5% buy zone from a 356.95 buy point.



Financial stocks continue to provide solid leadership. In the regional bank group, breakouts from **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)), **Fifth Third Financial** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)) and **Regions Bancorp** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)) continue to work.


**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) also outperformed in the Dow as oil prices rose again. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $65.37 a barrel, up 2.4%.


Several oil and gas producers are compelling turnaround stories and trade near buy points, including **Cimarex Energy** ([XEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XEC)), **PDC Energy** ([PDCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDCE)) and **Whiting Petroleum** ([WLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLL)).


There are plenty of stocks working outside of the technology sector, so it makes sense to target new buys. Just look for stocks with [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) near highs.


The put/call ratio on Wednesday gave a clue that indexes could be ready to bounce. It wasn't an extremely fearful reading at 0.84, but it was the highest since late October, just ahead of follow-through days for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in early November.


Among the day's top performers, **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) gave an early buy signal Friday with a gap above the 50-day moving average. The airline's weekly chart shows several tight weekly closes near its 10-week moving average, strengthening the stock's technical picture. IBD's airline group was one of the day's top performers, up around 4%.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average made good price gains Tuesday. But their advances masked a poor session for leading stocks and the Nasdaq composite.




The Nasdaq climbed to a record high in early trading, but faded for much of the day. The composite erased a 1.1% gain to close a fraction lower. It bounced some in the final two hours but only enough to prevent larger losses.


The results were better for the S&P 500, which rose 0.5% and closed in the middle of the day's price range. It gapped up to a nearly six-month high. The Dow added 0.8% and closed near session highs. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Energy, steel, mining and other industrial stocks led the market, which helped explain why the S&P 500 and Dow outperformed.

Weakness in semiconductor and software stocks were a big part of the weakness in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The Philadelphia semiconductor index reversed to a loss of 0.9% and again met resistance at the 50-day moving average.


It wasn't just technology shares that lagged. The Russell 2000 slid 1.1% in broad weakness for small caps. Technology and health care seemed to get hit harder among small caps. The Russell 2000 was near a record high of its own before it reversed lower.


If it was a bad day for small caps and techs, it was dreadful for leading stocks.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) reversed to close more than 1.7% lower. It held above the 50-day moving average, where support is quite important to emerge. There was little to cheer about in the IBD 50 aside from **PGT Innovations** ([PGTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGTI)), which soared on an acquisition, and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), which gapped up to a new high.


Nineteen of the 50 stocks fell more than 2%. Chinese social media company **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) was at the bottom of the pile. It plunged 8%, breaking support at the 50-day moving average in heavy volume. In fact, a number of Chinese stocks tumbled.


The Nasdaq struggled even while Facebook and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) enjoyed productive days. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, [beat profit and sales expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-alphabet-fang-stocks/) late Monday. Shares are nearly 5% above the 1,201.59 buy point.


**Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), another major Nasdaq component, broke out from an [odd cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). It also gave back some gains, but at least it closed above the 367.99 buy point. Shares rose after the biotech reported Q2 earnings that topped views.


The chart of the Nasdaq was a mess. Technically, the composite did not register a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). But for all intents and purposes, it was a bearish day. To give up so much of an advance in a day is poor action.


A week earlier, the Nasdaq performed almost a mirror opposite of Tuesday's price action, putting in a bullish reversal. But the index failed to follow up with solid gains. Tuesday's weakness produced a limp image. Combined with a sputtering performance for leading stocks, there's reason for caution.


Still, there are no big signs of a market top. The Nasdaq is near all-time highs and holding above its 50-day moving average. And the S&P 500 is widening a cushion above the 2800 level. Watch for both indexes to hold above their respective June highs. So far they are.


The number of distribution days is normal on the S&P 500 and a bit high on the Nasdaq. But a few will be expiring soon.


Earnings season is in full force, which will give the market plenty to ponder and analyze the rest of this week and over the next few weeks.

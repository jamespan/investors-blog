Indexes were mixed Wednesday as small caps outperformed on the stock market today. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) pared some early losses, while **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) battled more bad news.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average got off to a good start and outperformed other indexes in the early going. The Dow pared gains in the afternoon but ended fractionally higher.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 took a breather after touching a record high on Tuesday. Nvidia weighed more seriously on the Nasdaq, which fell 0.5%. The AI chip leader managed to close back above the 900 price level.


Wednesday's mixed action followed gains on all three major indexes Tuesday even though [inflation exceeded expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-feb-fed-rate-cut-sp-500/) in February.


Investor Enthusiasm Frothy On Stock Market Today
------------------------------------------------


Indeed, investor enthusiasm seems to be getting frothy. According to the Investors Intelligence Advisors Sentiment Report, bulls continued to rule the roost, but that bullishness is at a level that brings some risks.


"Rebounds and economic strength pushed the bulls higher to 60.9% (of market newsletters), from 59.4%" last week, the report said. For the second week, markets saw "the most bulls since summer 2021, increasing the danger of a retreat. The bulls last exceeded 60% in April and July 2021, at 63.7% and 61.2%, respectively."


Breadth was mixed as advancers beat decliners on the NYSE by about a 3-to-2 ratio, but decliners edged advancers on the Nasdaq.


Among the S&P's 11 sectors, technology lagged while energy gained. Semiconductor stocks continued to weaken. The three IBD chip-related industry groups were among the 10 worst-performing groups Wednesday. The PHLX Semiconductor Index had a bearish reversal Friday and has continued to waver.


Mining Stocks Break Out In MarketSurge 250
------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP031324-208x300.jpg)As discussed in The Big Picture lately, the number of breakouts among quality stocks has been drying up. And some of the most recent haven't been so fruitful.


In the [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/announcement//?srs=&utm_source=i.com&utm_medium=NHPBroad&utm_campaign=MS+FAQ+24&utm_id=MSFAQ24) Growth 250. there were fewer breakouts in the week ended March 8 vs. the previous week.


Some breakouts have been working but others are seeing gains fade. Thinly traded **Paymentus** ([PAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAY)) is up more than 30% from a March 5 breakout, but **AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)) and **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)) have given up much of their price increases from buy points.


Meanwhile, Wednesday's breakouts for **Owens Corning** ([OW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OW)) and **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) came in unimpressive volume. But several breakouts among copper and metal mining plays Wednesday came in solid volume.


Mining stocks had a fabulous day. **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) broke out in strong volume as did **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)). **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)) gapped up more than 8%. The stock is forming a long base, although the Dec. 28 high at 43 may act as an alternative entry.


Both bitcoin and gold gained Wednesday. Bitcoin surged past $73,000. The S&P Gold Shares ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) topped a buy zone. The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 4.19%.

Dow Jones, Magnificent Seven
----------------------------


In the Dow industrials, **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) gained for the second day as earnings loom on Thursday. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) broke a three-day wining streak, falling 1.2%. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) also dragged the Dow down on the stock market today after the Pentagon backed out on a $2.5 billion grant for the chip bellwether. Intel shares met resistance at the 50-day moving average.


[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Nvidia fell 1.1% after making hefty gains on Tuesday. Elsewhere, bears tightened their grip on **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) after [Wells Fargo analysts slashed their price target](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-downgraded-tesla-bull-analyst/) to 125 from 200 and downgraded the EV leader to underweight from equal weight. Tesla is in a downtrend, trading below its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). Shares are also at levels last seen last May.


According to Dow Jones Market Data, Tesla now ranks as the 12th largest company by market cap, now lower than **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)).



Earnings caused some major moves in retail.


**Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) gapped up nearly 18% to a record high on the stock market today. But **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) cratered. The discount retailer was the biggest loser on the S&P 500. The company had a poor fourth quarter and announced it will [shutter 600 Family Dollar Stores](https://www.investors.com/news/dollar-tree-stock-earnings-williams-sonoma-dollar-general/) in the first half of 2024 and additionally close 370 Family Dollar locations and 30 Dollar Tree stores over the next several years.


On Wednesday, **Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)), **XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) inched closer to buy points in their bases.


**Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)), an addition to [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) on Wednesday, cleared a [three-weeks-tight entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) of 152.55.

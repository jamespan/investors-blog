Weak performances for **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) in the stock market Wednesday didn't have much effect on the major stock indexes as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 ended with modest gains. Texas Instruments plunged 7.5% after the company reported disappointing earnings late Tuesday. And ServiceNow's downtrend intensified on news CEO John Donahoe is leaving to take the CEO post at **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)).




But ServiceNow stock rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading on strong earnings.


The Dow Jones industrials and Nasdaq composite added 0.2% each, while the S&P 500 picked up 0.3%. Nasdaq volume was slightly lower than Tuesday, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE also lower.


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) reversed higher in the Dow Jones after falling 2% early Wednesday. Sentiment was negative early after the company lowered its profit outlook, but CEO Jim Umpleby said the company planned to cut production to match dealer demand, which encouraged investors.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP102319-235x300.jpg)](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was another solid gainer in the Dow as investors continue to gravitate toward lower P-E stocks, that is those with cheaper valuations. Shares rose 1.3% to 243.18 — a new high — after Morgan Stanley raised its price target to 289 from 247.


The Nasdaq held up quite well even as semiconductor stocks were generally weak. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) fell 1.7%. But the exchange traded fund rose in after-hours trading, helped by strong earnings from **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)).


Meanwhile, the latest survey of market newsletters from Investors Intelligence showed the bulls rising to 52.8% from 49.1% the prior week and 47.6% the week before that. Rising bullishness in the stock market might sound like a good thing, but too much bullishness can be problematic. That's because the crowd is often wrong when it comes to timing the market. According to Investors Intelligence, readings above 55% call for defensive measures.


High Distribution-Day Count
---------------------------


The quiet day of trading was a modest win for stock market bulls after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 flashed another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) Tuesday. The count is quite high for both indexes, although the stock market has shown in the past it can perform well even with a lot of distribution days.


Still, significant signs of institutional selling in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to make it a challenging environment for growth stocks, particularly high P-E stocks. Despite a decent amount of actionable setups, it's hard putting money to work with confidence knowing that recent breakouts have been a mixed bag at best.


Consider **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), which broke out powerfully Friday on strong earnings. The stock held on to the bulk of the gain Monday, but big sellers were in the stock Tuesday as shares cratered nearly 5%.


Chipotle Sinks After Earnings
-----------------------------


Big sellers also were in **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) stock ahead of the company's earnings report late Tuesday, and the stock saw more follow-on selling Wednesday despite a [big earnings beat](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q3-2019-due-chipotle-stock-buy-point/) and strong same-store sales growth. But headed into earnings, Chipotle was one of the higher P-E stocks in the restaurant group; high-multiple stocks are held to very high standards around earnings.


IBD's view on stocks with high price-earnings ratios is fairly straight forward. A high P-E ratio should never keep investors from buying a stock, as long as there's a growth story supporting a high multiple. But high P-E stocks need to be handled carefully around earnings. With a small profit cushion, for example, taking profits ahead of the results can make sense.


Stock Market Breakouts
----------------------


Wednesday's session yielded a powerful breakout from **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)). Shares jumped 17% to 152.71 on strong earnings. The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) was 139.28. Lithia's industry group is filled with plenty of other strong performers. **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) continues to hold comfortably above a buy point. **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) continues to work on a solid base above its 50-day moving average.


Meanwhile, [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) followed through after the medical aesthetics firm cleared an aggressive entry of 29.48 on Tuesday. The stock is known for volatile price swings, but it also has the look of an emerging leader. The 29.48 entry is considered aggressive because its latest five-week consolidation was too short to be a proper base.


Several other stocks broke out Wednesday, including **Knight-Swift Transportation** ([KNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNX)), **Avery Dennison** ([AVY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVY)) and **Carlisle Companies** ([CSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSL)).


Another [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock, **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), jumped 4% in Wednesday's after-hours session after reporting strong earnings.

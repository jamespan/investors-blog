The stock market extended gains Wednesday after the minutes from the June 15 Federal Reserve meeting didn't reveal any big surprises. But sellers knocked stock indexes off highs during the final half-hour of trading.




The Nasdaq composite showed noteworthy price action with a move above its [21-day exponential average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). But a 1% late gain faded to 0.3% by the close. Still, the index closed above its 21-day line, which has been a resistance level since May. The longer the Nasdaq can hold above the 21-day line, the better chance it has of making a run toward its 50-day line.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 added nearly 0.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.2%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume. Breadth disappointed again, with losers beating winners on both exchanges.


The selling was most pronounced in the Russell 2000, which fell 0.8%. The small-cap index was weighed down by weakness in oil and gas stocks, including two names in the pipeline group. **International Seaways** ([INSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSW)) and **Scorpio Tankers** ([STNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNG)) closed with losses of more than 10%.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP070622-228x300.jpg)Another Russell 2000 component, **Kinsale Capital** ([KNSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNSL)), offered a harsh reminder to investors that it remains a challenging environment for technical breakouts. After jumping 3% Tuesday to a new high, shares dived nearly 9%.


After falling more than 8% Tuesday, U.S. crude oil futures fell 1% Wednesday, settling at $98.53 a barrel. The relentless selling continued in oil and gas producers like **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)), **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) and **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)). All three stocks are below their 200-day lines.


Bond Market
-----------


The bond market saw selling ahead of the release of the Fed minutes and it continued into late trading, with the 10-year Treasury yield up 10 basis points to 2.91%. It's yielding less than the 2-year note, which was up 13 basis points to 2.95%. An inverted yield curve is the bond market's way of saying that the economy is headed for a recession, or may already be in one.


The Fed minutes reinforced what Wall Street already knows: that the central bank is committed to bringing down inflation and another 50- or 75-basis-point hike is likely at the July 26-27 meeting. Indexes wavered after the release, but strengthened until the dip occurred in late trading.

Meanwhile, Chinese stocks sold off sharply after Shanghai announced mass Covid-19 testing in several districts due to a rise in cases. **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) was the worst percentage decliner in the Nasdaq 100, down more than 7%, while **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) also suffered sharp losses.


Health care stocks dominated the upside again in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


**Evolent Health** ([EVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVH)) jumped 4.5% and cleared a 32.55 handle entry. The health management services firm is still in the 5% buy zone that goes up to 34.18. Evolent was one of three stocks that topped buy points Wednesday. After an early buy signal Tuesday, **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) topped a 166.45 entry but closed just below it. **Funko** ([FNKO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNKO)) cleared a 25.18 handle buy point, but it also closed just below the entry.



Stocks are acting better as major stock indexes try to find a bottom, but it's still a risky environment with the uptrend under pressure. When it comes to new buys, keep positions small to start while maintaining a healthy cash position.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) gained 2%, helping lift the managed care group to a gain of 1.5%. The stock recovered nicely off lows Tuesday after finding support at the 50-day moving average. It is back above a 507.35 buy point. Group peer **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) rallied more than 2% in strong volume. It closed just below a 273.68 flat-base entry.

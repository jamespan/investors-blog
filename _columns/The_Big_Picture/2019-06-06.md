The stock market extended gains Thursday, with major stock indexes closing near highs for the third straight session. Stocks strengthened in the afternoon after Bloomberg reported the U.S. is considering delaying Mexican tariffs, set to take effect Monday.




New issues **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) and **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) were nice gainers in after-hours trading on strong earnings.


The Dow Jones industrials led the way, up 0.7%; the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Nasdaq composite picked up 0.5%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index lost 0.2%, recovering nicely after a 1% morning loss. Volume was light all day but picked up the pace into the close. Nasdaq volume edged lower, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly lower than Wednesday.


**Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) performed in line with the Dow Jones, up 0.7% to 105.11, after topping a 104.28 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) Wednesday.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP060619-300x286.jpg)MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) was one of several solid gainers in the Nasdaq 100. It's getting support at the 10-week moving average for the second time after a bullish breakout Feb. 27.


Stock Market Rally
------------------


Indexes have bounced nicely in recent days, but the stock market remains in a correction. The S&P 500 is back above the 2800 level, but its 50-day moving average around 2869 is a potential resistance level to watch. The Nasdaq and Dow Jones also have overhead supply issues to work through. Still, a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) would put the market back in a confirmed uptrend.


Thursday marked Day 3 of a rally attempt for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite.


Wednesday's gains were impressive in light of a weak reading on job growth from ADP. Private payrolls increased a paltry 27,000 in May, well below the consensus estimate of 175,000. The data came ahead of Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up 180,000. The economy created 263,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, a half-century low. But wage growth was soft for a second straight month.


Euro Rallies On Dovish ECB
--------------------------


Meanwhile, the euro hit a seven-week high against the U.S. dollar Thursday after the European Central Bank said it expects interest rates to stay at present levels at least through the first half of 2020. Some hoped that ECB Chief Mario Draghi would give the eurozone economy one last jolt of stimulus before his terms ends in October.


The U.S. stock market has been falling along with oil prices and the 10-year Treasury yield. The 10-year yield was north of 3.20% in November, but massive bond buying has knocked it all the way down to 2.13%. The bond market, oil market and stock market all seem to be worried about the prospects for an economic slowdown, but remember that follow-through days can occur when they are least expected.


Stock Market Breakouts
----------------------


Thursday's session delivered two powerful base breakouts from [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)).


AMD jumped nearly 8% to 31.82, good for a breakout from a flat base with a 30.05 entry. The 5% buy zone topped out at 31.55. Morgan Stanley upgraded shares to equal-weight from underweight and raised its price target to 28 from 17.



AMD's latest earnings report wasn't very pretty, with adjusted earnings per share down 45% from the year-ago quarter. Sales fell 23% to $1.27 billion. But Wall Street is optimistic about a new line of chip products and graphics cards. It has the look of a turnaround story. Annual earnings are expected to jump 39% this year and 56% in 2020.


Meanwhile, Ciena gapped up bullishly over a 40.86 buy point. Shares soared nearly 27%, good for a breakout from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/). A bullish [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ciena-earnings-ciena-stock-q22019/) was the catalyst.

Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) had another good day, up 3%. The Brazil-based payments firm tried to clear a 31.74 buy point in mid-May but came up short. It's nicely above the entry now, but it's been moving in tepid volume.

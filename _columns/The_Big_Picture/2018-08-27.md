Tech Stocks Rise, Push Nasdaq Past 8000; Goldman Sachs Leads Dow
=================================================================

Tech stocks and financials ended with solid gains Monday as the Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones conquered key price levels. A new [trade deal with Mexico](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-nafta-deal-trump-auto-sector/)Â fueled positive sentiment.




Beaten-down semiconductor stocks like **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100. **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) did well in the Dow as the 10-year Treasury yield rose 4 basis points to 2.84%.


The Nasdaq composite, Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 all hit all-time highs. The Dow Jones held its own, rising 1%. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.9%, and the S&P 500 added 0.8%. Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 ended near its session low, rising 0.2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MP082718-201x300.jpg)It was a solid accumulation day for the Nasdaq as volume rose nicely from Friday's level. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume coming in slightly higher than Friday.


Marijuana Stocks Soar
---------------------


Marijuana stocks also grabbed headlines after **Tilray** ([TLRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLRY)) inked a supply deal with Nova Scotia Liquor. **Canopy Growth** ([CGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGC)) and **Cronos Group** ([CRON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRON)) also soared. After vaulting 52% last week, Cronos gapped out of a deep consolidation Monday, rising 21% to 12.04. It closed well-extended from a conventional entry of 10.49.


Tilray's first earnings report as a publicly-traded company will be out Tuesday after the close. A loss of 9 cents a share is expected, with sales up 72% to $9.96 million. Like all other pure-play pot stocks, though, Tilray is a highly speculative name. It's not profitable yet, and it only did $21 million in sales in 2017.


What's Next After Earnings?
---------------------------


A strong second-quarter earnings season generally fueled recent market gains. But with earnings season mostly in the rearview mirror, what will be the next catalyst for more gains? A continued flow of strong economic data? Possibly, but that could result in a more hawkish Fed. Progress with China trade talks? Perhaps, but they're at a stalemate so far.


The good news is that market technicals continue to look favorable overall. The Nasdaq conquered the 8000 level Monday and the Dow closed above 26,000 for the first time since February. The Nasdaq's advance/decline is in new-high ground. This is all good, and it's the reason why the market remains in a confirmed uptrend.


But a slightly defensive posture isn't a bad idea either. Do you have gains in some stocks that have been hitting new highs in light volume recently? If so, consider taking partial or full profits. What about profits after breakouts from later-stage bases? It's OK taking profits in these situations as well. Keeping some cash on hand seems appropriate at this juncture.


Tech Stocks In Favor
--------------------


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com), chip leader **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) jumped 5% but ended off session highs. The chipmaker hasn't looked back after breaking out of a long consolidation in June. News that **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) delayed the release of next-generation chips until next year has been good news for AMD, which is set to release a next-generation chip of its own before the end of the year.


A couple of breakout attempts in the MarketSmith Growth 250 came up short. Enterprise software leader **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) tried to clear a 194.91 flat-base entry but reversed slightly lower. **Ansys** ([ANSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANSS)), meanwhile, cleared a double-bottom base early with a 182.10 entry but ended below the buy point.


Meanwhile, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) faded an early gain Monday after Friday's earnings-inspired gap up in price. But two top-performing tech stocks in the software sector followed through after breakouts Friday: **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) component **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).


Among the FANG stocks, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) got turned away at its 50-day moving average after soaring 13% last week. Shares rose 1.6%, but the stock ended near its session low.


Financial Stocks Rally
----------------------


IBD's money center banks group was one of the day's top performers, rising nearly 2%. Top gainers in the group included Dow components **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)). Of the three, JPMorgan is by far the healthiest as it closes in on a breakout over a 118.39 entry. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup remain well off highs. Goldman had the best percentage increase in the Dow, up 3.2%.

Stock indexes traded in a narrow range Friday, posting small losses in mixed volume. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, while the Nasdaq was flat. The IBD 50 and the small-cap S&P 600 took a more positive path, adding 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq.



For the third time in the week, the S&P 500 shook off an old distribution day. The June 19, June 24 and June 25 distribution days were retired. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer current.


However, the count remained at six because the S&P 500 picked up a fresh distribution day Friday. The Nasdaq's tally remains moderate at three.


Perhaps more worrisome than distribution at this point is the extreme reactions to earnings or revenue misses that some stocks are encountering.


**Outerwall** ([OUTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OUTR)) dropped 13% in heavy volume. Adjusted earnings topped views, but revenue missed. The Redbox kiosk operator wiped out 12 weeks' worth of price gains in a day.


**Hanesbrands** ([HBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HBI)) lost 9% in heavy volume. The company matched the Street's number on earnings but missed on sales. Besides the lackluster results, the company reported that hackers had hit Hanesbrands' website, grabbing some customer details.


How can investors protect a portfolio from big gap-down losses during earnings season?


One way is to use a weekly options strategy to limit losses. For more details, see the [July 24 Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/763345-using-options-to-minimize-earnings-risk.htm) column at Investors.com.


On the positive side, those who held **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)) and **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) through their quarterly reports did very well. The two stocks jumped 13% and 11%, respectively.


Ellie Mae topped the Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines. Molina beat on earnings but missed on revenue. Molina broke out Friday, clearing a 74.08 buy point in a flat base.


Other breakouts Friday included the thinly traded **Columbia Sportswear** ([COLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COLM)), which gapped up from a cup with handle, and **United Health Services** ([UHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UHS)), which cleared a tight consolidation.


Earnings season continues in the coming week, though a good chunk of it is over.


In the S&P 500, about 73% of the companies reporting in July and early August have already reported. By the end of the coming week, the percentage reported will be at 97%.


The end of earnings season could bring corporate buybacks back into play. In the five weeks leading up to a quarterly report, companies aren't allowed to buy back shares. And company buybacks have been a huge provider of fresh cash for the bull market that began in March 2009.


If companies decide to resume the buying in the wake of their quarterly reports, then they could help the bulls.


Oil groups dominated the downs Friday, while a good mix of groups rose, including commercial services and leisure groups.


For the week, the small-cap S&P 600 rose 1.6%, the S&P 500 1.2%, the Nasdaq 0.8% and the IBD 50 0.4%.


In economic news, the Chicago Institute for Supply Management's business barometer checked in at 54.7 for July, easily topping views for 50. But the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index booked a 93.1 reading vs. the 94.1 consensus for July.

  Stock Market Falls Modestly But Small Caps, IBD 50 Lag; Benchmark Yield Tops This Key Level

The stock market continued to sleepwalk through a holiday-shortened week, although small caps and the IBD 50 had a rougher going Wednesday.




The Russell 2000 fell 1.3% and appears to be hitting resistance around the 1900 level. Wednesday's loss snapped a six-day win streak for the small-cap benchmark, the longest since January. Strength in the Russell has helped the stock market broaden its advance. So a new downturn for the index may affect market breadth.


The IBD 50 index also lagged, closing 0.9% lower.


Even the release of minutes from the June Fed meeting did little to arouse the stock market. Policymakers left intact the notion that they remain committed to additional rate hikes. And [some officials favored increasing rates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-supported-raising-rates-after-june-pause-7b525544?mod=hp_lead_pos1) in the June meeting, when the Fed voted to keep rates unchanged.


Odds for a quarter-point increase in the Fed funds rate at this month's Fed meeting remained near 90%, according to [CME Group's FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html).


The 10-year Treasury yield rose nearly 9 basis points to 3.94%, extending its advance once the Fed minutes came out at 2 p.m. ET. The benchmark yield rose above resistance around the 3.85% level. It is now at the highest point since March 9.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP070523-277x300.jpg)Rising yields caused the stock market to falter in the past. But since about the start of May, the 10-year note's yield and the major indexes have been rising roughly in tandem.


Indexes Steady
--------------


The main indexes were again quiet Wednesday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite each slipped around 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100, which represents the top portion of the composite, was nearly flat.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) closed near the 177.04 buy point of a cup-with-handle base.


Volume rose sharply on the NYSE and Nasdaq following a half-session Monday.


Defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate showed relative strength. The **Utilities Select Sector SPDR** ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) ETF led with a 1.1% increase.


**The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund** ([XLC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLC)) rose 0.8% to the highest point since April 2022. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) — up 2.9% Wednesday to the highest price since February 2022 — accounts for about 24% of the index. **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) class A and class C shares account for nearly 22%.


While those two companies are nearly half the index, Communications Services also includes defensive telecoms such as **T-Mobile** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)), **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)).


Stock Market Too Optimistic?
----------------------------


The major indexes have rid themselves of multiple [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) over the past several days, while holding most of their late June-July rebound.


For those reasons, IBD is recommending exposure of 80% to 100%. However investors should not go all-in on stocks. The Nasdaq 100, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 look extended from their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


The new Investors Intelligence survey of market newsletters found that bulls rebounded to 54.9% from 50.0% a week ago. Bearish advisors fell to 18.3%. That's the largest gap since November 2021, when the market started to roll over. Indeed, the market has been known to turn when investor sentiment is at extremes.


Breakouts are still working for the most part. Some of the most recent, however, are sputtering. **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) was the S&P 500's biggest loser, down 8% in heavy trading. The electric-generator maker fell slightly below the 141.54 buy point of last week's breakout.


As Jason Draho, head of Asset Allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, cautioned last week, it may not take much to bring out the bears.


"The Fed, the data, and the AI story all have to go right for equities to go higher, since the S&P 500 is already priced for a near-perfect landing, while anything going wrong could lead to a downturn," he said in a note to clients. "That leaves little margin for error if inflation and growth data aren't coming in consistent with a soft landing."


Economic Data For Stock Market
------------------------------


In economic news, May factory orders rose 0.9%, the [fifth increase in the past six months](https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/prel/pdf/s-i-o.pdf). It was also above the 0.3% increase economists expected, [according to Econoday](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559275&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top). It was the latest in a series of mixed reports for the manufacturing sector.


On Thursday, the weekly jobless claims and job openings reports are due out. Then Friday, the June employment report will be announced.


The Shanghai Composite fell 0.7%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index slid 1.6% Wednesday.


New data on Chinese economic activity [showed continued weakness](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-service-sector-activity-growth-cooled-in-june-caixin-pmi-shows-update-53fecd73?mod=mw_latestnews). China's nonmanufacturing PMI, which covers service and construction activity, fell in June to 53.2 from 54.5 in May. And the private Caixin services purchasing managers index dropped to 53.9 in June from 57.1 in May.


**IShares MSCI China ETF** ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) fell 0.8% on Wall Street, and **iShares China Large Cap ETF** ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) dropped 1.2%.


In Europe, the London FTSE 100 fell 1%, the Paris CAC 40 lost 0.8% and the German DAX closed 0.6% lower.

Six trading days and eight calendar days before historic U.S. elections take place, investors enjoyed a broad advance in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/). This time around, smaller issues occupied the vanguard.




A 1.5% rise by the S&P SmallCap 600 topped gains of 0.3% by both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. But the small cap index's move looked especially pleasant for another reason: The index hoisted nicely above not only the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) but also a shorter-term yet equally meaningful technical level, the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


How an index behaves around the shorter-term moving average weighs heavily on whether IBD is seeing a [power trend among indexes and top stocks today](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/market/marketschool). An Investor's Corner explains [how IBD defines a power trend in stocks today](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-power-trend/).


The Russell 2000, up 1.6% on Monday, also climbed bullishly above its own [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Growth Vs. Value
----------------


Just because small caps performed well, that alone does not mean value stocks are taking over growth.


For sure, the iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) exchange traded fund outperformed with a 0.6% gain vs. just a 0.2% nudge higher by iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)). However, IWF holds a better Relative Strength Rating (82 vs. 70 over a 12-month time frame).


How about since the critical follow-through day that took place on Nov. 1, 2023? Since that nearly year-ago date, IWF has proven superior, gaining 44.1% while IWD has moved up 29.45.


Stocks Today: Large Caps Fade
-----------------------------



Going back to the large-cap gauges, Monday's action got tarnished by the way they forfeited intraday gains later in the day.


The Nasdaq composite reached as high as 18,671, up as much as 0.8%. If the Nasdaq had actually closed at this session high, it would have eclipsed a July 10 all-time closing peak of 18,647.


In similar fashion, the S&P 500 didn't do a good job of keeping its intraday gain of 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed the Nasdaq and S&P 500, rising nearly 0.7%.


Volume fell more than 7% vs. Friday's session on the Nasdaq, Dow Jones Market Data reported. But on the NYSE, turnover climbed 5% to 3.69 billion shares. Therefore, one could argue that action on the S&P 500 mimicked a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/), or a rare form of distribution. Nonetheless, because the S&P 500 did not make a two-day high on Monday, it does not count as such.


Bank, industrial and consumer-oriented components within the Dow Jones industrials more than offset a 2.8% slide by **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) in the price-weighted index of blue chips.

![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102824-208x300.jpg)Despite the nice numbers in the key stock averages, investors in individual stocks today need to stay extra vigilant about two things: one, earnings; and two, sector rotation.


**Vista Energy** ([VIST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIST)) on Friday tried to break out of an amorphous [eight-week base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/) with a 52.47 buy point. The 8% rise on Friday came in hefty volume, a bullish sign of institutional buying. But amid a sell-off in crude oil and natural gas futures, Vista shares slipped 1.6% Monday and it failed to follow through on its breakout.


Aerospace stocks have also achieved marvelous gains this year. But as the Market Pulse highlights, a few leaders in the space did not participate in the rally.


**Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) sank further below its 50-day moving average with a 2% drop in active turnover. Gains from a breakout near 200 have been excellent, but it's imperative for investors to not let paper gains turn into dust.


The View From Bonds
-------------------


The yield on the key U.S. 10-year government bond rose for the fifth time in six sessions. On Monday, the yield increased more than four basis points to nearly 4.28%, the highest close since July 24.


On MarketSurge, punch in "0TNX" (zero-TNX) to see a graph of the 10-year yield based on Cboe market data.


"It's a little bit of 'Back to the Future,' " Rick Pitcairn, chairman and chief global strategist at the multifamily office firm Pitcairn near Philadelphia, told IBD in a recent interview. The firm has $8.3 billion in assets under management. By referring to the iconic film starring Michael J. Fox, Pitcairn referred to what prognosticators in bonds were thinking almost a year ago. Back in December 2023, bond traders bet on the Federal Reserve making as many six cuts of the fed funds rate by a quarter of one percentage point each over the next 12 months.


They proved to be wrong.


In September, the U.S. central bank made its first cut in rates in four years. The Fed reduced the fed funds rate by a half point to a range of 4.75%-5%. Next week on Nov. 7, when the Fed holds its penultimate meeting of the year on interest rates, just two days after the Nov. 5 elections, CME FedWatch's survey shows a 96% probability that the bank will trim rates by 25 basis points.


Another quarter-point drop in short-term rates is less of a done deal at the Dec. 18 final meeting of the year. But probabilities are high at 71% of the Fed taking the fed funds rate to a 4.25%-4.5% level.

How Interest Rates Could Impact Stocks Today
--------------------------------------------


Pitcairn points out that if the Fed has to frantically cut rates, it implies the economy is in trouble. Yet earnings have grown sharply among S&P 500 firms so far in 2024. So, "both cannot happen at once. We didn't get all those cuts, but we got better than expected growth," Pitcairn added. He also sees a strong likelihood that U.S. investors could get 15% earnings growth in 2025 along with a lower cost of borrowing money.


"I'm tempted to make the same mistake" regarding expectations of big profits and significant rate cuts, Pitcairn said. "I don't think the Federal Reserve is partisan, but they are political. That is, they want to be thought of well. It is rare for the bank to starting a rate-cutting cycle before the election."


For those who think interest rates on the long end of the curve could keep rising, take a look at Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3X ([TMV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMV)). The ETF is designed to move three times the inverse move in the interest rates of long-term bonds. On Monday, the ETF rose 0.8% to 35.09 and spent its sixth session in a row above its now slightly-rising 200-day moving average.


Besides earnings, Friday's nonfarm payrolls report might have a pronounced impact on bond prices and yields.


[According to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), economists on consensus see just 125,000 net new jobs created in October, well down from a gain of 254,000 jobs in September. Forecasters see the jobless rate staying at 4.1%. Keep in mind that in recent years, revisions to the government data can get quite large.

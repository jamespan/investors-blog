The stock market served up a strange leadership mix for the week, as semiconductors, data storage and gold mining stocks posted strong gains.




The Nasdaq popped 1.3% Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials added 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. Small caps as gauged by the Russell 2000 rose 1.3%.


Volume grew on both major exchanges compared with the previous session.


At first glance, the mix of tech and gold mining stocks seems like an odd combination.

But there's another way to look at the week's leadership.


What The Gold Play Means
------------------------


If an investor regards gold miners as more of a merger-acquisition play, then the week's leadership has more coherence. (**Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) has made a bid to acquire **Goldcorp** ([GG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GG)). **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) completed its merger with Randgold on Jan. 2. Rumors abound of additional mergers in the space.)


Mergers can give big players access to the smaller players' unrealized potential. And it can give small players the big-money reach of the larger player.


The result can make for a more growth-oriented company.


In other words, the week's strange combination isn't so strange from a growth perspective. And bulls love it when tech and growth stocks take control.


Signs Of Rotation
-----------------


Going into Friday's session, investors were seeing early signs of sector rotation.


The interesting part is that the leadership is shared and broad, so far. Nine sectors are up about 7% this year, including electronics, energy, banks, software, finance, transportation, chips, S&Ls and retail.


Admittedly this is early to be identifying leaders. But if the trend holds and grows, the stock market could be looking at a rally with many players. What bull wouldn't like that?


Meanwhile, the restaurant group has plenty of items on the investing menu. Bulls like to see strength in restaurants because it points to a confident consumer.


Eleven restaurant stocks carry Relative Strength Ratings of 91 or better. A rating of 91 puts a stock in the top 9% of stocks. On Friday, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) rose 3.6%, while **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) added 1.9% and 2.6%, respectively.



Shutdown Lifted For 3 Weeks
---------------------------


President Donald Trump and the Democrats reached an agreement to lift the government shutdown for three weeks. The market showed little reaction, perhaps with the knowledge that the standoff is delayed but not solved.

The stock market ended Friday's session mixed as indexes closed off early highs amid signs of consumer weakness. Now a fresh inflation reading and retail sales data are due.




The Nasdaq composite closed nominally lower, but was essentially flat. It notched a solid weekly upturn of 1.1%, its third successive week of gains. The tech-heavy index pulled away from the important [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and is now up 8.9% for the year.


The S&P 500 managed to post a slender advance of 0.2% Friday. Its weekly climb was a more substantial 1.9%, and it now has jumped 1.5% above the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The benchmark index is ahead of the Nasdaq, thanks to a 9.5% hike so far in 2024.


Decliners held the edge over advancers on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq exchange Friday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its win streak to eight days as it turned in a 0.3% gain. Blue chips notched a 2.2% increase for the week and are up 4.8% for the year. **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) led the upside here while sportswear giant **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) lagged.


Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.7%. Despite this, it still managed to end the week back above its 50-day line. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund ended near lows for the day as it sank 0.1%.


Gains Fade On Consumer Survey; CPI Inflation Data Looms
-------------------------------------------------------


A promising open on the stock market faded following release of the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers sentiment index for May. It fell nearly 10 points to 67.4, well below economist expectations for 76. And its one-year inflation outlook popped to 3.5%, the highest level since last November.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP051024.jpg)"Today's lower-than-expected consumer sentiment numbers are a warning sign that the consumer shouldn't be taken for granted," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, in a note to clients. "In addition, inflation expectations have been rising as well, which is a double whammy for the Fed."


There will be a bevy of economic data reports in the coming week. On Tuesday the latest Producer Price Index reading is due. But Wednesday looks like the key day, with the expected release of April's Consumer Price Index data and retail sales data for April. Headline CPI is seen rising 3.4% year over year while the core reading, which strips out food and energy, is expected to rise 3.6%.


Investors also will keep an eye on the latest initial jobless claims reading due Thursday to see if the past week's upside surprise is the start of a more substantial trend.


There will be some major retail names [reporting earnings in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/walmart-stock-near-highs-earnings-on-holding-earnings/), including Dow Jones components **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)). Another Dow member, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), and **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) are among other noteworthy names posting results.


These Stock Market Groups Fare Best
-----------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors closed mixed Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Consumer staples, a defensive area, and technology made the best gains while energy and consumer discretionary lagged.


Investor's Business Daily industry groups offered a deeper insight into Friday's trading.


Computer networking stocks, integrated telecom services companies, telecom infrastructure firms and metal products distributors were among the best performers.


On the flip side, office supply retailers, educational software plays, generic drug firms and database software firms all underperformed.

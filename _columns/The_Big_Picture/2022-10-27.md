The stock market ended sharply mixed Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished with moderate gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off, as tech giant **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) crumbled on weaker-than-expected earnings results.




**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reported earnings late Thursday. [Amazon shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amzn-stock-falls-on-earnings-report/) dived almost 20% in extended trade, while [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-iphone-maker-beats-fiscal-q4-goals/) fell about 1%. Nasdaq 100 futures were sharply lower in response.


Amid a stock market rally that is showing signs of hesitation, three recent breakouts from **Aehr Test Systems** ([AEHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEHR)), **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)) and **Vertex****Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) triggered sell rules Thursday, while **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) and **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) are two top stocks to buy and watch.


Economic Data, Treasury Yields
------------------------------


U.S. GDP (gross domestic product) and first-time jobless claims came out early Thursday. GDP rose 2.6% in the third quarter, topping the 2.3% estimate and up from a 0.6% decline in the second quarter. Initial unemployment claims rose to 217,000 vs. 214,000 in the previous week, slightly below estimates. A strong economy gives the Federal Reserve room to keep raising interest rates.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MP102722-249x300.jpg)The 10-year Treasury yield closed at 3.93% Thursday, settling below 4% for the first time since Oct. 18. The yield is set to snap a 12-week win streak.


Q3 Earnings Season Continues
----------------------------


The news of the day was Meta's meltdown, as shares crumbled more than 24% to hit their lowest level since February 2016. Late Wednesday, Meta [reported third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-falls-on-third-quarter-report/) that missed earnings estimates but slightly beat on revenue. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.64 a share on revenue of $27.7 billion. Analysts expected Meta to report earnings of $1.90 a share on revenue of $27.4 billion, according to FactSet.


Other key earnings movers for Thursday were Dow Jones stocks **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), along with **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and **Wolfspeed** ([WOLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOLF)).


CAT stock jumped 7.7%, McDonald's rallied 3.3% and [Merck](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/merck-stock-merck-earnings-q3-2022/) climbed 1.4%. [Ford shares](https://www.investors.com/news/gm-earnings-ford-earnings-q3-2022/) rose 1.6%. O'Reilly shares moved up 4.6%. [ServiceNow stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/stock-servicenow-servicenow-earnings-now-stock-q32022/) surged 13.4%. Shopify popped 17.3%, while [WOLF stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/wolfspeed-stock-tumbles-after-chipmaker-guides-low/) plunged 18%.


Investors should continue to track companies that handily beat earnings results and have strong upside reactions, like Enphase Energy, which was [Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/enph-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-enphase/). They could be among the stock market's leaders if the market is able to shrug off its recent losses and move higher.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.6%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 1.6%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 inched higher.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, and also appeared to be lower on the NYSE. Lower volume means the Nasdaq avoids a second consecutive distribution day.


Top growth stocks ended with moderate losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF fell 0.4%. The ETF snapped a four-day win streak. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Murphy USA** ([MUSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUSA)) rallied 5.55%, breaking out past a 303.19 buy point in a flat base.


Stock Market Rally Struggles
----------------------------


After two straight days of heavy selling on the Nasdaq, the young stock market uptrend is clearly struggling to gain traction.


The market is still in a confirmed uptrend, so investors have the green light to buy strong breakouts. However, given the precarious action seen in recent sessions, and after a few failed follow-through days earlier this year, it's logical to keep exposure limited until the overall stock market environment improves.


As IBD continues to recommend, limit long exposure in both the general stock market and in top stocks to a range of 20% to 40% of a portfolio.

3 Recent Breakouts Trigger Sell Rules
-------------------------------------


Aehr Test Systems briefly gave up the entirety of a 19% advance from a 19.53 buy point during Thursday's session. The breakout's weakness triggered the [round-trip sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-winning-stock-plummets-round-trip-sell-rule/#:~:text=Finally%2C%20there's%20the%20round%2Dtrip,all%20gains%20are%20wiped%20away.). According to this rule, investors should sell the growth stock if it falls back near the buy point after it has made a gain of more than 10%. Try to sell before all gains are wiped away.




Shockwave Medical hit the [7%-8% loss rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 315 buy point during Thursday's 8% tumble. The stock is also breaking down below its key [50-day support level](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), which is another reason to back away from the stock and play defense. Earnings are due out Nov. 7. Strong results could spark another upside move but could also be a risk. Despite the stock's failed breakout, Shockwave has been a strong leader in recent months, so it is a stock to continue to monitor.


Vertex Pharmaceuticals also closed below its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) Thursday, sliding 7.5%. Shares ended just shy of triggering the [7%-8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) Thursday. With [quarterly earnings results after the close](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vrtx-stock-vertex-earnings-q3-2022/), it is dangerous to hold a stock through earnings with no profit cushion, much less a solid loss on the position.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Enphase, Dycom
---------------------------------------


Enphase Energy is approaching a [cup base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) 324.94 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Be on the lookout for a potential handle to offer a lower entry. Meanwhile, the stock's relative strength line is just off new highs.


The company is a leading provider of solar microinverters and battery systems. Microinverters boost solar energy production, improve reliability in solar energy systems and support intelligent energy management.


Dycom is just shy of a cup base's 120.55 entry and Thursday's slight decline could be the start of a handle.


Dycom provides engineering, construction, project management and other services to the telecom and utility industries. Their operations stretch across 49 states and over 39 operating companies.

Stocks Reverse Higher, And Why This Index Is The One To Watch Right Now
========================================================================

Stocks reversed higher Tuesday in a clearer sign that indexes are rebounding from their latest pullback.




Major indexes opened lower but almost immediately started to rebound. The rally stalled after midday, but indexes still closed near session highs.


The Nasdaq climbed 0.6%, and it's the index with the most to offer in terms of reading market direction. The composite pulled back last week near its 50-day moving average. After a couple of days of reluctant bottoming, the index Tuesday appeared more willing to resume its advance.


Although it didn't quite touch the 50-day average, the Nasdaq is behaving similarly to its pullbacks in late July and mid-August. The index made moderate rebounds from both. On a weekly chart, the index is finding support at the 10-week moving average, which is a positive sign.

Nasdaq volume rose, although it didn't take much to increase trading after Monday's Rosh Hashana holiday. Nasdaq's breadth, however, was curiously soft. [Decliners led advancers by 15-to-13](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/most-active.aspx). On the NYSE winners led slightly over losers.


One reason for the weaker Nasdaq breadth was the fact that semiconductor stocks were broadly weaker. The Philadelphia semiconductor index's 1% drop erased almost all of Monday's 1.1% gain. IBD's chip equipment and chipmaker industry groups were down 1.2% and 1%, respectively. Chip designers fell a more modest 0.5%. Strength in internet and other tech stocks helped offset the decline in chips.


Another salient weak spot was small caps. The Russell 2000 added less than 0.1%. It was difficult to pin down the reason, with no single sector showing exceptional weakness among small caps.


Energy stocks led as the price of crude oil jumped nearly 3% to $69.43 a barrel. Oil followed a 2% spike in gasoline futures as [Hurricane Florence tracked toward the Carolinas](https://www.weather.gov/wrn/florence) with Category 4 winds. Millions of residents are evacuating the area before it makes landfall Thursday, and the hurricane is expected to cause widespread flooding and power outages.


The hurricane also caused home improvement chains **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) to rise to new highs in active trading.


Generator manufacturer **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) [followed through on Monday's breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/hurricane-florence-generac-stock-home-depot-lowes/), gaining another 1%. The Carolinas are a major tobacco-growing area, and tobacco was one of Tuesday's top industry groups, up 2.1%.


Leading stocks were mainly positive. [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 0.9%. It outperformed thanks largely to **Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)), which gapped up 11% on confirmation of a buyout. Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics will acquire IDT in a deal worth $6.7 billion, or $49 a share in cash.


The majority of [IBD 50 stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) are extended from breakouts, and about a dozen are up enough that they could reasonably start forming new bases. In other words, there's a good chunk of leaders with stretched advances and they need to be watched for signs of fatigue.


At the same time, there's another dozen stocks in the IBD 50 that are [forming new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) or [are in buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). Those, which include **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) and **Old Dominion Freight Lines** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)), may provide the next phase of leadership.


Despite the index gains and strength in leading stocks, there were no convincing breakouts on Tuesday. The few top-rated stocks topping buy points showed weak price action, lower volume or both.

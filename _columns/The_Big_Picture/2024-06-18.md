  Stock Market Holds Strong Despite Weak Retail Sales; Nvidia, Arm Hit Fresh Milestones

The stock market shrugged off weaker-than-expected retail sales data Tuesday as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite edged higher and marked all-time closing highs.




The Nasdaq composite rose fractionally, while the S&P 500 added nearly 0.3%. Volume was close to Monday's light levels ahead of the Juneteenth holiday. U.S. financial markets will be closed Wednesday.


The Nasdaq is closing in on the 18,000 level, a round number that's a potential resistance level — although the Nasdaq didn't have any problems when it gapped above the 16,000 level on May 3 and the 17,000 level on June 5. Still, the composite is now 8.2% above its 50-day moving average, a level the Nasdaq hit nearly one year ago on July 19, just before it made a 9% pullback.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rose to another all-time high and surpassed **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) as Wall Street's largest company by market capitalization. Nvidia is quite extended after a torrid run; it's now more than 13% above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


AI chip designer **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) jumped 8.6% to an all-time high. Arm closed above a 164 entry after attempting that earlier in the week. A quick look at Arm's weekly chart shows six up weeks in a row, and another one taking shape this week. At this point, it's best to wait for pullback rather than chase the stock, which is already above a buy range that goes to 172.20.


The same could be said for **Hilton** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)), which also broke out and topped a 215.79 entry from a flat base. But after nine gains in 11 trading sessions, mostly in light turnover, Hilton could be ready to take a breather.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added just over 0.1% as the blue-chip index holds near its 10-, 21- and 50-day moving averages. The Russell 2000 added nearly 0.2% after Monday's upside reversal, but the small-cap index closed near its session low and is still stuck below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by about 4-to-3. The Nasdaq's advance/decline has been on a downtrend for about a month. Over on the NYSE, winners beat losers by about 4-to-3. Weakening Nasdaq breadth is a yellow flag.


Bond Yields Pressured
---------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield fell 6 basis points to around 4.22% after monthly retail sales missed expectations. May retail sales edged higher by 0.1% month over month, but that was below the 0.3% increase in economists' consensus forecast. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.1%, also below the 0.3% consensus. April data was revised lower.

After slumping nearly 22 basis points last week, the 10-year yield is basically flat this week. Interest rates have come under pressure as bond investors worry about a sharper-than-expected slowdown for the economy.


**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) led the data storage industry group to a gain of nearly 2%. The maker of memory and storage products reports earnings next week. For the May-ended quarter, revenue growth is expected to accelerate from Q2, rising 77% to nearly $6.7 billion. Micron is quite extended after a breakout from a large base during the week ended March 1. It's also extended from a cup-base breakout at 130.54.


IBD's chip-equipment group continued its winning ways, up another 1.8%. **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), one of several top performers in the group, continues hold gains well after joining [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) on June 5. The position was raised Tuesday.


ELF Breaks Out
--------------


**ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), another member of Leaderboard, soared past a 202.58 handle entry, helped by positive comments and a price-target hike from Canaccord Genuity.


With a large number of extended stocks out there, it's getting difficult to find new buys. Some industry group leaders like biotech **Blueprint Medicines** ([BPMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BPMC)) are setting up in new bases. Other strong performers like **Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) are finding support at their 50-day lines.


The IBD Market Pulse graphic recommends exposure at 80%-100%. Favoring the 80% side makes sense at this point, with Nasdaq breadth as weak as it is and the Nasdaq more than 8% above its 50-day moving average.


For perspective, Leaderboard ended the day about 77% invested, not including a short position in **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) that has worked so far.

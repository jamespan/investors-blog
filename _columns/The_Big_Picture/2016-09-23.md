Stocks Down, But Enthusiasm Sparks Up For M&A, New IPOs
========================================================

Stocks fell Friday, but **Apple's** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) pullback and the broad decline couldn't stop the major indexes from posting solid gains for the week.


The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both fell close to 0.6%, finishing near session lows. Small caps fared no better; the Russell 2000 slid 0.7%.


Apple sank 1.7% in volume that climbed 39% above its 50-day average. Yet the iPhone and iPad firm is still holding comfortably above a new breakout point at 110.33. In other words, the pullback appears normal so far.
The Nasdaq still ended more than 1% higher for a second straight week.

While the market was likely due for a rest, the lower turnover on both sides was positive for the bulls, suggesting that institutions weren't so inclined to ditch stocks heavily ahead of the weekend. Next week, watch to see if the 500 shows sticky action near its 50-day moving average.


Unlike Apple, which still tips the market valuation scales at $607 billion, small- and midcap leaders showed quiet action following strong recent runs. **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)) (June 2010 IPO), **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)) (August 2015) and **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) (June 2014) all declined in thin trade Friday.


Hence, the market uptrend is still intact. Still, keep a sharp eye out for new bouts of strong institutional selling in the coming week. The distribution-day count on the Nasdaq has simmered to just three over the past 25 sessions, yet all three were sharp declines at -0.8% (Aug. 24), -2.5% (Sept. 9) and -1.1% (Sept. 13).


The markets got dampened by a summary sell-off in the energy sector. Frustration over OPEC's inability to coordinate a serious cutback in production sent the oil futures pit into a selling frenzy. West Texas Intermediate crude near-term futures sank more than 3% to $44.88 a barrel.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, six of the eight worst-performing industry groups all came from the oil and gas patch including drilling, U.S. exploration and production, and field services.


The market seemed to contract two different types of fever: the first could be called "M&A syndrome," stimulated by cheap money; the second, "IPO-hyperitis," can reflect over-enthusiasm by the investment bankers. Of course, new IPOs are essential. Fresh bull markets need a crop of fresh new growth companies.


The IPO market suggests institutional greed is still intact. **Bats Global** ([BATS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BATS)) surged more nearly 20% to 31.80, gapping up past a 29.11 entry point on news that it may be looking for a suitor. November 2013 IPO **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) soared 21% to a year-to-date closing high of 22.62 following reports that it may hitch with another big Silicon Valley tech firm.


But don't buy new issues prematurely.


 Web ad specialist **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) shows why you must look for a base to form, even in fresh-from-the-oven IPOs. IPO bases are high-risk as they can form in as little as seven sessions.
IBD research has found that they serve as a launchpad to rocketlike breakouts and a fury of new highs.


Trade Desk had a stunning Wednesday debut, closing at 30.10, up 67% from its initial public offering at 18 a share. Yet it's dived hard the past two sessions, finishing Friday at 27.66.

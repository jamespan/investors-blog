  Dow Jones Falls As Stock Market Bears Feast; These Stocks Suffer As Recession Fears Rise

The stock market fought its way off lows late but still closed lower amid rising recession fears.




The Nasdaq composite fell by the biggest margin out of the major indexes but closed at session highs. Nevertheless, it slid 0.9% for the day and plunged 5.5% for the week. It has now fallen in four of the past five weeks.


Since getting turned away near its 200-day moving average, the index has swan-dived below all its main moving averages. It is now down nearly 28% so far in 2022.


The S&P 500 also fought back late to close with a loss of 0.7%. Nevertheless, it fell for the week in above-average volume and sits 5.5% below its 50-day moving average.


Adding further gloom to the picture is the fact volume ran higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Friday was a quadruple witching day, which clouds the picture with so much extra trading.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was also disappointing. Only the defensive consumer staples and real estate areas turned in gains, which were meager at best.

If the Dow Jones continues to fall it could be the first major index to test its June lows.


IBD 50 Tumbles Nearly 3%
------------------------


The bears also had their way with small caps, with the Russell 2000 diving 1.5%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 2.8% as its energy stocks took hits.


A warning from **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) that the economy is about to enter a "worldwide recession" has added to rising fears about a painful economic contraction.



This raises the stakes ahead of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday. Interest rates are widely expected to rise by 75 basis points, but guidance from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could either unlock a rally or lead to further losses.

Stock Market Outlook Changes Amid Gloom
---------------------------------------


With the major indexes falling away from their major moving averages amid a bevy of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), IBD's market outlook has now changed to "market in correction." This was the worst week for the market since June.


The performance of the IBD industry groups was once again illuminating on Friday.



The airfreight group, which is dominated by FedEx and **United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)), fared worst, with paper products and transportation logistics plays also struggling.


FedEx stock plunged 21.4% — its largest loss ever — while UPS dropped 4.5% in sympathy, invalidating a cup-with-handle base.


On the upside, there was a notable defensive bent. Wholesale food plays, homebuilders and discount and variety retailers were among the top performers.

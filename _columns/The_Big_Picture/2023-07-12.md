Some pundits like to say, there's always a bull market somewhere in the world.




Perhaps the next question could be this: Can there be more than one bull market — in not only stocks, but in other markets of speculation?


Investors not only witnessed more evidence on Wednesday that a [March 29 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-leads-bullish-turn-in-stock-market-but-still-must-clear-these-potential-pitfalls/) — as highlighted by IBD's Big Picture column that same day — proved that institutions have been deploying more cash into stocks. They also saw rallies in the government bond and commodity arenas as well.


Meanwhile, it may be worthwhile to continue comparing how the bull market in the U.S. fares with emerging rallies across both oceans. On that end, among the developed nations, only the Japan equity markets really offer true rivalry so far this year.


 


[Lighter-than-expected gains in consumer prices in June](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-slides-to-3-easing-fed-fears-sp-500-futures-rally/), including core prices that strip out volatile energy and food items, set up a solid rally from the get-go. Indexes faded some after a couple hours of trading. By day's end, the finish for some indexes was mixed and better for tech stocks.


As a result, the Nasdaq closed with a gain of nearly 1.2%. At one point, it reached 13,963, good for an almost 1.5% advance. This intraday price represented a 5% rally since the close of the [June 9 stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/), a rare form of distribution. Hence, the distribution-day count on the Nasdaq fell to three over the past 25 sessions.


The S&P 500, up 0.7%, also knocked out a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to a 5% rally. At its session high of 4488, the June 7 sell-off in higher NYSE turnover lost relevance. Volume rose on both exchanges.


So, as the Market Pulse table highlights, the distribution count has diminished to a manageable level.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed only a gain of less than 0.3%. Dow Jones component **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) fell 11 points in volume that ran double usual levels. That's exactly the opposite of what you want to see in a stock.



UNH has clearly traced a path of lower highs and lower lows after failing to rise above persistent upside resistance near 550.


The health insurance behemoth also reaffirms a timeless lesson for growth investors: Avoid averaging down in a stock. You don't want to chase a stock lower. Let a stock prove it's worthy of receiving more of your hard-earned capital.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP071223-186x300.jpg)In contrast, small caps strengthened. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF made it four gains in a row on Wednesday, rising 1.1%. It's now gained almost 5% over that time span.


Meanwhile, please notice how Wednesday's Market Pulse is not simply a calling card of tech stocks.


Included in the list: a fast growing fast-casual eatery chain serving Mediterranean fare; a foreign language app; a U.S. homebuilder; a global financial database provider; an innovative platform for automating the purchase of ads on internet and other media channels; and a Mexico-based explorer of oil and gas in Latin America.


Looking at market internals, breadth continued to expand.


Early data showed winners top losers by a nearly 2-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and close to 3-to-1 on the NYSE.


U.S. Vs. The World
------------------


Since Jan. 1, the gain in the S&P 500 is currently at 16.5%. Performance has been a motley affair among the popular U.S. gauges. After a dreadful 2022, in which the Nasdaq composite fell 33%, it's reversed fortunes nicely with a 33% gain so far this year. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials are lagging severely, up a comparably paltry 3.6%.


The IBD Mutual Fund Index, a proxy for active management among pros, holds a 14.5% gain year-to-date. So, it's mildly underperforming the 500. Monitor this index's performance by viewing the General Market Indicators PDF page, which is a link at the bottom of each day's The Big Picture.


Over in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed its Wednesday session at 31,943, up 22.4% since Jan. 1 and now 18% below its all-time peak of 38,915 set on Dec. 29, 1989. That's not a misprint — it's been more than 33 years and Japan's benchmark index for stocks has yet to eclipse its all-time high.


The Shanghai Composite, at 3196, is up just 3.5% year-to-date. Over in Latin America, Argentina's hyper-volatile S&P Merval index finished Wednesday up 2.1% to 431,551, a 114% advance for the year, according to Dow Jones Markets Data. Mexico's IPC, at 53,956, holds a much more sober 11.3% gain and Brazil's Bovespa, at 117,666, has tacked on 7.2% over the same time frame.


The Stoxx Europe 600 index finished Wednesday at 458.54, moving up 7.9% year-to-date.

Beyond the Bull Market In Stocks
--------------------------------


While the likelihood of a new quarter-point hike in interest rates at the next Federal Reserve meeting on July 25-26 has not changed (currently at 92%), the probability of another increase later in the year fell sharply on Wednesday.


For instance, the CME Group's FedWatch survey of bond traders now shows a 14.8% chance that the Fed will raise the fed funds rate to a 5.5%-5.75% target range in late September. In November, that chance rises to 27.4%, but that's still down from 36.2% just a day ago.


Ed Yardeni, veteran economist and head of institutional research firm Yardeni.com, told CNBC during a lunchtime interview in New York on Wednesday that he's continuing to see more signs that the U.S. economy is shifting from a "rolling recession" to a "rolling expansion." Plus, Yardeni believes the market will soon see a trough in the growth rate of earnings among S&P 500 firms. One reason? Yardeni thinks the latest "earnings recession" is not due to shrinking revenues, but depressed margins. But as companies innovate and employ more technologies to boost efficiency, those margins could in fact expand again.


On Wednesday, a sharp drop in the yields of long-dated U.S. government bonds helped support the action in stocks. Why? A couple reasons. One, investors who bought Treasury securities showed confidence that the Fed is getting closer to reaching the peak of its monetary tightening cycle. This means the cost of borrowing money to make acquisitions or other strategic investments won't be rising too heavily in the near term. Stable interest rates make it easier for corporations to plan future share buybacks, too.


The yield on the key 10-year Treasury bond fell 11 basis points to 3.86%. That marked its third straight decline. Yields fall when bond investors bid up prices because the interest rate paid out to bondholders, or the coupon, stays constant.

Bond Yields Moving
------------------


A second reason why a rally in Treasurys would be good for the bull market in stocks? It reflects investor confidence in the overall economy.


"The bond market finally got relief from inflation it was hoping for," Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates, commented in an email sent to IBD. "The inverted yield curve had become more of an indication the inflation relief was coming than anything else. Even the stubborn core CPI declined meaningfully from 5.3% year over year to 4.8%. We expect the yield curve inversion to lessen as investors digest the significance of today's data."


According to U.S. Treasury data, the yield on the 2-year bond has fallen from 4.94% at the start of July to 4.72% on Wednesday, vs. the 10-year bond staying put at 3.86% since July 3. Three-month T-bills have inched up in yield by only 3 basis points over the same time frame to 5.47%. The fed funds rate currently holds a target range of 5%-5.25%.


Watch Oil And Copper, Too
-------------------------


Meanwhile, commodities showed a little more mojo. It's of course likely too early to call it a bull market in these areas of speculation. But still worth watching closely.


In the futures market, light sweet crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 1.2% to $75.75 a barrel. That marked the eighth up day in 10 sessions. According to Dow Jones Market Data, Nymex crude is now up 13.5% from its year-to-date settlement low of $66.74. Crude oil is also up 7.2% for the month, but still down 5.6% year to date.


The United States Copper Index ([CPER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPER)) exchange traded fund rallied 2.2% to 23.77, and volume jumped vs. the prior session. Normally, IBD does not call follow-through days in commodity markets.



But the daily chart of CPER highlights another bullish aspect: The fund gapped up over its key moving averages, including the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Another reason why the bull market may in fact stick around a little longer than skeptics may think? Check out the [IBD Sector Leaders list](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). This automated screen is the most stringent in terms of fundamental, technical and institutional sponsorship factors.


Names To Watch In This Bull Market
----------------------------------


Headed into Wednesday's action, [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) showed nine companies that span a pretty wide band of industries.


On a price weighted basis, the Sector Leaders are outperforming the S&P 500 by nearly 500 basis points (up 19.6% for the former, up 14.8% for the latter).

==========================================

Wall Street took another shellacking Monday as China stocks plunged overnight. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallied furiously off session lows soon after the open, but it didn't take long for sellers to regain the upper hand.

  

At the close, the S&P 500 skidded 3.9%, the Nasdaq fell 3.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 3.6%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq spiked sharply from Friday, an impressive feat since volume was unusually heavy at the end of the week due to options expirations.

  

It was another day of institutional selling for the major averages, and another day of milestones for world markets â€” many of them not good.

  

The Shanghai composite slumped 8.5%, its worst one-day percentage loss since 2007, while markets in Germany, Paris and London fell around 5%.

  

The Nasdaq's 8.8% intraday decline was its ninth worst on record. The index tumbled 9% on May 6, 2010, the day of the flash crash. Its worst percentage occurred soon after tech stocks topped in 2000, with a 13.6% plunge on April 4.

  

On the NYSE, declining stocks swamped advancers by about 20 to 1. On the Nasdaq, losers topped winners by 9 to 1.

  

The IBD 50 lost 3.7%, in line with the broad market.

  

Crude oil lost $2.21, or 5.5%, to settle at $38.24 a barrel. It slid to $37.75 a barrel at one point, a 6-1/2-year low. Oil has been savaged in recent months, initially due to concerns about oversupply. Worries about China's economy are now in play as well.

  

Money flowed into bonds again as the yield on the 10-year note slumped 4 basis points to 2%. The yield has cratered 32 basis points since the July 22 market close.

  

Clearly the bond market is jittery about something. Is it really all about slowing growth in China, or is it also worried about the Fed and what effect upcoming interest rate hikes will have on the U.S. economy?

  

China has more room to stimulate its economy. The People's Bank of China has already cut its benchmark lending rate four times since November. It last reduced it by 25 basis points to 4.85% at the end of June. So far, the rate cuts haven't spurred an economic recovery.

  

China roiled world markets this month when it devalued its currency to boost exports.

  

But Wall Street also could be pricing in some softness in coming quarters for the U.S. economy, even though recent economic data have generally had more good news than bad.

  

Early last week, housing sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders hit its highest level since 2005. Earlier in the month, July retail sales reflected a more confident consumer. But the recent Fed minutes showed that FOMC members still want to see more healing in the labor market. The economy created 215,000 jobs in July, with upward revisions to May and June job growth.

  

Fed fund futures showed less optimism about a rate hike at the September meeting than they were last week. A separate Fed tracker, CME Group FedWatch, has the odds of a rate hike at the September meeting at 24%, lower than it was before the sell-off started.

  

A weak dollar tends to boost oil prices, but that hasn't been the case lately. The U.S. dollar index lost another 1.5% Monday, bringing its four-day decline to 3.8%.

  

Rampant fear has also been seen at market bottoms, and there's been plenty of it lately. It was in plain sight Friday as the put/call ratio spiked to 1.48 to its highest level since early 2008. It registered a reading of 1.35 Monday. Last week, the CBOE volatility index surged 118% for the week. On Monday, it crossed the 50 level for first time since February 2009. It ended at 40.74, up 45%. Keep in mind that plus-50 readings for the VIX don't necessarily signal a bottom is near.

  

Last week, the latest Investors Intelligence data showed bullish newsletter writers down to 37.7% from 40.2%. Nearly one year ago, right around the market bottom, bullish sentiment was at 35.3%.

  

Strength in the S&P 500 was hard to find, but food stocks held up well, including **Whole Foods Market** ([WFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFM)), **Sysco** ([SYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYY)) and **J.M. Smucker** ([SJM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SJM)).

  

Among the day's movers, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) closed well off its low after a 13% intraday plunge. Apple started to rally after Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an email to CNBC's Jim Cramer, saying "Apple has continued to experience strong growth in China through July and August. Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks."

  

Apple chip supplier **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) ended higher after early weakness.

  

Technical damage done to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in recent days will likely take some time to repair, and it will also take time for new leadership to take shape. But also keep in mind that market bottoms can be put in quickly and when they're least expected.

The stock market saw early gains evaporate as the bears took control Friday. More inflation data and a slew of tech earnings will be among the areas to watch in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite touched an all-time high in morning trading but ended the session down 1.2%. With a loss of more than 1% for the week, the composite's 2024 gain is 7.2%.


The S&P 500 also suffered a bearish reversal, as the index fell nearly 0.7%. It lost 0.3% for the week and remains 4% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). It's up 7.4% for the year.


Advancers actually held a slight edge on decliners on the New York Stock Exchange while honors were roughly even on the Nasdaq exchange. The Nasdaq shed the Feb. 5, 13 and 20 distribution days due to [the 5% rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-forecast-index-tops/). But Friday's loss in higher volume gave it a new distribution day, for a total of four. Higher NYSE volume also gave the S&P 500 a distribution day.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up better than the other major indexes, but still fell 0.2%. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) hurt the Dow with a 4.6% tumble.


Small caps fell less than other indexes, with the Russell 2000 off 0.1%. But the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) closed 0.7% lower after rising as much as 2.3%.


In a bearish move that could impact the broad market, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) — one of the strongest stocks of the year so far — reversed badly lower after hitting new heights. It ended the day down 5.6%.


Jobs Report Boost Fades, Inflation Data Looms
---------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP030824-.jpg)Initially the stock market rallied following the release of the [latest jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-february-unemployment-rate-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/). The U.S. economy added 275,000 jobs in February, above views. However, the unemployment rate rose to 3.9% from 3.7% in January, its first increase in four months.


There is some more key economic data due to drop in the coming week. The latest Consumer Price Index is due to be released on Tuesday. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress during the week that he believes rates are likely at their peak, so positive data here could bolster the case for cuts to happen sooner rather than later.


In addition, U.S. retail sales are set to be released on Thursday, a key reading on the consumer mindset. The Empire State manufacturing survey for March is expected Friday.


Some key tech earnings are also expected in the week ahead. **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **Jabil** ([JBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBL)) are among those set to post quarterly reports.


Stock Market Sectors Impress As Nvidia Reverses
-----------------------------------------------


A majority of the [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday in the red](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). The defensive utilities and real estate sectors as well as the energy sector rose on the day. In contrast, technology and consumer discretionary had tough sessions.



The discount chains industry group suffered following disappointing **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) results.

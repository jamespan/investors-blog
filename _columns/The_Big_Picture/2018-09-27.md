U.S. stock indexes advanced Thursday with highly rated stocks leading the way.




The Nasdaq climbed 0.6%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Small caps stalled as the S&P 600 closed just under flat.


Volume was lower on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data. The lower volume disappointed the bulls.


Lower volume suggests funds are not fully participating.

The major indexes sent mixed messages on recent resistance areas. The Nasdaq crossed back above the 8,000 level it has battled recently. The S&P 500 closed under the 2,916 high of late August, an area that has been an obstacle.


On Thursday, the [FANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) perked up. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) rose 1.1%; **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), 1.9%; **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), up 0.7%; and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), 1.1%.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which is sometimes included with the four FANG stocks, popped 2%. JPMorgan initiated coverage on Apple with [a bullish recommendation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-jpmorgan-buy-rating/).


Volume was initially strong for all five stocks but then faded to below average for each.


Internet Stocks
---------------


The internet stocks also had a fairly good day. **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) tacked on 1.5%. **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) added 1%.


Among online retailers, **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) popped 2.2%. Handmade goods seller **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) added 2.2%. Latin America's **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) battled 2.8% higher.


With the exception of MercadoLibre, which showed above-average volume, trade was slow for the other internet-related stocks.


Blue chips winners led losers by a 7-to-2 ratio in the 30-component Dow. Apple scored the best gain, while plastics and chemicals company **DowDuPont** ([DWDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DWDP)) lost 2.3%.


In the meantime, combined (NYSE plus Nasdaq) new lows continued a recent trend of outnumbering combined new highs, a bearish trend if it continues. So far, adjusted new lows have held the upper hand each day this week.


IBD's adjusted new highs/new lows list doesn't include stocks under 10 a share or under 60 in Earnings Per Share Rating.


The Day's Economic Statistics
-----------------------------


The third reading on Q2 GDP came in at 4.2%, a tick below the 4.3% consensus estimate.


Initial jobless claims scored 214,000, about even with the expected 215,000.


Durable goods orders offered a Rorschach test, letting bulls and bears see what they are prone to see.


For the bulls, durable goods orders roared 4.5% in August, more than twice the 2.2% increase expected.


For the bears, core capital goods, a gauge of business spending plans, fell 0.5% vs. an expected 0.4% rise.


Individual investors won't have to wait long for better evidence. The Q3 earnings season's unofficial kickoff is only about two weeks away. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) are among the companies that will report early in the cycle.


Each of those companies will report Q3 results before the open Oct. 12.

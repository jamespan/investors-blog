Stock Market Rebounds; What The S&P 500's Signals Are Saying
=============================================================

The stock market settled down after a couple of days of strong selling as the Nasdaq jumped more than 1% and small caps led the rebound.




Buying picked up in the final half hour in action on Wednesday that was more reminiscent of last week's bullish advances. Indexes also recouped much of Monday's and Tuesday's losses.


The S&P 500 climbed 0.9%. Its chart looks undisturbed by the declines earlier in the week; it's still trading near record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.9%. Both ended almost at Friday's closing prices.


The Nasdaq composite bounced 1.2%, erasing everything it lost Tuesday and then some. Small caps displayed the greatest strength. The Russell 2000 leapt nearly 2.4%. The index now tries to regain its 50-day moving average.


After a couple of rough days and indexes near all-time highs, investors are wise to ask if the stock market still needs to digest gains.


S&P 500 Stretched?
------------------


The S&P 500 is looking a bit stretched, still trading more than 5% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) at the close and 15% above its 200-day line.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP042121-240x300.jpg)The S&P 500 is not a stranger to those gaps, having traded around them in parts of November, December and January. Yet, the gap between the index and its 50-day line widened in the last couple of weeks. Also, the S&P 500 is at the top of an upper channel line that extends from the Nov. 9 move to new highs.


The Nasdaq faces its own test after sellers appeared at the 14,000 level. When indexes hit big round numbers, big investors try to use it as an opportunity to sell into the hands of buyers drawn by the allure of a major milestone.


Even with the composite near record highs, its performance generally lags the S&P 500. That's illustrated in the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which has been sloping downward since mid-February. However, the Nasdaq has outperformed the S&P 500 since March 31, so the RS line has flattened out some.


Volume fell from Tuesday's levels, suggesting institutional investors didn't buy back shares with the same fervor that they sold earlier in the week.


Volume Lags In Stock Market Indexes
-----------------------------------


Indeed, one concern about the stock market is that [volume is trending lower while indexes trade near highs](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-decline-fueled-by-weakness-in-chips-small-caps/). The S&P 500's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) bears that out with a D- reading prior to Wednesday's gains. The Nasdaq's Accumulation Rating is C+, although its volume also has been trending below average since March.


But breadth was positive Wednesday: Advancing stocks led decliners by about 11-3 on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Breadth has been uneven. The advance-decline line of the Nasdaq is slacking off, especially when compared with the NYSE's upward moving line. (The advance-decline lines for both stock exchanges are plotted on the [General Market Indicators page](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DailyGMI042021.pdf).)



The IBD 50 rose 0.9% but it's still down for the week. The growth-stock index held above the 50-day moving average during the week's bout of selling, a positive indication.


Consumer leaders **Plby Group** ([PLBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLBY)) and **Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)) led the IBD 50 Wednesday with romps of more than 10%. Home furnishings retailer **At Home Group** ([HOME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOME)) rallied nearly 7% after its 50-day line gave the stock more support. But **J2 Global** ([JCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCOM)) plunged more than 8% after it announced it will split into two companies through a spin-off of its cloud fax business.


Covid vaccine maker **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) climbed to a new high. Building products maker **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)) found support at the 50-day line and continues shaping a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Mining company **Sibanye Stillwater** ([SBSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBSW)) is trying to regain its 20.50 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Novocure** ([NVRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVRC)) won back its 194.85 entry.


The stock market losses earlier this week helped create [handles](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) in some leading stocks. **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) — all three [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks — are now [shaping handles](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) that bring their buy points to lower prices.

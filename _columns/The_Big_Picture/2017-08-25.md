Stock indexes stayed near their 50-day lines Friday, as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., made few ripples beyond speculation surrounding her own job.




The Nasdaq was up 0.6% in the first half-hour of trade but then reversed to end 0.1% down. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.3%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Yellen's term will end Feb. 3 and it isn't clear whether President Trump will reappoint her. Some market watchers said Yellen's pro-regulatory remarks in Jackson Hole mean she doesn't expect to be reappointed.


The Yellen factor could unsettle the market. Regardless of what market watchers think of Yellen, her policies are known and therefore easy to price into the market.

The stock market's action since June has been tiresomely predictable. Pullbacks in the indexes don't get far before petering out. Advances keep fizzling out.


While the market uptrend resumed Tuesday, the indexes spent the next three sessions kicking the can down the road.


At some point, this market will have to lend its pushing power to the either the bulls or the bears for more than a day. Until then, the frustration will persist.


On Friday, most leaders were heading south. China-based stocks, which recently provided bullish leadership, took some hard hits. **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) fell 8%; **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), 2%; **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), 6%; and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), 2%.


One stock market on the move is Brazil's. The Bovespa is up 18% this year and going into Friday's session was at the index's highest mark since January 2011.



President Michel Temer recently tagged 57 state assets for privatization and opened a Brazil reserve the size of Denmark to mining companies.


A handful of Brazil stocks — trading on U.S. exchanges — are highly rated.


**Banco Bradesco** ([BBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBD)) is in its 5% buy zone.


**Itau Unibanco** ([ITUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITUB)), another bank, is working on a double-bottom consolidation.


**Braskem** ([BAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAK)), a chemical firm, is in its 5% buy zone.


Metals miner **Vale** ([VALE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VALE)) is in its 5% buy zone.


**Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)) is extended from a recent breakout but Gol is not highly rated.

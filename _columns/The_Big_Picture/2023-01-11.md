  Stock Market Praying For Perfect CPI Report

Stock market indexes lifted to weekly highs ahead of Thursday's eagerly awaited December consumer price index report. Expectations for a meager 0.1% rise fueled positive sentiment, but the core number could reveal deep structural price pressures.




Tech stocks outperformed on Wednesday, but aggressive long bets could trigger renewed losses if data doesn't support bullish speculation.


The S&P 500 lost 19.4% of its value in 2022 but has risen about 3% ahead of the inflation report, which will set the tone for January's trading environment.


Wednesday volume posted strong percentage gains on the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges, signaling increased speculation ahead of market-moving data. Major benchmarks added about 1.5% to recent gains, but everyone is watching Thursday's report, looking for the right tone to take into the Q4 2022 earnings season.


The 10-year Treasury yield slipped 7 basis points to 3.55%. Crude oil ticked higher by more than 3%, closing above $77 per barrel, while natural gas ticked up to $3.69. Moderate weather in the U.S. and Europe has taken a toll on bullish energy speculators.


IBD raised its outlook to "confirmed uptrend" last week, in recognition of stronger stock market price action, fueled by the new year's optimism. That has played out in the first two weeks of January, with progressively higher prices and legitimate buying of 2022's most beaten-down tech names.


The January Effect
------------------


The January Effect has arrived on cue, with investors scooping up last year's biggest losers.

This impulse tends to peak about three weeks into the new year, when Q4 earnings results take control of the playing field. Ominously, analysts are forecasting a major decline from Q3 earnings and sales, pummeled by the negative impact of interest-rate hikes on 2023 budgets and labor costs.


However, the greatest challenge for markets will come in February and March, when jobs data reveals the impact of layoffs all across the corporate universe. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and dozens of blue-chip employers are cutting workforces, and those metrics will tell us if we're headed for a soft landing or full-fledged recession.


What To Do Now
--------------


All major indexes closed at highs for the new year on Wednesday.


The S&P 500 is back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) but still below the 200-day moving average, which many view as the dividing line between bull and bear markets. A benign inflation number on Thursday could bring reluctant bulls off the sidelines, setting up important tests at that barrier.



A strong buying impulse above the down trendline at SPDR Trust's ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) 400 level will set off strong buying signals that could yield nice returns, and perhaps even signal the end of the bear market. But smart investors will bide their time, waiting for the market to set up low-hanging fruit to scoop into their investment accounts.


Stock Market: Wednesday Movers
------------------------------



IBD 50 component **Donaldson** ([DCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DCI)) rallied within 1% of the 62.04 buy point of a [first-stage flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/), sitting at the edge of a 15-month saucer base. It's the nature of price action after the pandemic, with some issues shooting to higher highs or lower lows while the majority grind through long but eventually profitable basing patterns.


**Expedia Group** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) got some love Wednesday, rising nearly 5% after Oppenheim upgraded the travel site to outperform. EXPE stock has rallied above the 50-day line for the first time in six weeks. The uptick matches bullish **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) price action, with that Dow Jones component rallying more than 7% so far in 2023.


Just keep in mind that 2023 travel might not match early optimism because travelers finally hooked up with family members last year, easing post-pandemic demand.

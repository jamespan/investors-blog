Nasdaq Fights For Support; This Sector Rallies
===============================================

The Nasdaq composite ended with a modest gain Monday, helped by outperformance from biotech stocks and a solid showing from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). China-based stocks generally underperformed after recent strength.




The Nasdaq managed a decent close, rising 0.3% and ending just above the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 gained less than 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average eased less than 0.1%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added more than 0.3%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) buoyed the Dow, rising 1% to 161.50. It had been getting resistance near 160 after a breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a conventional entry at 156.75. Several published reports said Apple will hold a new product launch event on Sept. 12, where the public will get a look at the newest lineup of iPhones.


The market went back into a confirmed uptrend last week after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 gapped above their 50-day lines. The indexes' performance since then, however, has been suspect at best. Instead of following through, both indexes have been muddling around their 50-day lines.


Clearly, a heavy [distribution-day coun](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/tracking-trends/)t for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remains a black eye for the stock market as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 struggle for support. Add to that a challenging market for breakouts, and it's not hard to justify raising some cash at this point.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP082817-155x300.png)Devastation in Texas as a result of Hurricane Harvey was a focal point Monday, and storm-related stock moves were plentiful.


**Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) tried to clear a 110.01 buy point, but the RV maker closed in the bottom half of its intraday range. Shares rose 5% to 108.73. Group peer and [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) name **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) ended near its session high, rising more than 5% to 36.40. It's vying for a breakout over a 37.30 handle entry after a failed breakout over a prior entry of 36.70.


RV makers rallied Monday on expectations of new demand for temporary housing due to heavy flooding in Texas.


Dow component **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) added more than 1% on expectations of higher store traffic as a result of the storm. Home Depot gapped up over its 50-day line but ended just below it. It's a potential resistance level to watch.


Also in the Dow, **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) slumped nearly 3% as insurers sold off on expectations of potentially billions of dollars in claims.


Biotechs outperformed, helped by news of a big acquisition. **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) announced plans to buy immunotherapy developer **Kite Pharma** ([KITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KITE)) for $11.9 billion. The deal values Kite at $180 a share, a big premium compared with Friday's closing price of 139.10, and opens up a promising market for Gilead as growth in its hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS areas slows. Shares of Gilead rose 1%. Kite soared 28% to 178.01.


Immunotherapy strengthens the power of a patient's immune system to attack tumors. Other immunotherapy firms jumped on the news, including **Juno Therapeutics** ([JUNO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JUNO)), **Bluebird Bio** ([BLUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLUE)) and French firm **Cellectis** ([CLLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLLS)).


Top-rated biotech names with healthy charts include **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)) and **Supernus Pharmaceuticals** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)).


September gasoline futures climbed 4.6 cents, or 2.7%, to settle at $1.712 a gallon. Gasoline traded as high as $1.78 a gallon after refinery operations in Texas were shut down due to torrential rain and high winds from the hurricane. Benchmark crude oil slumped 2.7% to $46.57 a barrel.


December gold settled at $1,315. 30 an ounce, up 1.3%, as the U.S. dollar continued to weaken. SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) added 1.6% to 124.69. It's in the early stages of breaking out of a base with a 123.41 buy point.


It was a different story for China-based stocks, many of which underperformed after several weeks of outperformance. [Marketsmith Growth 250](http://www.marketsmith.com) names like **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)), **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) showed losses ranging from 3% to 5%.

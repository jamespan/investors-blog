U.S. stock indexes rebounded to close high in the day's range Thursday, but still couldn't avoid losses.


The Nasdaq stepped down 0.5%, rubbing out most of a 1.3% morning loss. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. The IBD 50 actually rose 0.2%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 failed to retake their 50-day moving averages, hurdles that must be overcome if the uptrend is to shake its negativity.


![mp101316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP101316-205x300.png)While bulls welcomed the trimming of losses, the bears could accurately point out that the session still amounted to distribution.


The Nasdaq's count increased to six days of distribution, but the S&P 500 stayed at eight. A Sept. 8 distribution day fell off the count because of time. After five weeks, distribution is no longer relevant to current conditions. Distribution involves a significant loss in a major index in rising volume. Such action points to institutional selling.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's worst performers included banks and steel. The best included specialty retail, gold miners and utilities.


Specialty retail was a one-trick pony. **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) surged 11% in heavy volume. The company raised guidance for Q3 and for the full fiscal year 2017, ending in January.


Ulta has been on IBD's radar for a long time. The stock rose 47% from a March breakout to a late-August high. Then it began a consolidation that it's still working on. If the stock can complete a new base, it would be second stage.


As a stock climbs, it pauses to consolidate. A breakout from a first- or second-stage base is more likely to work than those from later bases.


Unless Ulta's base adds a handle, the buy point would be 278.73. The stock is about 4.5% off that area.


Dining delivery service **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) bounced off its 50-day line in strong volume, creating a secondary buy zone. This marked its first trip to the 50-day line since a late July breakout.


A secondary buy zone is a place where existing shareholders can add a small amount of shares. The idea is to build a position on the way up.


Other investors could use the secondary buy zone as a place to open a position. However, the buy should be smaller than usual because there is more risk involved than if the initial purchase occurred at a breakout from a base.


Chip designer **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) slid for a fourth consecutive session. The price losses grew larger each day -- 0.1%. 0.8%, 3% and 7%. Volume was unremarkable the first three days but far above average Thursday. There was no negative news associated with the losses. The chart shows discouraging, choppy action since late July.


Economic news was mixed Thursday. First-time jobless claims checked in at 246,000, less than the Street's estimate for 254,000 and the lowest level since 1973.


But China whacked the bulls. September exports crashed 10% lower, far worse than the 3% drop expected. And unease surrounds the Federal Reserve. The stock market still appears nervous despite weeks of getting used to the idea of a rate hike yet this year.


Meanwhile, the U.S. presidential election is adding additional uncertainty. An indicator created by Sam Stovall of S&P Global Market Intelligence -- which involves the price action of the S&P 500 from the end of July to the end of October -- currently points to a victory for Republican Donald Trump. But this gauge has roughly two more weeks to run before it gives a conclusive reading. The accuracy of the gauge going back to 1944 is 86%.


Here's how Stovall's gauge works: If the S&P 500 rises from the end of July to the end of October, the party of the current president wins. If it falls, then the challenger wins. Right now, the S&P 500 is down about 2% since the end of July.


Elections when the indicator didn't work usually were years when a strong third party was in the mix. This year the Libertarians and the Greens are threatening to pull amounts that could be pivotal on a state-by-state basis.

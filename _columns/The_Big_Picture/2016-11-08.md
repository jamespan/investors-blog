Stocks Extend Pre-Election Rally, But Small Caps Lag; IBD 50 Jumps 2%
======================================================================

Stocks added to the prior day's surge, as investors looked to Tuesday's election results to remove one of the big clouds over the market.


The Nasdaq climbed 0.5% and the S&P 500 0.4% as both overcame an afternoon lull. The S&P 500 touched its 50-day moving average before paring gains, and that had to raise eyebrows among chart readers.


Another damper on the day's session was the fact that the small-cap Russell 2000 lagged with only a 0.2% advance. Risk appetite, in short, wasn't abundant.


Volume was flat on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq for the second day in a row. Ideally, index gains come with higher volume, and volume Monday and Tuesday did not match the intensity of most days last week, when the market was in a nose-dive. Still, there was one favorable change in the price-volume equation because the Oct. 4 [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) became too aged to count any longer.


![mp110816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP110816-207x300.png)The nitpicking comments above do not minimize the strength of this week's rally. The Nasdaq has wiped away an entire week of losses and the S&P 500 has erased seven days' worth of declines. Notice, however, that IBD's outlook still sees the market under pressure. The two-day rally is no reason to increase exposure to stocks, although Tuesday's election should clear up some of the big questions dogging investors.


Wall Street has signaled a preference for Hillary Clinton. Starting with the weekend news that the Democratic candidate was cleared by the FBI in the email scandal, stocks have been rallying.


Tuesday's trading offered some anecdotal evidence of that inclination in the way industry groups behaved. Pharmaceuticals — bashed by Clinton for excessive pricing — were among Tuesday's laggards. Gold stocks, which [are expected to fall if Clinton wins](https://www.investors.com/news/gold-is-at-a-turning-point-no-matter-who-wins-election/) — are down more than 2% this week.


Mexico's Bolsa IPC main index jumped nearly 4% in the past two days, in another sign that expectations of a Donald Trump defeat worked their way into markets.


But more than the Oval Office is at stake. The balance in the Senate and, to a lesser degree, the House of Representatives are two additional question marks. There's also a small possibility of a contested election.


To many investors, the memory of the Brexit surprise still echoes in their minds. On June 24, the day after Britons voted to exit the European Union, global markets were rudely surprised. The Nasdaq plunged more than 4% that day, though it started to recover two days later. With so much at stake for business, the U.S. elections are a pivotal event.


Politics aside, earnings remain a focal point in the market and again sparked major moves. Drugstore stocks were roiled after **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) cut profit guidance and its Q3 sales missed estimates. Chinese internet company **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) was wild, ending the day with a 13% plunge even after reporting stronger-than-expected [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/momo-tops-q3-earnings-with-strength-in-live-video/?yptr=yahoo).


The IBD 50 rose 2% Tuesday, as leading stocks outperformed the broad market. A few breakouts highlighted Tuesday's trading, which could be the seeds of new gains if the market keeps rising. **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)), **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) and **Synchronoss Technologies** ([SNCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNCR)) were noteworthy.


The food sector also was up a lot, with dairy, packaged foods and grains rising more than 1%. **Dean Foods** ([DF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DF)) was up 3% a day after it edged past analysts' profit estimates.


There wasn't much else acting as a motivation for food investors, aside from possible defensive plays ahead of the election. The market's signals suggest there won't be any major surprises. And for those fearing catastrophe, there's this tidbit: One of the best-performing industry groups Tuesday was funeral services.

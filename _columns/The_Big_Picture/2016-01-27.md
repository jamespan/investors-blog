When the Federal Reserve talks, everybody still listens.


In the wake of the U.S. central bank's first announcement of the year on interest rates, investors sold stocks heavily following hints that the Fed intends to stick with plans to raise the cost of money.


The Nasdaq slid 2.2%. The S&P 500 dropped 1.1%, buffeted in part by a spirited rise in oil and gas, mining and banking shares. The NYSE composite, which has more of those commodity stocks, lost 0.6%.

Higher volume on both sides chalked the market up with its first distribution day (intense professional selling), just one day after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 staged a follow-through.


The Nasdaq easily undercut Tuesday's intraday low and hit its lowest close since Oct. 23, 2014. A wild reversal by the S&P 500 was also negative; thus, IBD's outlook on the market was downgraded to "Uptrend under pressure."


Tuesday's follow-through had already proved to be hollow. The new-highs list looks worse than California's drought. When few stocks make new highs, it means that breakouts are scarce.


An astute investor is always ready to deploy cash on or soon after a follow-through. He or she should be able to choose from among at least a few outstanding-quality companies that have staged light corrections, completed sound bases, and are poised to break out to new highs.


That is not the scenario today. Check out the IBD 50, updated each day in [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/). Most lost ground. **Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)) and ATM operator **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) gained nicely, but neither offer a proper buy point.


The Fed's view on inflation may have disappointed traders who were hoping that  it would ditch a plan to raise the fed funds rate once a quarter in 2016. Even with oil down 75%, the Fed voiced confidence that inflation will rise to 2% "over the medium term."


What's clear today? A strong U.S. dollar is pinching American exports.


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) slumped 8.9% in huge volume. Q4 sales fell 4%, the first drop in 11 quarters. Falling sales do not favor the market bulls.

Stocks Jump Broadly, But Nasdaq, S&P 500 Still Seek Key Signal
===============================================================

The stock market extended its new uptrend Monday, when President Trump's case of coronavirus improved enough for him to leave the hospital, removing one of the newer clouds over Wall Street.




Indexes had already traded around session highs Monday afternoon, when Trump gave the news on his Twitter account. The stock market added to its gains and closed at session highs. The Nasdaq surged 2.3% and wiped away all of Friday's 2.2% loss. The S&P 500's 1.8% gain more than offset Friday's 1% drop.


The Nasdaq jumped more than 1% for the second time in three sessions. But volume fell both times. The S&P 500's rally Monday also came in lower volume.


Higher volume Monday (or Thursday) would have been bullish. It would have marked a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on the Nasdaq, reinforcing last week's bottoming signal in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The S&P 500 would have registered its own follow-through day on Monday, but not on Thursday, in which its gain was limited to 0.5%.


![MP100520](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP100520-289x300.jpg)IBD changed its market outlook last Wednesday because of the Dow's [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/). That's a narrow index upon which to base a follow-through, but it is working so far. Without it, you might have missed some investing opportunities have emerged since Wednesday.


Still, this remains a treacherous stock market. With the election one month away, political risk hangs over Wall Street.


Political Risks For Stock Market
--------------------------------


Foremost now is the health of President Trump. He is still battling Covid-19, but said on his Twitter account that he will leave Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at 6:30 p.m. ET.Â  He had been hospitalized since late Friday, but it appears he escaped any serious consequences from the virus. News early Friday that he tested positive sent stocks reeling that day.


Even once he goes home, the illness could limit campaign activities. The election itself could be complicated because mail-in balloting is expected to grow and it may delay vote totals. The nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court faces obstacles, including a rushed timeline for confirmation.


But the stock market also is cheering reports that a coronavirus stimulus package may move to a vote in Congress. While details are scant, there are signs that momentum is building for the measure to pass.


More Breakouts Among Leaders
----------------------------


With indexes rallying, more top-rated stocks are [breaking out of bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Take that as another signal that market conditions are positive.


**Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) rose above the 336.96 buy point of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). That cup also shares some of the elements of a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/). **SciPlay** ([SCPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCPL)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in heavy volume. **Regeneron** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) topped an alternative buy point at 157.56. **Marvell Technologies** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)), Monday's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-marvell-mrvl-eyes-breakout-new-high-near-buy-point/) company, climbed above a 41.29 buy point.



**United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) climbed above the 186.88 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a flat base in heavy volume. Its breakout was symptomatic of a [broad strength in construction stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/housing-stocks-reach-new-heights-hit-buy-points-amid-home-sales-boom/).


**Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)), **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) are trying to break out of bases. **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) did on Friday and remains in buy range.


[MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s screen of recent breakouts shows more than two dozen stocks, and most are performing well.


Some of the breakout stocks are in the IBD 50, which outperformed Monday with a 2.5% increase. All but four of the [IBD 50 stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) rose, as SciPlay led with a 10.3% surge.


Small caps outperformed the IBD 50. The Russell 2000 leaped 2.8% and is nearing two-month highs. Most sectors were higher, with breadth quite strong. Advancing stocks led decliners by a nearly 3-1 ratio on the NYSE and Nasdaq.

  Nasdaq Lifts Stock Market Higher Amid Technical Hurdles; What This Index Says About The Economy

Could the Nasdaq, as well as the general stock market, experience one of the briefest corrections in a while?




Judging by the way both the major indexes and key growth stocks acted on Wednesday, one could certainly contemplate the answer. Yet for now, the stock market, despite getting a much needed relief rebound amid a recent jump in the cost of money, has not quite yet delivered a "green light" to investors that it's time to seriously deploy capital back into equities.


Lately, the media has played up the inverse relationship between stocks and the yield on long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds.


Yet no matter the hype, the relationship remains very important. Amid what may have been bargain hunting in U.S. government debt Wednesday, investors appeared to embrace a little more risk in stocks as well. As the benchmark 10-year bond yield slipped 13 basis points to 4.19%, based on Cboe data, the Nasdaq led the upside in the stock market with a 1.6% gain.


The buying in long-dated Treasuries comes after the yield recently eclipsed last October's peak of 4.33% and the long-term cost of money hit the highest level since November 2007.


Stock Market Today: Nasdaq Leads Rebound
----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP082323--255x300.jpg)Both the Nasdaq composite and the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq, jumped 1.6%. They outweighed gains of 1.1% by the S&P 500 and 1% by the small-cap Russell 2000.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average served as the wallflower of Wednesday's dance toward higher prices, up 0.5%.


Volume on the Nasdaq edged a touch lower vs. Tuesday, down nearly 4% to 4.13 billion shares. Amid a budding rally attempt, you'd much prefer to see gains in higher volume vs. the prior session, not lower trade.


NYSE turnover grew almost 9% to 3.84 billion shares, according to Dow Jones Market Data. However, investors looking for a fresh confirmation that a tradable rally is underway might feel disappointed that the S&P 500's gain falls shy of the historical average of 1.25% seen among a panoply of successful follow-through days noted by IBD over decades of market history.


Therefore, for the time being, IBD's current outlook stands at "market in correction."


Plus, at 4436, the S&P 500 finished meaningfully below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


A [good follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), of course, often may take place when either the 500 or the Nasdaq is trading deep beneath their respective 50-day moving averages or their 200-day lines.


Just look at one of the best up days that confirmed a new uptrend over the past 20 years: March 17, 2003. On that day, the 500 surged 3.5% on Day 4 of its new rally attempt. At 862.79, the large-cap benchmark lifted above its 50-day line (at 857.93 that session) for the first time in eight weeks. But it also finished more than 33 points below its 200-day moving average (at 896.01).

Breadth Improves
----------------


Meanwhile, winners outnumbered losers on the Nasdaq by a 2-1 margin. On the NYSE gainers topped decliners by nearly 7 to 2. But stocks making new highs have gotten a bit scarce.


[As seen on MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) (punch in GMIAA on a daily chart for the NYSE and GMIAB for the Nasdaq), the 10-day moving average of the advance-decline lines for both exchanges has bent lower the past three weeks.


As many as six of the Dow industrials' 30 stocks rallied 2 points or more on Wednesday. And at least three of them came from tech land.



**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) led the group with a 4.54 point rise, or 1.4%, to 327. The Nasdaq-listed cloud computing and business software giant is trying to bottom out after a healthy correction of 15% from an all-time peak of 366.78.


A big move back above the 50-day moving average would make a bullish turn. How so? It would indicate that balance of supply vs. demand for shares could be tilting away from the former and toward the latter.


Meanwhile, fellow enterprise software firms **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)), a data analytics giant, and **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) both enjoyed healthy gains after hours after [reporting quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/technology/).

New Issues Still Struggling
---------------------------



SNOW, however, is not only trading beneath its 50-day line. It needs to show some muscle past stubborn upside resistance near 185 to 190.


Elsewhere, crude oil futures slumped 1.4% to $78.56 a barrel.


Analysts at Citigroup noted during a recent CNBC interview that some of the largest producers in the world, including Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela, have been showing clear signs of boosting their overall output. The peak in demand for oil year to year, meanwhile, tends to take place in August. These figures, combined with the surprise news of deflationary pressures enveloping China's economy, seem to offset the argument by oil bulls that the U.S. needs to refill its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a positive for demand.


According to Thinkorswim data, light sweet crude futures have bounced to as high as $84.89, or a 33% gain from its May 4 intraday low of $63.64 a barrel. On Wednesday, natural gas futures slipped nearly 3% while gasoline dipped 0.4% to $2.56 per gallon.

Monitor This Stock Market Average
---------------------------------


A dip in energy prices perhaps explains why the Dow Jones transportation average staged a decent 1.1% rally. It is a somewhat surprising leader in the stock market today; at 15,767, the Dow transports have ascended 17.7% since Jan. 1 so far this year.


Also, please check out a [MarketSmith daily chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). It shows the Dow transports (punch in zero-DJT at MarketSmith) is clinging to its fast-rising 50-day moving average.


Transportation stocks reflect the moving of goods and people. No wonder it acts as a key barometer of the future state of the economy.


The recent bankruptcy of less-than-truckload specialist Yellow has likely put a flat tire in the rallies of its peers. But some of the trucking firms, including **ArcBest** ([ARCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCB)), **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) and **J.B. Hunt** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)), have been respecting their 50-day lines. **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), stopping a six-day slump with a modest gain, is flirting with a possible test of buyers at its 50-day moving average near 255.



Railroads have pulled back more and have generally not performed well all year long. Airlines have had a horrible third quarter in the stock market so far. **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), despite rising 1.4% on Wednesday, has proved a disappointment since it streaked below its 50-day moving average on Aug. 11. Gains from a cup breakout at 40.30 have shrunk to less than 5%.


Yet within the ship transport group, **Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)) reversed from a sharp drop and minor undercut of the 50-day line to end almost 1% higher at 79.68 on Wednesday. Kirby's bounce off the 10-week line near 78 represents a [follow-on entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).

Bulls Recede
------------


[Bullish sentiment in the stock market](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears), meanwhile, continues to sink.


The latest weekly reading of bullishness among market pundits tracked by Investors Intelligence has dived to 44.3% vs. 47.1% last week. This means the combined ratio of those thinking it is going to be in a bear market or suffer an intermediate-level correction now commands the majority. Shrinking bullishness is actually good for equities. How so? The rise in pessimism means these market observers have exited the market. They are waiting for the stock market to prove they were right. But when they're wrong, they could return as buyers.


Bearishness sank to 18.6% vs. 20% a week earlier. But advisors projecting an intermediate correction rose to 37.1% from 31.9%, the highest level since fall of last year.

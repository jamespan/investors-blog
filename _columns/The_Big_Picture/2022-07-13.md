  Stock Market Mostly Shrugs Off Sizzling Inflation; What This Relatively New IPO Says About Stocks

So, another [hot inflation report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/the-cpi-inflation-rate-may-hit-9-dow-jones-rally-stalls/) showed consumer-level prices hitting four-decade highs. Yet while the American consumer is still feeling the pain, the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) seemed to write it off.




A drop of less than 0.2% for the Nasdaq composite, which finished well in the upper half the day's trading range, and a nearly 0.5% drop by the S&P 500, may have surprised some IBD readers. After all, the [June consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/the-cpi-inflation-rate-may-hit-9-dow-jones-rally-stalls/) showed a 9.1% jump in prices vs. the year-ago period. That topped an 8.6% year-over-year increase in May.


Stock Market Today: No Change In Outlook
----------------------------------------


This economic report made waves within the bond market. According to the CME Fed Watch survey of activity on fed funds interest rate futures, the probability that the Federal Reserve will increase the fed funds rate in July by a full percentage point to a target range of 2.5%-2.75% soared to nearly 77%.


Previously, it was all but certain that the U.S. central bank planned for a three-quarter-point hike to 2.25%-2.5% at its July 26-27 meeting.


And yet the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond dropped 5 basis points to 2.9%. That marked a third straight decline in the yield, meaning that investors bid up this long-dated bond. Such action made Wednesday's stock market all the more puzzling.


The S&P 500 marked its fourth straight decline. Thus, it gutted nearly all of the nice gains of 3% achieved during a four-day upswing. NYSE volume, meanwhile, rose slightly. That marks a third day of distribution since the market outlook changed to a confirmed uptrend with the [June 24 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gains-pace-as-these-hopes-rise-casino-stocks-hit-the-jackpot/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP071322_2-229x300.jpg)The Russell 2000's decline of 0.1% stood in contrast to a nearly 0.7% drop by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) weighed on the share price-weighted Dow Jones industrials; a 13-point drop was the largest among the Dow 30 members. That sent the stock below the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and more than 3% below a [handle entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) of 518.80 on its relatively shallow base.


The Nasdaq, meanwhile, did not fall by enough of an amount to categorize the session as one of [intense institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Summer Still Drags On Share Activity
------------------------------------


Indeed, other measures of the market indicate that the most powerful forces in the market — from mutual funds and large investment advisors to banks, pension plans, insurers and college endowment funds — did not react to the economic news with much gusto.


[In the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), the far majority of members ended the session in turnover that came in well below their average over the past 50 sessions.


The [Stocks On The Move stock list](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) featured only a pair of companies that rose in heavy volume.


The downside portion of this key stock list was certainly much longer. Very few on this list, however, could be considered as current leaders in the stock market. Most have been locked into downtrends and trade well below technical levels, such as the 50-day moving average and the 200-day line. **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), which reported second-quarter results on Wednesday, offers a good example now. A 28 Relative Strength Rating means that over the past 12 months, DAL has underperformed more than two-thirds of the stock market.

**Stark Message From This IPO**
-------------------------------



**Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) tanked 17% on news that it plans to acquire video game firm IronSource in a $4.4 billion deal. Clearly, Wall Street did not take a positive view of the news.


A weekly chart shows Unity, which went public in September 2020 at 52 a share, continues to struggle in bottoming out. Last week, shares rallied more than 20% and closed above the 10-week moving average. Now, Unity holders are seeing stiff resistance at the 10-week line. Weekly volume is already at the highest level in more than two months.


Such action is a strike against the stock market and its current uptrend. In general, when you have weak action among new IPOs, you're getting a signal that institutional demand is weak. That does not favor the bulls now.


Meanwhile, on the shrunken MarketSmith Growth 250, defensive issues mostly led the upside. That is, think food and beverage plays including **Molson** ([TAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAP)), **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) and **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)).



Celsius markets a beverage that the company says boosts a customer's metabolism and calorie-burn rate during exercise. Such a new concept, plus Celsius' fundamentals, perhaps makes the company the most interesting among the three.


An 800% jump in first-quarter profit to 9 cents a share on a 167% sales boost to $133 million highlights the kind of fundamentals you want to see in a [CAN SLIM growth stock](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Of course, when you have a company that earns a penny per share in the year-ago quarter, then the size of the EPS increase should be taken with a large grain of salt.


Yet analysts polled by FactSet also see large profit gains to continue throughout 2022 (up 800% to 45 cents a share) and 2023 (up 120% to 99 cents).


Finally, on the [MarketSmith homepage](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), more stocks registered gains in above-average turnover than those that fell. That's a curious divergence.


Beyond Stock Market
-------------------


[Bearishness among market pundits](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) continues to outweigh bullishness. But keep in mind that sentiment indicators are secondary in telling you what the market is doing. Put another way, the crowd can be right about the stock market's direction for a long while. Bullishness in the weekly Investors Intelligence survey, at 32.4%, remains below bearishness at 36.6%.


The percentage of newsletter editors expecting an intermediate-level correction — basically a decline of less than 20% off the highs — stands at 31%. This is certainly an oddly high level, given that the S&P 500 has already fallen 25% from its November 2021 peak. Yet perhaps it implies that by year's end, these observers believe the major indexes will cut their losses.

Stock Market Rallies Off Lows As Fed Stays Dovish, Calms Inflation Fears; Cyclicals Lead Again
===============================================================================================

The stock market recovered off lows Wednesday after Wall Street got exactly what it wanted from the Federal Reserve: another dovish policy statement.




A sharp rise in the 10-year Treasury yield to 1.69% in the morning helped fuel a 1.5% morning decline for the Nasdaq composite, but the index reversed higher by the close. Just after 5 p.m. ET, the 10-year yield was trading at 1.64%, up 3 basis points.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Russell 2000 small-cap index led the way, up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6%; the Nasdaq composite added 0.4% and the S&P 500 climbed 0.3%. Volume on the Nasdaq came in slightly higher than in Tuesday's session. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume slightly higher also.


After a strong rally above its 50-day moving average last week, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed, rising 0.9%. Top gainers in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks included two homebuilders. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) jumped 4.5% to 86.99. It's still in buy range from an alternate entry of 84.51. **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)) soared 4%, but it's extended after a bounce off the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/). Outside the IBD 50, **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) soared past an alternate entry of 95.82, rising nearly 14% to 100.95 on strong earnings.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP031721-240x300.jpg)Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed an increase in bullish sentiment to 55.9% from 51%. Rising bullishness might seem like a good thing for stocks. But it's not, because the survey is a contrarian indicator. Bullish sentiment was at 61.5% on Sept. 1, just ahead of a sharp pullback for the major stock indexes. Bulls fell to 53.6% on Nov. 3, one day before a market [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) confirmed a new uptrend.


Fed Statement
-------------


The main take-away from the Fed's policy statement is that the Fed sees a strong economy and higher inflation, but no rate hikes until 2024. Some had expected the Fed to change the timing of its first rate hike to 2023. Four of the 18 Federal Open Market Committee members now expect a rate hike in 2022, compared with just one at the December meeting. For 2023, seven members see a rate hike, up from five in December.

Rising interest rates in the bond market have been flagging the threat of inflation as the economy strengthens. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said higher price are possible later this year but should be "transient."


The Fed increased its GDP growth estimate this year to 6.5% from 4.2% and lowered its unemployment outlook this year to 4.5%.



The Nasdaq 100 added 0.4% after a weak showing Tuesday, when the index pared a 1.7% gain to 0.5% by the close. It's still waging a battle at the 50-day line. Top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), up nearly 4%, and **Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)), up 3.5%. Besides Marriott, other hotel operators like **Hyatt** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) and **Hilton** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)) are showing strength, trading sideways after mid-February breakouts.


Former leaders in the Nasdaq 100 like **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) and **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) rallied off lows Wednesday. But all four stocks fell hard Tuesday, ending with losses of around 4%. They've all suffered chart damage that will take some time to repair and are a good reminder not to stay married to former stock market leaders.


Stock Market Strength
---------------------


The technology sector still looks vulnerable, but a trio of tech stocks in the internet content group continue to trade well.


Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) seems intent on forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) as it holds above the 2,000 level and its 10-week moving average.

---


**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) is also acting well, holding nicely above its 10-week line after powerful breakout last month fueled by strong earnings.



China-based **Tencent Music** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) is making a bullish first test of its 10-week line after a breakout during the week ended Dec. 11. Buyers were in TME stock near the end of February when the stock pared a weekly loss of 17% to 4%. Earnings from Tencent Music are due Monday after the close.


Distribution Days
-----------------


The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remains elevated, with five higher-volume declines for the S&P 500 since Feb. 18. The Nasdaq also has five distribution days. But the strategy of selling growth stocks and moving into cyclical stocks is sound strategy for now. While the vast majority of growth stocks continue to struggle below key support levels, cyclical stocks continue to work nicely.


IBD's steel producers group was one of the day's top performers, up around 2.5%. The group is home to several strong performing stocks, including **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)), **Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)), **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)).


ArcelorMittal joined Leaderboard last week when it gapped out of a cup base with a 25.85 buy point.


In the chemical sector, **Element Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)) has pulled back in orderly fashion as it stays in buy range from a 19.50 entry.


In the heavy construction group, **Fluor** ([FLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLR)), **Granite Construction** ([GVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GVA)) and **Jacobs Engineering** ([J](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=J)) have emerged as leaders.

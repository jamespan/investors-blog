  Indexes Rebound Meekly, But Money Flows Again Into These Stock Market Sectors

When the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) shows a dull rebound like the one witnessed on Wednesday, it usually pays to look deep below the surface. That view confirmed a few things.




One, the stock market remains in a decent uptrend. Sure, instances of heavy professional selling remain high in recent weeks. But could that have been due to normal profit taking and a bit of rotation into new sectors?


Partly for these reasons, IBD's outlook for active stock investors has held at 60%-80% exposure for weeks. On Wednesday, the [invested percentage in the Leaderboard model stock portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) got shaved to around 60%.


Two, investors may still be waiting for more concrete news on the economy and inflation.


Wednesday's [ADP private sector payrolls data](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) and fresh comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell didn't seem to move the needle among bulls or bears.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP040324-209x300.jpg)On Friday, the nonfarm payrolls and unemployment report for March hits computer screens. Portfolio managers will once again focus on revisions to past numbers as well as indications that wage growth, a key component in overall inflation figures, continues to cool.


Three, even on a dull day for the indexes, remarkably, at least 27 of IBD's 197 industry groups rose 1.5% or more for the day. [The sectors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) ranged from oil and gas and gold to computers, heavy construction, transportation and leisure.


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Wednesday, The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 finished higher by 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The intraday range was narrow. Amid a small dip in long-term interest rates, investors appeared to hunt for bargains in smaller issues. The Russell 2000 rose 0.5%, outperforming a 0.1% decline by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


The yield on the key U.S. 10-year government note gave up midsession gains and finished at 4.35%, off 1 basis point â€” one day after it closed at the highest level since Nov. 27.


Volume on the Nasdaq increased more than 9% to 5.15 billion shares. That's nice to see on a day in which the quintessential index for top growth companies rebounds after a nearly 1% drop on Tuesday.


You would have, of course, preferred a much larger rebound. Yet the Nasdaq found support at a key short-term level, the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


NYSE volume fell nearly 5% to 3.7 billion shares.


Go to a [daily chart of the NYSE Composite](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/amex-nyse-composite-index-0nyc.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily), and you'll see turnover has now finished well below the 50-day moving average for the eighth session in a row. On March 21, volume rose merely 1% above average.


This suggests both the bulls and the bears are awaiting a new catalyst in which to take charge. Will [first-quarter earnings news](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) fit the bill?


The Earnings Picture, And A Look At PEG Ratios
----------------------------------------------


Robert Maltbie, president of the small- and micro-cap equity research firm Singular Research, thinks the stock market's longer-term picture looks rosy. One reason? Future profits look poised to keep rising.


"We've had three quarters of year-over-year earnings growth. The earnings momentum is turning positive," Maltbie told IBD. From a valuation standpoint, this factor helps make large-cap equities continue to look attractive.


Let's note here that three quarters of EPS growth, at least among S&P 500 companies, would include the just-ended first quarter of 2024. It will take time before actual numbers get set in stone. Yardeni Research finds that analysts' consensus estimates see Q1 profits rising 6.7% vs. a year ago to an aggregate $56.66 for the S&P 500, following a 4.6% lift in Q3 of 2023 (to $58.62) and 3.1% bump up in Q4 (to an estimated $54.82).


In the first two quarters of 2023, profits dipped 3.1% and 5.8% vs. a year earlier, respectively.


According to Maltbie, the historical PEG ratio, which compares the stock market P-E ratio vs. expected earnings growth, is 2.5. That comes from a long-term average price-to-earnings ratio of 16.5, divided by 6.5% earnings growth.


How about now? Although the S&P 500 is trading at a lofty 25 times trailing 12-month earnings, Wall Street is forecasting 11% earnings growth. Thus, the current PEG ratio comes out to 2.27, or lower than the long-run PEG ratio.


"AI is key to that 11% earnings growth," Maltbie, who also manages the long-short Argonaut fund at Millennium Asset Management, added.


An Emerging Tech Lead Runner
----------------------------



Helping the Nasdaq's cause was certainly **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), highlighted in the Market Pulse table. Shares stretched their gains to more than 50% after retaking the 10-week moving average near 85. That bullish move in the week ended Feb. 23 triggered an excellent [extra buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


[According to MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?intcode=lgnv%7Clgnv%7CMarketSmith%7C2023%7C06%7Cmsp%7Cna%7C%7C725068&src=A00653), Wall Street sees a huge swing in the flash memory chip giant's fortunes, going from a net loss of $4.45 a share in the fiscal year that ended in August to profits of 37 cents in fiscal 2024 and $7.24 in fiscal 2025.


In the February-ended fiscal second quarter, Micron accelerated sales for a second quarter in a row as the top line rose 58% to $5.82 billion.


Tech stocks, however, did not dominate the bullish side of the stock market Wednesday.


Keep an eye on the transportation firms. Healthy rises among the truck, railroad and shipping stocks suggest that revenues and earnings will stay robust. That's good for stocks, of course. The Dow Jones transportation average did better than all the major indexes on Wednesday, rising 0.7%.


As seen in the Market Pulse, two transport-related firms joined those stock market leaders up in above-average volume. They include **Greenbrier** ([GBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBX)), which specializes in railroad equipment, and tank barge operator **Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)).


And Kirby's solid rally lately points to strength in crude oil prices.


On Wednesday, light sweet oil futures rose another 0.6% and hit a session high $86.20, up 20.8% for the year so far. One of the top names in the current Leaderboard portfolio and a half-size position, **Weatherford International** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)), recently shoved into the [20%-25% profit zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) after a breakout past 102.64.

Beyond The Stock Market: Sentiment Indicators
---------------------------------------------


After Tuesday's stock market slide, some talking heads in the financial media made noises about the lack of volatility in the options world. On that day, the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) (VIX) jumped 7% for a third up day in a row. On Wednesday, the VIX edged nearly 2% lower and closed mildly below its long-term 200-day moving average.


As seen on the daily chart, the VIX's 200-day line still does not look like it's bottomed out.


Meanwhile, the bulls ratio of the weekly [Investors Intelligence survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) has held above 60% for at least three straight weeks. That's the longest streak above 60% since April 2021.


In last [Friday's episode of IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), panelists discussed the possibility that investor optimism, even at very high levels, is not necessarily a good timing signal of a stock market top.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 finished slightly higher in Thursday's mixed stock market action. Blue chips **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) plunged on disappointing earnings reports.




Stock market leader **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) selection **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) are stocks to watch in the current uptrend.


Early Thursday, the Labor Department's initial unemployment claims rose to 231,000 vs. 217,000 in the previous week. They were expected to climb to 222,000. The rise in jobless claims, which means a slightly worsening job market, helped push the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.44%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP111623-238x300.jpg)Key earnings movers included Cisco and Walmart, along with **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)).


[Cisco Systems](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/csco-stock-cisco-earnings-news-q12024/) plummeted nearly 10% after reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings late Wednesday that topped estimates, though product orders fell again. The company's outlook for the current January-ending quarter came in well short of expectations.


Meanwhile, [Walmart plunged more than 8%](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-target-spikes-on-this-major-surprise-dow-jones-rival-to-report/) after the company cautioned that consumer spending may be softening. Walmart did beat third-quarter estimates, as earnings were $1.53 a share on sales of $160.8 billion. Analysts expected profit of $1.52 a share on revenue of $159.65 billion. Shares dived through their 50-day moving average, triggering a sell signal.


[BABA stock](https://www.investors.com/research/alibaba-stock-buy-now/) tumbled more than 9%, while Macy's stock rallied 5.7%. [NTES stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ntes-stock-netease-beats-q3-earnings-goal-on-strong-video-game-sales/) declined 2.4%, still above a 110.82 flat-base entry. Finally, [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/panw-stock-news-palo-alto-earnings-q12024/) tumbled more than 5% after its earnings report, as the cybersecurity leader closed back below the 50-day line.

Dow Jones Today
---------------


On Thursday, indexes closed mostly near session highs, finishing mixed with modest gains or losses. The limited price moves were a good sign, indicating institutional investors were in no big rush to take profits from the November rally.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%. But the small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 1.5%. The index met resistance at its 200-day moving average Wednesday.


Volume dropped on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.



Aside from heavy losses for Cisco and Walmart, **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) was a big loser in the Dow Jones 30. The energy giant stumbled 2.6% to close at its lowest level since Sept. 27, 2022. Energy stocks were among Thursday's weakest as the price of U.S. crude fell 4.9% to $72.90 a barrel.


On the upside, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) surged 6.7%, closing around 16% past a 37.22 double-bottom entry.


And top growth stocks were also slightly lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dipped 0.5%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), Dow Jones software giant **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) rallied 1.8%, rising further above a 366.78 cup-base entry.

What To Do Now
--------------


Despite Thursday's losses, IBD recommends an exposure level of 80% to 100%, as the stock market continues its steadfast advance. If you're making progress in your portfolio, then the top of that range makes sense. However, if your breakout stocks have stagnated, then it's also OK to be more conservatively positioned.


If the market uptrend can extend itself further, there will be plenty of opportunities to make money.


Keep in mind that the Nasdaq continues to face potential resistance in the 14,149-14,446 zone. It wouldn't be surprising for the tech-heavy index to take a breather around these levels. That would be give leading stocks a chance to consolidate constructively before another move higher.


In the meantime, continue to look for new breakouts. And a great resource for daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks that are breaking out past new buy points. Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows stocks nearing buy points in bases.

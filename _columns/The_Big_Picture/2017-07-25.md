Nasdaq Lags On Alphabet Loss, But Industrials, Financials Lead
===============================================================

We'll take small gains rather than losses.


That seems to be the market's consensus as the major indexes Tuesday continued a trend of modest progress with a trade-off of no sizable declines. With indexes hitting record highs, that's not such a bad market.




The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.5% gain, after components Caterpillar and McDonald's surged on solid earnings reports. Caterpillar jumped nearly 6% and McDonald's rallied 5% as shares found support at the 50-day moving average.


The S&P 500 climbed 0.3% to a record high, as industrial, oil and financial stocks led much of the market.


The Nasdaq composite lagged, rising less than 0.1%, mainly because of a single stock: **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) slid 3% in heavy volume after its results didn't measure up to lofty expectations. The parent company of Google is the second-largest component of the Nasdaq after **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP072517-161x300.png)For the composite, it was its 12th gain in the past 13 days — good enough for a new all-time high. Since it started this month's rally, the Nasdaq has moved an average of 0.4%, and that includes a couple of gains of more than 1%. It's another reflection of the steady behavior in most of this year's stock market.


The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.9% and made a new high of its own. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Industrial shares took the leadership. Steel, mining and oil stocks shined.


**Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) surged 15% despite mixed Q2 results, but investors focused on positive signals such as strong copper prices. Other mining stocks rose in sympathy.


**BHP Billiton** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 40.02 buy point in heavy volume — one of a number of leaders that gapped up. **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) topped the 45.81 entry of another cup with handle. **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) gapped up and tried to break out above 39.60 but closed below the entry.


Financials also were strong. **PNC Financial** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)) broke out past a 128.35 buy point. **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) made a new high, adding to its breakout past a 46.74 buy point. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) gapped up 3%. The bank held its first investor day since the financial crisis and lifted long-term forecasts for profits and cost savings.


Banks also rose on a jump in bond yields as the Federal Reserve started a two-day meeting. Yields on five-, 10- and 30-year Treasuries had the largest day-to-day movement since the last Fed meeting, according to Tradeweb. The 10-year note's yield rose 7 basis points to 2.33%.


While a rate increase is not expected when the Fed announces its decision Wednesday, the bond market is keeping an eye on how and when the [Fed will start unwinding its massive bond portfolio](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/why-the-federal-reserve-might-spring-a-surprise-wednesday-bank-stocks-rally/), which could have an effect on yields depending on how the process unfolds.


It certainly wasn't a wasted day for techs, at least among the leaders. Chip, internet and fiber-optic stocks led the IBD 50.


Chinese internet company **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) leapt 3% to a new high. Semiconductor firm **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) rose 2% and also hit a new high. Those are examples of how select leaders have produced superb gains despite a market that often seems to move an inch at a time.


Several other IBD 50 stocks are forming bases. But that's no sure prognosticator of future gains, and a weak market can ruin bases that would otherwise be appealing.


Oil prices surged the most since November, with U.S. crude for September delivery up $1.55 to $47.89 a barrel. It was the highest close since June 6. Saudi Arabia pledged deeper cuts to crude exports, and U.S. stockpiles declined.


The homebuilding industry group rose 0.4% (in the bottom half of the day's performance table) after mixed industry reports.

Stock Rebound Accelerates; These Chart Signals Should Encourage Investors
==========================================================================

The stock market suddenly looks less burdened after indexes continued to rebound Tuesday, up for the third day in a row.




Indexes closed well off session lows after shaking off a morning tumble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2%, the S&P 500 tacked on 1.9%, and the Nasdaq composite advanced 1.8%.


Those were solid numbers, accelerating in percentage gains from the two prior sessions. The Nasdaq has just about wiped away the steep loss of 5.3% from Thursday, while the S&P 500 and Dow have a larger gap to make up. At Tuesday's highs, the Nasdaq matched last Wednesday's low, effectively erasing the price gap caused in Thursday's sharp sell-off.


In another positive step, the S&P 500's jump Tuesday was enough to erase Thursday's [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The index rose more than 5% from that session's close. The Nasdaq came quite close to wiping out its own distribution day from Thursday, but didn't rise quite enough.

Thursday's sell-off still stands out as a schism in the index charts, so don't drop your guard just yet. The Nasdaq faces a new test of the 10,000 level.


Small caps outperformed, as the Russell 2000 climbed 2.3%.


Positive News For Stock Market
------------------------------


The stock market is sensitive to headlines, and today's news fueled positive sentiment.


There was no bigger headline than the May retail sales report. U.S. retail sales jumped 17.7% in May, a record increase that indicates just how strongly the U.S. economy is rebounding from coronavirus lockdowns. The May sales doubled the consensus estimate from economists, and came after a record plunge of 14.7% in April.


"Yes the naysayers will say 'Well, look at the three-month trend ... it is still down nearly 30%,' to which I would say, 'Rome wasn't built in a day. It's going to take time to return to normal but it may be a little faster than we thought,' " Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets Economic Research, said in a report. "This may very well be the shortest, but still deepest, recession ever. Not likely that we'll see a repeat in June as this is pent-up demand unleashed in one month. But this poses upside risk for our Q2 GDP call."


The SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) jumped 2.9%. The ETF appears to be forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


The news was good on other fronts.


A corticosteroid used for a number of diseases such as rheumatism and allergies [showed promise as a coronavirus treatment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-treatment-decades-old-anti-inflammatory-drug-answer/) in severe cases, a study found.


Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is preparing [a $1 trillion infrastructure program](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-up-400-points-stocks-rally-retail-sales-stimulus-report/) to help revive the U.S. economy from the coronavirus recession. Cement, construction machinery, heavy construction, alloys and other hard-hat industry groups were among Tuesday's best.

Heavy machinery maker **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) gapped up to a gain of more than 5% and was the day's best Dow component.


Energy Stocks Climb
-------------------


Energy stocks also were strong as the price of U.S. crude oil rose 1.8% to $37.80 in late trading. The International Energy Agency expects global oil demand to fall by 8.1 million barrels per day this year, the largest drop in history. But in 2021, [demand should rebound by 5.7 million bpd](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-iea-report-historic-demand-drop-dire-aviation-market/), the largest gain in history.


[The IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) rose 1.3%, doing a good job of keeping up with the market. Utilities, down 0.5%, were the weakest S&P sector. That shows more risk appetite in the stock market.



A few stocks broke out but closed below [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) [rose past the 19.05 buy point of a cup base](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/vips-stock-breaks-out-to-new-high-but-is-china-stock-still-a-buy/). Shares closed slightly below the entry. **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) topped the 78.29 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a cup with handle. **Physicians Realty Trust** ([DOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOC)) and **Lexington Realty Trust** ([LXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LXP)) were among a few REITs that broke out.


Some other leading stocks are rebounding from pullbacks around their 10-week moving averages, such as **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) and **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)). The latter is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock.

Indexes Mark Fresh Closing Highs; Frothy Market Keeps On Chugging
==================================================================

The stock market's action on Monday showed it could care less about talks of a pullback and market frothiness.


After seven straight weekly price gains, the Nasdaq composite notched another record closing high, rising 0.6%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average also made all-time highs, rising 0.3% each. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in a touch higher than Friday's levels.


The one index that didn't mark a new closing high fared the best, as the Russell 2000 rose 1%. The IBD 50 also outperformed, rising 0.9%.


![MP081516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP081516.jpg)Several popular technical indicators point toward an overbought market. Overbought markets can also get frothy where speculation in growth names can get a bit excessive. New issues **Talend** ([TLND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLND)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) offer decent examples. Both aren't profitable yet, but shares of Talend soared 24% Monday. Twilio, meanwhile, jumped 10%, bringing its three-session gain to 34%.


Market frothiness doesn't mean individual investors should sell everything and move to cash, but taking partial gains in some top performers isn't a bad way to go.


The gain for those who bought [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) when it broke out over a 179.10 cup-with-handle buy point in late June hit 20% Monday. That triggered a key IBD profit-taking rule that generally says to take a 20% gain in a stock when you have it. The China-based company reports earnings Wednesday after the close. With earnings so close, locking in at least a partial profit makes sense.



The recent price action in other China-listed names has been a sight to behold as **Line** ([LN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LN)), **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) and IBD 50 member **Yirendai** ([YRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YRD)) saw more buy interest Monday. Momo, which reports earnings Tuesday before the open, cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 15.39 buy point.


Select oil- and gas-related industry groups outperformed as oil prices rose. West Texas intermediate crude oil for September delivery rallied $1.25, or 2.9%, to $45.74 a barrel on hopes for a production freeze at next month's OPEC meeting. Last week, oil rallied after comments from Saudi Arabia's energy minister indicated that the country might be willing to participate in production-freeze talks. Russia on Monday said it's consulting with Saudi Arabia and others to stabilize the oil market. Earlier this month, oil was trading below $40 a barrel.


Oil drillers outperformed, but actionable names in the group are scant. One name worth monitoring is **Nabors Industries** ([NBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBR)). It reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday in decent volume as it works on a base with an 11.31 entry. Shares rose 5% to 10.07.



Steel stocks also did well. In the specialty alloys group, **Allegheny Technologies** ([ATI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATI)) jumped 5%. It recently cleared an 18.48 buy point during the week ended July 29 but didn't make much progress. It's been moving sideways since then, bringing an alternate entry of 18.77 into play.


Group peer **Carpenter Technology** ([CRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRS)) also outperformed, rising 4%. It's trying to reclaim a 38.26 buy point. What looks like a handle buy point of 35.65 on the daily chart isn't, because the handle formed in the lower half of the base.


And contract research organization **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) broke out powerfully from a cup-with-handle base with a 50.06 buy point. Shares jumped 5% to 51.92. It was added to IBD's new [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=AURLJHH) product early in the session.

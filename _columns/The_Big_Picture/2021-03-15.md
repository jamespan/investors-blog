Growth stocks today showed more muscle. And this time, not all of them came from the New York Stock Exchange.




When you think about new leaders from sectors deemed to benefit from more normalcy in the economy, you're generally thinking of names such as **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), **Hyatt Hotels** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) and department store chain **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)). United stretched its gain from a recent 51.41 buy point in a shallow 10-week cup pattern to more than 18%. But on Monday, some commodity and banking stocks caught their breath.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 staged gains of 0.5% to 0.7%. Both benchmarks shook off light morning declines. And that's what you like to see when the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend. The old saw, "All's well that ends well" means something on Wall Street too.


Volume rose on both the Nasdaq and NYSE, signaling institutional accumulation.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) rose 0.3%. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) also marked its seventh straight up day, ramping up 1.4%.


Strong Finish
-------------

Buying really picked up in the final half-hour of the session, sending the index up more than 1%. At 13,459, the market cap-weighted Nasdaq now even shows a cushion, albeit a small one, above its 50-day moving average.


At the same time, a few tech sectors got off to a solid start to the week.


Looking at MarketSmith's preliminary 197-industry-groups report, oil and gas royalty trust, department store chain, airline, shoe, agricultural chemical, homebuilder and lodging fared best. Each of these groups rallied well more than 2.5%.


Growth Stocks Today
-------------------


But chip and semiconductor equipment firms also had a dandy Monday. Data storage, enterprise software, medical systems, financial software and tech services stocks also advanced more than 1%, early data showed.

A dip in long-term interest rates on Monday appeared to soothe any concerns, for now, that inflation is going to be serious enough to change the Federal Reserve's policy view. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell 2 basis points to 1.62% on Monday; 3-month T-bills held steady at 0.04%.


This Week's Focus: U.S. Central Bank Meeting
--------------------------------------------


Still, interest rates will dominate traders' minds all week. The Fed begins a new two-day meeting on Tuesday. What is absolute right now? The slope of the yield curve, which compares the investment return between short-term U.S. Treasury bills with long-term Treasury bonds, has steepened a lot.


No wonder, then, that banks, which benefit from the spread between the short- and long-term cost of money, have led IBD's [new highs list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-mar-12-2021/) lately.


For instance, 159 banks, 34 finance firms and 15 savings and loans made all-time or 52-week highs, according to IBD's new highs list. (Track the totals and leading sectors each day via [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).) On Friday, more than 900 stocks on the two main exchanges bolted to new highs while only 20 issues marked new lows.


The Stock Market Direction In 2021
----------------------------------


Recent commentary by Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, led by Chief Investment Strategist Brent Schutte, highlights expectations that the current rise in stocks will continue "in the intermediate term but with much broader equity market participation and leadership than has occurred over the prior few years."


One key reason? The September 2018-to-September 2020 period featured a much narrower field of leadership as tariffs on imports, coronavirus and the strength of earnings in tech companies helped define much of the market's behavior.


Over this two-year period, Northwestern Mutual notes that on an equal-weighted basis, the S&P 500 rose just 2.9%. Midcap cyclicals fell 2% and U.S. small caps dropped 9%. However, the tables have turned. Since September last year, U.S. small caps have risen 55%, U.S. midcaps up 38% and the equal-weighted S&P 500 is up 27%.

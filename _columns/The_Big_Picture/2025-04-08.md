It didn't take long for sellers to resume control in the stock market Tuesday after the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 powered higher during the first hour of trade.


The Nasdaq soared 4.6% on hopes the White House would be open to negotiating with some countries over recently announced tariffs. But there's still plenty of uncertainty on the tariff front, especially when it comes to China, which on Friday imposed an additional 34% retaliatory tariff on all goods imported from the U.S.




In response, President Donald Trump on Monday said an additional 50% tariff on U.S. imports from China would go into effect at midnight unless that nation withdraws its retaliatory duties.


In the end, uncertainty about tariffs, including the threat of a trade war with China, fueled a weak performance for the stock indexes. The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 2.2% on the second day of its rally attempt.


After a pink rally day for the S&P 500 Monday, the index erased an intraday gain of nearly 4% and closed lower by 1.6%. It was the first close below the 5,000 level for the benchmark index in nearly one year.


Stock Market Breadth
--------------------


Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq exchange by just over 3-to-1. The ratio was nearly 3-to-1 negative on the New York Stock Exchange. The one bit of good news, at least for stock market bulls, is that volume fell sharply from Monday's levels.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw an intraday gain of nearly 4% disintegrate into a loss of 0.8% by the close. **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was a top gainer in the blue-chip index, up 5.6%. Health insurers like UnitedHealth soared after the Trump administration said it will significantly increase payment rates to Medicare insurers next year.

**JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) also outperformed on the Dow Jones index, up 1%, ahead of its earnings report later in the week. JPMorgan and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) kick off [first-quarter earnings season](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/delta-stock-earnings-jpmorgan-earnings-wells-fargo-earnings/), with results due Friday before the open.


For growth investors holding a lot of cash, IBD growth screens yielded some big percentage gainers during the first hour of trading. Aggressive traders might have opted to nibble at a name like **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), but a buy near 85 during the first hour of trading was severely underwater by the close.

The weak close by Palantir, and several other former leading growth stocks like **Stride** ([LRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRN)), **Guardant Health** ([GH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GH)) and **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) was a reminder to stay on the sidelines. The latter three all got turned away at their 50-day moving averages after early strength.


Bond Yields Rally Again
-----------------------


After soaring 17 basis points Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield rallied another 13 basis points and climbed above its 200-day moving average. China is a big buyer of U.S. bonds, and rumors swirled Monday it was selling.


As concerns grow about a sharper-than-expected slowdown for the U.S. economy, [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) now thinks there's a 72% chance of four quarter-point rate cuts between now and the end of the year.


The stock market has a couple of important economic headlines to navigate the week. The minutes from the March 19 Federal Reserve meeting will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, with the latest reading on consumer prices due Thursday at 8:30 a.m. On a year-over-year basis, core prices are expected to be up 3% in March, down slightly from 3.1% in February.


What To Do Now
--------------


The best game plan now for investors is to stay patient and wait for individual stocks to set up in proper [bases](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/).


Even when stocks were rallying sharply early Tuesday, few if any, stocks were in position to buy. And due to the severity of the recent sell-off, it could stay that way for a while.


As noted above, Tuesday marked the second day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. A big percentage gain in higher volume on the fourth day or later of the rally attempt would qualify as a follow-through day.


But keep in mind that follow-through days can fail, especially when there's not a lot of merchandise to buy. After the recent selling in some gold, insurance and utility stocks, leadership is even more out of focus now.

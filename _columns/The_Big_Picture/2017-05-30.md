The Big Picture: Large-Cap Techs Vs. Small Caps
================================================

 A shortened week of trading kicked off Tuesday with modest losses for the major averages, more weakness in small caps and another day of outperformance for large-cap technology names in the Nasdaq 100.


The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 eased 0.1% each.


Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.8%. After getting resistance near the 1400 level, the small-cap index is now getting resistance near its 50-day moving average.

Economic data got early attention as personal income and spending data revealed a consumer on track for a second-quarter comeback after a not-so-great first quarter. The bond market saw inflows on the news, sending the 10-yield Treasury yield lower by 4 basis points to 2.21%.


The 10-year Treasury yield is getting close to the 2-year yield, prompting discussion of a flattening yield curve and its implications. Lower interest rates sparked losses of nearly 2% Tuesday for Dow components **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)).


The year-to-date performance of FANG stocks has been impressive and has some investors wondering if gains are sustainable.


Headed into Tuesday, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Â **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) showed gains ranging from 25% to 33%. The 33% gain belonged to Amazon, which crossed the 1,000 level Tuesday but closed below it.


The laggard in the group, Alphabet, also looks poised to take out the 1,000 level. Shares closed Tuesday at 996.17.


Some pundits look at the big gains in the FANG stocks and say they're not sustainable. It strengthens the case for a market pullback, they say. But the more calls there are for a market pullback, the less likely it is to happen.


Last week, the latest Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers showed a big increase in the number of editors expecting a near-term correction, to 29% from 24.8% the prior week. The survey acts as a contrarian indicator.


Still, the market uptrend must be respected for now because institutional-quality growth stocks with healthy charts easily have the upper hand over those with unhealthy charts.


The session yielded a few breakouts.


**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) rose 3% to 30.71. It's still in buy range from a 29.97 buy point. **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) cleared an 84.34 buy point ahead of its earnings report Wednesday before the open. Shares rose 2% to 84.80. And **Albany Molecular Research** ([AMRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMRI)) surged 5.5% to 19.85, clearing a cup-shaped base with a 19.45 buy point. The daily chart shows a handle area with a slightly early entry at 18.70.


A few China names underperformed Tuesday. Names like **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) and **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) aren't broken by any means, but look a bit vulnerable.


Good bases should form mostly above the 50-day moving average, but that's not entirely the case with NetEase. Shares lost 1% to 288.46 as it works on a late-stage base with a buy point of 308.76


Momo and TAL fell sharply in higher volume Tuesday. Momo slumped 5%, ending just below its 50-day line. TAL lost 2% as it tests support at the 50-day line.

title: Stocks Inch Up, But This IBD Rating May Say Something About The Market

U.S. stock indexes wandered in a narrow range Thursday, giving neither the bears nor the bulls much to work with.




The Nasdaq ended up 0.3% for the day, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2% each. Small caps, as gauged in the Russell 2000, retreated 0.3%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


The declining turnover, if confirmed, suggested funds weren't particularly active.

However, the two previous put/call signals May 13 and May 23 didn't lead to a lasting bottom.


E Ratings For Stock Indexes
---------------------------


Another technical item that recently came into play is IBD's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Going into Thursday's session, the rating was E on all three major exchanges — the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.


An E rating points to heavy selling, but it has an upside. Research shows that follow-through days that occur when the market is showing an E rating often work.


The last time all three indexes carried E ratings was Jan. 3 — one session before a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) confirmed a new uptrend was underway.


IBD's Market Pulse stayed in a confirmed uptrend for 53 sessions before that rally came under pressure.


Right now, though, the market is not positioned for a follow-through day. Indexes have to rise from a low at least a few days for that to happen.


News-Driven Stock Market
------------------------


In the meantime, bears are relying mostly on the bad news in a news-driven stock market.


The U.S.-China trade war has proved tenacious. Stocks simply haven't made much progress since Jan. 23, 2018, when President Donald Trump first began imposing tariffs.


The chief fear is that tariffs will lead to an economic recession and a sell-off in stocks.


The inverted yield curve — some short-term yields are now higher than long-term yields — is and isn't a concern. Yes, the yield curve has a good record of forecasting recessions. But sometimes it takes as long as one to three years for the recession to arrive.


Predictions with that long of a delay are about as useful as a Ouija board.


Handling The Current Stock Market
---------------------------------


What should the IBD-style investor do in the meantime?


Keep risk low: In a market correction, investors can be tempted to roll the dice on a stock. But trying to pick winners in a correction is a low-percentage game.


Build a watch list around current worries. If the China-U.S. standoff on trade is the problem, build a list of stocks that would benefit if that worry were removed.


Trim positions: Whether that means profit-taking or curbing losses, an investor needs a pile of cash to commit, should the market turn.


Watch the key moving averages: The 50-day and 200 day averages should be monitored daily on both individual stocks and the indexes. At Thursday's close, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were below the 50-day line and fighting to stay above the 200-day line. That sets up the possibility of support appearing at those levels.


Financial News
--------------


The second reading on first quarter GDP topped views, the new reading 3.1% vs. 3% expected. The prior reading was 3.2%.


First-time jobless claims matched the Street's estimate at 215,000.


Exchange Traded Funds
---------------------


In the ETF space, Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 1%, while Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) knifed 0.7% higher. That made for a good day for leading stocks, despite the dull market.


VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF ([REMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REMX)) skidded 3.4%, but was on track for a gain of 1% this week, on top of a 7% rally last week. China's threat to [reduce strategic metals shipments](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/trade-war-tensions-rise-china-threatens-rare-earth-export-ban/) to the U.S. has boosted the strategic metals exchange traded fund.

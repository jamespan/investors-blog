The stock market shook off a clash between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to end Friday higher, though monthly losses were steep. The February jobs report and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) earnings now loom large.


Stocks benefited from a late flood of buying, perhaps due to rebalancing on the final trading day of the month.




The Nasdaq composite fought its way out of negative territory to end Friday up 1.6%. While it fell further below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) amid a 3.5% weekly decline, it managed to find support almost exactly at the 200-day line. The tech-heavy index suffered a 4% decline in February — the worst since April 2024 — and is now down 2.4% for the year.


The S&P 500 also briefly flirted with negative territory before notching a daily gain of 1.6%. However, it fell 1% for the week and is lagging the 50-day average. It appears to be finding support around the 5,830 level, where support also appeared a few times earlier this year. The benchmark index ended the month down 1.4% but retains a slender lift of 1.2% for 2025.


Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and almost 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on both exchanges, an encouraging sign on an up day.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.4% Friday and mainly stood out due to its weekly gain of 1%. It has fought its way back above 50-day line despite falling 1.6% in February. AI play **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) were the best performers, rising 4% and 3.1%, respectively. But the price-weighted index got its biggest contributions from **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), which added a combined 130 points.


Small caps lagged, though the Russell 2000 still notched a daily lift of 1.1% Friday. It remains stuck below its 200-day line amid a February decline of 5.5%. Growth stocks did a bit better, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 1.5% despite a monthly drop of 3.7%.


While stocks have come off postelection highs, such action is common in the months after a new president being inaugurated, according to data from CNBC. But investors should remain on their guard given the choppy market action. Despite Friday's rebound, IBD kept its recommended exposure in the 20%-40% range.


Stocks Shake Off PCE, Trump-Zelenskyy Clash
-------------------------------------------


The stock market had been higher after the personal consumption expenditures price index for January came in as expected. Headline PCE rose 2.5% year-over-year, a slight dip. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, turned in an annualized lift of 2.6%. This year-over-year reading was also down vs. December and came in at the lowest level since March 2021.

Indexes later wobbled following an explosive confrontation between Trump and Zelenskyy. The clash ended with the latter leaving the White House and meant a mineral-rights deal between Ukraine and the U.S. went unsigned.


Zelenskyy said there should be "no compromises" with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin while Trump accused him of "gambling with World War Three."


The coming week sees a full slate of economic data, with the S&P final U.S. manufacturing PMI and construction spending data dropping Monday, the Fed Beige Book Wednesday and the U.S. trade deficit for January dropping Thursday.


But the key theme of the week is labor data, with the ADP employment report for February coming Wednesday and the all-important U.S. jobs report due Friday.


And while earnings season is drawing to a close, [a number of noteworthy reports are due](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/broadcom-stock-hit-by-sellers-earnings-costco-best-buy-earnings/). The likes of **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Marvell** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) are set to post results amid tech-sector selling. Retailers such as **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) also are in the days ahead.


Duolingo Plummets After Earnings
--------------------------------


All 11 [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday in positive territory](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Financials, technology and consumer discretionary stocks fared best while real estate plays made the slimmest gains.



Once again, those seeking deeper insight into the action on the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) could get it by examining the relative performance of IBD's 197 industry groups.


Generic drug stocks, integrated computer systems plays, a variety of oil and gas plays, and insurance brokers were among the best performers.


On the flip side, hospitals, solar stocks, drug stores, data storage companies and computer hardware plays all lagged.


Educational software stocks were also hammered after IBD 50 name **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) plummeted on disappointing guidance. It ended the session down 17% and flashed sell signals by undercutting its 50-day moving average and falling more than 7% below a 378.48 entry.

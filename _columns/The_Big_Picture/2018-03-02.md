Stocks ended three days of aggressive selling as the Nasdaq rubbed out early losses Friday and posted a strong gain.




 The Nasdaq rose 1.1% after being down 1.3%. The S&P 500 gained 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.3%.


The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.7%. With small caps outperforming, this proxy of growth and more-speculative assets gave the market something to cheer. Also encouraging were the index's reversals, especially the Nasdaq's. The composite found support at the 50-day moving average, making its positive reversal soon after it dipped below the line.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and according to preliminary data also fell on the NYSE.

Tuesday that appeared so. On Thursday, though, President Trump's call for a 10% tariff on aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on steel imports slammed the stock market.


A few market watchers insisted that the tariffs were no big deal, since steel represents just 1% of total goods imported into the U.S.


However, that overlooks the fact that trade wars aren't easily contained. Countries can retaliate. Products involved can spread.


Regardless of how the tariff issue plays out, bears are using it to apply pressure to the market's uptrend.


Let's consider some of the other key faceoffs between bears and bulls.


**Advantage bears, distribution days:** The stock market suffered three days of heavy selling during the week. Funds left clear footprints at the exits, and it wasn't all tariff driven. The uptrend is now under pressure. Another blow could knock the stock market back into correction.

**Advantage bulls, distribution in the indexes:** Going into Friday's session, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each had an E Accumulation/Distribution Rating, the weakest. Counterintuitively this sometimes foreshadows rallies — in other words, the selling is nearly exhausted. E ratings across the board haven't been the case since June 27, 2016, just before the Nasdaq launched a rally that lifted the index 63% over the next six months.


**Advantage bears, new highs vs. new lows:** New lows outnumbered new highs in 12 of February's 19 sessions. The scarcity of new highs is a troubling sign for IBD-style growth investors.


**Advantage bulls, the put-call ratio:** On Thursday, the put-call ratio closed at 1.17. Readings of 1.15 and higher often mark a short-term bottom in the market.


Breakouts were scarce Friday. Online real estate data provider **Zillow** ([Z](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Z)) broke out, but volume was moderate.

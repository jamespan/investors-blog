Stock Market Rally Gains Pace As These Hopes Rise; Casino Stocks Hit The Jackpot
=================================================================================

The latest stock market rally quickened its pace Friday as inflation worries eased.




The Nasdaq turned in the strongest gain as it spiked 3.3%. It ended the week up a muscular 7.5%. Nevertheless, it is still stuck below the 10-week moving average and is down almost 27% for the year.


The S&P 500 also impressed with a 3.1% gain. But while it rose 6.6% for the week it remains stuck below its major moving averages. It did recapture the 10-day line, though.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was encouraging, with all ending solidly higher. Materials and communication services were the two standouts, with financials not far behind.


Blue chips also partook in the rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.7%, with **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) the top components.


Small Caps Shine; Stock Market Outlook Changes
----------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP062422-300x284.jpg)The Russell 2000 ended the day up 3.2%, enough to end the week solidly higher. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), saw gains fade late as it rose 1.7%.


A volume spike due to rebalancing on the Russell indexes was enough to force a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). The rally confirmation signal means IBD's market outlook has now changed to a confirmed uptrend.


Investors should note that volume had been running lower prior to the final minutes of trading, when index changes caused trading to soar. This is a reason to exercise extra caution, and get back into stocks carefully. Indexes also remains near lows for the year, and many stocks remain badly damaged.


Inflation Gauge Offers Encouragement; Retail Earnings Key
---------------------------------------------------------


The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index was revised down Friday to a record low of 50 for June. This was lower than the preliminary estimate of 50.2. Analysts had expected no revisions. The index had came in at 58.4 for May.


In addition, the inflation expectations for the year ahead eased to 5.3% in June. This was down from a preliminary reading of 5.4%. This raises hopes inflation may be peaking.


Federal Reserve hawk James Bullard also said recession fears are overdone, further emboldening investors.


It remains too early to say whether this is another head fake before a further leg down, but Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya thinks forthcoming earnings reports are key.


"This could still be a bear market rally, but that might change if we get some less pessimistic outlooks from some major retailers next week," he said in a note to clients.


The likes of **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) and **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)) are all set to report.

Casino Stocks Hit The Jackpot
-----------------------------


With the stock market gathering steam, it is especially important to note the top performing industry groups.


Periodicals, oil and gas drillers and department stores were among the best performers. Casino stocks also caught the eye with a powerful surge.


**Penn National Gaming** ([PENN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PENN)) and **Caesars Entertainment** ([CZR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CZR)) were among the top S&P 500 stocks Friday, both rising almost 13%.

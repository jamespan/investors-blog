Transports Beat Nasdaq, S&P 500; Why A 4th Nasdaq Distribution Day Was Not Bearish
===================================================================================

Major indexes took a well-needed rest, and comments by President Donald Trump showing frustration over the progress of U.S.-China trade talks gave institutions the excuse for taking profits. Transports outperformed as oil stocks plunged. Overall, Tuesday's decline did not impact the [current outlook for stocks](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).




The Nasdaq composite fell 0.4%, while the S&P 500 eased 0.3%. Volume rose on both main exchanges. This means that both key indexes registered a new distribution day, or instance of unusually heavy professional selling.


But was it top growth stocks that shouldered the brunt of Tuesday's selling? Certainly not.


One piece of evidence? Check out Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)). The growth stock-focused ETF finally broke a streak of five up days in a row with a 2-cent loss, or less than 0.1%, to 35.81. At that closing price, FFTY's year-to-date gain of 29.6% still sharply exceeds a 19.8% advance by the S&P 500 over the same time frame.

CLOSE




The Nasdaq composite, finishing the day at 8222, holds a 23.9% gain since Jan. 1.


As seen in the Market Pulse table, four distribution days on the Nasdaq is a significant number. But among those four declines in higher volume, only the June 25 session showed a drop of 1% or more. (That day, the Nasdaq sank 1.5%.)



The S&P 500 has logged three distribution days since the Day 4 follow-through by the Nasdaq on June 7. The average drop in those three sessions? A manageable 0.6%.


The third quarter has so far been rosy for U.S. equities.


After delivering a blistering gain of 17.3% in the first half of 2019, the 500 has already climbed as much as 2.5% since the start of the current quarter.


If you are a news junkie, you've likely seen numerous headlines bemoaning the likelihood that [we're set to post the weakest growth in S&P 500 earnings since 2016](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/growth-stocks-show-superior-q2-estimates/). And that may be true. However, always remember that the market looks ahead, as much as six to 12 months into the future.

Are the thousands of professional money managers on the planet only now beginning to weigh the possibility that profits in Corporate America will be dull? Absolutely not. They're now looking for surprises in quarterly results — both to the upside and downside.


It's still early in new quarterly results this season, but surprises are already popping.


Earnings Rush And The Transports
--------------------------------


Check out **Canadian Pacific Railway** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)), the Calgary-based railroad. Shares roared ahead almost 9% to a new all-time high. Volume heated up 165% above its 50-day average.


Q2 earnings jumped 37% to $3.29 a share, throttling the consensus estimate of $2.45. Revenue accelerated 14% to $1.51 billion.



The average top-line increase over the prior six quarters: up 8.3%.


The strong gain lifted CP's profit from a breakout at 210.37 in a [large cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) to 17%.


That means CP is getting closer to triggering a key offense-type sell rule: [Take at least partial gains when your gain reaches 20% to 25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/). The thinking here: You are raising cash to put into an even stronger growth stock. Plus, you avoid the inevitable correction that eats away at your paper gains. Of course, when you have conviction you can decide to hold longer. Numerous leading stocks have been able to break out, make terrific gains, stage a mild correction, and break out yet again.


**Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) stand out as current examples. All five belong to [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) or have a spot in key stocks lists including [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders).


After the close, Canadian Pacific's U.S. peer **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) fell 6% in extended hours trading. Its earnings rose 7% to $1.08 a share, missing the Refinitiv forecast by 3 cents. Revenue slipped 1% to $3.06 billion, halting a four-quarter streak of top-line gains.


The Dow Jones transports outperformed Tuesday, rising 1.8%. The Russell 2000 ended up less than 1 point. Crude oil futures tanked more than 3%.

The Nasdaq composite set record highs Wednesday, leading the stock market in the wake of the Federal Reserve's latest policy statement. Top growth stocks **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) broke out past new buy points.




The Nasdaq rose 0.5% to handily outperform the other major stock indexes. The S&P 500 inched up 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved down 0.1%. Among the Dow 30, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) advanced 2.4% to add some space above its key 50-day line. Microsoft is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) member.


The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.4%, while leading growth stocks outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.6% on Wednesday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) was the top performer, with an 8.3% advance. Shares are forming a double bottom with a 45.28 buy point. A flaw is the stock's lagging relative strength line.


Volume was slightly higher compared with Tuesday's session on the Nasdaq. Preliminary data also showed higher NYSE volume.


Nasdaq Outperforms
------------------


![MP121620](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP121620-218x300.jpg)The Nasdaq hit a record high Wednesday, extending a win streak to three sessions and erasing last week's modest loss. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 indexes are just shy of all-time highs.


The Federal Reserve [opted to maintain the status quo](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-federal-reserve-resists-easier-money-dow-jones/), while resisting some calls for easier policy. The Fed statement said asset purchases would continue at least at current levels until there's "substantial further progress" toward inflation and employment targets.


The Nasdaq was higher before the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement. After some volatility on the news, the composite and S&P 500 climbed until both indexes gave back some ground in the final 20 minutes of trading.


The Nasdaq shows just two days of institutional selling. While the S&P 500 shows a more elevated [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count at five, [Monday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-tech-in-favor-as-small-caps-nasdaq-lead-stocks/) noted the Nasdaq has mostly avoided institutional selling, while top growth stocks continue to act well.


That trend continued Wednesday. Despite the mostly quiet action on the major stock indexes, there were several high-profile advances. Chipotle, DraftKings and Shopify broke out past new buy points. **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) continued to rebound from its 10-week moving average, while **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) advanced to new highs.


The continuing presence of strong breakouts is an encouraging sign for the stock market uptrend.

New Breakouts: Chipotle, DraftKings, Shopify
--------------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Chipotle Mexican Grill broke out above a 1,366.76 buy point in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/) with a 4.1% advance in big volume. Volume rose nearly 100% above average. Shares ended the session in the 5% buy zone, which goes up to 1,435.10.


Early Wednesday, Stiflel Nicolaus upgraded Chipotle to buy from hold and raised the price target to 1,500 from 1,400. Chipotle [shows an 80](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg.aspx) out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


DraftKings broke out above a 53.82 entry in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), advancing more than 6.5% Wednesday. Shares closed just below the buy point. Volume was slightly below average, a weak spot for the breakout.


Shopify broke out past a [cup-with-handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) 1,112.51 buy point amid a nearly 8% surge Wednesday. Volume more than doubled vs. its average, indicating strong institutional demand.


Stocks To Watch: Nio, PayPal
----------------------------


Tesla rival Nio rebounded from its 10-week moving average line — a key support level — with a 6.2% rise Tuesday. Shares added to Tuesday's gains, rising 2.7% Wednesday. A potential flaw is the lack of strong volume during this week's rebound.


The Chinese EV leader is a recent [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) addition.


Meanwhile, PayPal's Nov. 25 breakout above a 215.93 entry in a cup base gained some momentum. Shares advanced 3.9% Wednesday. The stock moved past the 5% buy zone that topped out at 226.73. KeyCorp raised its price target on PayPal to 235 from 215.

Monday was a quiet session for the stock market despite plenty of headlines, including President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland. But the Nasdaq marked a mild distribution day, and breadth disappointed.




**JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) outperformed in the Dow Jones industrial average, while **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100. But shares of Netflix plunged 13% in after-hours trading after the company missed domestic and international subscriber growth forecasts. Invesco QQQ Trust, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, fell 0.7% in after-hours trading.


All in all, it wasn't a bad session for the stock market as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite traded in a tight intraday range. But declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by a close to 2-to-1 ratio.


Stock Market Resilient
----------------------


At the close the Nasdaq composite eased 0.3%, the S&P 500 lost 0.1% and the Dow Jones picked up 0.2%. Small caps lagged badly as the Russell 2000 lost 0.5%. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume coming in higher than Friday. Nasdaq volume edged higher, resulting in a modest distribution day for the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP_5x3_071618.jpg)The S&P 500 closed above the 2,800 level Friday but ended just below it Monday. The Dow, meanwhile, closed above the 25,000 level for the second straight session.


The stock market had plenty of other headlines to ponder Monday, including a sharp drop in oil prices, decent retail sales data and outperformance by financials stocks.


Oil Stocks Lag
--------------


U.S. crude oil futures settled at $68.06 a barrel, down more than 4%. Sentiment was negative after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said some oil buyers could get waivers to continue buying oil from Iran. The comments came after the U.S. recently asked allies to stop importing oil from Iran.


**Whiting Petroleum** ([WLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLL)), **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) and **Murphy Oil** ([MUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUR)) took big hits.


In economic news, June retail sales were mostly in line with expectations, but big revisions to May data reinforced the notion that the U.S. economy is on solid ground. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) retailer **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) had a good day, up 2% to 103.43. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name is working on a flat base with a 104.09 buy point.


Financial Stocks Lead
---------------------


Meanwhile, a decent earnings report from **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) early Monday fueled a rally in financial stocks as the Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) added 1.8%. Shares of Bank of America jumped 4%. It's the third highest-weighted stock in the exchange-traded fund.


Earnings reports Friday from **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) didn't stir much excitement in the sector.


IBD 50 component **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) helped the super regional bank industry group to a 1.8% gain. Shares rose 2.4%, but like most other financials, SVB Financial is below its 50-day moving average as it consolidates gains.


ZTO Express Breaks Out
----------------------


Top gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com) include **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)). It cleared a flat base with a 21.80 buy point with conviction, soaring 8.8% to 22.43 in strong volume.



Another China name outperformed after reclaiming its 10-week moving average last week in higher volume. Shares of **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) added 2.3%.


Breadth might have been disappointing Monday, but when it comes to overall market health, things still look OK. The distribution day count for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq is smaller than it was, and sell signals are few and far between among leading growth stocks.


Still, the scare headlines are out there almost on a daily basis. Last week, Morgan Stanley predicted the yield curve will invert by the middle of 2019 but stopped short of saying the U.S. economy would slip into recession.


For now, it's best to focus on price and volume in the major stock indexes along with the price action of leading growth stocks. For the bulls, there's plenty to like in this regard, although Netflix looks poised for a harsh break of its 50-day moving average Tuesday.

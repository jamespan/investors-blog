title: Bears Own The Day But Where's The Money Going?

Bears interrupted the Nasdaq's nearly seven-week uptrend Thursday, slapping the stock market with stinging losses in rising volume.




The Nasdaq lost 1.2%, after being down as much as 1.9%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9% each. Small caps as gauged in the Russell 2000 shed 0.8%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges, pinning a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.


The big losses in rising volume pointed to institutional selling.


Follow-Up Questions
-------------------


Bulls and bears alike are inclined to pursue follow-up questions on a day of sizable losses. Why did the stock market go down? And where is the money going?


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MP020719-274x300.jpg)The first question is easy to answer: The market went down because there were more funds selling than buying. That might sound too simple, but there's wisdom in simplicity.


In most instances, a stock trader will find more useful guidance in price-and-volume action than in speculation on why something is happening. On Thursday, funds were selling, and individual investors should stay focused.


For those who insist on more convoluted explanations, three possible news catalysts were fairly clear Thursday.


Touchy And Skittish Session
---------------------------


First, the European Commission lowered its estimate for eurozone growth in 2019 from 1.9% to 1.3%. This set the bulls on edge, even if it wasn't enough to start a panic.


Second, CNBC reported that a meeting on trade involving President Donald Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping before the early March deadline is unlikely. Trump later confirmed the report.


Third, White House advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox News that Trump is considering a new round of tax cuts. But the market didn't appear to react much to the tax-cut remarks.


The negative news found a welcome in a touchy and skittish session.


Follow The Money
----------------


As stocks sold off, the second question — a much more difficult question — emerged. Where is all this money going?


A look at IBD's 197 industry groups found the day's selling was chiefly among the lowly-rated oil and auto-related stocks.


Meanwhile, buying was concentrated in medical long-term care, homebuilders, gaming software and restaurant stocks.


Cash is another possible destination, but there's no way to track cash on an immediate basis.


The uptrend that began after the Christmas Eve closing low has endured some harsh price losses along the way. The Nasdaq fell by 1% or more on three separate occasions, not including Thursday.


Each time the Nasdaq resumed its advance.


Breakouts Thursday
------------------


Stocks moving past buy points and then holding the gain were scarce Thursday. Dating services provider **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) broke out but then reversed back into the base. Ditto for child care provider **Bright Horizons Family Solutions** ([BFAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BFAM)).


Breakouts that appeared to be working included nursing facilities operator **Ensign Group** ([ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)), **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), **IAC** ([IAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAC)) and **Piedmont Office Realty** ([PDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDM)).


Headline Grabber
----------------


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) grabbed headlines Thursday as the stock cleared a consolidation dating to August after a strong earnings report.


The buy point, though, was cleared in the week ended Jan. 11. The entry point was 501.08. Volume was 41% above average that week. The stock was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) using an alternative entry at 544.


The Big Picture [alerted readers to Chipotle's improved condition Dec. 28](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dow-jones/) and to the [breakout in the week ended Jan. 11](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-questions-answers/). The stock is up about 17% for those who acted on the double-bottom buy point.

Stock Market Endures Chop Fest As Small Caps Outperform; Is Value Investing Truly Dead?
========================================================================================

Perhaps the most important number for the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?)? It had nothing to do with any individual stock or index. Perhaps you could argue it was this plain number: 4.




Institutions sold long-dated U.S. government bonds heavily. This meant the yield, or price-based return, on these fixed income securities went up. And the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note briefly reached 4% for the first time since Nov. 10.


According to Cboe data, the 10-year note's yield closed at 3.99%, up 7 basis points.


On Jan. 1, the yield began the year at 3.87%. Then it plunged over the next 4-1/2 weeks amid optimism that the Federal Reserve was poised to raise interest rates in much smaller increments than during its torrid pace of 2022. At one point, the yield hit as low as 3.33% before the current rebound.

You've probably heard neighbors or financial planners express any host of emotions — shock, relief, satisfaction, to name a few — at the fact that investors with savings can actually get a decent nominal rate of return in savings accounts, fixed-term certificates of deposit, and now U.S. government bonds.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP030123_3-192x300.jpg)Of course, the real return — after accounting for higher prices — remains dicey. After all, who knows how much, and when, will the rate of inflation come down in 2023?


That question seemed glued on equity traders' foreheads all day on Wednesday. Major indexes in the stock market seemed to shake off bearish emotions after some economic data hit the wires, starting at 9:45 a.m. ET and 15 minutes after that. The latest February reports on the Purchasing Managers' Manufacturing Index (PMI) and the ISM survey highlighted another month of slowing activity across the nation's factories.


Plus, U.S. construction spending edged 0.1% lower in January vs. the [Econoday view](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for a 0.2% gain month on month. Not surprisingly, December's revision showed construction spending falling 0.7%, worse than the preliminary 0.4% drop.


However, prices paid subindexes of Wednesday's manufacturing reports pointed to the specter of inflation, at least at the wholesale level.


Rearing Its Ugly Head Again?
----------------------------


According to Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)), the Institute for Supply Management survey showed that input prices budged up in February, yet remained lower than September levels. "I don't think this is cause for concern yet but it could be the beginning of the reversal in price declines since October," Roach wrote in a comment emailed to IBD.


LPL stock, meanwhile, showed resilience on Wednesday, bucking general malaise across the major indexes. The [new addition to Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) rose 1.7% to 253.80, edging above a 250.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [nearly 14-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


The investment advisory giant's industry group, Finance-Investment Banks, also outperformed on the day. Its price-weighted gain of 0.4% beat a 0.7% decline for the Nasdaq and a nearly 0.5% dip for the S&P 500. Small caps outperformed. The Russell 2000 edged up 0.1%. Midcaps did even better; the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund lifted 0.2%.


As you can see in the accompanying Market Pulse table, more [CAN SLIM-quality stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) rose in heavy turnover than those that fell significantly in above-average trading. Credit it to strength in the smaller companies in terms of market capitalization.



Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 5-point rise on Wednesday, despite a continued plunge by its component and stock market giant **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)).


HD shares fell 5.75 points to 290.79 and sank further below the [long-term 200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). Its rival **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) slumped 5.6% in more than triple average volume despite reporting a healthy 28% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter profit. Sales edged up 5%. That matched the best increase over the past seven quarters.


Home Depot joined nine other members of the Dow Jones 30 with losses of 1 point or more. On the upside, **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) paced the winners with a 9-point gain. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), another Dow Jones component, shot 16% higher in extended hours. The enterprise software giant reported quarterly results after the close that smashed fiscal Q4 earnings views. The company boosted its share buyback plan to $20 billion.


Will This Sector Grow Cold?
---------------------------



While the major indexes still hold gains since Jan. 1, the recent pullback within the giant retail sector should give long investors some reason for concern.


Consider SPDR S&P Retail ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)). In January, XRT had a brilliant run. But today, it's poised to mark a third weekly decline in four weeks. At 65.32, the fund has taken out its 50-day moving average and squeezed its 2023 advance to 8%. After the Feb. 2 close, XRT was up as much as 25%. In other words, this isn't an ordinary pullback.


On Wednesday, the stock market also showed worsening breadth, a bad sign.


Early data showed losing stocks outnumber winners on the Nasdaq by a 5-4 ratio. Not a huge difference. Yet, in a confirmed uptrend, you'd prefer to see more stocks rising than falling on a frequent basis. On the NYSE, the gap was smaller; decliners nearly reached 1,800 while gainers fell to around 1,400.


Beyond The Stock Market: Is Value Investing Dead?
-------------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, CNBC on Wednesday interviewed famed hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who sullenly declared that value investing is dead. Do others agree?


Some commentators quickly pointed out that the gigantic growth of passive index funds has certainly pushed active fund managers on the ropes in terms of performance. Numerous studies point to the fact that the far majority of mutual funds, after fees, do not outperform the S&P 500 and other popular stock market indexes.


Meanwhile, IBD readers might agree that from 2021 to today, the very idea of a "growth" stock and a "value" stock has been turned on its head. Specifically, some believe that the FAANG companies, after getting slaughtered in 2022, have become a "good value."


On the other end, oil stocks had underperformed for many years. But the big bout of inflation in 2021 and 2022 served like human growth hormone for certain commodity giants.


Yet don't forget that commodity stocks are also highly cyclical. **Shell** ([SHEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHEL)) is having a fine start in 2023. But its earnings, which ballooned from $1.24 a share in 2020 to $10.86 in 2022, are seen shrinking 16% this year and falling another 6% in 2024.


James Dorment, manager of the $700 million Voya Large Cap Value Fund (IEDAX), notes that dividend payers still may offer good value. Why? "They tend to reside in the more cash-generative ... companies," Dorment told IBD. "Stocks with higher dividend yields — utilities, REITs, some staples — on the other hand, may lag as investors favor high yield bonds as a lower risk alternative."


Shell's annualized dividend yield of 3.4% still beats the S&P 500's yield of 1.7% by a mile.


Meanwhile, the Russell indexes indicate that growth is having a stronger start this year than value.


The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) ETF, down 0.6% on Wednesday, remains up 6.4% since Jan. 1. That exceeds a 1.2% gain for iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) over the same time frame. Over the past 12 months, though, IWD has fallen less (-3.7%) than IWF (-13.5%).

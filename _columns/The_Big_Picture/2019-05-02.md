Dow Jones, S&P 500 Pace Mild Drop; Stock Market Shows This Subtle Improvement
==============================================================================

The major benchmarks for tracking large caps took a well deserved break. The S&P 500 logged a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). But the [current stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) showed a bit more technical improvement in a key sector for equities — the small caps.




The S&P 500 notched its third instance of unusually strong profit taking, technically. A 0.2% loss in higher turnover on the NYSE vs. the prior session is the [definition of distribution](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). On Thursday, the S&P 500 met that definition.


But within the context of the day's action, the "distribution day" may have given a falsely bearish signal.


Daily charts are key to every savvy growth investor's toolbox. And as seen in the [daily chart of the S&P 500](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nyse-s-and-p-500-index-0sandp5.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily), the index actually finished in the upper half of the session's range. The midpoint of the intraday range: 2916.09. The S&P 500 finished slightly above that.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP_3x3_050219-241x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.2%. Volume on the all-electronic exchange edged lower, eliminating the chance of a new distribution day.


One Reason Why The Stock Market Drop Was Minimal
------------------------------------------------


The small loss by the key indexes resulted in part to a strong reaction to the 3.1% slide in U.S. crude oil futures. Naturally, you'd expect the energy sector to react. Around two dozen industry groups within the IBD's 197 fell 1.5% or more, and six hailed from the oil and gas sector. The alternative energy industry group fell 2.1%.


Other notable industry groups that fell 1% or more? Count specialty enterprise software, solar, lodging and desktop software.


On the other hand, at least 40 groups — more than one fifth of the entire 197 industries — rallied 1% or more. (See a daily update of the performance of every IBD industry group at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.)


No wonder, then, that the key indexes did not fall that much. Plus, the strength in some of these industry groups spilled over into positive finishes for the S&P SmallCap 600 (up almost 0.3%), the S&P MidCap 400 (up 0.2%) and the Russell 2000 (up 0.4%).


What's more, the Russell 2000 has been traversing on the north side of its long-term 200-day moving average in recent weeks. That's a key shift from earlier this year, when the index bumped its head against the 200-day and bowed lower.


The S&P 600 remains mildly below its 200-day moving average. (See the 200-day line drawn in black in every [MarketSmith daily chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).)


The Beauty Of This Key Sell Rule
--------------------------------



No doubt, the past several days have seen numerous top stocks get hammered immediately following quarterly results. Sell-offs by the likes of former [Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **SS&C Technologie**s ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)), smartphone and desktop notifications innovator **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and new issue **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) give stark reminders of the value of the [20% to 25% profit-taking rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/).


Of course, there have been plenty of exceptions. A few top names in the enterprise software sector have shot higher on good earnings surprises. And if you have ironlike conviction in a stock that's acting well, you can get a little more greedy and decide to snatch some profits at the 30%, 40% or 50% level.


Yet the market's recovery in 2019 has been pretty breathtaking. Amid ongoing debate and concerns over hot-button issues such as inflation, the trade war, the country's debt mountain and peak profit margins, a pause at this point would not be unwarranted.



Howard Silverblatt at S&P notes that the S&P 500's four-month gain of 17.5% marks the best start since the first four months of 1987. You know what happened in October that year.


Post-Fed Market; What's Next?
-----------------------------


The Nasdaq sold off hard on Wednesday after some market observers took Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments after no change in the federal funds rate as indicating there's very little or no chance of a cut in short-term interest rates.


The veteran IBD reader may also think expectations of a rate cut would be silly in the face of a bullish economic report last week; the first reading on [first-quarter U.S. GDP](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) came in at 3.2% growth. That marks an *acceleration* from the 2.2% increase for the fourth quarter of 2018.


Strategist: Don't Wish For A Rate Cut Now
-----------------------------------------


Seema Shah, senior global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors, notes that historically a first rate cut tends to be negative for equities. Why? It indicates that the economy is weak and the Federal Reserve is taking action to promote growth.


Consider the third quarter of 2007.


On Sept. 18 that year, the Fed slashed the fed funds rate by 50 basis points, or a half point, to 4.75%. It marked the first reduction in the short-term cost of money in more than four years. From June 2004 to June 2006, the U.S. central bank jacked up the fed funds rate by 400 basis points to 5.25%.


In the decade, after a long run-up that began with a [key follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) in March 2003, the S&P 500 peaked at 1576 in October 2007.


By March 2009, the 500 dived to as low as 666, down more than 57% from its then all-time peak.


"I think growth is front-loaded in the first half in the U.S., but I don't see a recession in the U.S. The reason is that it will be lifted by China. I am somewhat more optimistic on Europe and China than others," Shah told IBD in an interview at the [Milken Institute Global Conference](http://www.milkeninstitute.org/) that ended Wednesday in Beverly Hills, Calif. She adds that with the 70th anniversary of the Oct. 1, 1949, founding of the People's Republic of China this year, the government will do all it can to prevent a sharp slowdown in economic growth.



The Sector Leaders stock list, up more than 30% year to date on a price-weighted basis, has recently seen the entrance of **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)), an expert in China-based e-commerce. Baozun is working on a new ultra-deep cup. On the positive side, since late March the small cap has logged three up weeks in heavy volume.


According to [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-baozun-inc-cl-a-ads-bzun.aspx), Baozun has raised its [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) to a sharp 98 on a scale of 1 (like mud) to 99 (like magic).


A Growth-Focused ETF To Watch
-----------------------------


The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) ETF took a little more selling heat. The young exchange traded fund fell 0.5%. That marked a third straight loss. Yet at 20.37, its 17.1% gain since Jan. 1 still hammers the Dow Jones' 12.8% advance.

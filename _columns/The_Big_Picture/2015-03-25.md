Persistently mild distribution in the broad market turned harsh Wednesday as major averages dropped sharply in higher volume.

  

The selling also found its way into leading stocks in leading industry groups, putting the market uptrend back under pressure.

  

The Nasdaq slumped 2.4%. It's still above its 50-day moving average, but it was the tech index's largest daily percentage decline since it lost 3.1% on April 10. The S&P 500 lost 1.5%. It closed about 6 points below its 50-day moving average. The IBD 50 fell 3.3%.

  

On the Nasdaq, declining stocks swamped advancers by nearly 4-to-1. The ratio was close to 3-to-1 on the NYSE.

  

Volume surged on the Nasdaq, partly due to huge volume in Nasdaq-listed **Kraft Foods** ([KRFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRFT)). Shares jumped 36% on news it's merging with **Heinz** ([HNZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HNZ)). Even if Kraft had traded average volume, Nasdaq volume still would have risen considerably from Tuesday.

  

The answer to the question "Why did the market go down Wednesday?" isn't as important as the simple understanding that the session was another day of institutional selling. It's really all that matters when gauging market health.

  

A rising dollar, the precipitous drop in oil, Greece's financial problems and worries about the Fed's first rate hike are often blamed for market weakness. What we know right now is that the distribution-day count in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq is alarmingly high. Persistent distribution in the market makes it difficult to make money in stocks. For this reason, an increased cash position makes sense.

  

The biotech group, the No. 1-ranked group in IBD's database headed into Wednesday, slumped 5.3%. It was the largest one-day percentage decline since a 5.9% drop nearly one year ago (April 10). Leaders in the group like **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) took big hits in heavy volume.

  

Market-leading chip stocks also got thrashed. Chipmakers like **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) and **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) fell hard. Sellers also had their way with fabless firms like **Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)).

  

Oil and gas stocks were a bright spot. May crude oil ended at $49.21 a barrel, up $1.70, or 3.6%. Eight out of the 10 best-performing groups in IBD's database were oil- and gas-related. Drillers and exploration and production firms fared the best.

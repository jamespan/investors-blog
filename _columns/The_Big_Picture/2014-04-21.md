Stocks kicked off a heavy week of earnings on a positive note Monday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rising for a fifth straight session.

  

Despite some morning volatility, the Nasdaq ended with a 0.6% gain. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4%. Both closed right at their session highs, extending a recent pattern of strong finishes. The S&P 500 is in its longest win streak of the year.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.2%.

  

Volume fell sharply across the board. Generally, it is better to see gains in higher volume. But Thursday's trade, which was boosted by options expirations, made for a tough comparison. Breadth was positive, with winners beating losers by about 3-to-2 on both major exchanges.

  

Leaders showed good action. About 36 stocks in the IBD 50 scored gains. The index of leading stocks climbed 1.1%, outperforming the main indexes.

  

**Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)), which has seen solid accumulation recently, bolted to a new high in the regular session. Shares took off after-hours on a Wall Street Journal report that the Botox-maker was being pursued by **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) and activist investor Bill Ackman.

  

Allergan was ranked No. 45 in Monday's IBD. 

  

While Monday marked another day of progress for the major indexes, the market remains in a correction. The best thing to do is to continue building your watch list with stocks building bases or setting up secondary buying opportunities. Be ready to buy the best stocks from leading industry groups when the market follows through.

  

One thing investors can do is go through the rankings of 197 industry groups and see which are making headway. (The full list is published every Monday.) Chipmakers and auto-related groups are among those marching higher.

  

From the Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) is bouncing off support at its 50-day moving average. 

  

**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) is in an 18-week-old consolidation, but it's a risky late-stage pattern.

  

In the auto sector, **Tenneco** ([TEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEN)) is forming a base-on-base pattern with a 62.85 buy point. The stock regained its 10-week line last week.

  

This will be a heavy week of earnings, with about 159 companies in the S&P 500 reporting results.

  

Some big caps such as **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)) and **Kimberly-Clark** ([KMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMB)) already delivered better-than-expected earnings before Monday's open. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) also beat earnings views. (See [story](http://news.investors.com/technology/042114-697801-nflx-stock-up-on-q1-earnings-subscription-price-increase.htm).)

  

A few IBD 50 stocks were also set to release results this week, including **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)). Both are expected to increase earnings about 100% from a year ago when they report Wednesday and Friday, respectively.

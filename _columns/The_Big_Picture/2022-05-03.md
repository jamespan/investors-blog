Mild action on the stock market is often the calm before the storm ahead of big news. And that looked to be the case Tuesday, when indexes struggled to move decisively as the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve kicked off.




Indexes were pogoing within a tight range throughout the session, and while indexes managed to build slightly on Monday's gains the move was far from decisive.


The S&P 500 ended up as the best major index of the day, closing up 0.5%. It remains rooted below its 50-day moving average but is trying to find its feet once again. [The S&P sectors closed mostly positive](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/), with energy the biggest winner. Consumer discretionary and consumer staples were the only laggards.


It was a disappointing day for the Nasdaq. It closed up just 0.2%, about the middle of the day's price range. It remains below all its moving averages as it continues to toil.

Small Caps Excel As Growth Stocks Lead
--------------------------------------


Small caps managed to outperform. The Russell 2000 saw gains fade but still closed up 0.9%.


Growth stocks outperformed also, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) up 1.4%. The fund has lost more than a quarter of its value so far in 2022, which is a far worse performance than the S&P 500.


Meanwhile, the bond market was mixed. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note slid 2 basis points to 2.97% but it remains well up on last week.


Fed Meeting: Can Powell Thread Inflation Needle?
------------------------------------------------


The latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee kicked off on Tuesday. With inflation skyrocketing, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has made no secret of his inclination to meet the challenge head-on.


He has heavily telegraphed a 0.5% hike in interest rates. The central bank is also set to finally get to grips with its mammoth balance sheet starting in June.


The post-meeting news conferences have often served as a platform for Powell to serve up soothing words to calm investor worries. He needs to strike a delicate balance between being keen to tackle inflation without sounding excessively hawkish on rates.


National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan thinks Powell could succeed in acting as a stock market whisperer once again.


"The anticipation of a change in policy seems to be more powerful than the actual event," he said in a note to clients. "When the Fed hiked rates back in March, the S&P 500 went on to rally about 10% in the weeks after the meeting. We would not be surprised to see a similar pattern after this week's meeting, as markets seem to sell on rumors, and buy on news."

Education Play Hits This Stock Market Group
-------------------------------------------


Investors should always be tracking the best and worst industry groups in any given session.


On Tuesday the top performers were consumer loan stocks, coal plays and a variety of areas within the oil sector. Drillers and domestic explorers fared particularly well.



Among the worst performers were travel booking stocks, database plays and lodging companies. The latter group includes both **Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)) and **Hilton Worldwide** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)), two leaders that were down in big volume.


Another notable loser was the education software group. The key loser here was **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)). It was smashed just over 30% after the firm served up weak guidance for Q2 and the full year.


Chegg had been a big pandemic winner as stay-at-home students flocked to their products. It now sits 43% below its 50-day moving average and is now about 85% off its February 2021 high of 115.21.


The disparity between earnings and price performance is quite staggering. It holds an EPS Rating of 87 but a stock Relative Strength Rating of just 7. It further underlines how damaging the unwinding of the stay-at-home trade has been for certain stocks.

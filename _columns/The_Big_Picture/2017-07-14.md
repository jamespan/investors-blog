The pressure came off the market uptrend Friday, as the S&P 500 scored a new high.


The Nasdaq led with a 0.6% thrust but fell shy of a new high. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.5% and 0.4% respectively, as they notched new highs.




Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Still, the action changed IBD's market outlook to a confirmed uptrend, from uptrend under pressure.


The distribution-day count remains high.


Individual investors can now check their watch lists for stocks nearing buy points or in buy zones. Selective test buys are the best way to approach this market. If a stock begins to turn south after a purchase, the prudent investor should sell before the loss reaches 7% or 8%. An 8% loss should be the worst loss, not the most common.


Caution is in order despite the improvement in market conditions. Why? The new high on the S&P 500 came in timid volume. A change in a market's character should have an emphatic quality. This change appears more tentative, though that could always change and some quality stocks have been breaking out.


Also, Friday's best performers had a conservative tilt. They included oil stocks, gold miners, food and tobacco. This is generally not the stuff of which gr![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP071417-190x300.png)eat runs are made.


If the bullish campÂ had their way, banks would've gathered strength Friday with the substantial Q1 earnings beats from three major players.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) turned in earnings that were 15% higher than expected. **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) beat the consensus view by 6%. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) topped by 5%.


Yet, those three stocks lost ground. Analysts found flaws in their results. For JPMorgan, the flaw was disappointing trading revenue. For Wells Fargo, it was weakness in the mortgage business. For Citigroup, it was weakness in the credit-card niche.


The only consolation for the three was that they trimmed the losses to finish high in the day's range.


While the negative reaction spread among the money-center banks, volume was missing for most and most staged positive reversals.


One factor that could be a problem for the banks is the loss of momentum to repeal the almost 9,000 pages of the Dodd-Frank law. President Trump and the Republicans have yet to show that they can deliver on a pro-business agenda.

**Special Report:** [Personal Finance Action Plan For 2016](http://news.investors.com/special-report/787619-personal-finance-action-plan-for-2016.aspx)


Stocks in 2015 chalked up the worst year for the S&P 500 since the start of the bull market in 2009. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, posted its weakest gain in four years.


![MPv_160104_151507939_68854](http://ibdcmsprod10/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MPv_160104_151507939_68854.png)On Thursday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed the last trading session of 2015 with losses of 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively. For the year, the Nasdaq rose 5.7%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7%.


As 2016 begins, wariness is natural. Individual investors have become used to nice gains over the past seven years. From the March 12, 2009, follow-through day through 2015, the compounded annual return in the Nasdaq was about 20.5%. For the S&P 500, the return was about 16%.


Most investors would probably be happy to take such returns in 2016, particularly since the gains have come during what economists call a "growth recession."


Loosely defined, a growth recession involves a rebound so weak that it feels like a recession to many ordinary people.


Yet achieving [gains in the stock market in 2016](http://news.investors.com/special-report/787619-personal-finance-action-plan-for-2016.aspx) could be difficult if the pessimists are right. Some market watchers, such as Citigroup, see the chance for a recession.


The jobless and underemployed might ask how a recession would be any different from the past seven years. Yet among the investing class, reality is different. The stock market has been mostly good to investors.


President Obama's policies, along with the Federal Reserve, have boosted the stock market in a backdoor way. A lack of business confidence, or "regime uncertainty" as economists call it, along with low interest rates, have set up peculiar incentives.


With low rates for borrowing money, companies have used cash and cheap borrowings, not to invest in new ventures but to buy back shares. Research shows that stock buybacks have been a key driver in the bull market.


This is not the ideal way to drive a bull market. Ordinarily, vibrant confidence, new businesses, new products and profit growth are the ingredients for spreading the wealth.


Wealth spreading hasn't happened, but some optimists are probably ready to say: It's only a matter of time.


Historically, betting against America's economic engine has been a fool's bet. As for stocks, an investor only has to glance at one of those wall maps of the stock market since 1901 to recognize that the long-term bias is up.


What are the factors that could push stocks up or down in 2016? Here are six elements to track and one to ignore.


• **Crude oil**: The price of oil fell 46% in 2014 and 30% in 2015.


IBD's database on light, sweet crude goes back 33 years. How many times have prices dropped sharply two years in a row?


Only one other time, 1997-98, and the next year saw a 112% gain in the price of oil. Still, oil bears say that this time could be different.


Worst case: A decline in demand drives oil prices hard south, signaling a recession and heralding a bear market.


Best case: Oil prices rebounding to a Goldilocks level — not too high to pinch consumers and not too low to lay off oil workers — would be ideal. What is the Goldilocks price? Some in the industry say $60 a barrel.


• **Stock buybacks**: Pessimists see gloom no matter what happens here. If companies redirect money to capital projects instead of buybacks, then the stock market loses a key pillar. If companies keep buying back stock, they only confirm a weak U.S. recovery.

Worst case: Buybacks shrink, and stock prices tumble.


Best case: Earnings improve with the economy. New money enters the stock market.


• **Interest rates**: Some say that the Federal Reserve should've started upping rates two or three years ago. Others say that the Fed has steered a calm course.


Worst case: The U.S. goes into a recession, leaving the Fed tool-less and clueless.


Best case: The Fed does no harm.


• **Money supply**: Money is fuel. Too little and the economy sputters. Too much and inflation ignites.


The Federal Reserve controls about 20% of the money supply. Banks control 80%. New regulations have encouraged banks to keep money tight, which has had a role in the weak recovery.


The Center for Financial Stability has reported that Divisia M4, the broadest gauge of the money supply, rose 4.6% in November, the most in 30 months. It could be the start of something good.


Worse case: M4 reverts to pathetic growth, slowing the recovery.


Best case: Growth in M4 gets the economy moving at a faster pace.


• **The China card**: Once China was about commodities. Now it's about a growing middle class. Item: In 2009, China accounted for 2% of **Apple** 's ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) revenue. In 2015, the percentage was 25%.


Worse case: China's shift to a consumer-driven economy takes longer than expected.


Best case: U.S. companies thrive on a new and growing China consumer sector.


• **Manufacturing with 3D**: This was supposed to be the next big thing. But weak capital spending smashed 3D stocks in 2013-15. The Street, though, expects **Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)) and **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) to grow earnings 300% and 115% respectively in 2016.


Worse case: Manufacturing lags, and the market continues to ignore the 3D stocks.


Best case: The trend finds traction.


• **The presidential election**: Politics is perhaps the most overvalued factor for stocks.


Innovation, not politics, drives the stock market. A president can set a positive tone and get out of the way, but not much else.


Don't get distracted from the main event in 2016: The price and volume action of the major stock indexes. That action will be investors' best guide.


**Notes on Thursday's action**: The Nasdaq and S&P 500 skidded in light but rising volume, slapping the indexes with a distribution day. Because of the subdued holiday volume, the distribution days Monday and Thursday lack clarity.


The Nasdaq lost its 50-day moving average line after two closes above it.


First-time jobless claims were worse than expected, and the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index missed the Street's estimate badly.

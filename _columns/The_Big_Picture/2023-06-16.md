Stock Market Reverses Lower, Could Be In For Pullback After Longest Win Streak In 4 Years
==========================================================================================

The stock market finally got tired of climbing, as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 broke six-day win streaks with moderate losses Friday. Following their feverish rally, it's fair to expect indexes to rest at least a little longer.




After rallying 5.8% in May and nearly 6% so far in June, the Nasdaq looks stretched. The index is more than 9% above the 50-day moving average and on Thursday the gap exceeded 10%. That's the most extended since the index topped in early February.


The S&P 500 is similarly extended, nearly 6% above its 50-day average. That compares with index peaks in February and December.


Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reversed lower Friday, but held most of the week's gains and capped another week of robust gains.

The S&P added 2.6% for its fifth consecutive weekly gain â€” the longest streak since November 2021. The Nasdaq rose 3.3% to make it eight up weeks in a row, a feat unmatched since a 10-week run that ended in March 2019.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP061623_2-300x300.jpg)The Dow reversed lower to end with a 0.3% decline and up nearly 1.3% for the week. It closed above 34,000, a resistance level for much of the past 12 months. So it's encouraging for the index to hold above that level. The Dow is up four of the past five weeks.


Stock Market Gets Distribution
------------------------------


NYSE and Nasdaq volume soared on quadruple witching expiration of options and futures. In fact, it was the highest Nasdaq volume in nearly a year, according to Dow Jones Market Data. So, Friday's stock market losses added up to a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


That left each index with two distribution days. June's upsurge caused multiple distribution days recorded in May and June to lose their relevance.


But don't let the small amount of distribution make you complacent. Be prepared for a market pullback.


If indexes do pull back, it is important for them to hold certain levels. For the S&P, a hold above 4325 (the August 2022 peak) would be important. Watch for the Nasdaq to stay above 13,000.


Leading Stocks Hold Up
----------------------


Leading stocks are holding up, with few showing any real stress. Investors, however, should try to take profits in some winners. That could be especially smart with fast risers.


**Amphastar Pharmaceuticals** ([AMPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMPH)), for example, roared more than 20% the past week and has reached its [25% profit target](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


At the same time, don't ignore new opportunities. In the IBD 50, [several stocks have formed three- or four-weeks-tight patterns](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/growth-stocks-in-the-ibd-50-are-coming-back-to-life/). **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), which is up about 25% from its breakout in March, could be setting up to extend its run.


The megacaps that have led the market also look to be in good shape. The biggest drop in this batch was **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), off 1.7%.


The IBD 50 fell 0.8% Friday.

One stock doth not an entire market make.


The key indexes closed mixed Wednesday amid a bloodbath in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) shares. One of the greatest growth engines since the March 2003 stock market bottom, the maker of smartphones, portable computers and digital entertainment slid more than 6% in volume that bulged 218% higher than average after reporting a year-over-year drop in iPhone unit sales.

Apple lost more than $36 billion worth of shareholder value, as roughly $11 billion worth of shares exchanged hands. Its weighting in the Nasdaq -- 6.6% as of Wednesday's IBD -- helped drag the tech-heavy index down 0.5%. The stock is firmly locked in a downtrend since breakout attempts in April and July 2015 failed. It closed Wednesday 27% off its 134.54 peak.


Apple's influence on the S&P 500 is much less, of course, with 499 other companies making up the balance. The large-cap index edged 0.2% higher, helped in large part by a nearly 3% jump in crude oil futures. That, combined with better-than-expected results from the likes of Norway's **Statoil** ([STO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STO)) and other integrated energy giants, helped trigger [another rally in the oil and gas sector](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/global-leaders/statoil-total-bp-rise-as-oil-prices-clear-key-technical-hurdle/).


Some sector indexes left the major averages eating their dust. The Dow utility average, boosted by no move on interest rates by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, rebounded 1.5%, its biggest gain since Feb. 18. The Philly semiconductor index rallied 1%. The small-cap S&P 600 edged out the S&P 500 too, up 0.4%.


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq but grew on the NYSE. Given Wednesday's action, the volume changes were ideal. An investor going long wants to see the market rise in heavier trade and drop in lower turnover.


That said, the level of heavy institutional selling in recent weeks remains at elevated levels; thus, IBD's outlook stays at "uptrend under pressure." This means you can still buy breakouts or rebounds off the 50-day moving average, but stay focused on the top-performing names. Given the long rise since the Feb. 11 near-term bottom, it's also highly sensible to harvest some gains and build up some cash.


Why is cash good in a portfolio?


Two reasons. First, should the market correct again, your portfolio should see a smaller downdraft. Second, markets and stocks can still go up in a pressured uptrend, so cash gives you an opportunity to capitalize on new breakout opportunities. Keep a close eye on names that appear in Market Pulse, [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), [IPO Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) (today on B7) and Stocks On The Move (Page B3) for fresh ideas.


While the Fed members generally agree that U.S. economic growth and inflation have yet to reach levels that justify the second hike in the fed funds rate since December, it's interesting to note that Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank chief Esther George dissented for the second straight meeting, arguing for another 25-basis-point hike immediately. Even if it had happened Wednesday, the cost of money would still be ultra low. Ten years ago, in June 2006, the U.S. central bank raised the fed funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 5.25%.

The stock market seesawed its way through another volatile session Monday, but most of the trading was on the losing side.




No matter which direction it went, the stock market's grasp was tentative as it moved with conflicting headlines on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. The S&P 500 could not stay in a single direction for more than two hours.


At the closing bell, the S&P 500 fell 0.4%, ending a second straight day below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). Its three-day decline is now the largest since October of 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The Nasdaq composite, up and down as much as 1% during the day, closed nearly flat. Energy, financials, health care and real estate S&P sectors fell more than 1%, which contributed to the S&P's weaker performance vs. the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP_3x2_021422-218x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average and small-cap Russell 2000 each lost 0.5%. The IBD 50 underperformed the market, falling 1.4%. Eight of the 50 stocks fell more than 2%.


For the second session in a row, **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)) fell more than 4% and has fallen more than 8% from the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) — a [sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). **Global Ship Lease** ([GSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSL)) closed below its 26.61 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lighter on the NYSE as well.


Sentiment Gauges Suggest A Stock Market Low
-------------------------------------------


It's difficult to gauge the stock market's direction in a volatile period like the present, and it's smarter to trade cautiously until stocks settle down. For now, investor sentiment suggests indexes could be bottoming, at least in the short term.


The [Cboe Market Volatility S&P 500 index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, jumped as high as 31.74 Monday and ended more than 5% higher. The index has a tendency to signal market lows when it spikes more than 20% above its 10-day moving average, and it did on Monday.


It's hard to judge how effective or lasting these signals are when the stock market is so volatile. A similar spike on Jan. 24 and on Dec. 20 confirmed market lows pretty well. A signal on Nov. 26 missed the low by a few days. But the Jan. 10 VIX spike preceded only a brief market bounce.


The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall), another sentiment gauge, also is indicating excessive fear. Monday's ratio of 0.97 was the highest since Jan. 25, also around the time of a short-term bottom.


The stock market is watching conflicting signals on the Russia-Ukraine standoff, all the while aware that an interest-rate increase is likely to come next month.


The [odds of a half-point rate hike](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) at the March Fed meeting are now larger than the odds for a quarter-point increase. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on CNBC that he believes the Fed needs to "front-load" rate hikes. Bullard, who's been one of the most hawkish Fed officials, last week said the Fed should raise the fed funds rate a full percentage point by July.


Ukraine Weighs On European Equity Markets
-----------------------------------------


European stocks were understandably more sensitive to the Ukraine crisis, and major bourses saw their largest losses since Jan. 24. The London FTSE 100 fell 1.7%. The German DAX was down 2% and the Paris CAC 40 dropped 2.3%.


Russia supplies [40% of the European Union's oil products and coal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-changes-the-playbook-for-the-market-selloff-11644858772?mod=article_inline), and is a major source of key metals such as palladium and aluminum. Ukraine is a big exporter of corn and wheat.


Stock trading can be more a function of luck than skill in these tricky markets. More than 30 [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) stocks have topped buy points in the past few weeks, and about half are still above these [correct entries](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).



Hobbled as it may be, the stock market still finds some appealing setups that could pan out in a better market. Some are in the energy sector.


**Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and is getting closer to the 25.57 buy point. It is a [third-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/), but the oil patch is hot thanks to bubbling oil prices. U.S. crude climbed 2.5% to $95.46 a barrel Monday.


**Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), analyzed in the [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch column today](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-energy-stock-callon-petroleum-nears-buy-point-amid-higher-energy-prices/), is in a cup base.


In the finance sector, new issue **Ryan Specialty** ([RYAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAN)) is in a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/). **Ares Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)), today's [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ares-stock-rises-near-buy-point-as-alternative-assets-shine-in-volatile-stock-market/), is forming another double bottom.

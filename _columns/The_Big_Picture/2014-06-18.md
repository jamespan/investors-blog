S&P 500 Leads Gains, Remains Top Major Index This Year
=======================================================

Stocks rallied in higher volume and the major indexes scored a fourth gain in a row Wednesday.


Leading stocks behaved well as the IBD 50 gained 0.9%. Traders cheered the Federal Reserve's decision to further wind down its massive quantitative-easing program yet not hastily move toward hiking the cost of borrowing money.


The U.S. central bank shaved its monthly buys of mortgages and Treasury bonds by another $10 billion to a total of $35 billion. The stimulus program was initiated in September 2012 with $85 billion a month.


The S&P 500 made its biggest gain in its four-day win streak, rising 0.8% and building its year-to-date gain to nearly 6%.


The gain has taken much more time to achieve than in 2013, of course. Last year, it took just six weeks — not months — for the large-cap benchmark to accumulate a 6% advance. The S&P 500 ended 2013 up 29.6%.


The Nasdaq on Wednesday moved up 0.6%. Declines by stocks in IBD's semiconductor manufacturing, semiconductor equipment and fabless semiconductor groups held the Nasdaq indexes back a bit.


Those declines were minor blemishes on what was one of the more positive sessions for investors in a while. When a market rises substantially in higher volume, it is an unmistakable sign that fund managers are busy putting money to work in stocks.


In light of the growing humanitarian crisis and rapid emergence of a highly militant, financially independent ISIS organization in Syria and Iraq, the market's rally is showing impressive resilience.


The market's internals also showed good signs. On the NYSE, advancers beat decliners by more than a 2-to-1 margin.


As the Fed noted, not all aspects of the American economy are plugging along. In its statement, the central bank noted that business fixed investment "resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow."


New-home sales and housing starts remain in a slump. High prices across various regions and the still-precarious jobs market have many wondering if long-term growth can be sustained.


No wonder the IBD 50 and IBD Leaderboard are not featuring housing-related stocks much these days. In the Building-Residential/Commercial group, only thinly traded **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) sports a Composite Ranking of 90 or better. Multi-unit housing plays, particularly REITs, are thriving. In IBD's REIT Leaders table (page B9), numerous stocks show yields north of 5%.


Helping the S&P 500 outperform are the utility stocks. Even the IBD 50 features at least one utility, **ITC Holdings** ([ITC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITC)) (No. 47 in Wednesday's paper, page B5). The Dow utilities, up 2% Wednesday, boast a 15% gain so far this year.

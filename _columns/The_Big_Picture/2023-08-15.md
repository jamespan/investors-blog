The [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) and certain sectors suffered another day of steep declines on Tuesday. Volume was mixed. Overall, the day's action affirmed IBD's decision nine trading sessions ago to ratchet the outlook for the market to a more cautious state.




Curiously, Tuesday's session did not contain all the elements of a full-blown sell-off that would likely reveal a true correction is coming â€” at least, not yet.


The reasons why sellers sent the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average for losses of 1% to 1.2% each were not hard to see.


Overnight, Chinese equities fell after China's central bank announced a new cut in interest rates in hopes of supporting the economy. The rebound in industrial production, exports and consumer spending in the Middle Kingdom has so far disappointed economists.


Stock Market Today: Banking Credit Fears Heighten
-------------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, lenders in the U.S. sank on reports that Fitch, the bond ratings agency, is mulling a downgrade in the individual credit ratings of as many as 70 lenders within its research universe.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP081523-209x300.jpg)Analyst Chris Wolfe told CNBC that if the firm downgrades the entire industry's debt rating by one notch, it would re-evaluate ratings on even large banks, including major money centers **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)).


BofA's stock gapped down at the open and fell 3.2% to 29.94, a nearly four-week low. Shares also slid to the 50-day moving average for the first time since early July.


Small-cap indexes had a tougher day on Wall Street. The Russell 2000 slipped 1.3% to 1895. It found no support at its rising 50-day moving average, which has risen to 1911. Gains in the popular index have deflated to 7.6% for the year.


Weakest Index Performers
------------------------


Elsewhere, the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund dropped almost 1.4% for its fifth drop in six sessions. The ETF has nearly given back all the gains since the beginning of the third quarter.


Notice on a daily chart how MDY had cleared a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 476.20 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) on June 30. The 5% gain has shrunk to nearly nil. The midcap 400 acts as a good barometer for growth stocks.


Another poor performer on Tuesday? The Dow Jones transportation average slumped more than 1.7%. It sliced cleanly through its [21-day exponential moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) IBD research has found that in a solid stock market uptrend, both growth stocks and key indexes tend to lead their 21-day lines higher and find support at this moving average during mild pullbacks.

Mixed Volume
------------


Volume expanded on the Nasdaq by almost 5% vs. Monday to 4.47 billion shares. But on the NYSE, turnover fell slightly.


The Nasdaq's decline in higher turnover chalked up an eighth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) within IBD's 25-session tracking. The last time we saw that many sessions of pronounced professional selling? You have to go back to the end of September 2022, when the Nasdaq scored nine distribution days.


The intensity of the current batch of distribution days in the stock market? Surely nothing to sneeze at.


Besides the July 19 stalling day, in which the Nasdaq actually rose 4 points on the day but finished in the lower half of its intraday range, the composite index has seen a 2.1% decline on July 20; a 2.2% drubbing on Aug. 2; a 1.2% shellacking on Aug. 9; and a 1.1% slide Tuesday.


Meanwhile, the sell-offs that took place from mid-September to early October last year demonstrated far more ferocity. On Sept. 13, the Nasdaq got pounded 5.2% following a hot inflation report. From Sept. 21 to 23 last year, it marked back-to-back-to-back declines of 1.8%, 1.4% and 1.8%.



Looking at the S&P 500 on Tuesday, the large-cap gauge closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since March 28. At 4437 Tuesday, the S&P 500 closed 0.2% below its 50-day line, currently at 4446.


Technically, this is indeed meaningful. A big swing below the 50-day line indicates that institutional investors are not excited about accumulating shares amid the pullback to lower prices. Yet at least on Tuesday, the index crept quietly below the line, rather than plunge below it.


What muddies the waters of the stock market as well? Volume has certainly lightened up on both the exchanges in recent days. Of course, that's normal for the middle of August.


[On the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), only seven members finished the session in volume that rose at least 10% above their average levels over the past 50 days. So for now, IBD's current outlook remains at uptrend under pressure with a suggested portfolio exposure to stocks at 60%-80%.


Retailers Outperform Stock Market
---------------------------------


Better-than-expected U.S. retail sales in July boosted several fast-growing retailers. Some of them are noted in the accompanying Market Pulse. Homebuilders also bucked the decline on Tuesday. As a group, these stocks rallied 0.6%, even as the benchmark U.S. 10-year government bond yield rose by 3 basis points to 4.22%. Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) disclosed it now owns stakes in a few homebuilders.



**Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), profiled during Tuesday's [IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/), flexed unusual strength. Shares rose 2.3% in double normal turnover. Gains from a breakout past a trendline and an early buy point around 64 have now reached 19%. The stock has also escaped the 5% buy zone from a standard buy point of 68.16.


The deep-discount retail chain, which offers a treasure-hunt experience for shoppers, has enjoyed a turnaround in profits. Earnings fell 58% in the quarter ended in July 2022, then rose 9%, 22% and 145% in the next three quarters. Revenue has accelerated as well, going from 9% growth in fiscal Q2 and Q3 of the latest fiscal year to year-over-year gains of 10% and 13%.


The stock market will receive fresh quarterly results from several more retailers later this week, such as **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) on Wednesday.

The stock market rallied sharply again Monday after strong gains Friday. Volume remained lackluster, but breadth improved and the session yielded plenty of bullish movers.




What was looking like a bad week for the stock market last week ended up being pretty good as the Nasdaq composite shaved a weekly loss of 2.7% to 0.7%. A bullish end to the week reminded investors about the importance of being nimble. Indeed, many investors raising cash early last week — when the Nasdaq was threatening a break of its 50-day moving average — were putting some money to work on Thursday and Friday, and maybe a little more on Monday.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 marked new highs Monday, up 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively. Broad-based strength in oil and gas stocks helped the S&P 500. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures settled at $65.64 a barrel, up 5.6%, after seven straight declines.

After sharp sell-offs, it's difficult to find actionable oil and gas stocks, with many below their 50-day lines or worse. Among oil and gas producers, **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) gapped up close to its 50-day line. It could try to break over a [trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) soon. That would correspond with a move above its Aug. 13 high of 28.72.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100 again after shares jumped 3.1% last week on earnings. Nvidia stock added another 5% and is now slightly extended past the 5% buy zone from the 207.43 buy point.


Economic data due this week includes July new-home sales on Tuesday and durable goods orders on Wednesday. After that, the focus will shift to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak Friday at 10 a.m. ET at the Jackson Hole conference of central bankers. The Fed's next two-day meeting is Sept. 21-22.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index jumped 1.9%. Breadth was pretty good in the stock market, with advancers beating decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1. The ratio was nearly 7-to-1 on the NYSE.


Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq but appeared to be lower on the NYSE. The July 19 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq is now deleted from the count because of time elapsed. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each have only two distribution days over the past several weeks.


Market Movers
-------------


Top-rated growth stocks in the IBD 50 also did well, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) up 2.5%. Twelve stocks in the IBD 50 rose 3% or more Monday, including **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and **Bill.com** ([BILL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILL)). Snap is a [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock, and the position was increased Monday due to bullish price action.

It was a broad-based market rally as mining, steel and airline stocks also outperformed. Travel-related stocks got a lift after the Food & Drug Administration gave full approval to **Pfizer**'s ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **BioNTech**'s ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) vaccine. Previously, the vaccine had emergency authorization.


[Semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) also fared well after Chinese regulators approved **Analog Devices**' ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) acquisition of **Maxim Integrated Products** ([MXIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXIM)). That fueled hopes that **Advanced Micro Devices**' ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) purchase of **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) and Nvidia's purchase of Arm Holdings will also get the go-ahead in China.



Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), shipping firm **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)) jumped nearly 8% in strong volume. It's still in the 5% buy zone after a breakout from a cup base with a 79.59 entry. Other heavy-volume gainers in the group included **ZIM Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) and **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)).


But some breakouts faded after strong starts. In the security software group, **SentinelOne** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) added 3.6% but closed well off highs. So did software stock **Confluent** ([CFLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFLT)), which tried to clear a cup base with a 58.09 entry.

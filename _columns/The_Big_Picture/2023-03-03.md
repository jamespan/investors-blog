Stock Market Roars As Outlook Improves, But Will Powell Spoil The Party?
=========================================================================

The stock market roared back in impressive fashion Friday, powered by a bull charge. But investors need to stay on their toes in case this is a false dawn.




The Nasdaq composite fared best out of the major indexes, popping 2%. This accounted for much of the tech-heavy index's weekly gain of 2.6%. It has swiftly retaken its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) after failing to hold the key benchmark the previous week. The Nasdaq is up about 12% for the year so far.


The S&P 500 closed at highs as it jumped 1.6%, or about 2% for the week. It snapped a losing streak that stretched back to the previous three weeks. Gains for the year now stand at nearly 6%.


Bulls will be encouraged by the fact the benchmark index used support at its 200-day line as a springboard to rebound above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Gainers outnumbered decliners by around 5-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and just under 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

It is now modestly positive for the year. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was the top component, popping 3.5%


Small caps also participated, with the Russell 2000 rising 1.4%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) held bragging rights for the day as it popped 2.2%.


Positive Action Triggers Market Shift
-------------------------------------


Dovish talk from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic Thursday continued to boost stocks and cause bond yields to retreat. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note skidded 11 basis points to 3.96%. The 4% level seems key.


A handful of leading issues showed good action. The likes of **International Seaways** ([INSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSW)), **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) and **Mobileye Global** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) bounced off their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) or broke out of bases.


But a potential land mine lies ahead when Fed Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress next week. He is set to speak to a Senate committee on Tuesday before appearing before a House panel Wednesday. Powell has a proven track record of being able to move the market.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya told Investor's Business Daily there are reasons to exercise caution.


"Wall Street wants to go higher despite a lot of signs that the Fed may have to take rates even higher than what markets are pricing in," he said. "We also still have a lot more earnings downgrades coming our way, so it is hard to imagine this stock market rally will last. "


This week's positive action has seen the market revert to confirmed uptrend status. This justifies raising exposure to the 60% to 80% level. But investors should do so in a measured fashion in case this turns out to be a bear trap.


As ever, investors should let theÂ day-to-day action of the indexes and stock market leaders be their principal guide.

The IBD industry groups offered further insights for stock market investors.


Automakers, metal miners and metal product distributors all fared well. But it was solar stocks that rose the most, including [new Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock **Nextracker** ([NXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXT)), which jumped 4.6%. It cleared the 33.05 buy point of an IPO base.


On the other side of the coin, shipping stocks, office supply sellers, newspapers and discount retailers were the worst performers.

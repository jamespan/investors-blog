The stock market's nearly three-week advance slowed Tuesday, as indexes tried to enter territory that's been held by sellers for months.


The S&P 500 climbed 0.1%, trimming a gain of as much as 0.5% as NYSE volume edged higher. Energy stocks were among the day's best, which gave the S&P some added fuel. The price of crude oil topped $50 a barrel for the first time in 11 months.

Of 212 biotechnology companies, only a half-dozen are listed outside the Nasdaq, making the industry one of the most Nasdaq-heavy.


The industry plunge came on bad news from three companies. **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) said its multiple-sclerosis drug candidate [failed a clinical trial](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biogen-loses-big-ms-gamble-as-anti-lingo-fails-clinical-trial/?ven=YahooCP&src=AURLLED&ven=yahoo). Shares plunged 13%. **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), down 11%, said its Soliris, a drug already used for rare blood diseases, missed a primary goal in a trial as a possible treatment for a neuromuscular disease. **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) added to its 10-month misery by falling 15% after the company's Q1 profit missed expectations and management cut its outlook.


The Nasdaq was left scratching the 4970 price level, where the index peaked in April. If the indexes have ambitions to continue rising, they'll have to penetrate into levels where they've often become snarled. For more than a year, the S&P 500 has made eight attempts to rally above 2100, only to be turned back each time.


Tuesday's results suggested that an assault on that fortification won't be easy. The S&P 500 stalled, giving the index a new distribution day. Yet over the past three weeks, the market has seen a very limited amount of institutional-size selling.


Some indications, moreover, suggest the market has underlying strength.


The S&P 500 climbed above its April 20 top at 2111 and made its highest close since July 22. Bulls would hope the Nasdaq will follow along. The small-cap Russell 2000 (up 0.3% Tuesday) has a small cushion above its April highs and outperformed the major indexes for the second day in a row.


The NYSE advance-decline line keeps rising from its mid-February low, and the Nasdaq's has turned sharply higher in the past three weeks. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of the S&P is a solid B- while the Nasdaq's has improved to C. Tuesday's winning stocks led losers by 12-to-7 on the NYSE and were nearly even on the Nasdaq.


The IBD 50 added 0.7%, showing that leading stocks aren't shirking. The Dow transports also outperformed. Its 1.1% increase was all the more impressive given the rise in oil prices.


More importantly, some institutional-quality stocks are breaking out, although big gains from buy points remain elusive. On Tuesday, **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) topped the 39.82 buy point of a flat base. Portable oxygen tank maker **Inogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)) broke out past the 50.60 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was merely average for both, though.

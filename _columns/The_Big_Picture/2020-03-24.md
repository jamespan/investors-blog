Tuesday's market blast higher may have made some readers' dreams about big profits in the stock market feel real.




Powerful gains by a wide swath of stocks. Strong buying into the close. Muscular action by sectors that have in years past led the market higher (think software, e-commerce, health care, retailing).


So, what should investors be looking for now?


A single-session confirmation that, even as many may still feel shellshocked by the depth and breadth of the [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), the institutional crowd is serious about loading up more on equities.


IBD calls that a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/).


[The IBD Live show on Tuesday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) detailed reasons why Monday's down day on the Nasdaq actually served as the first day of a new rally attempt. This means Tuesday's sharp advance, while pleasant, only serves as Day 2.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP032419-274x300.jpg)Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has now stamped its fourth Day 1 attempt in less than two weeks. Since March 13, the three past rally attempts got obliterated by new waves of selling. Will a fourth time be the charm?


The Nasdaq Performs Less Badly
------------------------------


While the Nasdaq composite has typically led general rallies in recent years, its 8.1% gain on Tuesday actually stood in the shadow of a 9.4% leap by the S&P 500, one of its top 5 largest percentage increases ever.


As seen in the General Market Indicators PDF link at the bottom of this story, the Nasdaq is still upending the S&P 500 year to date, down 17.3% for the former vs. down 24.2% for the latter. The Nasdaq 100, which monitors the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, has cut its loss since Jan. 1 to 13.5%.


Yet looking ahead, the major indexes — even if a [follow-through emerges](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) — are going to need more than the flash and sizzle that bodybuilders Hans and Franz gave in their "Pump You Up" Saturday Night Live routine. As an investor, demand authentic growth stocks to break out in thunderous volume and hit new highs with gusto.


Consider this stat. From March 16 to March 23 alone, each session sported on average 847 issues on the Nasdaq that stroked new 52-week or all-time lows.


Over the same time frame, only nine stocks made new highs each day on average. In terms of market internals, that's the polar opposite of what you want to see. At least Tuesday's session showed a far smaller number of stocks on both the Nasdaq and NYSE wilt to [new lows](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-mar-24-2020/). (Track the daily totals every day after the close at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), as well as the top contributing sectors.)


Few names with superior EPS, Relative Strength and [Accumulation/Distribution ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) are trading within, say, 5% to 15% of their 52-week highs right now and poised to break out. So an ideal environment for [CAN SLIM stock investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) could in fact well take a while.


Is Fear Over Coronavirus Fading?
--------------------------------


Confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. galloped past the 50,000 mark on Tuesday and have caused no fewer than 674 deaths nationwide. Yet the likelihood of a financial aid package worth trillions of dollars to help workers, small businesses and borrowers passing in Congress gave at least one reason for bargain hunters to rush back into stocks.


Meanwhile, cases in Italy, the European epicenter of the health crisis, crossed the 60,000-case barrier. But figures from the CSSE at John Hopkins Univ. showed a smaller daily gain on Sunday vs. prior days. Plus, while the 6,820 deaths in the European powerhouse is truly tragic, 8,326 have recovered.


World Health Organization data also illustrated a bend, even if slight, in the curve for Italian coronavirus cases — from 5,560 new cases reported on Monday to 4,789 on Tuesday. WHO noted 6,557 new cases on March 21.


U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has proposed a whopping $2.5 trillion relief bill that includes tangible measures such as allowing mortgage holders to postpone payments by up to six months. Her remarks to the media on Tuesday morning that Capitol Hill is getting closer to sending a package to the White House raised hopes on Wall Street that the impact of Covid-19 on the U.S. economy will be deep but short-lived.


Meanwhile, President Trump expressed hope that the U.S. will fully reopen for business by Easter, April 12.


"There is an old saying that 'markets stop panicking when politicians start panicking.' Fiscal and monetary policy responses are now starting to calm the credit markets. Expect this to continue into other markets," Andrew Slimmon, managing director and senior portfolio manager on long equity strategies at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said in an email exchange with Investor's Business Daily.

Signs Of Normalcy Returning To The Dow Jones?
---------------------------------------------


**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) helped lead the Dow to big gains following news that the company reopened its Shanghai Disneyland amusement park in the bustling metropolis of China.



But it takes just one glance at a daily or weekly chart on Disney to understand two things. One, such companies have a lot of recovery work to do before a good base gets built. [Excellent bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) boost the odds of an [excellent breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), [the best time to buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Two, [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) will overwhelm some stocks more than others in the short and medium term.


So in this current phase of the market, take it as an opportunity to [hone the watchlist](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) to companies with a [rising relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) and superior earnings and sales growth and estimates.



The [IBD Long-Term Leaders list](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/), currently 70% invested based on a 20-stock portfolio, includes a range of proven big winners. **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Amedisys** ([AMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMED)) made the list headed into Tuesday's session; both are trading on the north side of their 50-day lines. That's rare these days.


[IBD 50 Stocks To Watch showcase](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-chinese-restaurant-leader-yum-china-new-buy-point-stock-market-correction/) **Yum China** ([YUMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUMC)) also appears to be giving a subtle sign that the Chinese consumer is regaining some confidence.

The stock market was resilient again Wednesday as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq significantly pared early losses of 0.7% to 0.8%. In stock market news, a solid gain for **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) on strong earnings fueled a day of outperformance by the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)). It rose 0.5%.




At the close, the Dow Jones industrials eased 0.3%, mostly hurt by weakness in **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)). Shares lost nearly 5% after House Democrats introduced a bill to insure all Americans through Medicare. The S&P 500 eased less than 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index picked up 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in slightly higher than Tuesday.


Stock Market News: Chip Stocks Lag
----------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite edged higher by 0.1% despite broad-based weakness in semiconductor stocks. The Philadelphia semiconductor index lost 1.2%, weighed down by weakness in Nasdaq 100 chip names like **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MP022719-229x300.jpg)IBD's chip designer group is home to many of the top-performing semiconductor stocks. Group leaders include **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) and **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)).


Major stock indexes fell to session lows just after 10 a.m. ET after Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former attorney, started his testimony on Capitol Hill. But the selling was short-lived.


U.S. crude oil futures settled at $56.94 a barrel, up 2.6%. Oil was strong after the Energy Information Administration said that [domestic crude supplies fell by 8.6 million barrels](https://www.investors.com/research/futures/crude-oil-prices-opec-cuts-extension-eia-data/) last week. Oil also got a lift after Saudi Arabia reaffirmed its commitment to reduce output.


Stock Market News: Gauging Market Health
----------------------------------------


The S&P 500 is getting some resistance near the 2800 level, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index this week got turned away at the 1600 level. To its credit, the Nasdaq composite marked its fourth straight close above the 7500 level. The Dow Jones continues to grapple with the 26,000 level.


[Distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) hawks don't have much to be alarmed about these days. Signs of distribution, or higher-volume declines for the stock indexes, have been scant since the S&P 500 confirmed a new uptrend on Jan. 4.


The S&P 500 showed stalling action Monday, with a close near its low in higher volume. That raised the S&P 500's distribution-day count to three, but signs of unequivocal institutional selling have been virtually nonexistent in the past several weeks.


The stock market has done quite well amid a steady flow of uncertain headlines. No doubt Wall Street is optimistic about ongoing trade talks with China. It also has embraced a more dovish tone from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who wrapped up two days of congressional testimony on monetary policy. The Fed has been clear that it's in no rush to raise interest rates any further.


Money flowed out of the bond market Wednesday, sending the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 5 basis points to 2.68%.


Earnings Winners
----------------


Results from **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), **CoStar Group** ([CSGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSGP)) and **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) impressed Wednesday and gap-ups for each stock looked pretty good at the close. All three closed near session highs.


But it was a different story at **Tandem Diabetes Care** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)). All three gapped up on earnings and closed with solid gains, but all three stocks closed off session highs.


Watch for heightened volatility in the stock market Thursday on the final day trading of February. End-of-month trading can get busy as institutional investors reposition portfolios.

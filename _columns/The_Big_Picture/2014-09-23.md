The stock market fell again Tuesday, leaving its outlook no less murky than it has been on other days lately.

  

The Nasdaq slipped 0.4% and the S&P 500 0.6%. Selling picked up in the final 15 minutes as both indexes closed at session lows.

  

The IBD 50 fell only 0.1%, but that was its third straight drop. Leading stocks have been mixed, with a few rising from buy areas, others trading modestly below those levels and many more unable to move firmly in either direction. With such pervasive uncertainty, it is appropriate to treat the market as less of a friend until it can show a little more love.

  

Indexes are signaling some institutional selling. Several distribution days have occurred since the market started flattening out this month.

  

On Tuesday, there was no distribution because of lower volume across the board.

  

With most leaders meandering, it seems like institutional investors are being quite selective on what they buy. Few top-rated stocks are making strong advances as [new issue](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)). The maker of wearable video cameras surged 7% in above-average volume to a new high.

  

The Nasdaq's advance-decline (A/D) line has fallen to nearly a one-year low. The fall supports the notion that institutions are being extra picky.

  

The NYSE's A/D line is not in such bad shape, partly because transportation and some other cyclicals have shown relative strength. Big caps have also performed better. The Dow, off 0.7% Tuesday, remains almost at a new high.

  

On the flip side, small caps — which are more abundant in the Nasdaq — are practically in a correction. The Russell 2000 is down about 7% from its July 1 peak.

  

On Tuesday, economic and geopolitical news put the market on a downbeat mood. European shares fell broadly after the latest reading on manufacturing and services sectors in the eurozone fell to its lowest level this year.

  

The U.S. and Arab allies launched airstrikes and missile attacks on Islamic State forces late Monday, marking a sharp escalation in the Middle East conflict and the first time that the group had bombed IS targets in Syria.

  

A couple of sectors sold off on negative news.

  

Stocks of some companies involved in tax-inversion deals slid after federal regulators announced new rules designed to prevent U.S. companies from escaping U.S. taxes.

  

**Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) gapped down to a 3% loss. The stock closed 1% below the 64.72 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. The medical-device maker is seeking a $42.9 billion deal with Ireland's **Covidien** ([COV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COV)).**AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)) — which plans to acquire Ireland-based **Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)) — lost 2% but still ended above a 56.04 entry.

  

Auto stocks were weaker after **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) missed earnings expectations. Shares of the auto dealership chain plunged 9.5%, triggering sell signals.

  

New-car sales have picked up as consumers' finances have improved, hurting the used-car market. **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) sank 2% to a nearly eight-month low. IBD's auto retail and wholesale industry group was one of the day's poorest.

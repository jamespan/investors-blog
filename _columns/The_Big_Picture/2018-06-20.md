In the dictionary, the letter D goes before the letter N. But in the current dictionary of trading on Wall Street, it's the exact opposite. To understand why, just view the Nasdaq and the Dow.




The Nasdaq composite posted a solid gain of 0.7% on Wednesday, eradicating the prior day's slim loss. But the Dow Jones industrial average could not keep up. The blue chip index fell nearly 0.2%. Four Dow Jones components fell at least 1 point or more in the price-weighted index. They included **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)).


The S&P 500 played the role of middle child, rising less than 0.2%. Its smaller sibling, the S&P SmallCap 600, outperformed with a 0.7% gain.


Like the Nasdaq, the S&P 600 posted all-time new highs.

So, as the Market Pulse table shows, the total number of relevant heavy institutional sell-offs in the large-cap index is still a bit elevated at five.


However, only one of those five distribution days featured a sell-off of 1% or more — namely, the 1.2% decline on May 29.


Listen to NPR or watch the business shows in other mainstream media and you will without fail hear what the Dow did first. Sometimes, you might not even hear what the "new kid on the block" did.


But savvy IBD investors know that "new" is one of the key factors to consider when you want to own a piece of some of the best merchandise in the equity markets. Newer companies tend to introduce products and services that are transforming the workplace, creating new jobs and economic value, and improving the quality of our leisure activities.


Nasdaq 30 Vs. The Dow 30
------------------------


Let's consider the 30 largest companies on the Nasdaq by market cap.


The average IBD Composite Rating for these 30 names: a 69. They also average 75 in terms of Earnings Per Share Rating.


At least 11 of the 30 Nasdaq giants hold a Composite score of 90 or better; they include **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), and [Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).


How about the Dow industrials?


The 30 stocks show an average Composite Rating of 58 and EPS Rating of 69. Just three show a 90 Composite or better: **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)).


To its credit, at least seven of the 30 Dow industrial components have gained 10% or more since Jan. 1. But three of them reside on the Nasdaq as well — **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), all giant winners during the late 1980s to late 1990s.

The Nasdaq, at 7781, is up 12.7% for the year. The Dow industrials have fallen more than 1%.


The End Of 'Blue Chip' Status
-----------------------------


Next week, the Dow will replace its oldest member, **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), with **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)). Walgreens trades on the Nasdaq.


One might bemoan the listless performance of Walgreens shares. But Walgreens clearly outmatches GE in the area of current earnings growth. That's the [C in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


The drugstore chain has delivered earnings increases of 13%, 22%, 16% and 27% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. That tops the 7% and 4% EPS gains seen in the two periods prior to that.


The retail sector is No. 6 among IBD's 33 general sectors. Plus, the medical sector is a leader, No. 4. High industry strength benefits most stocks that comprise it.

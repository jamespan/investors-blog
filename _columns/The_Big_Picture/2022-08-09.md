Stock Market Falls On Micron Warning, Inflation Jitters; Shockwave Medical Soars On Earnings
=============================================================================================

Sellers came into the stock market Tuesday, hurt by a revenue warning from chip bellwether **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)). Wall Street was also jittery ahead of a key inflation report Wednesday.




The Nasdaq indexes and Russell 2000 small-cap index led the downside, but the selling never got intense. After giving back a 1.6% intraday gain Monday, the Nasdaq composite fell another 1.2% Tuesday. But the index still looks fine as it tests the 10-day moving average. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, giving the index a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) fell 1.1%, hurt by sharp declines for chip-equipment stocks like **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)). The Nasdaq 100 is also testing its 10-day line.


Stock Market News
-----------------


Sentiment was negative in the technology sector after Micron said it expects [fiscal Q4 revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mu-stock-micron-delivers-dismal-outlook/) at or below the low end of prior guidance. Micron's warning came one day after **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) significantly lowered its quarterly revenue guidance. Micron stock gapped sharply below the 60 level, falling nearly 4%. Nvidia extended losses and paid a visit to its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Shares are down 10% so far this week.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fell 1.3%, but it hasn't touched its 10-day line yet.

**Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)) was a standout performer in the small-cap index after the company reported another strong quarter and bullish revenue guidance. Shares gapped out of a long consolidation and hit an all-time high, rising 17%.


The stock is extended now, but strong moves like this can often be followed up by tight, sideways trading. It's a sign of strength and support that can often presage more strength.


The S&P 500 dipped 0.4%, buoyed by strength in oil and gas stocks. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures traded as high as $92.65 before settling at $90.50, down 0.3%.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP080922-225x300.jpg)Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) was a top gainer in the S&P 500, rising 4% on news Warren Buffett purchased an additional 6.7 million shares. That brings his stake in OXY to around 20%. But Occidental's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) is a weak D-, hurt by several higher-volume declines in recent weeks. The stock gapped up above its 50-day moving average early Tuesday, but the stock closed off highs.


**Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)) and **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) also outperformed in the S&P 500.


Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq by just over 2-t0-1. Breadth was negative on the NYSE as well, with decliners topping gainers by less than 2-to-1.


After a strong move off lows, major stock indexes are at a point where a pullback would make sense. The S&P 500 on Monday tried to poke above its early-June high but reversed lower in higher volume. The index avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) Monday because it only fell 0.1%. The stock market still has a light distribution-day count working in its favor.

At this point, trimming some winners to raise some cash makes sense. There's nothing wrong with being proactive, even with the stock market still in a confirmed uptrend. After a strong move off lows, some consolidation for the indexes should be expected. Keep an eye out for new buys, but don't settle for second- or third-tier stocks. Focus on the quality merchandise.


All Eyes On Inflation
---------------------


Tuesday was quiet in terms of economic data, but there could be some fireworks Wednesday when the Consumer Price index for July is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Overall, economists expect prices to be up 8.7% year over year, a little lower than June's reading of 9.1%. Excluding food and energy costs, prices are expected to increase 6.1%, up slightly from June's reading of 5.9%. The Producer Price index, which measures wholesale inflation, will be out Thursday.

Shockwave was the best gainer in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), along with [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **New Fortress Energy** ([NFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFE)). The latter cleared a cup base Monday and followed through Tuesday, up another 4%. Note that the stock quickly formed the right side of the base. It could use a breather after rising in 10 out of the past 12 sessions.


**Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) has been rallying in light volume after its July 22 downside reversal. Shares crossed above the 80 level Tuesday as they form a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/getting-the-dub-recognizing-the-double-bottom-base-pattern/) with an 88.06 entry.



In merger news, **Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)) slumped nearly 12% after the company cut its revenue guidance and announced plans to buy online jewelry brand Blue Nile for $360 million.


Separately, **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) added 1% to 50.35 after **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) offered to buy the video gaming software company for $20 billion, or $58.85 a share. But Unity last month agreed to buy AppLovin rival IronSource for around $4.4 billion. Unity shares closed well below Applovin's offer price, raising questions about the likelihood of a deal. AppLovin fell 10% on the news.

The stock market continued a volatile streak Monday, when indexes jumped more than 2%, shifting direction once again.




It was the third straight session in which the S&P 500 moved more than 2%. The Nasdaq moved more than 3% for the second consecutive session, and that followed Thursday's wild day. With such volatility, the next move — up or down — could be just as big.


But on Monday, the stock market traded in a much narrower price range, and indexes held gains into the close. That's encouraging action, supporting a case for a possible [follow-through signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) as early as this week.


Indexes are holding above Thursday's lows, which for now mark the start of a rally attempt. Tests of resistance at their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) come next for the big indexes. The past few attempts haven't gone well, so the 21-day lines certainly bear watching.


Also keep in mind that indexes are bouncing from oversold levels. That's why waiting for a follow-through is the first step in shifting exposure back to stocks.

Of course, that reflects institutions' apprehension about stocks. It also shows there's a lot of capital on the sidelines, ready to go to work if the market can sustain a rally.


Nasdaq Leads Stock Market
-------------------------


The Nasdaq composite led with a 3.4% burst. The S&P 500 rose nearly 2.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.9%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and also appeared to rise in the NYSE. Big gains are all the more bullish when they happen in rising volume.


And breadth was strong too, with advancers leading decliners by nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


The stock market gapped higher at the open as the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 4% overnight. But stocks held firm, even as the benchmark yield climbed back above 4%. The yield late Monday was settled at 4.01%.


There was a positive backdrop to the session, or at least a lack of really bad news.


The U.K. government [rolled back most of a planned tax package](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-u-k-chancellor-to-release-new-public-spending-tax-policies-11665987080?mod=hp_lead_pos2) that sparked financial stability worries. The London FTSE 100 rose 0.9%. The British pound and U.K. bonds also rallied.


Third-quarter earnings so far are not so gloomy. Early Monday, **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)) [beat profit and revenue expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-of-america-goldman-sachs-bank-of-new-york-mellon-q3-earnings-2022/) in generally upbeat third-quarter reports.


Loan Loss Provisions Hit Banks
------------------------------


Still, banks aren't exactly in boom times. Before Monday's earnings, S&P 500 bank earnings were down 13% compared with the year-ago period.


John Butters, FactSet senior earnings analyst, says a key factor in the decline is higher provisions for loan losses in Q3 vs. a year ago. "Provisions for loan losses have no impact on top-line growth, but do have an impact on bottom-line growth, as they are treated like an expense on a company's income statement," he said in a report.


Combining the announced and estimated results, provision for Q3 loan losses for the 18 S&P banks are $6 billion. And  expectations are for aggregate provisions to rise above pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2023, the analyst added.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lagged major benchmarks but still closed 1.4% higher. Most of the 50 stocks rose, but about three dozen climbed less than the S&P 500's solid gain.


Rotation Seen In IBD 50
-----------------------


The IBD 50 has seen some rotation during the bear market, although the newest names have tended to fade. Today, the watchlist is shifting from cyclicals to financials and health care stocks.


Monday's list could find **Pinnacle Financial Partners** ([PNFP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNFP)), which has climbed back above the 200-day moving average. **CVB Financial** ([CVBF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVBF)) was Monday's [IBD 50 Stocks to Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/bank-stock-and-ibd-50-member-cvb-financial-approaches-buy-point-ahead-of-earnings/) pick.


**Genmab** ([GMAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMAB)), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) and **Sarepta Therapeutics** ([SRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRPT)) are among a budding group of well-performing biotech stocks. **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) and **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) represent a resilient managed care industry group. [Sarepta is the IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/srpt-stock-why-sarepta-is-expected-to-dominate-its-gene-therapy-market/).


It's important to watch for rotation.


Once the stock market gets rolling on an uptrend, the new leaders will tend to be the ones that post the strongest gains. So far, however, the emerging leadership is still underdeveloped. Therein lies a risk for the stock market because Wall Street will need broad participation from institutional-quality leaders to mount a new uptrend.

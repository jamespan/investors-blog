=====================================================

Major averages ended near session highs Tuesday in an otherwise lackluster session.

  

Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.

  

The S&P 500 notched its first distribution day since a follow-through confirmed a new uptrend Oct. 21. But similar to the Nasdaq's Oct. 29 higher-volume decline, distribution was mild.

  

The Nasdaq lost 0.3% but finished near the top of its intraday range. The S&P 500 also fell 0.3% but ended near its high. The IBD 50 fell 0.3%, in line with the market, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%.

  

**Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) weighed on the Nasdaq for most of the session. The online travel firm reported its eighth straight quarter of 20% or higher earnings and sales growth, but its fourth-quarter outlook disappointed. Shares slumped 8% in huge volume.

  

Group peer **TripAdvisor** ([TRIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRIP)) crashed 13% in Tuesday's after-hours session on disappointing Q3 results.

  

Wall Street certainly has been in a good mood lately. And why not? Corporate earnings have been mostly solid, and a big drop in the price of oil has made trips to the gas station less painful. Even better, distribution in the major averages has been virtually nonexistent, a good environment for growth stocks in which to make headway.

  

Crude oil fell to a three-year low Tuesday, hurt by price cuts in Saudi Arabia. December oil lost $1.59, or 2%, to $77.10 a barrel. Oil fell into a bear market last month amid slowing demand and booming output in the U.S.

  

The precipitous drop in oil hasn't been good for oil and gas-related stocks. Exploration and production firms, drillers and field services companies were hit hard again Tuesday. Airlines and restaurant stocks outperformed.

  

In the airline group, **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) and **Allegiant Travel** ([ALGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGT)) are already extended past proper buy points, but **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)), **Southwest** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) and **Delta** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) are still in range after breaking out this week.

  

In the restaurant group, **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) was a big mover after a breakout over 28.60 last week. Shares rose 6% after the company reported earnings late Monday.

  

After the close, IBD 50 component and Sector Leader **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) reported another solid quarter. Shares rose 2% in the after-hours session after earnings and sales topped expectations. (More on Page A1.) It's working on a cup-shaped base with a buy point of 176.46.

  

A lot of stocks have moved already, but some are still setting up in bullish patterns. IBD 50 name **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) is just below a potential 128.40 buy point from a cup-shaped base. Meanwhile, **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) is working on a cup-shaped base with a 31.78 buy point. It's still 35% off its high, but the stock rallied 85% after hitting a low of 17.11 in May.

  

U.S. markets could move Thursday depending on what comes out of the European Central Bank policy meeting in Frankfurt. Pressure is building for the central bank to consider additional stimulus measures. On Tuesday, the European Commission cut its growth forecast for the 18-country eurozone.

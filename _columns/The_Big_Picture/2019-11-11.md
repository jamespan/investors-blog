Stocks bounced from early lows Monday, closing with minor losses. While it was good to see sellers fade, a stock market rally of five weeks does seem to be moderating.




The Nasdaq composite eased 0.1% after being down more than 0.4%. The S&P 500 also closed well off session lows, down 0.2%. Volume fell in a sleepy Veterans Day session.


Some moderation or even a pullback would not be surprising after a five-week win streak on the S&P 500 and a six-week run on the Nasdaq. Since the Nasdaq's 1.1% jump on Nov. 1, the average price change on the composite is less than 0.3%.


Still, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain near highs and are trading above prior resistance levels. Their 50-day moving averages are trending higher after a mild decline in September and early October. In short, there are no chart signals of a top, other than the market's own gravitational pull.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP111119-300x277.jpg)The IBD 50 easily outperformed, although it was thanks mainly to two Israeli stocks. **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) surged to another new high. The maker of equipment for minimally invasive cosmetic and other surgical procedures is up 224% from its IPO at 14 a share. **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) bounced 4%, but the stock's close below the 10-week moving average in heavy volume last week was a sell signal.


Assuming there are no bad surprises on the U.S.-China trade war or political explosions, the stock market can look to the rest of November with relative calm. November tends to treat Wall Street well. Historically, it is the second best month on the S&P 500 and third best on the Nasdaq, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.


Most of the third-quarter S&P 500 earnings have been reported already, with mainly positive reactions on Wall Street.


Larger Gains For Earnings Winners
---------------------------------


The S&P 500 companies that beat Q3 profit views saw an average stock price gain of 2.3%, according to FactSet. That's more than double the five-year average of a 1% increase. (That's measured from two days before the earnings release to two days afterward.) That's on pace for the largest average price increase among S&P 500 earnings winners since the third quarter of 2014.


The stock market also is being more forgiving of earnings misses. S&P 500 companies lagging EPS estimates are seeing an average stock price drop of 1.8%, FactSet notes. The five-year average for such stocks is a 2.6% drop.


On the whole, third-quarter earnings season is mixed for the S&P 500. Combining reported and still-expected results, FactSet estimates S&P 500 earnings are down 2.4% for Q3. It would mark the first three-quarter streak of declining EPS since Q4 of 2015 through Q2 of 2016, the research firm says. Also, more companies issued negative profit guidance than average.


More companies are beating views, but by smaller margins. With nearly 90% of reports in the books, 75% topped expectations, above the five-year average. But those companies beat by 3.8%, which is below average. In terms of sales, 60% topped views and by 0.9% above consensus estimates, both above average.


Boeing Boosts Dow Industrials
-----------------------------


The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](http://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis) led with a fractional increase Monday. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) shares jumped after the company said it [expects certification of the redesigned flight-control software in mid-December](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-delivery-before-pilot-training/), potentially clearing the way for Boeing 737 Max deliveries to resume. Boeing stock still has a lot of repair to do.



The Russell 2000 fell 0.3% as the small-cap index battles resistance at the 1600 level.


The U.S. stock market opened lower after Chinese stocks sold off following the shooting of a protester in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Hang Seng index plunged 2.6% and the Shanghai composite 1.8%. Chinese ADRs were mixed. The iShares MSCI China ETF ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)), a portfolio of 460 large and midcap Chinese companies, fell 1.2%.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) pared losses and closed 0.2% lower. The online shopping company reported [$38.4 billion in sales for its annual 24-hour shopping festival, Singles Day](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/singles-day-shatters-sales-record-but-alibaba-stock-falls/), an increase of 24% from last year.

The stock market bounced back from Wednesday's sharp sell-off, as small caps led the major indexes higher Thursday. Wall Street will shift its attention to the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation indicator, the core PCE price index, early Friday.




[Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) idea **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) holding **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are stocks to watch.


Early Thursday, the Commerce Department's third estimate of [third-quarter GDP](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-key-inflation-rate-just-hit-2-percent-sp-500-rallies-as-rate-cut-odds-grow/) slowed to 4.9%. It was expected to remain at 5.2% growth from the earlier estimate. Meanwhile, the Labor Department said first-time jobless claims rose to 205,000 from 202,000 the week before, below Econoday estimates for 210,000 new claims.


Due out at 8:30 a.m. ET Friday, the Commerce Department will release its monthly personal income and outlays report.


Personal income is expected to rise 0.4% for the month for November, with personal consumption expenditures set to increase 0.3%, per Econoday estimates.


Wall Street expects the personal consumption expenditures price index to fall 0.1% on the month, with annual increase of 2.9%. Finally, the core PCE price index will rise 0.2% in November, with a 3.4% annual rise.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The stock market posted solid rebounds Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.9%. The S&P 500 rallied 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite moved up 1.3%. All three recovered a hefty chunk of Wednesday's losses.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP122123-260x300.jpg)The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.7%, nearly erasing the entirety of Wednesday's 1.9% sell-off.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Inside the Dow, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) were the day's biggest winners, rising 2.7%, 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Cisco** **Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) were the only two losers, and they were barely lower.


And top growth stocks also ended sharply higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) advanced 1.9%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)) rallied more than 6% after the [company's strong quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ccl-stock-surges-cruises-into-buy-area-on-strong-earnings/). Shares closed just 2% away from a 19.55 entry in a cup base.

What To Do Now
--------------


IBD recommends an exposure level of 80% to 100%, with the stock market holding just off its recent highs. If you continue to make solid progress in your portfolio, then it makes sense to be fully invested. But if you start to give back some hard-earned gains, especially after Wednesday's downside reversal, then it can make sense to lower your exposure a bit.


During [Wednesday's IBD Live session](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), the panel warned that now is an important time to pay close attention to your positions and potentially even start taking partial profits.


Stay on the lookout for clusters of distribution days, which are much more dangerous than the one-off days of institutional selling. A clustering of selling would indicate a need to lower your exposure.


Meanwhile, look for more leading stocks that are breaking out. And a great resource for daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks topping buy points.Â In Thursday's list, there were zero new breakouts.


Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) is in a cup base with a buy point at 581.40.

  Stock Market Surges As Rally Accelerates; Berkshire Results Await

The stock market continued to power higher Friday, boosted by a soft jobs report, as major indexes cleared significant benchmarks. Gains snowballed as earnings from Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) highlight the week ahead.




The Nasdaq composite was the strongest of the major indexes as it jumped 1.4%. The tech-heavy index managed to close back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), an encouraging development for stock market bulls. It turned in a strong weekly gain of 6.6% and is now up nearly 30% for the year.


The S&P 500 followed close behind as it popped 0.9% and bullishly clambered above its 50-day line in the process. The benchmark index turned in a near-6% lift for the week and now has a gain of 14% for 2023.

Advancers outnumbered decliners by roughly 5-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Sharp gains for the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) and the First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) suggest a broadening rally is afoot.


Small caps also gave the bears the harshest beating, with the Russell 2000 jumping 2.7%. Further, growth stocks popped as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) vaulted 1.8%. Both remain below their 50-day moving average for now.


The encouraging stock market bounce has prompted Investor's Business Daily to recommend that investors raise exposure to the 40%-60% range. But buyers should do so in a disciplined fashion. There could be a retracement of some gains in coming sessions due to the sharp nature of this week's upward move.


Berkshire Earnings, Fed Chair Powell Loom
-----------------------------------------


Stocks got a boost again Friday after the nonfarm payrolls showed the U.S. economy added 150,000 jobs in October. This was well shy of economist expectations for an increase of 179,000. September's figures also were revised downward. And the unemployment rate rose to 3.9%, when it had been expected to hold steady at 3.8%.


Softening labor data further bolsters the case that the Federal Reserve may be done with interest-rate hikes. Now the question becomes how long they will remain at current levels.


The coming stock market week kicks off early when Berkshire Hathaway reports earnings Saturday. Investors will be listening closely for clues from Warren Buffett's company on the economic picture. (An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Buffett would hold a conference call with analysts after the report.)


**Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)), **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) and **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) are other interesting names delivering quarterly reports in the coming week.


There also will be opportunities for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to further fine-tune his message on the economy as he speaks at the Division of Research and Statistics Centennial Conference in Washington on Wednesday. Powell also is set to take part in a policy panel discussion at the 24th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference on Thursday.

Is The Stock Market Turning Complacent?
========================================

The stock market proved again that it can handle ambiguity, though some investors might be wondering if complacency isn't setting in.




The Nasdaq lost 0.2% Friday, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each retreated 0.1%. The Russell 2000 stumbled 0.9% as small caps lagged sharply.


Volume rose across the board.Â The action in the Nasdaq was sufficient to qualify as [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which is a sign of institutional selling.

News No Big Problem For Stock Market
------------------------------------


Negative news during the week came at a less urgent clip. The major news included a warning from Goldman Sachs on valuation concerns in the chip sector; the Federal Reserve's hint to cut interest rates; and the nervousness surrounding Iran.


China, though, remains the elephant in the room. Tariffs and a slowing economy drew little attention last week, except for reports that Trump would meet late this month with China's leader Xi Jinping in Japan.


In the meantime, President Trump gave the bears nothing to work with Friday when he backed away from taking military action against Iran. Iran shot down an unmanned U.S. drone Thursday.


Trump said the U.S. military estimated that 150 Iranians would be killed in a planned counterattack. Trump tweeted that the action would not have been "proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone."


With Iran off the table, at least for now, the stock market was free to focus on other items.


Tally In New Highs
------------------


New highs rolled up their tally in the week's sessions, topping the trend Thursday with 453 combined highs (Nasdaq and NYSE). A market watcher has to look back more than a year to find a higher number.


Complacency showed in the put/call volume ratio Thursday, when the gauge closed at 0.6. The low reading hasn't been very good at identifying market highs.


The last time the put/call dropped to 0.6, or lower, was Dec. 18, 2017. Choppy action in the Nasdaq followed, but it was in the context of an advance.


Stock Market Breakouts
----------------------


Breakouts continued Friday, though most failed to hold above the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Discount retailer **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) closed above its buy point. Railroad operator **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) found resistance at its handle's high.


In the finance sector, the 18 biggest banks had no trouble passing their stress tests Friday, possibly setting up dividend hikes.

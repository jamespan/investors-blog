Stocks Do Little, End Slightly Up; Some Leaders Show Bullish Action
====================================================================

Stocks lingered just below break-even most of Thursday's session but closed above the line.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each inched up 0.1%, while the Dow slipped 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600, however, rose 0.7%.


The IBD 50 added 0.1%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE.


Action in the past seven or eight sessions shows the major indexes in a sideways, holding pattern.


Secondary indicators aren't clear on whether the market might be near a short-term top or set to go higher.


For instance, the percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day moving average line hit 66% on Sept. 5, the day the S&P 500 hit its recent closing high.


What is that telling investors?


If an investor looks at short-term highs in the S&P 500 this year, the current signal can provide bulls and bears with a conclusion of their choosing.


At highs on July 24 and April 2 — just before S&P 500 retreats of 4% — the percentage of NYSE stocks above the 200-day line was at 70% and 76%, respectively. On Jan. 22, just before the S&P 500 declined 6%, the percentage was 66%, the same as Sept. 5 — an uncomfortable reading for the current market.


The chief indicator, the market itself, confirms the uptrend is intact but little else.


Apart from the Aug. 13 follow-though day, the percentage gains the Nasdaq and S&P 500 notched in rising volume have not exceeded 0.5%.


This doesn't provide much of a tailwind for stocks trying to advance after breakouts.


Yet several stocks recently have pushed through their 5% buy zones, which is a bullish sign. The 5% zone is often an area a strong stock pushes through quickly. Lately, however, the 5% buy zone has been acting more like a resistance zone.


If so, some stocks are escaping.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) jumped out of the 5% buy zone this week in strong volume. Other stocks that cleared the zone recently include medical researcher **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)), contract research provider **Parexel** ([PRXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRXL)) and **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)).


As these leaders leave the train station and become too extended to buy, other leaders are positioned to possibly do similar things.


Some leaders, such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), have been essentially moving sideways for weeks. This isn't the time to throw in the towel. Holding to see if these stocks can find new thrust is prudent.

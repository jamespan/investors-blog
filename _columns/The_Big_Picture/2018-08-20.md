Blue chips picked up where they left off last week, with another day of outperformance Monday. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was a top performer in the Dow, while semiconductor stocks continued to lag, weighing on the Nasdaq.




After rising 1.4% last week, the Dow Jones industrial average added just over 0.3%. The Dow's weekly gain easily topped a 0.6% gain for the S&P 500 and a 0.3% decline for the Nasdaq composite.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index performed mostly in line with the Dow, up 0.3%. The S&P 500 gained 0.2%. Nasdaq volume fell, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE lower than Friday's levels.

The Nasdaq lost the July 16 distribution day due to time, reducing its count of higher-volume declines in the past five weeks to three.


What's Wrong With The Chips?
----------------------------


The Nasdaq 100 eased 0.1% as chip stocks like **KLA-Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) ended with losses of more than 1%.


After giving up longer-term support at the 200-day moving average last week, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.1%. It was a decent close for the index, however, after falling 1.2% intraday.


Earlier this month, the Semiconductor Industry Association reported worldwide chip sales hit a record $117.9 billion in the second quarter, up 20.5% from the year-ago period. But clearly, the price action of many former leaders in the sector is the market's way of saying that [slower growth could lie ahead](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/chip-stocks-slide-growth-concerns/).


**Nvida** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was a bright spot in the chip sector Monday, reversing higher in strong volume. Shares were weak Friday after the company reported another quarter of strong earnings and sales growth. But sales of chips used for cryptocurrency mining came in well below expectations.


Blue Chips With Healthy Charts
------------------------------


Shares of Nike jumped 3% to 82.18. It's still in buy range from an 81.10 flat-base entry. Wall Street liked the look of its earnings report in late June, which showed a nice increase in North American sales after three straight quarterly declines.


Several blue chips in the Dow currently boast charts that could yield upside breakouts.


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) is back above its 50-day moving average and only 6% off its high. **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) is just off highs, while **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) is working on a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) base with a 136.76 entry. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) are also breakout candidates.


Elsewhere, **SodaStream** ([SODA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SODA)) made headlines on news thatÂ **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) is buying it for $3.2 billion. The deal values SodaStream at $144 a share, an 11% premium to Friday's closing price. Shares of SodaStream soared more than 9% to 142.11. PepsiCo eased 0.1%.


In the retail sector, **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) followed through after a bullish breakout Friday on [earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/cloud-computing-stock-f5-networks-near-breakout/). Shares jumped 13% Friday and an additional 4% Monday. Volume was strong both days.


[Marijuana stock](https://www.investors.com/news/marijuana-stocks-to-buy-cannabis-stocks/) and recent IPO **Tilray** ([TLRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLRY)) soared 17% to 35.90. It cleared an IPO base with a 34.20 buy point. Tilray went public in July at 17 a share. Keep in mind that Tilray is a small, speculative name with a limited track record of execution. Sales in 2017 totaled $21 million, up nicely from $13 million in 2016.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) were top gainers, up 5% and 2%, respectively. Both stocks are have performed well since being added to [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com).


Lululemon's industry group was one of the day's top performers, rising more than 2%. Other top performers in the group scored new highs, including **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), **TJX Companies** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)), as money continued to flow into consumer discretionary names. Earnings from TJX are due Tuesday before the open.


**Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), a group peer of Five Below, cleared flat base with a 77.60 buy point. Shares rose 4% to 77.65. Volume was 33% higher than average, and the relative strength line has not made a new high.


Fed In Focus
------------


The coming week is relative light on economic data. But Wall Street will pore over the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting when the minutes are released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.


In related news, the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium starts Thursday. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a speech Friday morning. President Trump has been critical of recent interest rate hikes by the Fed.


The Fed is widely expected to lift rates for the third time this year in September, but a fourth hike in December is far from a sure thing.

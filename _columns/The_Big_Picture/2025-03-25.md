The Nasdaq composite closed near its session high for the third straight trading day Tuesday in the wake of a strong gain. Buying demand was tepid in the rest of the stock market as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 edged higher, while small caps lagged.


After Monday's sharp climb, IBD lifted its exposure to 20% to 40% after the Nasdaq composite surged 2.3% on the ninth day of its rally attempt. Volume came in lower than Friday so the session didn't qualify as a follow-through day. But Friday's volume was skewed by the quarterly expiration of options, giving Monday's session the tone of a follow-through day and prompting a slight increase in exposure.




The Nasdaq composite closed higher by nearly 0.5% as it gets ready for a rendezvous with its 200-day moving average. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100 with a gain of 3.5%. After a sharp sell-off dating back to December, Tesla closed just above its 200-day moving average.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 followed up a bullish move above its 200-day line Monday with a gain of nearly 0.2%. The benchmark index scored a small win by closing above its January low of 5,773. But the S&P 500 is facing [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/david-ryan-how-to-spot-and-understand-overhead-supply) issues just like the Nasdaq at this point.


Stock Market Recap: Small Caps Lag
----------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied less than 0.1% after powering above its 200-day line Monday as well as the 42,000 level.


Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 small-cap index gave back 0.6%. It's been the hardest-hit stock index at this point after recently pulling back nearly 20% off its high.

Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq exchange by more than 3-to-2 and the New York Stock Exchange by more than 4-to-3.

Volume on both exchanges fell slightly from Monday. Going forward, a steady diet of higher-volume gains and lower-volume declines for the major stock indexes would be just what the doctor ordered, at least for stock market bulls. That would be a sign that new money is coming in from the sidelines. The bears, on the other hand, will watch for lower-volume gains followed up by higher-volume declines.


An invested percentage of 20% to 40% at this point means that it's OK to try out some new positions. But investors should make sure they're small to start, say 2.5% to 5% of their total portfolio. Now is not the time to be aggressively increasing exposure with tariff headlines still volatile.


Leaderboard Adds Two Names
--------------------------


The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio added two new names Monday — **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) as 5% positions — and Investor's Business Daily also increased the ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ([UPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPRO)) exchange traded fund after the leveraged ETF initially joined the Leaders list on March 14.


It's still early, but IBD will look for good feedback from all three names in coming days. Good feedback would be if the three holdings make progress from these entries. Bad feedback would be if they immediately turn tail into unprofitable positions.


Weakness in drugmakers like **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)), **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) weighed on IBD's ethical drugs group, which slumped around 3%. The biotech group also lagged with a decline of around 2.5%.


Gold stocks outperformed again Tuesday as the precious metal tries find a new home above $3,000 an ounce. But finding gold stocks still in a buy zone is a tall order because the leaders started coming out weeks ago. Leaderboard name **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) is still holding above its 10-day line after joining the Leaders list on Jan. 21 when it broke out from a 12-week consolidation.

Movers And Shakers
------------------


IBD's security software group also outperformed, helped by strong showings from **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)). CrowdStrike gapped up to its 50-day line with a gain of more than 3%, but the stock closed off highs. Zscaler added nearly 3% as it tries to break out over its recent high of 217.10.



A few more stocks joined the breakout ranks, including **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), which rallied nearly 1%. GE shares spiked Monday and closed just below a flat base entry of 212.19. The first buy signal came when GE bounced off its 50-day line on March 17.


Group peer **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) in higher volume. Heico rallied 1% and closed just above a 270.37 handle buy point.


Insurance stocks outperformed again. In the property and casualty group, small cap **Skyward Specialty** ([SKWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKWD)) tried to clear a cup-with-handle base with a 54.32 entry. Shares rallied 1.7%, but early gains faded and Skyward closed below the entry.


Group peer **Chubb** ([CB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB)), a relatively new holding for Warren Buffett, is adding a handle to its 23-week consolidation. The large cap is on breakout watch as it sits just below a 299.33 buy point.


In the financial sector, Peru-based large cap **Credicorp** ([BAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAP)) rallied 2% and is at the top of an 18-week consolidation.

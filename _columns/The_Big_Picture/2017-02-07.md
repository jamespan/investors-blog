Major Indexes Edge Higher, But Session Marred By Stalling
==========================================================

The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite scored fresh all-time highs Tuesday, but all in all, it was a quiet session that eventually ended up being a bearish stalling day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


The Dow and Nasdaq added 0.2% while the S&P 500 rose fractionally. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was higher than Monday's levels.


The Russell 2000 lagged, falling 0.4%. The small-cap index ended a hair below its 50-day moving average. The IBD 50 eased 0.2%.


The Dec. 30 distribution day fell off the count for the S&P and Nasdaq on Tuesday because of time, but both indexes showed stalling action, unable to make much price progress despite higher volume. So the count of distribution days stays the same in today's Market Pulse with five for the Nasdaq and four for the S&P 500. The last instance of stalling on the Nasdaq was Jan. 20. For the S&P 500, it was Jan. 10 (Note: The S&P 500 will not be charged with a stalling day for Tuesday's session.

![mp020717](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP020717.png)Despite the up session, breadth was weak as declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by less than 2 to 1.


Wall Street didn't react much to another favorable reading on consumer confidence with the release of the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism index. It rose to 56.4 in February, the highest level since October 2004. The index has now been above the neutral 50 level for five straight months now.


There's been a fairly steady chorus of naysayers in the mainstream financial media saying that the multiyear bull market doesn't have much left. That may be true, and there are yellow flags out there, but until the sell signals become pronounced, the confirmed uptrend still has to be respected.


The distribution-day count is much lower than it was, and leading growth stocks are acting well overall despite a still-challenging environment for base breakouts. There are plenty of good setups out there, but the missing ingredient for many recent breakouts has been volume.


Tuesday's session served up one breakout and a few other breakout attempts.


China-based **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) closed near its high after taking out a 52.59 double-bottom buy point. Shares rose nearly 5% in solid volume.


Volume was heavy in **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)) as shares rose 2% to 43.04. A solid earnings report was the catalyst, but the stock ended near its session low. The stock hit an intraday high of 44.90, just below a 45.30 double-bottom buy point.


 **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), meanwhile, cleared a 258.56 buy point in average volume but reversed. Shares fell 0.1% to 257.48.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) closed in the bottom half its intraday range after trying to clear a 120.03 buy point of a late-stage base. Shares rose 1.5% to 119.13. Volume was a whisker above average. Earnings from Nvidia are due Thursday after the close.


A few stocks made headlines in Tuesday's after-hours session, including **Zillow Group** ([Z](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Z)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)), but all three traded lower in extended trading after reporting earnings.

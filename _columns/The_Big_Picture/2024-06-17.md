The stock market ended Monday trading higher as it faces an important retail sales report. Technology stocks had another strong session, while an industry group flexed its muscles thanks to a pop in **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) shares.




The Nasdaq composite made a new closing high as it rallied 1%. It sits clear of all its moving averages and now holds a gain of about 19% for the year so far. Some investors may consider it stretched given it sits more than 8% above its 50-day line and more than 18% above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/).


The S&P 500 also made a new closing high after rising 0.8%. The benchmark index owns a more moderate year-to-date gain of nearly 15%. But it now stands more than 13% above its own 200-day line.


Advancers led decliners by almost 1.5-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and held a slender edge on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq also lost its May 29 distribution day due to the 5% rule. This is when the index climbs more than 5% from the distribution day's close.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a four-session losing streak as it gained 0.5%, inching just above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) made the strongest gain here with a 2% lift while **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) lagged again as it fell 1.2%.


Small caps gave the bears a bloody nose in Monday's stock market. The Russell 2000 rallied out of the red to gain 0.8%. It remains below its 50-day line though. Growth stocks did better, with the Innovator IBD 50 exchange traded fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 1.2%.


Retail Sales Data On Deck
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP061724.jpg)Tuesday's headlines are due to include the release of May U.S. retail sales figures by the Commerce Department. Headline sales are expected to rise 0.3% vs. being flat the previous month, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Minus autos, economists see them inching up to 0.3% vs. the prior April's reading of 0.2% growth.


Consumer spending accounts for almost 70% of the U.S. economy. So this data point is important to measuring the health of the U.S. consumer. While it drives economic growth, it can also fuel inflation.


"We expect May's retail sales report to be stronger than the weaker profile we have seen in recent months, perhaps as some payback after control group sales have declined three of the past four months," UBS economist Jonathan Pringle said in a note to clients.


There will also be some Fedspeak during the day. Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler and Dallas Fed President Laurie Logan are due to make public appearances.


Over the weekend Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, a member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, spoke out on rates. He said it is a "reasonable prediction" the Fed will make a rate cut in December based on current conditions.


Autodesk Pop Boosts Design Software Group
-----------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Monday mostly higher](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Consumer discretionary and technology came in the strongest while real estate and utilities, the latter a defensive area, absorbed the hardest blows.


Once again, the performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups was telling [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).



Department stores, fabless semiconductor plays, office supply retailers and meat products stocks all had healthy sessions.


In addition, the design software group also outperformed. A pop in Autodesk shares fueled the rally. Autodesk ended the day up 6.5% amid news that activist fund Starboard Value bought a $500 million slice of the company.


Autodesk gapped through its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) but remains a long way below a potential consolidation entry of 279.53, [MarketSurge analysis shows](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/). Poor price performance over the past 12 months is underlined by its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 33 out of 99.


In contrast, solar stocks, drugstores, medical software plays, and generic drug firms were among the worst stock market laggards.

The stock market fell sharply Tuesday after a couple of pieces of economic data reminded investors that the U.S. economy is on shaky ground.




Major stock indexes started to slide just after 10 a.m. ET after the latest reading on consumer confidence came in below expectations. So did a regional manufacturing survey from the Richmond Federal Reserve.


The Conference Board's consumer confidence survey came in at 98.7, below the consensus of 101 and the lowest level in more than a year. Meanwhile, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing index contracted to -19, worse than May's reading of -9 and well below the 2 consensus.


The 10-year Treasury yield rose early but backed off highs by the close. Just after 4 p.m. ET, the yield was nearly flat around 3.19%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP062822--250x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6%, weighed down by big drops for **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)). The Russell 2000 small-cap index gave back 1.9%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The selling was most pronounced in the Nasdaq composite, which turned a 1% early gain to a loss of 3% by the close. The index has been getting resistance at its 10-week moving average since April. It came to within 6 points of its 10-week average Tuesday before turning lower. The Nasdaq also closed below Friday's follow-through-day low, wounding the new market uptrend. As a result, IBD's market outlook was lowered a notch in today's Market Pulse to "uptrend under pressure."



Volume on the Nasdaq rose from Monday, giving the index a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The fact that the index suffered a higher-volume decline so close to the follow-through day also doesn't bode well for the new rally.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1. High-profile semiconductor stocks like **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) fell more than 5% each and are threatening to break below recent lows.

Chip-equipment firm **Photronics** ([PLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAB)) was looking pretty good when the stock was testing a prior area while trading near the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). But sellers swarmed around the stock Tuesday, knocking shares lower by nearly 10%. Photronics is a good example of how a weak stock market usually takes everything down with it.


The S&P 500 fell 2% and marked a bearish outside day after trying to move above its 21-day exponential moving average. It barely closed above Friday's low after undercutting it slightly. NYSE volume fell slightly.


A couple of casino operators in the S&P 500 with a big presence in China outperformed after the country eased Covid restrictions for inbound travelers. **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) rallied 3% and **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) added 4%, but both stocks closed near session lows and are still stuck in downtrends.


Oil And Gas Stocks Outperform
-----------------------------


Losers beat winners on the NYSE by just over 2-to-1, but it would've been worse if not for a strong session for oil and gas stocks. Top S&P 500 gainers in the energy patch included **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)), **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)), **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)).

The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) was the sole bright spot among the S&P's 11 sectors, rising 2.7%, but the fund closed off session highs.


Solar stocks lagged badly after recent strength and were among the worst performers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). **Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)), **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) and **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) ended with losses of more than 6% each.


The SPDR Gold Shares ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) lost ground for the fourth straight session as it struggles below the 200-day moving average. The Biden administration on Tuesday blocked gold imports from Russia. Gold has been having a tough time making headway amid a strong U.S. dollar. After finding support at the 50-day line, the Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish ETF ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) gapped up and closed with a gain of 0.6%.

Health Care Holds Up
--------------------


Some health care stocks have tempted investors lately, but after five straight gains, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) reversed sharply lower below its 50-day moving average, falling 1.7%.


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), which joined [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Monday, is the second highest weighted stock in the fund. It outperformed Tuesday, but the stock still pared a 2.6% gain to around 0.5%.



If you're sitting in a healthy cash position, you're in a good spot. Even with last week's follow-through day, the cupboard was pretty bare with prospects. The stock market sent a clear message Tuesday: It's still a risky environment in which to be buying stocks. If you're still holding some winners, don't be afraid to trim positions or take profits outright. Above all else, cut losses short.

Financials Shine, But Nasdaq Rocked As Tech Stocks Take Heat
=============================================================

Strength in some financials led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 0.4% gain and record closing high Wednesday, but action was wild and woolly in semiconductor, FANG and China stocks, resulting in a day of institutional selling for the Nasdaq composite.




 Volume rose sharply over Tuesday's levels on the Nasdaq and was indicated higher on the NYSE. The Nasdaq registered a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/ http://www.investors.com/short-selling/), raising its count to four. The S&P 500 avoided one because its percentage decline was too small.


For the second straight session, the Dow's strength was fueled by solid moves for **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), which ended with gains of around 1%-2%. **UnitedHeath Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) also outperformed.


JPMorgan hit a new high after finding support at the 50-day moving average for the first time after a breakout over a 95.32 buy point. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, is trying to reclaim a 247.17 buy point, but it's been a laggard in the financial sector as evidenced by a [Relative Price Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 52.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MP112917-161x300.png)Citizens Financial** ([CFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFG)) cleared a long consolidation with a 39.20 buy point, rising nearly 5% to 40.67. It closed within the 5% buy zone. It was one of many regional banks that broke out of bases.


Money flowed out of bonds Wednesday, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield by 5 basis points to 2.38%. That was one factor influencing the rally in banks.


The S&P 500 eased less than 0.1%, but the Nasdaq composite slumped 1.3%. Longtime chip leaders **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) gave up their 50-day moving average lines in heavy volume. Morgan Stanley on Monday cited lower flash memory prices and weak earnings growth next year as a reason to take profits in the chip space. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index lost 4.4%, closing just above the 50-day line.


Surprisingly, breadth was slightly positive on the Nasdaq, with selling concentrated in larger-cap names.


Small caps kept pace with the Dow as the Russell 2000 added 0.4% to a record closing high. Regional banks did much of the heavy lifting in the small-cap index. **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) cleared a base with a 97.21 buy point, rising 2% to 98.24, but volume was only slightly above average.


Among the FANG stocks, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) fell below its 50-day line, while **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is testing support at the 50-day line. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) continue to hold above the key support levels.


China stocks were also a drag on the Nasdaq. **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) gave back 4.5% to 110.82. It's still holding above a 105.60 double-bottom buy point and still holding above the 50-day moving average. **YY Inc**. ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) extended its losing streak to four sessions, falling 7%. It's also above the 50-day line.


Growth stocks were across the board with more than half the names in the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) down 2% or more.


Bitcoin dominated the headlines again after it cleared the 11,000 level early Wednesday, but the cryptocurrency fell below 10,000 in afternoon trading, resulting in another session of volatile trading for **Bitcoin Investment Trust** ([GBTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBTC)), **Overstock.com** ([OSTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSTK)) (an investor in the technology behind Bitcoin) and **Riot Blockchain** ([RIOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIOT)).


With broad-based weakness in growth stocks Wednesday, some might be wondering why IBD's market outlook wasn't lowered a notch to "uptrend under pressure." It's a good question, but one that's not hard to answer, because the Nasdaq composite is only 1% off its high and Wednesday's selling wasn't broad. Also keep in mind that the Dow, S&P 500 and Russell 200o hit new highs Wednesday. In addition, all four indexes continue to hold above their 50-day lines.


Retail stocks also outperformed, helped in part by news that the economy grew at a rate of 3.3% in the third quarter, mostly in-line with estimates. **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) jumped 4% to a new high. The strength came after the discount retailer gapped up Nov. 17 on strong earnings.


Meanwhile, bullish sentiment in the market remains high according to the latest data from Investors Intelligence. The number of bullish newsletter writers rose to 62.3% in the latest week, up from 61.5% the prior week, and the eighth straight reading above 60%. Three weeks ago, bullish sentiment hit a 30-year high of 64.4%.


In the past, high bullish sentiment has been seen near market tops, while excessively bearish sentiment has been seen near market lows.


The bottom line? Yellow flags have been out there for a while, so playing defense probably makes more sense than offense at this point. That said, with major stock indexes holding above their 50-day lines, the market uptrend must still be respected. Rotation out of technology stocks and into financial and retail names was in plain sight Wednesday. For those underinvested, seeking out opportunities in these sectors isn't bad strategy.

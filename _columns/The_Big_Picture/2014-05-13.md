The S&P 500 made a new high Tuesday, but it wasn't enough to relieve the market from its lethargic pace.

  

The benchmark index climbed less than 0.1% after trimming most of a 0.3% advance earlier in the day. The Nasdaq lagged, losing 0.3%. Volume inched up on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE.

  

In the strictest technical terms, the S&P 500's new high would represent the resumption of a market uptrend. But that would be a disingenuous conclusion in light of the market's indecisive landscape.

  

Even as it climbed to a new high, the S&P 500 stalled. That's not exactly a triumphant way to start a bullish trend.

  

In other ways, the market seems to be dragging its feet.

  

Nearly a month since a promising reversal off a low, the indexes have yet to deliver a confirmation of the attempted rally.

  

The Nasdaq is stuck basically between 4000 and 4185. Its advance-decline line is trending downward, as is the composite's 50-day moving average.

  

Big caps, utilities, transportation and a few other sectors have helped prop up the S&P 500. The NYSE advance-decline line is at a new high, which underscores the divergent paths the broad indexes have taken.

  

While the market tries to sort itself out, it's best to keep little or no exposure to stocks. Wait for the market to give a clear confirmation of its rally before committing funds.

  

The indexes may be sluggish, but don't count out a bullish signal occurring any day now.

  

The IBD 50 added 0.3%, thanks largely to an 8% surge in shares of **Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)). **Coca Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) — Keurig's partner in a cold-beverage machine being developed — disclosed it had raised its stake in Keurig.

  

The recent breakouts in the IBD 50 have produced mixed results, which is another layer in the market's muddled picture.

  

**Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)), **Iconix** ([ICON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICON)) and **Manitowoc** ([MTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTW)) have slid below their buy points.

  

**United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) and **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) are making tentative gains from their entries.

  

But **Trinity Industries** ([TRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRN)), **Air Lease** ([AL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AL)), **Old Dominion Freight Lines** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)), **AmTrust Financial Services** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)) have made strides from breakouts.

  

**Aspen Technology** ([AZPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZPN)) tried to break out from an awkward cup with handle, but reversed lower despite a jump in volume.

  

The day's leading industry groups were a mix of defensive and cyclical stocks: Food, auto, data storage and air freight were among the top groups. Weakness in software and chip stocks hurt the Nasdaq. Banks and building were other weakling sectors.

  

Retail stocks were broadly lower after the sector's April sales inched up 0.1%, missing forecasts.

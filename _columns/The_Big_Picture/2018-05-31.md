U.S. stock indexes lost ground Thursday, as a midnight deadline loomed for the Trump tariffs targeting Europe, Canada and Mexico.




The Nasdaq slipped 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.7% and 1%, respectively. Indexes closed low in their daily price ranges.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which added a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) to the composite. Volume was indicated higher on the NYSE, which would give the S&P 500 a distribution day as well.


Although the tariffs on steel and aluminum looked certain just hours before the midnight deadline, President Trump is known for making sharp U-turns.

Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said the U.S. tariffs were "totally unacceptable." He said the EU would bring a case to the World Trade Organization.


Even if the WTO were to rule against the U.S., it isn't clear what Trump would do. During his presidential campaign, Trump threatened to pull the U.S. out of the WTO. Also, the WTO's process is slow. The process begins with a 60-day negotiation period. A ruling could take 18 months or longer.


Resistance For Stock Indexes
----------------------------


Meanwhile, the stock market has its own problems as it tries to price in the Trump tariffs.


If the tariff squabbles are truly responsible for the stock market's uncertain mood, at least the reaction has just weighed on stock gains rather than creating a wave of selling.

CLOSE




The Nasdaq has not closed above the 7500 level since March 13. The S&P 500 has not made a serious run at retaking the 2800 area in the same time period.


Yet if it becomes clear that Trump's trade stance is more about conviction than pragmatic deal making, things could get ugly in a hurry in the stock market.


FANG Stocks
-----------


On Thursday, the FANG stocks — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — moved mostly in low volume.


Facebook cleared a 188.42 handle entry. Volume was well below average. But it was the strongest volume since May 2, which is a significant increase. Also, the relative strength line made a new high since the basing period began.


The best price-and-volume action belonged to Google-parent Alphabet. The stock rose 2% in volume 74% above average. Alphabet is still basing.


Two other brisk movers were apparel designer and retailer **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)), which rose almost 6% in volume 108% above average; and solar stock **Sunrun** ([RUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUN)), up 5% in volume 109% above average.


On the downside, tech stock **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) gapped down 8% in turnover 86% above normal.


Economic Data
-------------


Economic reports were generally favorable Thursday.


Consumer spending increased 0.6% in April, the fastest growth in five months.


The Chicago purchasing managers gauge for May surged to 62.7, above 59.4 which was the highest estimate in the range.


But pending home sales for April dived 1.3% vs. the consensus view of a 0.4% increase.


Homebuilder stocks were mostly down. The industry group fell 2%.


Coming Up
---------


On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its report on the employment situation for May. The report will be available before the stock market's open.


Analysts expect nonfarm payrolls to rise to 190,000 vs. 164,000 in April. The range of estimates runs from 155,000 to 220,000.

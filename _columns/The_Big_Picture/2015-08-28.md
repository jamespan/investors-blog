Stocks Enjoy Some Quiet Time; Smith & Wesson Breaks Out
========================================================

Stock indexes wandered quietly to little effect Friday, apparently content to avoid more trouble. The Nasdaq added 0.3%, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.1%. Small caps outperformed as the S&P 600 popped 0.6%.

  

The IBD 50, though, dropped 0.3%.

  

Volume fell on both major exchanges.

  

After Monday's wild intraday plunge, which took the Nasdaq 18% off its high, bulls might be happy with any kind of action that isn't a disaster.

  

If so, they got their wish and a bit more in the past four sessions. From Monday's low, the Nasdaq advanced 12%.

  

Market watchers call such action a relief rally, an odd expression because a relief rally doesn't necessarily have legs for a longer run. It usually means analysts believe the selling went too far too fast.

  

Experienced investors know that uncertainty is the main ingredient after fast market losses. Markets need time to shake off the dizziness.

  

The indexes may or may not have put in their short-term lows. A second test of the lows is a possibility, though it would take quite a drop in the Nasdaq — more than 500 points — to test the low.

  

What should an individual investor do in the meantime?

  

Savvy investors won't be drawn into a guessing game about the market's next move. This is a time to watch the major indexes closely, to avoid new purchases and perhaps to raise additional cash if circumstances are appropriate.

  

The market will eventually settle most of the doubts. Patience is necessary.

  

On Friday, breakouts were few, but one small cap managed to shoot above a base.

  

Firearms maker **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) cleared a first-stage pattern, retaking a 17.14 buy point in strong volume.

  

The retaking of buy points has been a trend lately. The market correction will pull a stock under its recent buy point, but the stock will climb back above the buy point within a few days.

  

For example, homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) closed below a 28.80 buy point Tuesday and then retook it Wednesday. Ideally, bulls want to see weaker volume on the drop below the buy point than on the retake. That's exactly what happened with Horton. Volume was 42% above average on the drop and 78% above average on the reclaiming of the buy point.

  

Lawn care products maker **Toro** ([TTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTC)) closed below a 70.69 buy point Aug. 21 and then recaptured it Thursday. Volume, though, was heavier on the drop than on the rebound.

  

Online networking platform **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) lost its buy point Aug. 21 and regained it Wednesday. However, volume was weaker on the rebound than on the drop under the buy point.

  

Alcoholic beverage producer and marketer **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) sloshed under a 122.23 entry Monday. The stock retook the buy point Wednesday in volume 182% above average. Volume on the decline was 161% but up volume was stronger than down volume in that session.

  

In the context of this market, the reclaiming of a buy point is encouraging action.

  

Economic reports were on the light side Friday. Personal income for July was in line with views for a 0.4% gain. Consumer spending, though, rose 0.3% vs. views for 0.4%. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for August missed: The Street expected 93.3 but got 91.9.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq added 2.6%; the IBD 50, 1.5%; the Dow Jones industrial average, 1.1%; and the S&P 500, 0.9%.

The major stock indexes jumped sharply Thursday, adding to this week's already-strong gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is approaching record highs.




The Nasdaq rallied 2.6%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also advanced 1.9%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 traded 2.8% higher.


Leading growth stocks also raced higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 2.8% on Thursday.


In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) surged nearly 8%, breaking out above an early entry at 65.52. On the downside, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) tumbled 2.7% after its [quarterly results were mixed](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-stock-alibaba-earnings-q2/).


Volume was higher from Wednesday's session on the Nasdaq, while preliminary data showed slightly lower volume on the NYSE.


Stock Market Rally Extends Gains
--------------------------------


Last week, the major stock indexes staged their worst weeks since the coronavirus stock market crash in March. For the week, the Dow Jones tumbled 6.5%, the S&P 500 index lose 5.6%, and the Nasdaq composite shed 5.5%. Friday's action pushed IBD's market outlook [into a correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-sell-off-amazon-apple-facebook-tesla-dive-alphabet-new-buy-point/).


![MP110520](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP110520-288x300.jpg)But this week has been a completely different story. On Wednesday, [follow-through signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 indexes put the market trend back into an uptrend. Now, the Nasdaq staged its own follow-through day, as more top stocks broke out past new buy points. It amounted to more positive signals for the stock market.


During market corrections, investors should be building watchlists of potential leaders. Now it's time to put those watchlists to work.


Investors should use the recent strength as a go-ahead to buy new breakouts. Start slowly with new purchases and see how they perform. After raising cash during the recent correction, don't become fully invested all at once. Try some new buys. If they work, you can add to them; if not, you can back away.


In particular, focus on stocks with strong relative strength, which can be done by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, then the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, then the line will point lower.


Stocks to watch include [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/), companies with stable earnings growth and price performance.

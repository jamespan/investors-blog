Buyers pushed the Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite into new high ground Friday, with semiconductor stocks leading the charge again. The stock market started off on solid footing after White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the U.S. and China are getting close to a preliminary trade deal.




Strong earnings from **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) fueled a breakout over a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) add-on entry. Applied Materials' strength helped lift VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) to a gain of 1%. IBD's chip-equipment group was one of the day's top performers, up around 2%.


The Nasdaq showed the most impressive technical action, with a bullish gap above the 8500 level. It scored a fresh all-time closing high, along with the Dow and S&P 500. All three indexes closed with gains of 0.7% to 0.8%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Thursday's levels.

The Oct. 16 distribution day fell off the count due to the Nasdaq's strong gain since that day. Even though the S&P 500 still shows four distribution days, all four came with moderate price declines.


Economic Data
-------------


In economic news, Wall Street liked the look of a 0.3% rise in October same-store sales, slightly better than expected. But excluding autos, sales rose 0.2%, below the consensus estimate of 0.4%.


Meanwhile, the stock market shrugged off a weaker than expected number from the Empire State manufacturing index. But weak manufacturing data is nothing new for the stock market. Earlier this month, the ISM manufacturing index contracted for the third straight month.

Despite the new data, worries about a recession for the U.S. economy have subsided. The stock market seems to be on board with the Fed, which is expecting 2.2% growth for the economy this year and 2% growth in 2020.


Stock Market Movers

[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) was a top gainer in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), up more than 7%.

IBD 50 stock **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) continued its torrid run, rising nearly 8%. For those who bought at the 29.48 entry, taking profits is a perfectly reasonable strategy at this point. A key IBD [sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) is to take a 20%-25% gain in a stock after a breakout. InMode was featured in Friday's [New America](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/inmode-stock-incredible-streak-medical-aesthetics-player-redefine-plastic-surgery/).


**Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) gain from a 221.47 entry hit 20% Friday.

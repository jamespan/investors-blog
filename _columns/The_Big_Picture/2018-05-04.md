Stocks forgot their worries over trade rules with China, Dodd-Frank banking regulations and inflation, as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) led the market higher Friday.




The Nasdaq charged ahead 1.7%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the large cap S&P 500 added 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


Bulls would've preferred price gains in rising volume but they took what they could get.

Bulls and bears alike will be waiting to see if the market can follow-up Monday.


Apple gapped up 4% in volume 62% above average, clearing a consolidation. Warren Buffett provided the catalyst. Buffett revealed that his **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)) bought 75 million shares of Apple in the first quarter. Berkshire began acquiring Apple shares in early 2016.


If Buffett's remarks were aimed at reviving a troubled stock market, they succeeded Friday.


The Nasdaq retook its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 and the Dow sprang from their 200-day lines.


Apple comprises the biggest weighting in the Nasdaq, 6.3%. Apple is the sixth-biggest weighting in the price-weighted Dow. It also accounts for 4% of the S&P 500 by market cap.


Buffett also said his fund dumped the last of its **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) shares. The IBM position was already down to 0.18% of Berkshire's holdings, so that did not contribute much of a splash in Q1.


On Friday, IBM rose 1.3% despite Buffett's remarks. IBM bulls may have decided that Big Blue won't have to face any more downward pressure from Berkshire.


Breakouts were understandably limited on a day when volume was declining.


Stocks that broke out in strong volume included payroll and personnel software provider **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), up 6.6%; business software developer **Mindbody** ([MB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MB)), up 4.3%; liquefied natural gas play **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)), up nearly 6%; and pet medical stock **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)), up 8.4%.


News for a change took a back seat. The China trade talks were conducted without noisy headlines. A small move in average hourly wages chilled fears on inflation. That was part of the April jobs report, which showed job gains less than expected.

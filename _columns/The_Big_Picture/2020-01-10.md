Stock Market Dips Late After Dow Jones Tops 29,000; 4 Recent IPOs To Watch Right Now
=====================================================================================

Sellers came into the stock market during the final hour of trading Friday, but losses were mild as Wall Street took news of [weaker-than-expected job and wage growth](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-u-s-economy-adds-145000-wage-growth-slows-dow-jones-rises/) in December mostly in stride.




The Dow Jones industrials topped the 29,000 level briefly before pulling back. The blue-chip index eased 0.5% at the close. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended with losses of 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index fell 0.4%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Thursday.


In recent days, talk of an overbought market ripe for a pullback has been growing. And there's something to that. The Nasdaq 100 and Nasdaq composite moved above upper price-channel lines Thursday. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is just above an upper channel line, while chip leaders like **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are getting close to the top of their upper channel lines.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP011020-265x300.jpg)A move above an upper channel doesn't mean a stock, or an index, is about to roll over, but it's a sign that either could be ready to take a breather for a while. Also keep in mind that the Nasdaq 100 closed Friday about 6% above its 50-day moving average. That's the same level it was right before the index pulled back sharply in early May after a strong rally off its December 2018 low. The index was 5.4% above its 50-day line in late July ahead of another sharp pullback.


Of course, overbought markets can stay overbought for a while, so it still makes sense to target potentially actionable stock charts. And there's no shortage of prospects in this vein, particularly when it comes to [recent IPOs](https://www.investors.com/iponews).


Brazil-based brokerage **XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)) reversed slightly lower Friday, but its weekly chart looks just fine as it forms an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). **Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)), a benefits management company specializing in fertility services, is five weeks into a cup-shaped pattern. It's also on breakout watch.

**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), an emerging leader in the rejuvenated enterprise software group, is also working on an early-stage base. Datadog isn't profitable yet but shows big sales growth in recent quarters.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) is another recent IPO in the enterprise software group. It ended the week still in buy range after a breakout from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 27.29 entry.


It's not a new issue, but **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) staged a nice breakout Friday, clearing a cup-with-handle base with a 64.24 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

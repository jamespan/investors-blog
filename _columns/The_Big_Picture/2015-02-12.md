Nasdaq Escapes Trading Range, But S&P 500 Still In Box
=======================================================

The Nasdaq pushed to a new high Thursday, but the action for top-rated stocks was mixed.


Volume rose across the board as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 popped 1.2% and 1%, respectively.


The IBD 50 added 0.7%.


While the gains weren't dramatic, they did raise the possibility that the range that stocks have been trapped in for more than two months is disintegrating.


The Nasdaq on Thursday broke above the boxlike trading range that's been in place since late November. The S&P 500, though, remains under the high it made in late December.


Leading stocks rising in volume Thursday had only a moderate advantage over high-volume losers. (See the Market Pulse at right.)


Another drawback was that the top-performing industry groups were mostly laggards, such as steel and oil.


One bullish development was combined new highs, which dominated new lows, 286-21 — the best ratio since late August.


Meanwhile, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) pegged a new high and is 22% above a 103.84 buy point cleared in October. A stock that rises 20% to 25% above its buy point will often begin a new consolidation. Individual investors who bought at the October buy point have a decision to make: hold or take profits?


Apple's stock action has complicated the decision. Recently, the stock broke out from a shallow, base-on-base pattern. The stock is up 5% from the 119.85 buy point.


One way for October buyers to play the situation is to sit tight and see if the most recent breakout can also reach the 20% profit level.


Selling there might be ideal, because the next base would be third stage. A later-stage base is more likely to fail than a first- or second-stage pattern.


Breakouts on Thursday included software development services outsourcer **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) and September [initial public offering](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)).


News was mixed. Reuters reported that Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine had agreed on a cease-fire. In Brussels, European Union negotiators succeeded only in getting Greece to agree to more talks — this time with its creditors.


In the U.S., initial jobless claims were higher than expected, and January retail sales fell more than the consensus estimate.


Volume could be light Friday, given that it is the last session before a three-day weekend. The market will be closed Monday for Presidents Day.

Stock Market Turns Mostly Lower After Nasdaq 100 Hits Record High; 3 Breakout Stocks To Watch Include Tesla
============================================================================================================

The stock market ended a volatile session mostly lower Thursday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied as much as 0.35% before turning lower to close down 0.7%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 set a record high, erasing losses from the coronavirus stock market crash, but closed down 0.8%.




The S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher — buoyed by a 6.4% jump in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 ended the session flat. But leading growth stocks sharply underperformed: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) slid 1.9%, its biggest loss since May 12 when it fell 2.6%. Volume was much higher on the Nasdaq vs. Wednesday's session and appeared slightly higher on the NYSE.


Nasdaq 100 Sets Record High
---------------------------


Stunningly, the Nasdaq 100 hit a record high Thursday, becoming the first major stock index to completely recover from the coronavirus stock market crash. On March 23, the Nasdaq 100 bottomed after a 22.5% drop from the start of the year.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP060420_1-224x300.jpg)Thursday's sharp losses came in higher volume than Wednesday, adding a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) to the Nasdaq. After a stall day on May 26, the Nasdaq now has two days of institutional selling. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 added its first distribution day due to Thursday's higher NYSE volume.


For now at least, leading growth stocks continue to at least try to break out. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) tried to break out past a 58.26 buy point in a cup with handle Thursday, but was turned away. [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) member **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) again tried to move past a 387.95 buy point in a flat base. Shares rallied as much as 1.1% before reversing to fall 1.9%.


Meanwhile, stock market leader **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is back at its 50-day moving average for the second time in as many weeks. If the stock breaks the 50-day in heavy turnover, then more downside could be imminent.

Earnings To Watch: Broadcom, DocuSign
-------------------------------------


After the close Thursday, two top stocks reported their earnings: chip giant **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and [IPO Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)).


[Broadcom](https://www.investors.com/research/avgo-stock-buy-now/) reported [EPS that matched analyst targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/broadcom-earnings-q2-2020-avgo-stock/) and revenue that topped estimates. But shares slipped about 1% in the after-hours session. Broadcom is extended past a 277.82 buy point in a [deep cup with handle.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/)


DocuSign reported [strong Q1 earnings and sales numbers](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/docusign-earnings-docu-stock-q12020-covid/), sending shares up more than 2% late Thursday. The IPO Leader ended Thursday more than 40% above a 98.48 alternate entry in a cup with handle.

Potential Breakout Stocks To Watch: Costco, Tesla, Trade Desk
-------------------------------------------------------------


**Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) reported stronger-than-expected monthly comparable-store sales, sending shares up 1.3% on Thursday in the regular session.


Costco briefly moved up above an aggressive entry at 311.93, but closed below the buy trigger. Shares of the warehouse retailer are still approaching a 322.73 buy point in a cup with handle after finding support near their 50- and 200-day moving average lines in recent sessions.


A key downside is the [stock's lagging relative strength line.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) When a stock breaks out, the RS line should hit new highs on the breakout day or shortly thereafter to confirm the stock as a potential leader.


Tesla stock fell back below a 869.92 buy point in a cup with handle, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The 5% buy zone tops out at 913.42. Shares fell 2.1% Thursday.


Tesla was added back to the [IBD Leaderboard Leaders list](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Monday after the strong breakout. According to IBD Leaderboard commentary: "Tesla broke out above a handle on an extra-deep cup base. It is trading above a trend line within the handle that offers an aggressive entry near 828."


Trade Desk surged past a 327.45 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) buy point on Wednesday with an 11.5% surge. But after Thursday's slide, shares are back in a 5% buy zone that runs up to 343.82.


[Trade Desk stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-the-trade-desk-inc-cl-a-ttd.aspx) boasts a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, placing it in the top echelon of growth stocks. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors easily gauge a stock's strengths.

On Jan. 4 this year, Wall Street celebrated Dow 25,000. After Wednesday's buoyant advance, it's almost time to say hello to Nasdaq 8000.




The Nasdaq composite, home to many of the greatest growth companies in U.S. stock market history, paced a fairly broad advance Wednesday with a gain of nearly 1.2%. That marked its biggest single-session advance since a 1.4% rally on July 12.


The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, steamrolled over the market bears. It rose 1.4% and breached the 7500 level for the first time, and notched a new all-time high.


The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, despite suffering some weakness in certain sectors including construction, leisure and select retailing.


As seen in the Market Pulse table, the [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count fell by one on the Nasdaq and by two on the S&P 500. The June 19 distribution for both indexes expired on time.

This means that the large-cap benchmark now shows just one instance of intense professional selling in recent weeks. (*The distribution count on the S&P 500 was incorrect in an earlier version of this story. The current Market Pulse shows the correct number*.)


Small-cap stocks lagged but still joined the rally. The S&P SmallCap 600 reversed from an early loss of less than 0.6% to edge 0.2% higher by day's end. That snapped a mild three-day losing streak.


As seen on a daily chart, all of the key indexes finished close to session highs. That's a signature of solid institutional demand.


Another such signature that the big boys and girls of the market were busy accumulating shares? Volume on the NYSE grew.


A solid advance in higher turnover vs. the prior session suggests that demand from the institutional crowd is increasing.


Indeed, you need the fund managers on your side if you are going to have any hope that your stocks or equity-based ETFs are going to go higher.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange-traded fund spurted 2.9% higher to 37.40. Volume bulged 41% above its 50-day average. FFTY rallied 34% in 2017.


Indeed, the Accumulation/Distribution ratings for both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have improved since the market outlook upgraded to "uptrend resumes" on May 10. Back then, the ratings were in the D range. As of Tuesday's close, the S&P 500 showed a hearty B- grade on a scale of A to E, the Nasdaq a C+.



Another Trump Victory?
----------------------


One-on-one talks between President Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the European Commission, bore fruit. Bloomberg reported that Europe will expand imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas and soybeans.


Both sides will cut tariffs on industrial products.Â Trump reportedly added that the two sides would work toward "zero" tariffs on industrial goods. Such news certainly gave the indexes an extra kick higher in the final half-hour of trading.


But investors shouldn't ignore one of the most important factors that have helped stocks rise in recent years: earnings.


A True Stock Market Driver
--------------------------


So far, the Q2 reporting season hasn't been bad at all.


"Corporate earnings for Q2 have been coming in 20% higher year over year and revenue have been 9% higher," noted Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. "The strong earnings results and strengthening economy continue to buoy the stock market, although at 16.5 times forward earnings, the market could be another 6%-9% higher from here if the market returned to the multiples it reached last year (e.g. 17.5 to 18 times earnings)."


"The catalyst to unleashing a higher multiple could be the removal of the trade war fears, but today is just the first step. Going forward, negotiations with Mexico and Canada will be very important and the 800 pound gorilla in the room is China, which also serves as the Trump administration's most difficult challenge," Zaccarelli added.


But earnings reports carry risk, a point that was illustrated after Wednesday's close. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) plunged more than 20% after the company's quarterly sales missed estimates and guidance was weak.


The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100 was down more than 2% in extended trading.

Sellers came into the final hour of stock market trading Tuesday, resulting in another distribution day for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500.




The Nasdaq composite notched an early gain of nearly 0.6%, but the index reversed lower for a loss of 0.4%. Volume rose, giving the index its eighth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), with seven higher-volume declines coming in March alone.


The S&P 500 also marked a mild distribution day, falling nearly 0.3% in higher volume. **Seagate Technology** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)) was the second-highest gainer in the index, up more than 7%. Early Tuesday, Morgan Stanley upgraded the data storage firm to overweight from equal weigh along with a big price target hike to 115 from 73. Morgan Stanley [cited a "more attractive multiyear earnings story](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/seagate-stock-upgrade-ai/)."


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 small-cap index edged lower by 0.1% to 0.2%.

The distribution-day count for the Nasdaq is quite high. But keep in mind that only three of the index's higher-volume declines since Feb. 28 showed losses of 1% or more. The other five showed declines ranging from 0.3% to 0.5%.

Distribution has been similar in the S&P 500. Of the index's six distribution days, one was a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/). The other five showed declines ranging from 0.3% to less than 0.7%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the NYSE and Nasdaq by about 3-to-2.


The advance/decline line for the NYSE has been on a nice uptrend since early February as stock market leadership has broadened beyond tech. But the Nasdaq's advance/decline line has been trending lower since mid-February.


Magnificent Seven stocks like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) continue to show strength and hold near highs. But weakening breadth on the Nasdaq is something to monitor, along with excessively bullish sentiment among stock market newsletter writers.


Nvidia snapped a six-session win streak Tuesday, falling 2.6% in lower volume. The AI leader is still holding above its 10-day moving average.


Investors Intelligence will release its latest reading on bullish/bearish sentiment Wednesday. Bullish sentiment has been above 60% for two weeks in a row. That's considered excessively bullish. It's a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.


While top-rated growth stocks in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com) continue to show strength and support, it's getting harder to find actionable setups. If you do find a stock setting up in a base, make sure it has a strong [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) and a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) that's near highs.


Stocks To Watch
---------------


Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is near the top of a nine-week cup base after an earnings sell-off in late January. But the stock's RS line is still well below its late-January high. In the biotech group, **Vericel**'s ([VCEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VCEL)) relative strength line is near highs as the stock sets up in a cup base.

**MGM Resorts** ([MGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGM)) is closing in quickly on a 47.53 entry, but a lagging RS line and RS Rating of 56 don't fit the mold of a true stock market leader.


In the software sector, **Pegasystems** ([PEGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEGA)) has a relative strength line near highs as the stock sets up in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). After soaring on earnings on Feb. 15, Pegasystems' latest base formed as the stock moved sideways while holding support at the 21-day line.



The stock market will be closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. But the bond market will be open, and the latest reading from one of the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauges will be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. On a year-over-year basis, the core personal consumption expenditures index for February is expected to come in at 2.8%, unchanged from January.


Federal funds futures traders think there's a 70% chance that the first interest-rate cut will come at the June meeting. The market envisions two more quarter-point cuts after that, which would bring the fed funds rate down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% by year end.

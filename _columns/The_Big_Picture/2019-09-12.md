Stock Market Stalls, Turning An Up Day Less Cheery
===================================================

U.S. stock market indexes stalled Thursday, turning early gains into disappointment for the bulls. News on the trade war initially cheered the market with a suggestion of softening on both sides.




The Nasdaq climbed as much as 0.9% but settled for a 0.3% gain. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Small caps in the Russell 2000 stepped down less than 0.1%.


Volume in the stock market fell on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


Aside from Thursday's stalling look, technicals improved in a variety of ways in recent sessions.


The Aug. 27 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) fell off the Nasdaq and S&P 500 because of significant price gains lately. Research shows that a distribution day can fall off because of time or because of cumulative price gains.


The count remains manageable on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


New Highs Vs. New Lows
----------------------


Another area of improvement is new highs vs. new lows. Going into Thursday's session, daily new 52-week or all-time highs in September averaged 171 vs. 64 new lows.


Also, the percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day moving average reached 62% Wednesday, the highest level in six weeks.


Stock Market And Tariffs
------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP_2x1_091219-240x300.jpg)In financial-related news Thursday, President Donald Trump delayed the date for implementing new tariffs against China. The deadline was reset from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15. China has been signaling flexibility since late August.


The game between Trump and China's Xi Jinping apparently has turned toward matching the positive move rather than repaying hostility with hostility. It's hard to tell how long that situation will last.


In the meantime, the European Central Bank cut interest rates and resumed quantitative easing.


Trump is hoping the Federal Reserve will cut U.S. interest rates after the Sept. 17-18 meeting. The Street is expecting a quarter-point cut.


Gains Were Broad
----------------


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, updated every day after the market close in [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), gainers were broadly based. Groups leading the day's winners included homebuilders, payment processors, chips, metal ores, Internet, toys and some retail stocks.


Losers for the day also included some retail stocks as well as medical and oil plays.


Breakouts And New Highs
-----------------------


New highs and/or breakouts included **Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)), which scored a new high but remains in the 5% buy zone. Ally's pretax margin was 17% last year, the second highest in the past seven years.



Ally holds a [new spot in IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). The midcap remains within [the proper buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).

Other stocks in the same industry group were mostly down.

The stock crossed above a 21.46 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



Home and building products provider **Griffon** ([GFF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFF)) knifed almost 4% higher. The small cap stock passed above a 19.22 [breakout price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in busy volume.


On the negative side, **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) slid 10% in fast trade. The provider of home energy solutions peaked in late August and then came down like a waterfall. The solar energy stock lost about 40% in 12 sessions.

The stock market's second half of 2015 is clearly off to a poor start. Wednesday's decline was a perfect reminder that traders are nervous about the latest headlines. The Nasdaq composite paced the sell-off, falling nearly 1.8%. The S&P 500 was off 1.7% and slumped back below its 200-day moving average. (See Page B2)

  

The IBD 50 dropped 1.9%.

  

Volume fell below Tuesday's levels. But as seen on Page B2, turnover was still heavy on the Nasdaq. A three-hour outage on the floor of the NYSE likely impacted overall composite turnover to a minor degree.

  

The Nasdaq's decline off its peak has now touched 5%. Certainly, technicians will be watching closely to see if the composite finds support at its 4888 short-term low set on May 6.

  

The latest statistics of the market appear to suggest that future upside is limited.

  

Since the Nasdaq hit an all-time high of 5164 on June 24, the leading index's major moves have all been to the downside.

  

Tuesday's positive reversal was stunning. Yet strong buying didn't follow. Rather, Wednesday's loss marked the Nasdaq's fourth decline of 0.5% or more in the past three weeks.

  

The Nasdaq fell 0.7% on June 24, 0.6% on June 26 and 2.4% on June 29. The biggest up day over the same time frame? A measly 0.6% gain on June 30.

  

The new highs list has deflated fast. On June 26, IBD's screened list of new highs counted 134 stocks on the Nasdaq vs. 56 new lows. Since then, new lows have swamped new highs every day, sometimes by a 3-to-1 margin.

  

The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has plunged in the past two weeks, meaning that fewer stocks are going up.

  

More tech stocks have been struggling lately, particularly the chips. The Philadelphia semiconductor index lost 2.6% on Wednesday. It's down 4.6% since Jan. 1. On the NYSE, the advance-decline line fell even more sharply. (See the S&P 500 chart on B2.)

  

Yet in IBD's research tables, the apparel, medical, media, S&Ls, chips, consumer and software sectors still held double-digit gains for the year as of Wednesday's paper (pages B6-B7).

  

Fear is rising. That's good. Pundits and fund managers display this emotion as they're selling stocks. The accumulating cash can later help fuel future rallies.

  

The put-call volume ratio is still high, but it still hasn't hit the 12-month peak of 1.41 seen on Oct. 13. The CBOE market volatility index jumped to its highest close since Jan. 30. (See the psychological indicators table on Page B11.)

  

Bulls in the latest Investors Intelligence survey sank to 44.8%.

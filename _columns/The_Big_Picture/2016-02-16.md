Stock Indexes Score Bullish Gains For Second Straight Session
==============================================================

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq took another step toward a bottom Tuesday with robust gains in mixed volume.


On the heels of Friday’s 1.7% gain in lower volume, the Nasdaq added 2.3% in higher volume, the S&P 500 rose 1.7%, and the Dow industrials picked up 1.4%. Volume on the NYSE fell from Friday’s above-average volume levels.


Higher volume wasn’t exactly a tall order for the Nasdaq. Volume was below average Friday ahead of the three-day weekend.


![MP021716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP021716-191x300.jpg)Breadth was solid on both exchanges, with advancers outnumbering decliners by more than 4-to-1 on the NYSE and by 7-to-2 on the Nasdaq.


It was a solid day for the IBD 50. The index of leading growth stocks rose 2.2%. Seven components rose 4% or more, including **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **CalAmp** ([CAMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAMP)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)).


The market’s attention shifted from oil to China as investors liked the look of a 3.3% rise in the Shanghai composite overnight. Both topics have been thorns in the market’s side for a while now.


U.S.-listed China firms were among the day’s top performers. Inside the IBD 50, **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) rose 5%. It’s working on a cup-with-handle base with a 33.01 entry, although the outright leader in the group looks to be **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)), another IBD 50 name. After triggering a sell signal from a 48.94 buy point, it reclaimed the buy point Tuesday with conviction, rising 10% -- but note that its latest base was late-stage.


It’s not that oil was completely out of the news. WTI crude oil lost 1.4% to settle at $29.04 a barrel. It traded as high as $31.53 on hopes for an output cut. News that top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to freeze output at January failed to bring buyers in from the sidelines.


Even if the main indexes follow through and confirm a new uptrend in coming days, the question still remains: What’s out there to buy? Recent follow-through days for the market haven’t amounted to much, but that’s not a big surprise since growth screens were generally scant with prospects. New market uptrends need legitimate leaders -- not utility, food and consumer staple stocks.


Solar stocks were among the best performers Tuesday, with IBD’s solar group up more than 6%. But the strength in the group came from mostly low-priced names. **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) continues to show relative strength and is one of the more compelling growth stories in the group, but it’s still 38% off its high.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) bulls can’t be all that happy with the stock’s price performance despite two strong up days in a row for the Nasdaq. Facebook reversed below its 50-day moving average for the third straight session Tuesday, falling 0.4%.


The good news is that several top-rated growth names have started work on the right side of potential bases.


**O’Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is back above its 10-week moving average and only 7% off its high. It shows four straight quarters of double-digit sales growth and four quarters in a row of 20%+ earnings growth.


Small-cap payment processor **Vantiv** ([VNTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNTV)) is also back above its 10-week line and only 8% off its high. Earnings growth has accelerated for three straight quarters.

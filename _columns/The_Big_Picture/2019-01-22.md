Nasdaq Leads Broad Drop; This Is Why The Sell-Off Was Not So Awful
===================================================================

The stock market started weak and ended sharply lower Tuesday, a day in which gloomy news headlines on the economy dominated. Yet given how much stocks have rallied since Christmas, the session likely surprised few market veterans.




The day on Wall Street also featured at least three notable elements that IBD readers shouldn't ignore. Perhaps the most important of the three? Leadership-quality stocks didn't do that badly, and the sell-off did not really disturb their base-building efforts.


Two more positive angles for the day included the fact that volume fell on both main exchanges. Plus, the key averages appeared to find buyers at or near their respective 50-day moving averages.


How The Major Equity Indexes Fared
----------------------------------


The Nasdaq led the decline pretty much from start to finish. A CNBC interview with Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council, in the final hour of trading spurred some last-minute bargain-hunting. Still, the tech, consumer and health care-centered composite index fell 1.9%. That wiped out a large portion of last week's 2.7% climb.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MP012219-229x300.jpg)The S&P 500 dropped 1.4%. The S&P SmallCap 600 retreated 1.7%. Mild strength among defensive plays (think dairy, gold, alcohol, media, food and utility stocks) helped buffer the slide a little. In contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell 1.9%, posting its biggest single-day drop since a harrowing 3.4% crushing on Jan. 3. Losers sharply outmatched winners on both exchanges. But the [new lows list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jan-22-2019/) did not balloon the way it did last month.


At 7020, the Nasdaq composite still holds a 13% advance since hitting bottom at 6190 on Christmas Eve. If you're really bearish on stocks, then you should be salivating at this potential new elevator ride down in prices.


Yet on Tuesday, notice on a daily chart how this time around, the 50-day line (drawn in red) served, for now, as a level of support for the index. Roll the clock back nearly seven weeks, and you'll notice how the Nasdaq failed to bullet up through its 50-day line on Dec. 3, when it rallied 1.5% for the day. Then the Nasdaq rolled back over the next day.


The S&P 500 and the Dow industrials also pierced the 50-day line Tuesday but closed above it. The S&P MidCap 400, down 1.5% on Tuesday, has yet to touch its 50-day moving average since crossing back above it on Wednesday last week.



Longtime chartists know that when a market is healthy, certain patterns emerge. One key pattern: A major benchmark will rise above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. And over time, the 50- and 200-day lines will rise steadily too.


Technical Support In The Stock Market For Now
---------------------------------------------


That, of course, is not the situation right now.


The Nasdaq would likely need weeks, if not a few months, to rebound back above its 200-day moving average. The 200-day line is currently near 7450 and has flatlined for months.


What could spark fresh buying on Wall Street? Obviously, a positive resolution on the stiffening trade war would help greatly. So too would a general view among portfolio managers that S&P 500 companies can avoid a drop in earnings this year.


That's why the next three weeks of earnings season is so critical.


So far, banks have helped the cause. Money center, regional and S&Ls are by no means helping the new highs list at all. But look at big caps such as **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)). The two lenders both reported nice Q4 results last week. They now trade just 10% to 11% below their 52-week highs. Bank of America's RS Rating of 70 is still so-so at best. But seven weeks ago, it was 28 on a scale of 1 to 99.


Economic Slowdown Risk Up
-------------------------


Jason Pride, chief investment strategist at money manager Glenmede, is among a rising number of buy-side portfolio managers expressing concern about the federal government shutdown, which hit Day 32 on Tuesday. He notes a White House Council of Economic Advisers estimate that every week the shutdown lasts, the U.S. lops off 0.13% of economic growth.


In other words, first-quarter GDP could be shaved by 0.6% or more, depending on whether a divided Congress and President Donald Trump can show compromise on immigration and southern border-wall issues.


The [Econoday economic calendar](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)Â shows that weekly retail sales are due Wednesday, as measured by the Redbook indicator. During the week ended Jan. 19, U.S. retail sales rose 6.7% vs. year-ago levels.


What Leading Stocks Are Doing
-----------------------------


Meanwhile, make sure to keep a watch list of fresh names and revise your list regularly. Key stock lists, such as Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and the Big Cap 20, are showing more names and more stocks that are building new bases.


If a highly rated stock falls in light volume and rebounds in higher turnover, that's good. It means institutional appetite is likely growing. You should see the RS and Accumulation/Distribution ratings improve.

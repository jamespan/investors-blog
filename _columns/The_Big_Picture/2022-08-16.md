Stock Market Stays Resilient; Home Depot, Walmart Lead Dow Jones; Costco Fades After Early Pop
===============================================================================================

Buyers dictated the action again in the stock market Tuesday as solid earnings reports from **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) fueled a day of outperformance for retail stocks.




The Nasdaq composite fell 1.1% intraday but pared its loss to 0.2% by the closing bell. Top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), up nearly 3%, and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), up 1.3%. Costco cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) with a 552.81 entry but faded off highs. Results from Ross Stores are due Thursday evening.


Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq by a 3-to-2 margin.


Retail-related industry groups dominated the upside, helped by strong showings for Walmart and Home Depot. WMT stock surged above its 200-day moving average, rising 5%. HD stock jumped 4%, but it's still below the 200-day line.


Both retailers helped to propel the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the 34,000 level. The blue-chip index added 0.7% as it tries to find a new home above its 200-day line.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 rose for the third straight session, up 0.2%, and came close to a rendezvous with its 200-day moving average, a potential resistance level to watch. The S&P 500 hit an intraday high of 4325.28, less than 1 point from its 200-day line  The last time the index made a bid to recapture its 200-day line was on April 21, but it reversed sharply lower.


NYSE advancers had a slight edge over decliners.

---


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) edged lower but marked its third straight close above the 200-day line. Preliminary data showed higher volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq.


In the oil patch, breakout attempts for **EQT** ([EQT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQT)) and **Antero Resources** ([AR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AR)) faded.


EQT pared an 8.4% intraday gain after topping a 46.81 buy point. Shares still rose 4.3% to 47.19. Antero moved past a 41.05 entry early but closed below the buy point. Shares picked up 4.2% to 40.55.


Oil Slumps/NatGas Spikes
------------------------


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude oil futures settled at $86.53 per barrel, down 3.7%. That's the lowest close since late January.


Meanwhile, natural gas futures spiked 6.9% to a 14-year high, helping the cause of **Golar LNG** ([GLNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLNG)), which rose for the eighth straight session. GLNG barely topped a 27.62 buy point Monday and extended gains in today's session, up nearly 4% to 28.43.


Another resilient performance was good news for the bulls but the stock market is starting to look overbought by at least one indicator.


The short term overbought/oversold oscillator (found in [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) by entering NASDQ) is quickly approaching its early-June peak. That's the last time the Nasdaq showed overbought conditions. The index fell sharply for three straight sessions from June 9-13. For the month, the Nasdaq slumped 9.7%.

That said, the stock market still has a light [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count working in its favor. The Aug. 2 distribution day for the S&P 500 fell off the count Monday because the index rallied 5% from that day. The Nasdaq lost its Aug. 9 distribution day for the same reason. The Nasdaq's 0.19% decline Tuesday was too small to qualify for distribution.


Higher-volume gains and lower-volume declines for the indexes would be picture-perfect price action for the bulls.

Stock market bulls also like improving breadth, particularly on the NYSE. The advance/decline for the Nasdaq and NYSE has been trending nicely higher since the first half of July.


Breakout Watch
--------------


A couple of car dealerships scored big breakouts. **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) soared out of a 43-week consolidation, rising 7%. Group peer **Penske Automotive** ([PAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAG)) rallied out of a cup-with-handle base with a 121.55 entry. Shares jumped nearly 6% to 124.16.


Coal stocks outperformed early, but gains faded. **Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) extended its winning streak to nine sessions, but a 6% intraday gain faded to less than 1% by the close.


ARCH stock broke out of a downtrend when it gapped above its 50-day moving average last week. The coal producer is forming the right side of a cup base.

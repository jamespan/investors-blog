  Stock Market Closes Off Lows, As These Signals Send Conflicting Message

Stocks wavered Monday, still woozy from Friday's sell-off, as the market continued to try to metabolize three months of hearty gains.




Indexes switched direction several times during the session but were mainly in the red. They closed high in the day's price ranges, which suggested the selling is abating.


For chart readers, the most interesting chart belonged to the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nyse-dow-jones-indus-actual-0djia.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily). The Dow fell almost to its 50-day moving average, where it started to rebound. That indicated support is emerging, a nice dovetail with the indexes' move off session lows.


The technical picture was mixed, however. The S&P 500 closed just below 2800 — a level that has been pivotal for many months and has greater importance now that the market's direction is unclear.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP-032519-228x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite lost 0.1% after reducing a loss of 0.8%. It still has a cushion above 7500, another key level to watch.


If the market had a clearly positive sign Monday, it came from the small caps. The Russell 2000 climbed 0.5%. The Russell, however, remains below its 50-day moving average and has lagged the major indexes this month.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was indicated lower on the NYSE.


Stock Market Pausing
--------------------


After three months of nearly uninterrupted gains, the stock market seems to be pausing, or at least moderating its advance. The slowing was first noticeable on the Dow, which has been in a sideways range for a month. The Dow, however, is not an ideal gauge of growth stocks.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 abruptly broke from upward trends on Friday. Sure, a market doesn't top on a single day, and in the longer term institutional selling has picked up. The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains uncomfortably high, even after the S&P 500's Valentine's Day distribution (Feb. 14, down 0.3%) lopped off because five weeks have gone by.


With market signals conflicting, IBD's market outlook was downgraded to uptrend under pressure Friday. Investors needs to be very careful with stock purchases, and taking some profits makes sense while the market tries to find direction.


The market, you could say, is just constipated rather than showing any serious disease. Among leading stocks that have broken out the past several weeks, few have flopped. [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 0.4% Monday in a good showing for leading stocks. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) edged up nearly 0.2%.


Economy Slowing?
----------------


News that special prosecutor Robert Mueller [cleared President Donald Trump of collusion with Russia](https://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-dodges-bullet-mueller-report-buries-trump-impeachment/) had no real impact on the stock market, other than to remove a cloud over the presidency. A trade agreement with China seems to be closer. The market is far more focused on a narrowing yield curve and [other signs of economic slowing](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/inverted-yield-curve-dont-panic-copper-prices-key-dow-jones/), especially abroad.


Retail and consumer sectors led Monday. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) rose 1.2%.


What should have been a good day for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was not. The stock was the weakest Dow Jones member, falling 2.3% and sliding back below its 200-day line.


The stock fell despite [a batch of product announcements](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-services-launch-event-streaming-video/) Monday that included a video streaming service, a gaming subscription platform, a credit card and other services. Word of the new offerings had leaked, and Monday's stock decline appeared to be typical selling on the news.


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) led the Dow, rising more than 2%. Shares have fallen 4%, 10% and 4% in the prior three weeks.


The company announced a meeting with pilots on a software fix for the flight management system that is suspected in the crash of two 737 Max 8 airplanes. Meanwhile, a number of airlines [voiced support for Boeing](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines-confident-pilots-meeting/).

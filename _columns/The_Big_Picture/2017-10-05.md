U.S. stock indexes posted new highs Thursday, as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 extended their win streaks to eight sessions.


The Nasdaq advanced 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.3% pop.




Volume eased on both major exchanges.


Thursday's market was typical of recent action. After several days of minor gains and losses, one or more indexes posts a solid gain. Then it's back to small gains before the next minor eruption.


Since IBD's market outlook went back to confirmed uptrend on Aug. 22, the Nasdaq has notched a daily gain of at least 0.7% seven times. But the bears only managed to slap distribution on the indexes twice in the same period.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP100517-185x300.png)Distribution involves a loss in rising volume and is a sign of institutional selling. Institutional buying and selling is what makes or breaks an uptrend.


The current rally itself has undergone some changes recently. Consider these four items:


**No. 1:** In August, the sector with the most new highs was utilities. Ten times utilities scored the most new highs for the day. This is not the sort of leadership bulls like to see.


But in the second half of September, the bank sector became the chief leader. Banks have delivered the most new highs in 10 of the past 12 sessions, including Thursday.


The banks aren't yet market leaders, as far as sector and industry group rankings are concerned. But the banks are well-positioned for a move up.



Banks that aren't far from a potential buy point include **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) and **U.S. Bancorp** ([USB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USB)).


Others are in the 5% buy zone after breakouts: **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)).


Meanwhile, **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) is extended from is Sept. 18 breakout.


**No. 2:** Sectors that were near the top on Aug. 22 and remain near the top include electronics, building and chips.


This continued strength, more than rotation, characterizes the rally at this point.


**No. 3:** The so-called FAANG stocks — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)), the parent company of Google — are reasonably close to their highs, even if they aren't leading the market as a group.


Netflix is the best performer, up 16% since the Aug. 21 close. (Netflix broke out of a new base Thursday.) Alphabet is up 7%. The other FAANGs are trailing the indexes.


**No. 4:** While the Nasdaq is up an impressive 22% so far this year, the right niches have done even better.


The Sector Leaders group is up 42%. The Nasdaq Stock Spotlight is up 37%. IBD's New America is up 29%.


How should an individual investor handle this market?


The cumulative success in this year's market — despite the spurts and pauses — suggests patience is the best approach.


The IBD-style investor should concentrate on buying quality stocks at the right moment (the spurting breakout) and then hold through at least the first squall (the seemingly inevitable pause).


Patience through a few spurts and pauses should leave the individual investor with a cushion. And with a cushion, the individual investor can play his or her cards calmly.

Stock Traders Turn Cagey As Dovish Fed Spurs Late-Hour Sell-Off
================================================================

The banking doves in the U.S. capital won out again, and stock investors lost, albeit mildly so.


In absolute terms, the major indexes actually didn't lose much on Wednesday. But the manner in which they surrendered decent gains during a final-hour sell-off was disappointing.


The Nasdaq composite rallied the entire morning, then picked up a little more steam right after the world's most powerful central bank issued a statement on no change in short-term interest rates. That decision surprised no one. But the tech-rich index, up 0.5% at session highs, still ended the session down less than 0.2%. Now 7% off its 52-week high of 5231, the Nasdaq showed it's losing momentum amid a market uptrend that was confirmed with a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-stages-another-follow-through-but-new-stock-highs-still-look-wafer-thin/) on Feb. 17.


The S&P 500's rally also got clipped, turning a 0.5% midafternoon gain into a fractional loss. Volume was stagnant all day and finished lower on both sides.


![MP_061516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP_061516-167x300.jpg)The Federal Reserve has been dovish -- meaning that it wants to keep interest rates ultralow to promote spending and investment -- ever since the subprime debt crisis hit Wall Street and triggered an indiscriminate sell-off of stocks in 2008 to 2009. Yet stocks perked up this spring on a growing belief that the Fed had enough confidence in the economy to proceed with plans to hike the fed funds rate at least two times in 2016. Bank stocks started to feel a tailwind. The new high list showed numerous smaller lenders gaining steam.


Yet the mood at the Fed and in the capital markets in general appeared to change dramatically after a June 3 report showed an awful drop in net new jobs in the U.S. in May. Treasury bond yields plummeted on the news. On Wednesday, the 10-year note's yield was back to its lowest level since the summer of 2012 after the Fed shaved its full-year economic growth forecast (from 2.2% to 2%) and members of the FOMC interest-rate policy committee lowered their long-term outlook on the fed funds rate (from 3.3% to 3%).


Even Esther George, who at the April 27 meeting was the sole Fed board member wanting to raise the target rate for overnight loans to big banks -- to a target range of 0.5% to 0.75% -- joined the board's decision on Wednesday to stay put on the cost of money.


The dour session still revealed at least two bright spots.


One, winners beat losers on both the NYSE and Nasdaq, although not as much as earlier during the day. On the NYSE, winners led almost 3 to 2. A healthy stock market sees more stocks participating in the upside, not fewer. The positive breadth helped the NYSE composite and the Russell 2000 small-cap gauge eke out a tiny gain.


Two, growth stock leaders didn't fare too badly. The IBD 50 showed few names falling in huge volume. As the Market Pulse table shows, telecom cable expert and Leaderboard member **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) rebounded for a second straight day, rising 1.6% to 85.95, just whiskers below an 86.14 buy point. Other fiber-optic and telecom-related stocks also fared well, including new issue **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) (up 9% to 41.85) and **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)), which was spun off from former stock market leader JDS Uniphase.


Acacia is etching a narrow IPO base with a 43.20 buy point. The specialist in 100-gigabit-per-second optical interconnect technology for cloud computing and data networking grew earnings per share by 125% to 90 cents a share in 2015 on a 63% jump in revenue to $239 million. Few IPO stocks these days can boast such high-level growth.


Lumentum is trying to form a base-on-base pattern. (See the Investors' Corner column published Tuesday for more on this vital chart phenomenon.) It is expected to grow Q2 profit by 133% to 35 cents a share.


Despite the 2% drop in crude oil futures on Wednesday, investors still poured money into commodity plays. Metals, steel and mining shares all rallied, perhaps due in part to U.S. dollar weakness and also due to a stronger-than-expected earnings outlook from major players such as **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) as China's steelmaking juggernaut shows signs of slowing output.


Investors also likely cheered the rebound by the New York Federal Reserve Bank's Empire State manufacturing survey in June as well as a 0.2% rise in mining output in May, which also reflects busier activity at oil and gas wells.


The day's action drew a parallel with the market's six-month leadership in terms of industry groups. Scour the top 40 within IBD's [daily ranking](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-june-14-2016/) of 197 industry groups and you'll see fistfuls of oil, metals and other commodity groups. The building sector has grabbed some top-tier rungs, and so have a few retail industry groups -- namely discount and variety, and specialty. The tech and medical sectors are, for now, mostly absent at the top.

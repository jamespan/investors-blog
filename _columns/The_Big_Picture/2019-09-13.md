  Blue Chips, Small Caps Keep Edge In Stock Market

Blue chip stocks and small caps held sway in the stock market Friday, though by day's end that wasn't worth a great deal.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.1%, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.2%. The large-cap S&P 500 slipped 0.1%. Small caps as gauged in the Russell 2000 added 0.2%.


The Russell 2000 jumped nearly 5% for the week. It was its best week since December 2016, and it easily outperformed the main indexes.


Volume fell across the board, perhaps in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's two-day huddle in the coming week. The Street expects the Fed to cut rates a quarter point, though it isn't clear the move will accomplish much beyond setting a mood.

The top five for the day included metal products distributors, meat producers, funeral services, construction and mining equipment, and oil and natural gas pipelines. Meat products is the only highly rated group.


On the day's downside, dairy, tobacco and gold miners fell.


Value And Cyclical Talk
-----------------------


Much of the recent talk in the stock market has been about the fading of growth stocks and the rise of value stocks and cyclicals.


What exactly is meant by value and cyclical?


Cyclicals include basic industries such as steel, machinery, chemicals, aluminum and plastics.


As IBD founder William O'Neil noted in "How to Make Money in Stocks," rallies in cyclical stocks "tend to be more short-lived and prone to falter at the first hint of a recession."


Investors shouldn't expect a cyclical stock to have the longevity of a top growth stock. The average life span of a leading growth stock's advance is 18 to 24 months. Cyclical stocks rarely rally for more than a season or two. When they do, they often morph into a growth stock. For example, specialty steel stocks had a sharp run-up in 2003-07.


Value stocks can be more difficult to define, but one way is to keep an eye on the [Growth Funds Vs. Value Funds](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IBD1209152905MUTUALS.pdf) chart. A rising line means growth is outperforming value, and that's been the case most of this year. Very recently, value began to outperform growth, but it isn't clear that will continue.


Stock Market: What's Next?
--------------------------


In the coming week, in addition to the Federal Reserve meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, other key reports are expected. On Monday, the empire state manufacturing gauge will be released. Industrial production and the Redbook retail results are expected Tuesday. Wednesday, the Philadelphia Fed survey is expected.

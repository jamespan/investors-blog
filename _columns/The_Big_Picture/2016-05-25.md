Oil Stocks Lead Rally; Does The Market Now Embrace Inflation?

The market seemed to give a treat to nearly every type of investor Wednesday, except perhaps for the utility stockholder.


Key indexes rallied in unison, fortifying a surprising advance that began with a wild reversal on May 19. The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and S&P SmallCap 600 all logged gains of 0.6% to 0.7%. Volume was mixed, falling on the Nasdaq yet rising mildly among Big Board stocks.


The Dow utility average slumped 0.4%. It's down 3% in the second quarter so far.


![MP052516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP052516-192x300.jpg)Beaten down oil stocks led the charge, following news of a far bigger than expected drawdown in weekly U.S. crude oil supplies. Crude futures rose more than 2% to $49.67 a barrel. **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Diamond Offshore Drilling** ([DO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DO)) and others are no longer 40% to 50% below their 52-week highs or worse. In fact, these potential turnarounds, despite their mostly horrid IBD ratings, are now close to breaking out of bottoming patterns.


Remember, every sector has its day in the sun. Energy companies in the S&P 500 are expected to post their first-ever quarterly net loss since S&P Global Market Intelligence began collecting data.


Yet even for stocks, it's often darkest before dawn.


Why is this recent upturn so surprising? One key word: inflation.


For a while, the market and numerous talking heads seemed convinced that 2016 was likely to see no change in interest rates, at least for a long while. U.S. GDP growth has stalled, after all. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen made it clear that, due to terrible economic conditions around the globe, the most powerful bank in the world was going to move slowly on removing its "accommodative policy."


But then, the market got blindsided by new domestic data showing that inflation isn't dead. Consumer prices and wages are accelerating. Home prices, especially on the coasts, keep going up.


The sudden realization initially shook up stock investors. Even this column intoned last week that a late 1970s era of [stagflation](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-fall-more-does-the-market-see-a-return-to-carter-style-stagflation/) could threaten the U.S. economy. However, soothing comments from numerous key Fed officials have focused on this message: We can raise rates a little more, and the economy won't crack.


The market, driven by the real-money decisions by millions of investors, seems to agree. The technicals continue to improve. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by more than a 2-to-1 ratio; the Nasdaq's advance-decline line continues to spike up after sliding for three weeks.Â New highs on the Nasdaq continue to exceed the NYSE in recent days (42 and 80 on the Nasdaq on Monday and Tuesday, vs. 25 and 68 on the NYSE; go to the [IBD Data Tables page](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), listed under the Stock Lists tab at Investors.com, for Wednesday's full list.)


The S&P 500 is back in the black, up 2.2% so far in 2016, but commodities in general are doing better. The Reuters CRB index is up 5.3% year-to-date.


Numerous leaders are showing tight consolidations or are crafting new bases, including robotic surgery king **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) (its [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-intuitive-surgical-inc-isrg.aspx) shows a 98 Composite Rating); veteran homebuilder **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) (96 Comp); Chinese social media force **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) (90 Comp); fast-growing casual dining chain and IBD Leaderboard member **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) (93 Comp); and top-performing airline **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)) (94 Comp).


In other words, it isn't just the [banking stocks](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/banking-energy-stocks-keep-major-indexes-rolling-higher-suntrust-breaks-out/) (benefiting from a potential rise in rates) and the oil patch that are keeping the uptrend intact, even amid a still-heavy distribution count. (Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 lost one of those Wednesday because they are too far back in time now.)


Stockpickers, rejoice.

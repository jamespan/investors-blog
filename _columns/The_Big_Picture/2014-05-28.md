Leaders Flourish Despite Indexes' Mild Retreat
===============================================

Stocks caught their breath Wednesday, a day after the Nasdaq posted a follow-through to end a relatively mild correction.

  

Some leading stocks refused to pause and instead ran higher.

  

The Nasdaq composite dropped less than 0.3%. Volume fell slightly. That's ideal market action after Tuesday's 1.2% advance in heavier trade. The follow-through gave the clearest signal yet that institutional investors have renewed their appetite for equities.

  

Wednesday's decline appears like a small nick in the rally that had taken the Nasdaq 4.1% higher in the prior seven sessions.

  

The Nasdaq is now up 7% from its near-term low of 3946.

  

Market internals continue to improve as well. This is important, for it tells growth-minded investors that the odds of success in going long with stocks continue to improve.

  

While Nasdaq decliners topped gainers by a roughly 8-to-5 margin, the index's advance-decline line has sloped sharply higher since the middle of last week. Plus, new highs exceeded new lows.

  

Today's Market Pulse highlights several issues, both on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, that are breaking out or setting up new base patterns. Use the Pulse as well as IBD markets columns to form a watch list.

  

The S&P 500 eased 0.1% after posting a fresh all-time high. The quiet drop halted a four-day win streak. But winners on the NYSE actually edged losers, and some sector indexes rallied. The Dow transports rose 0.7%.

  

The IBD 50 edged 0.2% lower.

  

While bullishness remains ultra-high among market pundits polled by Investors Intelligence, not all psychological indicators are showing giddy optimism.

  

The put-call volume ratio rose Wednesday despite the latest confirmation of a new uptrend in play. (See the chart at the bottom of this page.) When this line rises, options traders are generally trading more bearish puts or buying and selling fewer calls.

  

Market skepticism is understandable. The Nasdaq's 32-month rally from a bear-market low in October 2011 is long in the tooth. Fund managers react nervously to news from the Federal Reserve over the future course of interest rates. The U.S. economy is mediocre at best.

  

Yet it is unwise to fight the market and trade on one's personal beliefs. See today's [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/702418-emotions-and-successful-investing.htm) on the delicate issues of handling and confronting emotions.

  

New breakouts are acting well. Take **Arris Group** ([ARRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRS)), which moved back into [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) on May 16 after spending a month on the Cut List. The Internet TV infrastructure play showed renewed strength several weeks ago, with a high-volume rebound back above the 10-week moving average and bullish first-quarter results.

  Stock Indexes Avoid Bearish Signal But Fail To Add Gains

While stock indexes avoided a bearish signal Thursday, bulls had to wonder what the market truly wants.




Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's reassuring words fired up the stock market Wednesday.


The market Thursday, though, had trouble following up in an emphatic way.


The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average battled to small losses for the day.


By the close, the Nasdaq was off 0.3%, the S&P 500 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.1%.

Uptrend Lacks Firm Footing
--------------------------


For the bullish investor, the price and volume action was pleasing because it avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), thanks to lower volume. Distribution, which points to institutional selling, involves a price loss in rising volume. It was also positive that indexes gave back little of Wednesday's big gains.


But realistic investors know the uptrend is not yet on firm footing. Investors don't need much of a reminder: On the second day after the Nov. 7 follow-through day, the S&P 500 suffered distribution. That placed the uptrend under pressure and by Nov. 20, the rally was confirmed dead.


IBD's research shows that a distribution day early in a new uptrend is often lethal.


So, Thursday's action, while welcome, settles nothing.


Trump Could Provide Lift
------------------------


News could fire up the uptrend in a more sustained way as early as this weekend. President Trump will meet with China's leader Xi Jinping on trade and tariff issues.


If Trump and Jinping can come to an agreement, bulls expect that would be a catalyst for stock gains. Given the uncertainty surrounding tariff issues, the market probably hasn't priced in an agreement.


Consumer Spending Up
--------------------


Another factor working in the market's favor is consumer spending.


The reading for October came in at 0.6%, the fastest growth in seven months. The figure was above views for 0.4% and far above the prior revised reading of 0.2%.


Breakouts Scarce In Stock Indexes
---------------------------------


Stocks are in some ways in the same place they were Nov. 7. Breakouts were few then, and they were few Thursday.


Stocks breaking out Thursday included **Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)), which cleared a handle in soft volume; drugmaker **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), which rose above a flat base in below-average volume; restaurant chain **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)), which cleared an entry and then pulled back under it in weak volume; medical supplies provider **Henry Schein** ([HSIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSIC)), which also broke out and then reversed in slow trade; and **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)), which cleared a consolidation in heavy volume and stayed above the buy point.



The Federal Reserve released the minutes from its Nov. 7-8 meetings. The minutes showed members essentially backing Fed chief Jerome Powell's take on the need for another rate hike and a view that rates are approaching neutral.

Five Big Cap Reasons Why The Nasdaq Is Outperforming
=====================================================

 Indexes closed mixed Tuesday, but not before the Nasdaq composite reached another record high and reinforced its leadership.


The Nasdaq rose 0.3%, despite losing nearly half its early gains. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% and continued to meet resistance at the 2400 level, though it made a new intraday high. The Dow Jones industrial average is tracing a similar chart. The average was down 0.1% on the day as it challenged the 21,000 level.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. But in the end, there was no sign of heavy institutional selling, or what is known as distribution. That left the market with an acceptable five distribution days on the Nasdaq and three on the S&P 500. Investors can take that as a signal to remain with a high exposure to stocks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MP050917-194x300.png)Year to date, the Nasdaq is about doubling the S&P 500's performance, helped in part by a surge in biotech, chip, internet and other technology sectors.


Yet the Nasdaq's advance-decline line is lagging a bit. Why should that happen, when the composite has been the leading major index?


Maybe it's because the Nasdaq heavyweights have been doing the heavy lifting. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) are near new highs.


Those five stocks alone combine for about one-fourth of the Nasdaq's total weighting, and their prowess has been a key factor, especially in the past three weeks or so. Other big components are acting well. For example, the broadband cable provider **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) is in buy range after a breakout past a 38.54 entry last month.


The Nasdaq's big five also have are major pieces of the S&P 500, but not to the degree that they are responsible for the Nasdaq.


That may also explain why the Nasdaq has led even while small caps have lagged. The Russell 2000, basically flat on Tuesday, is 2% from its prior high and trying to stay above the 50-day moving average.


The IBD Mutual Fund Index also is at new highs, which is another sign that institutional favorite stocks are pacing the market.


That's not to say breadth is lacking. The NYSE advance-decline line is at new high, and breakouts have been occurring in many sectors. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is near recent highs.


Strength is building in travel stocks, such as hotels and some airlines. The lodging group is in the top 20 of 197 groups. **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) broke out past a 76.90 buy point Tuesday on a [strong passenger traffic report](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/american-shares-jump-on-unit-revenue-outlook/).


**Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)) surged to a new high in big volume after the hotel beat profit expectations late Monday. **Hyatt Hotels** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) erased much of its early gain but held just above the 58.15 buy point of a flat base. **Hilton** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)) was in buy range from a 60.59 buy point.


Chinese stock continue to make strides and on Tuesday, **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) broke out of a seven-month pattern. Shares cleared the 18.71 buy point in heavy volume and closed out of buy range. The company provides e-commerce services for brand partners, and its strength may be related to strong stock performance from partner **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)).
Homebuilders remain one of the top-ranked industry groups, and certainly an area for investors to explore.


**MDC Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)) roared to a new high after the homebuilder beat earnings expectations. Profit of 43 cents a share topped the consensus estimate of 36 cents and marked a 126% leap over the year-ago quarter.

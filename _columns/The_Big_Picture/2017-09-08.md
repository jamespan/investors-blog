  Bulls, Bears In Standoff: Who Wants To Own This Market?

U.S. stock indexes haven't gained much since two solid up days in late August, but the bears also haven't found much traction.


That scenario played out again Friday.




The Nasdaq dropped 0.6%, as semiconductor, telecom and internet industry groups lagged. The S&P 500 edged down 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.1%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. The Aug. 3 distribution day fell off the indexes because of time.


Friday's session was thin on data, but national and world news generated plenty of noise.


The noise included **Equifax's** ([EFX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EFX)) huge data breach disclosed late Thursday, a powerful earthquake in Mexico Thursday night and a hurricane on track to hit Florida on Sunday. Equifax shares plummeted nearly 14% in the highest volume in at least the current decade.

One group that heated up at the open on the Equifax news was security software. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) rose 2.9% in the first 15 minutes of trade and then reversed to close with a 0.2% gain.


Friday's stock action had the quality of second thoughts. Going into Friday's session, the insurance property stock group was down about 4% for the week. But the disaster-sensitive group rebounded 1.7% Friday, according to preliminary data.


**Chubb Limited** ([CB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB)) soared 5% in heavy volume Friday, erasing all of the losses suffered over the past eight sessions.


Second thoughts also pertained to stocks that had been rising. The oilfield services group rose about 6% through Thursday but gave back 2% Friday.


Banks were another beaten up group that rebounded Friday. The superregionals, for example, popped 1.5% after losing more than 5% earlier in the week.


Going into Friday's session, the superregional bank group was No. 180 of 197 groups. In early March, the group was No. 1.


What happened?


Apparently the expectations surrounding the Trump election victory lost air. Dodd-Frank regulations, a drag on banks, are still intact.


Also, interest rates haven't played out as expected. The Federal Reserve raised rates at its June meeting, but the Street doesn't expect an increase when the Fed meets Sept. 19-20.


The week ahead could inspire caution as a placeholder week before the Fed's two-day meeting.


The Street is nearly unanimous in the belief that the Fed will stand pat on rates. A hike would be stunning.

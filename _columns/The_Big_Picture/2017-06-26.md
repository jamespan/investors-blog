The stock market closed mixed Monday after shifting course a couple of times during the day, a microcosm of how the indexes are still feeling their way around.




The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3% as fiber optics, internet, semiconductor, software and other Nasdaq-domiciled industry groups were in the bottom of the day's performance table.


The S&P 500 was almost flat and the Dow Jones industrial average added less than 0.1%, but both salvaged gains. Indexes opened higher but quickly reversed lower. They hit lows about 90 minutes into the session, then started recovering slowly. The S&P 500 stalled, although its action was not the type that would be equated with a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764).

It would have been a shock if volume had climbed — because a surge of trading swamped the market late Friday due to Russell index rebalancings. NYSE breadth was good, with winners over losers by 9-to-5, while the win-lose ratio was 5-to-4 on the weaker Nasdaq.


Despite the technology-sector woes Monday, the market's leadership is still tech-friendly.


Gaming software, medical software, biotech, business software, networking, fiber optics, internet and semiconductor industry groups are in the top 20 of IBD's 197 groups.


Other than soft drinks (which jumped [to No. 17 from 43 in six weeks](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-jun-23-2017/)), there's not much defensive posturing. The Dow utilities led Monday with a 0.7% increase, which could be interpreted as a move to shelter.


Sector leadership also favors the Nasdaq: Electronics, chips, leisure, computers, internet and software are the top six.


The number of distribution days is acceptable, with four on Nasdaq and two on the S&P 500. Both indexes are near highs, and the Nasdaq has held on to most of the previous Monday's 1.4% vault.


Despite those positives, the S&P 500 is basically at the same place it was three weeks ago. Moreover, since it made a new high June 19, the index is lower. The Nasdaq is lower than it was three weeks ago, and the composite has not made up the losses of the June 9 sell-off. Technology stocks got hit the most in that rout.


IBD's market outlook is still at confirmed uptrend, and giving a signal to be invested in stocks. But the sideways trend of the major indexes shows a market that remains indecisive. Investors, thus, should treat the market with more skepticism than they normally would in a confirmed uptrend.


The Dow has done better than that; it is now just off last week's high. But market veterans know that when the Dow leads the market, it's a reason to be cautious.


The VIX is below 10 again, a level that indicates complacency among investors. It had been in that area for many days before the June 9 convulsion, but it's hard to read its signals. Although it left skid marks, the June 9 plunge did not break the market.


The Russell 2000 added 0.1% Monday. Intraday, the index was up 0.5%. Many smaller banks rose and aided the small-cap index. The Dow transports climbed 0.6%. The transportation equipment group rose 1.8% but the rest of the sector was more subdued.



Retail stocks were up broadly. Nine of the 13 best-performing groups were retailers, including auto dealers, drugstores, specialty shops and discount chains. **Rite Aid** ([RAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAD)) surged 30% on word that its merger with **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) is nearing approval.


There was only one significant breakout Monday, and so far it wasn't impressive. **Exelixis** ([EXEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXEL)) edged past the 24.95 buy point of a seven-week cup-without-handle base, and closed a few cents below the entry. Volume in the biotech was 46% above average, a good sign.


**Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) sold off 6% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the takeout-ordering service to equal weight from overweight and cut its price target to 43 from 47, citing increasing competition.

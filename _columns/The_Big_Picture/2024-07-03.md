The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 closed a shortened session with record highs Wednesday, as the stock market went into the Independence Day break stretching its uptrend.




The Nasdaq added 0.9%, extending its year-to-date gain to more than 21%. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% to mark its 33rd record close so far this year.


But the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell less than 0.1%. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) cost the blue-chip index the most points. Small caps also lagged the stock market. The Russell 2000 reduced a 0.8% morning gain to 0.1% by the close.


The stock market closed early ahead of the July 4 holiday break. Volume was trending higher at the market's 1 p.m. ET close. Trading will resume Friday with a full session.


Breadth, which has been lacking in the stock market, improved Wednesday. Advancers topped decliners by an 11-to-5 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange and by 7-to-5 on [the Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/daily-market-statistics). If breadth can continue to expand, it would indicate more sectors are participating in the market's advance, potentially growing the pool of buying opportunities.


Techs Lead Stock Market
-----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP070324.jpg)Tech stocks easily outperformed Wednesday. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) exchange traded fund rose nearly 1.4% and made a new closing high. Semiconductors provided much of the sector's strength, with chip designers and chip-equipment makers among the top-performing industry groups.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), the flag-bearer of the artificial intelligence investment theme, rose more than 4% as it found support in a pullback to the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) were other chip stocks that lent their support.


Mining, steel and other metals stocks also outperformed Wednesday as precious metals rallied. That's one sector to watch for emerging leadership.


Gold for July delivery rose 1.6% to $2,359.80 an ounce to a nearly one-month high. A combination of [lackluster economic data plus a weaker U.S. dollar and Treasury yields](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-prices-look-to-settle-at-1-month-high-as-silver-jumps-nearly-4-adf172dd?mod=us-market-data) sent gold to its best day since April 5.


Silver for July delivery jumped 4.1% to $30.548, while copper gained 2.5% to $4.5410 â€” its largest gain since May 17.


The SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF ([XME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XME)) rose 1.8% and closed back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since June 6.


Growth And Techs Lead Market
----------------------------


To be sure, the market continues to favor technology and growth stocks. Indeed, success in this stock market has depended largely on which pond you fish.


Since indexes bottomed on May 31, the tech-tilted Nasdaq is up 8.7%, the Technology Select ETF gained 10.5% and the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) climbed 9.3%. Finally, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) has surged nearly 16%.


Compare that with indexes that leave out techs, growth or artificial intelligence plays:


IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) is down 1.8% from the start of June. ProShares S&P 500 Ex-Technology ([SPXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPXT)) is up 1.2% and ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ([NOBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOBL)) is down 2.7%.


Some industry groups that were having a good year on bullish themes have been trending lower since June: aerospace and defense, footwear, heavy construction, electrical equipment, and alternative energy.


History Favors Stock Market
---------------------------


The S&P 500 rose 14.5% in the first six months of the year, nearly identical to the index's gains for the same period last year. In 2023, it rose 15.9% in the first half. Historically, that is a good sign for the rest of the year.


Almost every year that the S&P 500 climbs more than 14% in the first half, the index closes the year with gains, according to Dow Jones Market Data. But most of those gains come in the first half. On average, the S&P climbs 24.5% for the full year, but only 2.8% in the second half.


It's different in election years like the current one. The S&P historically has climbed 0.9% in the first six months and 7.2% in the second half.

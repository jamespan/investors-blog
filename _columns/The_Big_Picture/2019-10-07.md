title: Stocks Give Back Gains, But Indexes Still Test This Key Resistance Level

After two days of solid gains, the stock market paused Monday, as if to gather itself before making the next move.




The Nasdaq composite gave back 0.3%, the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](http://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis) fell 0.4% and the S&P 500 lost nearly 0.5%. Indexes closed near session lows after seesaw trading. Trade-related headlines contributed to the day's uncertain tone.


Not to trivialize Monday's losses, but the main indexes traded in narrower intraday ranges than in past two days. Contrasted with last week's action, this seemed like a normal pullback.


There are some signs to support the notion that the market's next move is up.

For starters, the S&P 500 is fighting to hold above its 50-day moving average.


Volume fell on both exchanges. So Monday's session indicated the selling was routine rather than mass liquidation among institutional investors. Nasdaq volume, though, was barely lower from Friday's totals.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mp100719-262x300.jpg)Leading stocks performed in line with the market, if not better. The IBD 50 lost 0.3%. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell just 0.1%.


On the flip side, the Nasdaq closed mildly below the 50-day line and still faces resistance at that important level. To be sure, the battle for the 50-day lines is not settled. Meantime, those 50-day lines continue to bend lower.


A clump of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) in September and last week remain a cloud on the market.


Which way will the market go? It's impossible to tell, but at least the main indexes are not sinking too deep or rallying too far. For now, continue to treat stocks with caution. Buying stocks with a the market uptrend under pressure is riskier.

This Stock Market Won't Die
---------------------------


Like the cyborg in "Terminator," this stock market doesn't want to die; it keeps surviving blasts and crushing blows. Those can be metaphors for the U.S.-China trade war, interest-rate uncertainty, a threat of impeachment and other risks.


With each index downturn this year, the 200-day moving average has arrested losses in the Nasdaq and S&P 500. It happened again last week.


The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) helped in setting a low last week, after it spiked to unusually high levels of investor fear. Remember, this signal is pretty reliable for bottoms but is no guarantee of sustained advances.



The market's rebounds have shown their limits. In the latest pullback, the two main indexes failed to top their late-July highs. Few breakouts among top-rated stocks have made much headway.


There's been little upside volume in the market in general. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating for the major indexes held at D- or E as of Friday's close, reflecting reluctant buying. Few IBD 50 stocks saw above-average volume Monday. [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=downs) again was light Monday.


Small caps lagged early but ended relatively better. The Russell 2000 fell 0.2%. The S&P 600, another small-cap index, also fell 0.2% and met resistance at its converged 50-day and 200-day moving averages.


Among specific stocks, there was little to admire. **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), the luxury furnishings chain, topped the 175.39 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). The stock was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).

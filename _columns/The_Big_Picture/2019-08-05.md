title: Stock Market, Top Growth Stocks Sell Off Amid Intensifying Trade War

The nearly two-month stock market rally since a [June 7 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-posts-big-gains-ushers-in-positive-signal/) by the Nasdaq ended abruptly Monday in the wake of the intensifying U.S-China trade war.




The Dow Jones industrials plunged as many as 962 points intraday after [China devalued the yuan](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-got-dangerous-dow-jones-dives-as-yuan-breaks-key-level/) vs. the dollar and suspended purchases of U.S. agricultural goods. The move comes in response to President Trump's Aug. 1 decision to impose 10% tariffs on an extra $300 billion in Chinese goods. All three indexes — the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials — broke down through their key 50-day moving average support levels.


These stock indexes and others also ended with heavy losses. This signature action of a weak general market — combined with heavy sell-offs in leading growth stocks — shifted the stock market from an "uptrend under pressure" into a "market in correction." At this juncture, raising cash and avoiding new buys are the best portfolio moves for now.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the trading day with a 3.5% loss, its biggest decline since May 13 when it fell 3.4%. The S&P 500 dropped 3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 767 points, or 2.9% — weighed down by Dow Jones stocks **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)). Apple stock triggered a [loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).

Volume on the Nasdaq jumped compared with Friday's trading. Preliminary data showed higher NYSE volume as well.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) lagged the tech-heavy Nasdaq with a 3.6% loss amid heavily negative action. Only one IBD 50 member finished in positive territory — **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)).


Current Stock Market Correction
-------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP080519-273x300.jpg)


Bearishly, the Nasdaq has had repeated days of weakness — down six days in a row — along with heavy losses, while cutting through the 50-day support level. IBD calls it a "vertical violation." This type of action, which occurred in October 2018 and again in May, suggests an intermediate correction has begun.


At this point, the stock market is likely to see one or two failed tries at a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) during future rebounds.


The Q4 2018 follow-through days failed amid earnings warnings by companies. Eventually, the [Jan. 4 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/) this year succeeded. Next, the June 7 follow-through day also hit pay dirt because the May correction was caused by political reasons. Keep in mind that this current stock market is news-driven, so positive announcements could turn it around quickly. However, that hope is no reason alone to sit on your hands in the face of a deteriorating environment.


A 'market in correction' indicates that investors should be raising cash amid an increasingly uncertain environment. Hold off on new purchases and, as usual, obey any defensive sell signals, like a [sharp break of the 50-day line after a huge move](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule.


But don't tune out. It's easy to be frustrated during a tough market full of quick losses and rapidly evaporating gains. Instead, start updating your [watchlist of top growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). The next cycle of stock market winners may not be the same as previous cycles. Use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) to find stocks that are holding up better than the major stock indexes.


Apple Triggers Sell Rule
------------------------



Apple stock fell more than 5% Monday, as the stock's recent breakout move failed. Last week, the stock advanced above a 215.41 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a giant [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) after the company's strong earnings results. But the stock closed below the entry.


On Monday, the stock fell more than 7% below the entry. Investors should sell stocks when they fall more than [7%-8% below the proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) to avoid even heavier losses.


These IBD 50 Stocks Falter
--------------------------



**Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) closed below its 50-day line for the first time since a Feb. 6 breakout above a 164.18 [pivot point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a cup base. Shares fell more than 6% and remain above the [20%-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/), so it would be prudent to take at least some profits. A [break below the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) after an extended move is a key defensive sell signal.


Brazilian payment processor **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) fell more than 5% to close at 43.27. Shares are about 11% off their 52-week high in just six trading sessions. On July 10, the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) story highlighted that it [would be wise](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/pagseguro-digital-stock-time-to-sell/) to begin taking profits in the stock leader.


Top Stocks With Unusual Strength: Pinterest
-------------------------------------------



With the stock market in a correction, investors should be looking for stocks that are holding up well relative to the pervasive weakness. Enter **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), which has landed a spot on the [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) RS Line Blue Dot screen. The RS Line Blue Dot screen combines the RS line and the MarketSmith Pattern Recognition feature into a list of stocks boasting unusual strength.


Pinterest reversed from heavy losses to close with a nearly 0.5% gain. The IPO stock is trading just below a cup base's 35.39 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after Friday's 18.6% [earnings-driven surge.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinterest-stock-jumps-second-quarter-beat-offers-pretty-picture/) Bullishly, the stock's RS line is at new highs.


Keep in mind that investors should be holding off on new purchases, even promising new IPOs, given the volatile environment.

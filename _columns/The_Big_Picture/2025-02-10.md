  Stock Market Bounces Despite Tariff Talk; What Breakouts Tell Us About The Market

Technology and energy stocks led gains for the major indexes Monday, although the stock market remained in an uncertain phase as it continues to grasp for direction.


A new round of tariffs spooked the market Friday, but on Monday investors shrugged off those fears. President Donald Trump said over the weekend that steel and aluminum imports would [face a 25% tariff](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-tariff-plans-trade-war-b66f4d6b?mod=hp_lead_pos2). He also promised reciprocal tariffs, and the market advanced.




Trump's proposed tariffs helped steel stocks rally Monday. Investor's Business Daily's steel producers industry group was second best with a 5.3% jump. Steel-pipe maker **Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)) climbed past a 39.65 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/). Most of the rest of the stock market took the news in stride.


The Nasdaq composite climbed back above its 50-day moving average after closing below it in Friday's bearish reversal. The composite led the stock market Monday with a 1% increase as Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) climbed 1.5%, a good day for an index that is lagging so far this year.


The energy sector led with a 2.2% increase, as Nymex crude for March delivery rose 1.9% to $72.32 a barrel.


The S&P 500, which has held above its 50-day line since Jan. 21, rose 0.7%.


Small caps faded. The Russell 2000 closed 0.4% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 0.4%. Growth leaders outperformed, as the IBD 50 index rose 1.4%. Its tracking exchange traded fund, the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), rose 1.8% and is close to breaking out past a 32.24 buy point.


Volume jumped on the Nasdaq and fell on the New York Stock Exchange from Friday's totals. Advancers topped decliners by 3-to-2 on the NYSE and by 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.


Stock Market Rangebound
-----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP021025.jpg)A mostly steady ascent from September until mid-December has been replaced with a choppy market with multiple days in which indexes reverse in direction or break important chart levels, only to climb back above them.


The Nasdaq still has a half-dozen [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) over the past several weeks. But indexes have cleansed themselves of many older distribution days that are no longer relevant.


On Monday, the S&P 500 Jan. 2 distribution day came off the count after 25 sessions passed from that date.


The stock market's uncertain action is why IBD continues to recommend [exposure of 60%-80%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/). A level closer to 60% is smart until market direction becomes more clear.


The stock market today is more rangebound than weak. Eventually, indexes will break out of this funk and investors will have a better sense of direction.


It's been a month since the stock market bottomed on Jan. 13, and even while progress has stalled, there's a positive undercurrent in the market: Dozens of quality stocks have [broken out of bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Going back to the last week of January, more than 80 stocks in the [MarketSurge 250 Index](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) have topped buy points from bases. Of those, 52 are above their buy points. On average, they are nearly 3% above the buy points, including the ones now below entries.


New Market Leaders
------------------


A 3% gain doesn't sound like much. Yet, there have been winners in health care (**Doximity** ([DOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS)), **Hims & Hers Health** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS))), commercial services (**Genpact** ([G](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=G))) and software (**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Magnite** ([MGNI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGNI))).


Curiously short on the list: tech stocks. Only 16 of the 81 recent breakouts are from the tech sector, and they are all software or tech services companies — no semiconductors and only one internet stock.


Instead, financials — more than 20 stocks — make up the bulk of these new leaders. Travel and media stocks also make up a bloc of new leaders. Granted, some are below buy points. But so far, not a single breakout stock has triggered a sell signal.

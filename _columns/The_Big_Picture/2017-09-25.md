Tech Stocks Crushed As Nasdaq Reaches A Key Test
=================================================

A rout in technology stocks cost the Nasdaq composite 0.9% Monday, while serious drops in many leading stocks gave investors alarm.




Sellers piled on solar energy, fiber optic, software, internet, semiconductor and other technology stocks.


The Nasdaq, where the majority of technology stocks are housed, fell to its 50-day moving average, setting up an important test for the composite. If the index can bounce from that line, the market has a chance to resume its advance. If not, investors might need to turn more cautious.


The rest of the market did not fare so badly. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2% after paring losses. The Russell 2000 rose 0.1% to extend a run of outperformance against the big indexes. The small-cap benchmark made a new high, in fact.


Breadth also showed how selling was concentrated on the Nasdaq. Losing stocks led winners by about 15-to-14 on the Nasdaq. But winners dominated by a 9-to-7 margin on the NYSE as utilities and the energy sector came out as the day's winners. Sentiment that OPEC will extend production cuts sent Brent oil to the highest level in two years, and U.S. WTI crude up 3.1% to $52.22 a barrel, the highest since April.

Other types of safe-haven assets also climbed after North Korea's foreign minister said President Trump had declared war on Pyongyang and that it reserves the right to shoot down U.S. warplanes even if they don't fly into its airspace. It was the latest in an escalation over North Korea's nuclear ambitions that has kept Wall Street on edge.


Gold added 1.3% to $1,313.70 an ounce. The 10-year Treasury note yield fell 4 basis points to 2.20%.


Indexes had been crawling since the Sept. 11 rally, a flattening pattern that raised suspicions about their ability to sustain advances. As this column pointed out last Tuesday, the market looked as if it was entering the topping phase of a familiar pattern of modest gains and declines.


How the Nasdaq behaves at its 50-day line will help decide its direction. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have the advantage of just a few [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). Monday was only the second one this month, due to the combination of index losses and higher volume.


The put-call volume ratio and VIX market volatility gauge are not at levels that would indicate a bottom is at hand. With no clear market signals, it's best to observe how the leading stocks act. On that front, investors need to be guarded.


Market prom queens such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) showed some stress Monday. Facebook and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) closed below the 50-day line.



In the IBD 50, **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Cognex** ([CGNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGNX)) and **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)) fell below their most recent buy points. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) also fell below its most recent entry and volume was high.


Bad news fed the selling in many internet stocks. For example, Chinese authorities fined some social media companies for content violations. Facebook decided to abort the creation of a new class of shares with no voting rights, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced his intention to sell 35 million to 75 million shares over the next 18 months.


Most top stocks have avoided sell signals, but more breaks below their 50-day lines would elevate risk.

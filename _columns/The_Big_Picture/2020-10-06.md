The bean counters of U.S. government won Tuesday.




During the first five hours of Wall Street's trading session, key indexes and powerful stock market leaders performed with grace. After scoring healthy gains on Monday, stocks looked to pad the advance that got confirmed by a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gives-bullish-signal/) on Wednesday.


Then came the tweet.


![MP100620](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP100620-178x300.jpg)President Donald Trump, hardly a day after returning to the White House after being hospitalized for coronavirus, told the public that he would refuse to pass a new economic rescue package drafted by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. The Nancy Pelosi-led House sought $2.4 trillion in new spending across a number of fronts. Trump refused to budge above his limit of $1.6 trillion.


The U.S. economy got help from the CARES Act passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump on March 27. Yet a 31.4% annualized plunge in gross domestic product in the second quarter of this year simply underscores how much the market, as well as the Federal Reserve, had been looking forward to additional aid on the fiscal side.


A Late-Afternoon Slaughter
--------------------------


The S&P 500, up 0.6% at around 2:45 p.m. ET, tanked 1.6% from its session high of 3431 in a 15-minute bloodbath of selling. The large-cap index ended down 1.4%, ending mildly below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the second time in three sessions.


Other equity indexes mirrored the negative reversal. The Nasdaq composite wasted a 0.5% midday gain to lose 1.6%, but it held above its 50-day line. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial firms on the Nasdaq, slid 1.8%. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF outperformed. But its 0.3% loss and surrender of a 2.5% surge surely left a sour taste in investors' mouths.


A New Distribution Day
----------------------


Volume climbed on both exchanges. Hence, the Market Pulse shows a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. A flurry of true institutional sell-offs can smother a new rally. But for now, the distribution count is still low.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, off 1.3%, continues to weave above and below the 28,000 level. At 27,770, the blue chip index stands a few points below the close of its Sept. 30 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) but above that day's low.


Is The Stock Market Rally Dead?
-------------------------------


Of course, certain sectors got hit harder than others. Airlines, facing an existential crisis as the global economy is still trying to battle Covid-19, fell 2% to 3% or more. **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), which had recently declared it would not furlough workers and instead focus on pay cuts, is locked in between a narrowing space between its 50- and 200-day moving averages.


Insurance, gold mining, oil and gas, and retail stocks also had a terrible day. (See the daily price performance of all 197 industry groups at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) or in the Reports section of [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).)



Meanwhile, why did gold shares such as **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) fall so much?


Perhaps the thinking is that more government spending and higher federal debt would deteriorate the value of the U.S. dollar. A weak dollar makes gold more attractive. Higher gold prices would benefit Kirkland and its industry peers. But the fact that Trump decided to end negotiations with Congress suggested that America would take a break from additional fiscal moves to boost the economy.


On Tuesday, SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) fell 1.2% for its biggest single-day drop since Sept. 26. Gold futures on the COMEX cooled off 0.6% to $1,908.80 an ounce.


Kirkland Lake, falling 4% in the heaviest turnover in two weeks, is now threatening to give back all the gains from a breakout past 44.33 in an eight-week [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).

Beyond Trump Tweet: 3 Things To Watch In October
------------------------------------------------


For stock pickers who have focused on leading industries, not lagging ones, the scenario is quite different.


Software, home construction, medical and internet sectors still act well. The Market Pulse showcases a section of leading stocks that bucked the decline with gains of 1% or more in above-average turnover.


Good action by new leading stocks is the lifeblood of new bull markets. Watch this primary factor in the fourth quarter.


**United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)), highlighted in a recent [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/united-rentals-stock-buy-point-construction-heats-up/) piece, reacted normally. The company got plenty of airtime in Monday's IBD Live show.



**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) slid a bit more below a new buy point at 77.55, but damage remains limited. Plus, the homebuilding giant has a nice cushion above its 50-day moving average. Semiconductor equipment play **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)), [No. 14 in the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), rose for the eighth session in nine days. Its breakout past 74.38 is bearing fruit.


Earnings, Earnings, Earnings
----------------------------


Second, quarterly results over the next month and a half will give institutions a chance to decide whether it's time to further take profits or to build bigger stakes. Numerous banks will kick off earnings season.


"Our latest tracking of bottoms-up analyst expectations suggests that the 42.5% decline in operating earnings recorded in the second quarter will be followed by a more cyclical 20% decline in the third quarter and 10.9% in the final three months of the year," Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, wrote in a daily note to clients. "These quarterly estimates imply a full-year decline of 18.6%."


"The same bottoms-up estimates look for a 25.7% rebound in earnings next year. Earnings per share are expected to total $127.70 this year and $165.12 next year. The implied multiple of 25.9x this year is generally seen as compressing to 21.5x in 2021," Ricchiuto added.


Keep an eye on the [IBD earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/).


Third, the path of Covid-19 and news on vaccines will likely continue to help dictate the direction of stocks. But also keep an eye on interest rates. On Monday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond spiked to 0.78%. That marked the highest level since early June.


Did large funds simply take profits in long-dated government bonds with the intention to shovel more money into stocks?

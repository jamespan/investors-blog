Stock Market Dives Ahead Of Key Inflation Report; Why Investors Need To Be More Cautious Now
=============================================================================================

The stock market finished sharply lower Thursday, as the major stock indexes dived ahead of Friday's critical inflation report.




Ahead of the market open Thursday, first-time unemployment claims rose to 229,000, higher than the expected rise to 210,000 vs. 200,000 in the prior week. Initial jobless claims hit their highest level since January.


Economic news will be an even bigger focus Friday morning with the release of May's consumer price index. Consumer prices are expected to rise 0.7% in May vs. a 0.3% gain in April, according to [Econoday estimates](https://us.econoday.com/byweek.asp?cust=us). Inflation is expected to jump 8.2% in May from a year ago, down slightly from April's 8.3% year-over-year rise.


The 10-year Treasury yield closed at 3.04%, rising seven of the last nine sessions and hitting its highest level since May 11. U.S. oil prices eased Thursday, but remain near recent highs. West Texas Intermediate crude traded above $121 a barrel. In early March, WTI briefly topped out above $130 a barrel. The national average price of gas in the U.S. surpassed $5 per gallon for the first time ever Thursday, [according to GasBuddy.](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/5-dollar-gas)

[Five Below](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-five-below-ollies-bargain-outlet-report-as-bigger-rivals-wobble/) — which missed sales views and cut its outlook — pared losses to 1.4%, while [Nio stock skidded nearly 8%.](https://www.investors.com/news/nio-stock-up-ahead-of-earnings-tesla-stock-pops-with-china-sales-expected-to-improve-in-may/)


Stock Market Uptrend Struggles
------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 1.9%, while the S&P 500 declined 2.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dived 2.7%. All three undercut key short-term support levels and closed below their [21-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) for the first time since late May.


The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 2.1%, while growth stocks ended with big losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slid 3.6%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and also appeared to be higher on the NYSE.


All S&P sectors finished sharply lower, with communication services and transportation selling off 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively. Consumer staples was the best performer, and it was still down 1.3%.


While the outlook remains in an uptrend, the market is clearly struggling. The Nasdaq added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for a second straight session, taking the total number of institutional-selling days to three. The S&P 500 also added a distribution day.


With the indexes under some heavy selling and failing to hold support, IBD downgraded its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure."


Another key aspect of market health — besides the amount of distribution — is the performance of market leadership. Bearishly, many recent breakouts are struggling or have failed entirely. **Amphastar Pharmaceuticals** ([AMPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMPH)) plunged more than 21% Thursday. Shares triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting rule from a 40.08 cup-with-handle buy point after a breakout just Tuesday.


On Wednesday, [shipping stocks dived](https://www.investors.com/research/shipping-stocks-dive-as-stagflation-fears-hit-market-zim-triggers-this-sell-rule/) and continued falling Thursday. Longtime leaders **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) and **Zim Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) tumbled and broke down below their 50-day moving averages. Star Bulk shares slid another 4.4% Thursday, while Zim shares plunged another 9.8%.


If other leaders begin to break down as well, then the struggling stock market rally would likely find itself back in a correction. For now, investors should play defense and proceed with caution. Avoid most new breakouts, unless the stock shows exceptional fundamental and technical strength.

Stocks To Watch: Northrop, Ulta, Vertex
---------------------------------------


Many recent breakouts continue to struggle in the choppy uptrend. **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) are squarely below their buy points, while **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) is having trouble holding onto its own entry.


Defense giant Northrop Grumman surrendered its 477.36 buy point after tumbling 4% Wednesday and falling another 2% Thursday.


Vertex Pharmaceuticals sold off 5.4% Thursday, falling about 6% below a cup-with-handle's 276.10 buy point. Bearishly, the stock also gave up its 50-day line.


Ulta finished Thursday just below a cup-with-handle's 426.93 buy point. On Wednesday and again Thursday, the stock topped the entry but was unable to hold onto that level. Still, Ulta shares are showing tremendous relative strength in a choppy uptrend. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit a new high Thursday. Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Ulta stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-ulta-beauty-inc-ulta.aspx) shows a solid 94 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).

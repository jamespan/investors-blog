Stocks rebounded Monday to continue an upward trend. The Nasdaq was the highlight of the session as it delivered a one-two punch.


The Nasdaq ended the day with a 0.9% gain. It climbed back above the 5000 level for the first time in nearly 15 years and came within 2.5% of its March 10, 2000, record high at 5132.50.


Another positive was that the tech-heavy index lost its Feb. 4 distribution day after rising 6% from the close of that day. The Nasdaq is now down to just one distribution day since its Jan. 8 follow-through day.


The Nasdaq has been pretty much rising nonstop since clearing a big trading range last month. So a pullback wouldn't be much of a surprise at this point.


Heavyweights **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) helped the Nasdaq Monday. Chip stocks also gave the index a boost amid merger activity. **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) agreed to buy peer **Freescale Semiconductor** ([FSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSL)) in a cash-and-stock deal. (See story on Page A1.)


The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 2.8% to its best level in 14 years. IBD's three semiconductor-related industry groups rallied 2.1% to 2.9%.


Weakness in energy and utility stocks held the S&P 500 to an 0.6% gain. But the benchmark S&P index still scored a record closing high.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average and the small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. Both scored record highs.


U.S. stocks were higher on news that China had cut a key interest rate. (See International Leaders on Page B10.) The world's second biggest economy had also a round of mixed economic data.


Despite strong price action on the day, volume dipped on both major exchanges.


With many stocks having broken out in recent weeks, some have already nabbed respectable gains. Part of successful investing involves booking profits when you have them. A number of leading stocks such as **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)), **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Cerner** ([CERN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CERN)), **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) and NXP Semiconductors have risen 20% or more from latest buy points or are close to doing so.


But not all leaders are well. **Pacira Pharmaceuticals** ([PCRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCRX)) plunged nearly 20% in huge volume after the FDA rejected an application for expanded use of its lead drug, Exparel, which is a painkiller. The stock triggered the 8% sell rule.

Small Caps Outperform The Major Stock Indexes
==============================================

Stocks packed in quiet losses and gains Friday as the market left the Nasdaq the only major index up for the week.


The Nasdaq closed up 0.1% Friday after reversing direction a couple of times earlier in the session. The S&P 500 finished just below flat. The Dow Jones industrial average and the small-cap S&P 600 rose 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed higher NYSE volume.


Stocks in the small-cap S&P 600 that moved up solidly for the week included shoe retailer **DSW** ([DSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DSW)) up almost 6%; jewelry retailer **Fossil Group** ([FOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOSL)), up 1.6%; restaurant chain **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)), up about 3%; prepaid debit card provider **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)), up 1.8%; and apparel maker **G-III Apparel** ([GIII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIII)), up 1.5%.

Among 33 sectors, retail started the year at a lackluster No. 20. The climb toward leadership was slow but steady.


By May, retail started appearing in the top 10. By early July, retail began scoring in the top five.


Going into Friday's market, the retail sector was No. 4, outranked only by software, medical and consumer. Retail was up almost 22% year to date.


News Looms
----------


The market had trouble making much headway in September, perhaps partly because of noise over tariffs, a rate hike and rising oil prices.


While news Friday was light, at least the news relevant to the stock market, some big news items loom.


The midterm U.S. elections are only about five weeks off. If the political futures prediction markets are correct, Democrats will grab control of the House of Representatives and Republicans will keep their grip on the Senate.


What would that mean to the stock market?


Probably not much. As IBD founder William O'Neil has pointed out many times, innovative companies with products that can change the way people live are far more important.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), for example, is a company that changed the world. Granted, not everybody is convinced that ever-present smartphones are what the world needed. But it happened.


Pull up a monthly chart of Apple. Mark November 2004, November 2008, November 2012 and November 2016.


What effect did the elections have on Apple? Nothing that can be seen on the stock chart.


Earnings Look
-------------


Soon traders will have the Q3 earnings season to dissect. The unofficial kickoff is about two weeks away.


Some of the big banks will report Oct. 12. They may need some beats if they are to overcome recent gloom in the sector. Going into Friday's session the bank sector was No. 23 among the 33 sectors.

  Stock Market Powers Higher In New Rally Attempt; Tesla, Daqo New Energy Surge; Energy Stocks Snap Back

A shortened week of trading started off with a bang for the stock market Tuesday as major stock indexes closed with gains of better than 2%. Volume fell from Friday, but it was a tough comparison because options and futures expired Friday, resulting in unusually heavy volume.




**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was the top gainer in the Dow Jones today, up more than 6%, while **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) surged more than 9% to lead the Nasdaq 100.


UNH stock soared back above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/), but it still needs to conquer the 500 level, which basically corresponds to the stock's [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Tesla showed short-term technical action by moving above its short-term moving averages and last week's high of 706.99.


On the second day of a rally attempt, the Nasdaq composite closed off highs but still rose 2.5%. It recovered the 11,000 level with ease, but the index is still below its short-term moving averages. If the Nasdaq can move above the 10-day and 21-day exponential moving averages, it could pave the way for a run at 12,000. But the Nasdaq's 50-day line is just above the 12,000 level and looms large as a potential resistance area.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP061722-1-289x300.jpg)The S&P 500 rallied 2.4% on the second day of its rally attempt; the Russell 2000 small-cap index gained 1.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 2.1%. But with the stock indexes and most individual stocks far off their highs, actionable stocks remain in short supply.


Breadth was OK on the Nasdaq, with advancing stocks topping decliners by just over 2-to-1. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by nearly 3-to-1.


Indexes are trying to make a case for a bottom again, but it's not a convincing one â€” at least not yet. Another [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/) would be good to see, but not much has changed since the last time the Nasdaq followed through on May 26. That one failed quickly. There's still a lot of technical damage that needs time to repair. Once the repair work is done, that's when new bases will form. And it's the new bases that will deliver the new breakouts as institutional money comes in from the sidelines.


The 10-year Treasury yield snapped a three-session slide after coming close to its 10-day moving average Friday. The yield rose 7 basis points to 3.31% Tuesday.

Money flowed out bonds and into stocks ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony on Capitol Hill this week. He'll start his semiannual monetary policy report in front of the Senate Wednesday at 6:30 a.m. PT. He addresses the House of Representatives Thursday at 7 a.m. PT.


The stock market is still struggling with rampant inflation and what impact it will have on corporate earnings this year. It's also struggling with the threat of a recession after the Fed hiked its key lending rate by 75 basis points last week. Another 75-basis-point hike is expected in July.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Several oil and gas stocks bounced back after some harsh selling last week. WTI crude oil futures for August delivery settled at $109.52 a barrel, up 1.4%.


Out of 11 sector ETFs tracked by S&P, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) led the way, up 5.2%. **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), which dived below its 50-day line Friday, bounced back close to the line, up 6%. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) rallied 4%, but it's still far below its 50-day line. Both stocks make up about 44% of the S&P energy ETF.


Among oil and gas producers, **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) was a top gainer in the S&P 500. Shares bounced 8.2% after traveling down to the 200-day moving average Friday. Diamondback hit a low of 119.56 Friday, undercutting the low of its latest consolidation and shaking out sellers.

Other top gainers in the S&P 500 from the oil patch included, **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)), **Phillips 66** ([PSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSX)) and **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)). Gains ranged from 6% to 7%.


Chinese solar firm **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) led the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). After a breakout from a bottoming base earlier this month, DQ vaulted nearly 15%, closing just below an alternate handle entry of 67.16. Keep in mind that Daqo's gain from the 53.70 entry already exceeds 25%, which is a target for taking some profits. Daqo's bottoming base, which started forming March 10, sits inside a larger base that began in early November.


Meanwhile, a couple of biotech stocks did well. After surging 4.8% Friday in heavy volume, **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) climbed above its 50-day moving average, rising 2.7%. It's now in position for a possible move above its June 8 high.


After a mild pullback to its 21-day exponential moving average last week, **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)), jumped above its 10-day line, rising 4.3%. The stock's strength resulted in its addition to [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader).


Coal stocks also bounced back. After plunging below the 50-day moving average Friday in heavy volume, **Consol Energy** ([CEIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEIX)) reclaimed the line in above-average trade, rising 14%. IBD's coal group rallied nearly 5%.

===============================================================================================

The stock market briefly dived Thursday after inflation hit a 40-year high ahead of the open. But the major stock indexes cut into those losses, ending just off session highs.




**Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)), **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)), **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)) are among the stocks to watch in the ongoing stock market correction ahead of a potential [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


Stock Market Today
------------------


The stock market opened sharply lower Thursday after Russia-Ukraine cease-fire talks [failed to make progress.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-ramps-up-attacks-after-deadly-hit-on-maternity-hospital-11646907696) The two countries' foreign ministers met in Turkey. Meanwhile, the consumer price index rose 0.8% from the prior month and 7.9% vs. a year ago, the [biggest annual gain since January 1982](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-hits-40-year-high-as-oil-food-prices-jump-dow-jones/), the Labor Department said.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slashed losses to 0.3%, while the S&P 500 ended 0.4% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dived as much as 2.3% before paring losses to less than 1%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 moved down just 0.2%.


The S&P is holding mainly above the 4200 level, while the 13,000 level may give the Nasdaq a foothold. So watch how the indexes behave around those levels.


Top growth stocks bucked the market trend Thursday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 0.8%, aided by strength in energy and fertilizer stocks such as **Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)) and **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP031022-288x300.jpg)The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up to 2.01% in the wake of the CPI report amid a four-day win streak. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude oil briefly traded above $114 a barrel before reversing lower to close around $106.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to also be lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Rally Attempt
--------------------------


Thursday was Day 11 of a rally attempt, which means a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) — signaling the start of a new uptrend — still remains possible despite the session's losses and heavy selling in the previous several days. Market bottoms often happen when investors least expect it, so be prepared with a ready-to-go watchlist. For now, the [market outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) remains a "market in correction."


During corrections, investors should be in cash. But don't tune out. Instead, keep a watchlist of top-performing stocks that are trying to hold up during the market weakness. Use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) to help you identify potential stock market leaders. You can also find stocks newly added to IBD's proprietary watchlists, like the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) list.

Stocks To Watch: Costco, Cleveland, Nucor, Quanta, Union
--------------------------------------------------------


Costco, Cleveland-Cliffs, Nucor, Quanta Services and Union Pacific are among the stocks to watch. They could become actionable if the market outlook improves.


Costco stock continues to build a cup base with a 571.59 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Keep an eye out for a handle to form, which would lower the entry. The stock rose 1% Thursday in sharp contrast to the stock market. Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) hit new highs this week, a sign of strength especially during periods of significant market weakness.


Steelmakers Cleveland-Cliffs and Nucor both moved back out of buy range during Thursday's sessions. CLF shares rallied 7% as it became extended past a double bottom's 24.77 entry. Nucor shares rallied 2.7%, out of buy range above a double bottom's 126.77 buy point.


[Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/pwr-stock-pops-energy-transition-boosts-quanta-services/), Quanta Services, topped a 113.81 early trendline buy point Tuesday during the session's 8.2% surge. Meanwhile, the stock continues to move up the right side of a consolidation with a 124.79 buy point. PWR shares rallied 2% Thursday. The stock's RS line hit a new high.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Union Pacific bullishly regained its 256.21 flat-base entry, rising 2.4%. Thursday's upside reversal was a welcome sign after two straight days of heavy selling this week saw the railroad operator give up the flat-base buy point. Per Leaderboard analysis, the RS line had already been making new highs, which is a sign of a market leader.

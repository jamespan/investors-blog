  Stock Market Jolted As Recession Fears Rise; Steel Melts But This Gold Stock Shines

The stock market was jolted lower amid new jobs data Tuesday. With recession fears rising, gold stocks popped as treasury yields tumbled.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day 0.5% lower. Still, it remains down less than 1% for the week and is clear of its major moving averages after a bullish, three-week run. A lack of volume means tech stocks were not finding many buyers or sellers today.


The S&P 500 also dipped, falling 0.6%. Bulls will take heart from the fact its weekly dip is marginal and the index remains clear of the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Decliners outnumbered gainers by just over 2-to-1 on the NYSE. The margin on the Nasdaq was slightly wider, coming in at just under 3-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a similar decline, tumbling 0.6%. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) was a major laggard on a dreadful day for industrials while **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) led the upside.


Small caps received the harshest spanking by bears, with the Russell 2000 diving 1.8%. Weakness among banks played a role here. Growth stocks were also given a caning, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) tumbling 1.5%.


Investors seemed to flee risk assets in favor of hiding out in treasuries. The 10-year yield dived 9 basis points to 3.34% while the two-year yield plunged 16 basis points to 3.82%. The yield curve, often an indicator of a recession, remains inverted.


Jobs Data JOLTS Stock Market
----------------------------


It was a case of be careful what you wish for after stocks were hit following the latest JOLTS report.


The report showed job openings totaled 9.93 million in February, a surprisingly-large drop of 632,000 from the previous month's downwardly-revised figure. This was the first time in two years the figure came in below 10 million.

While investors are keen to see cracks emerge in the labor market in the hopes it leads to a more dovish Fed, the fact it raises the risk of a hard landing and a recession is hardly a tailwind for stocks.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya pointed out in a note to clients that future rate cuts may come at a cost.


"The bears are feeling confident that the recent rally can't keep going given valuations and how the rates markets are clearly signaling we are recession bound. The bulls see a weakening economy and the end of the Fed's tightening cycle," he said.


"The bears most likely have a stronger argument as, if we see rate cuts in the fall, that means something is really wrong with the economy."


Meanwhile **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) CEO Jamie Dimon stoked fears surrounding the financial sector after he said in his annual letter to shareholders that the banking crisis is not over and that "there will be repercussions from it for years to come."


Despite this, the market uptrend remains intact. Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq so no distribution days were added, at least according to preliminary data. For now, 40% to 60% exposure makes sense but keep on top of any sell signals in your portfolio.

Gold Stock Shines As Steel Melts
--------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors had a tough day, with a majority ending negative. The defensive utilities subgroup posted the best gains while industrials, energy and materials struggled.



Steel producers fared the worst but commercial services leasing firms, construction machinery plays, metal product distributors and automakers also struggled. Farming machinery stocks lagged as well.


One worry for industrials: The regional banking crisis could have a knock-on effect on securing loans. Bank plays had a bad day, with the superregional banking group the worst.


On the upside, gold miners were among the best performers. The bullish action led to [Leaderboard adding](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) to its position in **Royal Gold** ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD)), which is in a buy zone above a 131.99 entry.


At the same time, precious metals' strong performance is hardly a bullish call on the economy. The Good Friday jobs report is looking crucial, though there will be no instant reaction because the stock market will be closed.

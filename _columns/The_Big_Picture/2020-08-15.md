S&P 500 Almost Hits New Milestone; New IPOs Give This Important Trading Lesson
===============================================================================

The S&P 500 came up short in making a key milestone, yet Friday's action still proved good enough to hand the large-cap benchmark its third straight up week and a sixth weekly advance in seven weeks.




A shove higher in the final 15 minutes of the session almost pushed the S&P 500 into positive ground for the day. Plus, the index harbored a good chance of hitting a new all-time weekly closing high since the market's peak in 2020, before the coronavirus market crash. In the week ended Feb. 14, the S&P 500 closed at 3380.


Still, an 8.8% gain since the start of the third quarter is nothing to sneeze at.


The Nasdaq fell 0.2% in a slight increase in volume vs. Thursday. So technically, Friday's session qualifies as a [new distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). But it's the type of institutional "sell-off" that you'd prefer in a market that has etched a [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) since an [April 2 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/).


![MP081420_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP081420_2-285x300.jpg)Notice on a daily chart how the trading range held within a tight band of less than 0.8% from low to high. This is favorable when comparing to some of the wide-ranging declines in July and August. Over these two months, the Nasdaq has dropped 1% or more for the day four times. And the intraday range in each of these instances far surpassed what took place on Friday.


The Nasdaq 100, down just 0.1% on Friday, eked out a weekly advance of less than 0.3%. Yet this adds cushion to gains of 4% and 2.1% in the prior two weeks.



Remarkably, the gauge of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq has yet to penetrate its 10-week moving average since crossing above this important level in the week ended April 17.

Most of the top industry groups for the week hailed from the bottom half of IBD's rankings of six-month performance. They included specialty retail, gaming, air freight, oil & gas field services, commercial staffing, ship transport and steel. They gained 6% or more each.



Such action reflects a rising confidence, albeit at a slow pace, that the economy will eventually recover from the Covid-19-caused shutdown. New data has been encouraging. Thursday's initial jobless claims fell below 1 million for the first time since March. On Friday, July retail sales excluding cars and gas jumped 1.5%, [smashing the Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for a 0.9% rise.


The IPO market continues to get attention, and for good reason. But the market showed why the risks of buying too early and buying companies with no earnings are so critical.


**Rocket Mortgage** ([RKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RKT)) halted a four-day losing streak, up 1.2% to 18.96. The financial services giant ($38 billion market cap, $5.1 billion in sales and 65 cents in earnings per share in 2019) holds just a 5% gain from its initial public offering at $18 a share. If you bought on the Aug. 6 debut or the next day, you had to act fast to avoid a quick loss. It highlights the importance of waiting for a [proper initial base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) to form.



**Vroom** ([VRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRM)) rallied 3.7% on Friday after Thursday's 18% plunge. The auto retailer does not make any money yet. Sales had grown 20% or more for four straight quarters. However, Q2 sales dipped 3% to $253 million.

  Stocks Nearly Flat; Is Market Running Out Of Steam After Long Rally?

After advancing for several weeks in a row, maybe it was too much to ask the stock market to keep rising Monday.




Indexes erased morning losses and climbed into the afternoon. But some late profit-taking shaved gains. The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ended only 0.1% higher. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was virtually flat on the NYSE.


Calm trading characterized Monday' session, with indexes tracing minor price ranges. The Nasdaq fell as much as 0.3% and the S&P 500 was off 0.4% at its lows. The modest moves made it hard to notice that all three major indexes made record highs.


The Dow made its second straight close above 28,000. But small caps lagged. The Russell 2000 closed 0.3% lower, although it too finished away from the day's lows. Energy stocks bore the brunt of small-cap losses, with Invesco S&P Smallcap Energy Portfolio ([PSCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCE)) ETF down 3.4%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP-111819-234x300.jpg)Last week, the Nasdaq made it six straight up weeks, and for the S&P 500 it was five up weeks in a row. That's impressive, but the market will need to muster even more buyers if it's to stretch that streak much more.


To be sure, the stock market has been streaky this year. The Nasdaq just matched the six-week win streak from late march to early May. The composite also was up six of eight weeks in June and July. It also had a 10-week win streak to start the year. The S&P 500 had nearly similar win streaks.


Each of those streaks started the same way: A [follow through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) marked the start of a new uptrend in the stock market. Jan. 4, June 7 and Aug. 13 were days of large gains in the major indexes in higher volume, and dutifully noted in [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). Those bottoming signals did their job.


So, can the stock market extend its current streak? There's not much standing in its way, other than a normal pullback to keep things from overheating.


It was curious that Monday's best S&P sectors were defensive: The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) rose 0.5%. Long-term U.S. interest rates fell.


Stock Market Risks Subsiding
----------------------------


The major market risks are subsiding. Earnings season is winding down. The Fed has stated its vision for interest rates, and Wall Street did not protest. The U.S.-China trade war remains unresolved, but indications are positive. Political risks remain, however. So far, the market seems at peace as impeachment hearings go on.



**Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) was Monday's best breakout, a sign that some software leaders are mending. Shares topped the 112.56 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Still, IBD's enterprise software industry group is [the No. 99 group out of 197](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-nov-15-2019/), way off from No. 33 just six weeks ago.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)Â is still lagging the major indexes, but rose 0.3% Monday. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which has a different weighting system, is near a new high. Speaking of streaks, the ETF is now up eight sessions in a row.


**InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) was a big boost for both the ETF and underlying index. Shares of the maker of cosmetic and medical procedures shot up as much as 18.8% intraday and closed nearly 6% higher. After an avaricious rise over the past four weeks, InMode may be ready to cool off.

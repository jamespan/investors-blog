What is Wall Street? It's essentially a parade of money moving from one end of the street to the other. The action in top stocks and the general market truly underscored this point on Tuesday.




If casual observers remarked, "Oh, Tuesday was a pretty dull day," they would be right. The Nasdaq composite gained a measly 0.3%. Except for a brief slide 45 minutes before the closing bell, the gains felt measured all day. The S&P 500 gained a little more than 1 point. Small caps outperformed the S&P 500: The Russell 2000 edged 0.2% higher.


Yet "dull" also would reflect a gross oversight of what happened on a sector-by-sector basis.


Semiconductor stocks jammed. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) vaulted more than 2.4% and hit a new all-time high of 115.86.


Enterprise software stocks, which have hustled sharply higher since the start of the year, took a well-deserved rest. On [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), five of the six business software-related stocks featured on four separate lists (Leaders Near A Buy Point, Leaders, Watch List and Earnings Options) fell. Yet none of them flashed sell signals, such as a [steep drop through the 50-day or 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).


On the down side? Health care firms got creamed again.


Beyond Top Stocks: A Growing Stock Market Bifurcation
-----------------------------------------------------


The 15 worst performers in IBD's [daily ranking of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-apr-16-2019/) all dropped at least 1.2%. Six of those groups came from the gigantic medical sector — namely research equipment and services, systems and equipment, supplies, products, services and ethical drugs. The average price-weighted drop among these six industry groups: 1.8%.


The Dow Jones utility average fell more than 1.3%. The SPDR Utilities ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)), down 1.2%, still holds a decent gain of 8.6% year to date. But XLU is now testing support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since it crossed bullishly above it on Jan. 31.


Gold and silver mining, property REIT and tobacco shares also had a bad day at the office, each of those groups dropping 1.5% to 2.4%.


Such price changes probably don't matter much to investors aiming for healthy dividends over the long run or broadly based equity index ETFs such as SPDR S&P 500 ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)). However, for stock pickers, sessions like Tuesday matter a lot. They remind us that achieving an outstanding return on stocks cannot be done without paying close attention to the overall strength of a stock's industry group and its broad sector.


Where Do Health Care Stocks Stand Now?
--------------------------------------


For weeks, the IBD stock research tables had already hinted that the health care sector is a laggard. Numerous companies across the gigantic industry are perhaps facing the prospects of game-changing government legislation that could disrupt existing business models.


Take the 33 sector rankings in IBD's [NYSE and Nasdaq research tables as of Tuesday's close](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-apr-16-2019/). Medical ranked deeply within the bottom half at No. 25, down from No. 22 on Monday in terms of blended mid- and long-term relative price performance..


A 5.8% gain since Jan. 1 certainly sounds great on an annualized basis. But compared with gains of 19.4% by the 10th-ranked Apparel sector through Tuesday's close, 30% by Computer (No. 8), 30% by Chips (No. 4) and 28% by Software (No. 1), it looks quite small.


NYSE turnover jumped 9% vs. Monday. That marked a [rare stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) on the S&P 500 and gave the large-cap benchmark a fifth distribution day.


No doubt, [five distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), or instances of unusually heavy selling by fund managers, are a concern for an uptrend, especially how far and how fast stocks have run up since the Jan. 4 follow-through.


Yet the current count actually shows [two rare stalling days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), including Tuesday's session, and only one session in which the S&P 500 fell 1% or more: the 1.9% drop on March 22.


In short, the latest [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) lack teeth.


Nasdaq volume also rose sharply. Since the composite index finished in the upper half of its intraday range, it did not trigger a stalling day.


3 More Elements Of Bull Market Health
-------------------------------------



The sell-off in mostly defensive stocks on Tuesday is just one positive element of the current bullish landscape for investors in high-growth companies. What are three other notable factors?


**One, market internals still look good**. As seen in the [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) section of Stock Lists on Investors.com, the ratio of new highs vs. new lows on both the Nasdaq and NYSE remains very positive.


**Two, even blue chips are breaking out**. Just witness last week's stunning move by **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) after it officially joined the market for broadband-based video service with Disney+. As [this recent Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/screening-top-stocks-new-can-slim/) notes, plenty of small-, mid- and big-cap stocks are executing the N (for "new") in CAN SLIM.


**Three, equity markets overseas are getting back some of their mojo**. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong posted a nifty reversal overnight and rallied 1.1%, raising its year-to-date gain to nearly 17%. The Hang Seng continued to lead its 50-day moving average higher. Ditto for related ETFs such as and X-Trackers Harvest CSI 300 ([ASHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASHR)), Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2X ([CHAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHAU)), Direxion Daily FTSE China Bull 3X ([YINN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YINN)).



**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), a China auto marketing firm and member of IBD's Leaderboard, has crafted a new handle on its giant cup. A [new buy point](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) has emerged in the fast-growing consumer spending play.


Positive investor sentiment data coming out of Germany, one of the biggest economic engines in the EU, helped send the iShares MSCI Germany ETF ([EWG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWG)) up 0.5% for a fourth straight gain and to its highest level since Oct. 16.

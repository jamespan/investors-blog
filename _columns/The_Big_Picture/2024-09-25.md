The stock market continued a dull trend Wednesday, although the unremarkable trading in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq obscured selling in smaller stocks.




The S&P 500 closed 0.2% lower but still made an all-time high in early intraday action at 5,741.03. The Nasdaq composite edged up less than 0.1% and held above the 18,000 level.


But the Russell 2000 index slid 1.2%. Energy, health care and consumer discretionary stocks hurt small caps the most, although losses stretched to other sectors in the small-cap benchmark index.


The S&P 400 midcap index lost 1.3% for its largest drop since Sept. 6.  It is meeting resistance at the 570-574 level. The midcap index is most heavily weighted in industrials (22.7%), financials (16.6%) and consumer discretionary stocks (14.4%). Those sectors fell 0.4% to 0.6% Wednesday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also lagged, down 0.7% for the day and snapping a four-day win streak. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) alone accounted for 118 points of the Dow's 293-point loss. The stock plunged 5.5% in double its average volume, sliding below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The biotech had disappointing trials on two drugs, reports said.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. Declining stocks outnumbered gainers by about 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by 12-to-5 on the NYSE.


Stock Market Sees More Breakouts
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP092524.jpg)Wednesday's dull session also overshadowed a quiet but continued wave of breakouts among high-rated stocks.


**Progress Software** ([PRGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRGS)) broke out of a 57-week pattern in heavy volume after a positive earnings report for the business applications software maker. **Pegasystems** ([PEGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEGA)) cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/). Citigroup raised the work-management software maker's price target to 92 from 87.


Industrial pump and valve maker **Flowserve** ([FLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLS)) broke out of an irregular base in volume that was nearly three times its average. The stock started rallying Tuesday, when a Bank of America analyst said Flowserve [should benefit from demand for nuclear energy](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/nuclear-energy-stock-flowserve-ai-b0c4c8e6?mod=mw_quote_news) to power artificial intelligence computers.


[Investor's Business Daily's MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) screen of recent breakouts — which is filtered through the MarketSurge Growth 250 index — lists 55 companies on the stock market. Nearly half are more than 5% past their proper buy points.


But other fine choices such as **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), **Badger Meter** ([BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **Wheaton Precious Metals** ([WPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WPM)) remain in buy zones.


In another sign that breakouts are appearing and generally working, the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) is near its highest point since April 2022. The exchange traded fund tries to capture [stocks rising past resistance levels](https://www.innovatoretfs.com/etf/default.aspx?ticker=bout), based on IBD's research.


The ETF is outperforming the more widely traded Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which closed Wednesday 8% below its June 20 high. Year to date, however, both funds are up about 10%.


The IBD 50 index rose 0.3% Wednesday. **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) gave the IBD 50 a big boost, as shares rallied 6.6% to record highs. The language-learning app provider is [adding AI-generated features](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/duolingo-stock-ai-innovations-language-learning-app/). JPMorgan Chase and other firms raised their price targets on Duolingo.


What September Says For Market
------------------------------


With three trading sessions left this month, the stock market has avoided the curse of September. Historically, the S&P 500 falls an average of 0.7% in September, making it the worst month of the year statistically.


Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said in a report that market momentum this year favors continued gains for the rest of 2024.

Over the last 75 years, the S&P 500 has fallen in the final three months of the year only eight times when momentum was strong during the first three quarters. Whenever returns exceed 16.4% in the first nine months (the S&P is up 20% this year), the S&P has climbed in the fourth quarter 80% of the time. Fourth-quarter gains, however, lag with a 3.5% average return.


Moreover, when the S&P 500 makes a new high during September, the benchmark index climbs in the fourth quarter 91.3% of the time. The average S&P 500 return in October-December is 4.8%. And in 21 out of 23 years, it produced positive results.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dived 370 points Thursday, extending losses from the [Federal Reserve's hawkish comments Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cut-hopes-dim-as-hawks-take-over-sp-500-slips/). One reason for the continued sell-off this week? The 10-year Treasury bond yield surged Thursday, hitting its highest level since late 2007, based on 3 p.m. ET closing-price data recorded by Dow Jones.




As the market correction deepens, [IBD Leaderboard Watchlist stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)), **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) are stocks to watch in [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?).


Economic Data
-------------


First-time weekly claims for unemployment assistance surprisingly dropped to 201,000. They were expected to rise to 225,000, vs. 220,000 claims in the previous week.


Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index fell into a contraction in September, down to -13.5. It was expected to drop to 0.5, down from August's 12.0 reading. Finally, existing-home sales from the National Association of Realtors fell to 4.04 million in August, down from July's 4.07 million.


The [mixed economic data](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) helped push U.S. Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year yield settling at 4.48% Thursday, hitting a new 52-week high.


Key earnings movers Thursday were **Darden Restaurants** ([DRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRI)), **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) and **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)).


Darden shares declined 2.7%, while KBH stock slid 4.3% on Thursday. Finally, FedEx shares jumped 4.5%.


Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Falls
-----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP092123-300x281.jpg)On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 1.1%, while the S&P 500 declined 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dived 1.8%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 slipped 1.6%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE compared with Wednesday's session.


In the Dow Jones Industrial Average, networking giant **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) dived nearly 4%, breaking below the 50-day line. The Dow Jones member said on Thursday that it will acquire software company **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) for $28 billion in cash. Cisco will buy Splunk for $157 per share, a 31% premium to the software firm's closing price on Wednesday.


Top growth stocks lagged, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) sold off 2.6% Thursday, hitting its lowest level since March. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) dived 6.1%, closing a touch below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Shares are on pace to tumble around 14% on the week.


On Wednesday, the stock market sell-off caused IBD to [downgrade its current outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gets-a-fresh-bearish-downgrade-after-fed-decision/) for the stock market to "correction" from "uptrend under pressure." IBD cut its recommended exposure level to a 0%-20% range.


During market corrections, investors should primarily be on the sidelines until the start of a new uptrend. Instead of tuning out, create a watchlist of leading stocks that could be market leaders in the next uptrend.

Buyers dictated the action again Wednesday as the stock market put the wraps on a half day of trading. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) stock moved nicely higher after Q2 vehicle deliveries topped expectations, but **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) stock slumped 3.5% after Bloomberg reported the company is in advanced talks to acquire **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)).




The Nasdaq composite extended its winning streak to six sessions, rising 0.8% to an all-time closing high, helped by strength in software stocks. **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) picked up 2% to 80.64. It closed just below an ascending base buy point of 82.35. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) cleared an ascending base with a 293.08 entry. Shares closed at 293.15, up 1.7%.


The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 marked new closing highs as well, rising 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Volume was light ahead of the July Fourth holiday.


Tesla stock ended near its session low, but still rose 4.6% after the company said it delivered 95,200 vehicles in the second quarter, above Wall Street estimates of 91,000. [Model 3 deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-jumps-as-vehicle-shipments-beat-estimates/) totaled 77,550, also above estimates.

Broadcom is a top-10 holding of the fund, with a weighting of around 5%.


In other ETF moves, iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) is still in buy range after a breakout over an alternate [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 223.68. Shares closed at 225.61, up 1.1%. **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) combined make up more than a third of the fund.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The stock market's performance since the June 7 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) has been impressive amid rising bullish sentiment. Investors Intelligence on Wednesday said bullish newsletter writers rose to 55.2% from 53.3%. But increasing bullishness isn't necessarily a good thing because the survey is a contrarian indicator. Bullishness hit 56.4% in late April just before the market started to pull back.


But with plenty of healthy stock charts out there, and limited signs of institutional selling, stock market bulls still have reasons to be optimistic.


Growth Stocks On The Move
-------------------------


**Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) also outperformed Wednesday, up 2.6% to 71.54. It's currently a half position on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) but could go full if the stock breaks out of its current base with a 75.38 entry.



New issue **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) tried to cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) Wednesday but came up short. It cleared a 46.43 buy point early but closed at 45.50, up 3%. Fundamentals are a bit questionable, however, because sales growth decelerated sharply when the company reported earnings in May.


Bond Yields, Jobs Data
----------------------


Money continues to flow into U.S. bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield is around 1.95%, its lowest level since November 2016. Meanwhile, 10-year yields are negative in Japan, Germany and France.


In economic news Wednesday, private payrolls increased 102,000 in June, but that was well below the consensus estimate of 140,000. It was the second straight weak reading from ADP. In May, private payrolls increased a scant 27,000, but the number was revised slightly higher to 41,000.


Later this month, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its key lending rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2% to 2.25%. And there's a 75% chance of another quarter-point cut at the September meeting.

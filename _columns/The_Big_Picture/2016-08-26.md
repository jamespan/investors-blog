U.S. stock indexes popped higher on Fed chief Janet Yellen's remarks Friday, but the gains proved short-lived.


Indexes pared or erased gains. The Nasdaq closed just 0.1% higher, while the S&P 500 subtracted less than 0.2%. The IBD 50 was flat. Volume rose across the board.


For the week, the IBD 50 lost 1%; the Nasdaq, 0.4%; and the S&P 500, 0.7%. The Nasdaq snapped an eight-week win streak, continuing a weakening trend that reminds investors to be guarded.


Yellen said the case for a rate hike had "strengthened" but offered no timetable. Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer later told CNBC that two rate hikes this year would be "consistent" with Yellen's remarks.


![MP082616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP082616-181x300.jpg)The notion of a second rate hike this year appeared to rattle the market.


In one sense, bulls had to wonder what Fischer was thinking. The hint of two rate hikes only added uncertainty. Fischer planted the doubts just as the market was getting comfortable with the idea of one rate hike.


Of course, acting as steward over the stock market is not in Fischer's job description. And it's possible, though perhaps unlikely, that his remarks were not out of line with Yellen's thinking. Yet if Yellen's mission was clarity, Fischer muddied the waters.


The reactions of the bank stocks were telling. At first, virtually every bank was rising nicely on Yellen's remarks. Once Fischer made his comments, most bank stocks gave back their gains. But the [**bank stocks had one more move**](https://www.investors.com/news/jpmorgan-bank-of-america-other-banks-up-on-strengthened-yellen/) left. Many reversed off the day's lows, closing reasonably high in the intraday range.


For example, **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) gapped up 2.4%, then retreated to a 0.3% gain and rebounded to end with a 1.7% gain. Volume was 44% above average for the megacap.


South Dakota-based small-cap **Great Western Bancorp** ([GWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWB)) jumped 1.9%, then reversed to a loss and then rebounded to a 0.9% gain.


If banks are expected to profit from higher rates, why the back and forth? Wouldn't two rate hikes be twice as good?


Market logic is seldom simple. The market hates uncertainty, and that's what the Fed delivered.


At the end of the day, the market handled events fairly well. A Fed that was expected to clarify conditions only obscured them.


Experienced investors know that following the stock market -- from a detached angle -- can make for unexpected laughs. On Friday, what the Fed lost in clarity was papered over in comic relief.


In the coming week, the market will go about the unfunny work of sorting it out.

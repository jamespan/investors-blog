Netflix Helps Lift Nasdaq To 3rd Straight Record Closing High
==============================================================

Tech stocks turned in a solid performance Tuesday, helped by strong earnings from **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 marked their third straight record closing highs.




 The Nasdaq ended with a gain of 0.7%, while the Nasdaq 100 added 0.8%. Price action was quieter in the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500. The Dow ended fractionally lower and the S&P 500 eked out a 0.2% gain. Nasdaq volume edged up, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE lower than Monday's levels.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index added 0.3% and the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) lagged a bit, down 0.2%.


It's been a slow week of economic data so far, but Wall Street will be watching December existing-home sales data Wednesday, new-home sales data Thursday and the first reading on fourth-quarter GDP Friday.

The 10-year Treasury yield slipped 4 basis points to around 2.61%. The yield on Friday hit its highest level since July 2014. The next Federal Reserve meeting is scheduled for Jan. 31, and the Fed is widely expected to stand pat on rates, although more rate hikes are expected this year.


With the market in a confirmed uptrend, there's no reason to be swimming against the market tend, expecting a market downturn. The [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) remains mild, with one for the Nasdaq and one for the S&P 500. A distribution day is when an index declines more than 0.2% in higher volume. A 0.3% decline in heavy volume would be considered a mild form of institutional selling, while a loss of around 1% or more would be considered heavy institutional selling. When distribution days start to cluster over a short period of time, it's often a sign that a market pullback is in store.


For now, distribution is not an issue for the market. Neither is the action of leading growth stocks, many of which continue to show relative strength, perhaps in anticipation of strong earnings reports.


Q4 earnings season has swung into gear, and the results so far have been solid, with plenty of firms speaking positively about the future thanks to tax reform, including **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Kimberly-Clark** ([KMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMB)) on Tuesday.


Netflix jumped 10% to 250.29 after reporting bullish earnings and sales late Monday. Headed into earnings, Netflix was extended from a 204.48 entry. Among the other FANG names, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) member **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rose more than 2%, while **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) added 1%. Of the three, the only one that's not extended is Facebook, but its relative strength is lagging badly even with shares in new high ground.


Despite a plethora of extended stocks out there, investors doing their homework have some names to consider. As always, check a stock's relative strength line on an IBD Chart. If it's at or near new high ground as a stock is trying to break out, that's a good sign because it means the breakout could have oomph.


In the breakout world, enterprise software company **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) is still in buy range after a low-volume breakout Monday over a 114.98 cup-with-handle buy point (seen on the daily chart). Shares rose 1.7% Tuesday to 117.21. In early December, Workday hit an intraday low of 95.35, undercutting the low of a prior base. This served to reset the base count. Workday's weekly chart shows a conventional entry at 116.99,



Among China names, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) enjoyed a nice bounce off the 50-day moving average, rising 4.5% to 192.28 in heavy volume. It's retaking a 191.85 buy point from a later-stage base with a 191.85 buy point.


Keep in mind that buying breakouts from later-stage or late-stage breakouts is riskier. **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) breakout from a late-stage base is working so far, but the goal is to focus on early-stage breakouts, not late-stage ones.


Biotechs have been on a tear lately, and it was more of the same Tuesday as IBD's biotech group gained nearly 2%. **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) rose to the top of a six-month consolidation that shows a conventional entry at 167.95. Shares jumped nearly 3% to 166.59. Vertex owns a Composite Rating of 98 thanks in part to big earnings and sales growth in recent quarters.


Other leaders are testing support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout. IBD 50 name **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) is doing just that. It hasn't bounced off the support level yet, but it's also working on a flat base with a 74.90 entry.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, March U.S. crude oil futures settled at $64.47 a barrel, up 1.4%, as investors wagered that a U.S. weekly inventory report Wednesday will show the 10th straight weekly decline in crude stockpiles.

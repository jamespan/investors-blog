Stock Indexes Lose Ground; Volume, Though, Declines
====================================================

Stocks chugged south Friday, but trade slowed in the first session after the market uptrend was confirmed.


The Nasdaq closed with a 0.7% loss after being down as much as 1.2%. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The IBD 50 eased 0.5%.


Volume fell across the board.


While longs never welcome a down day, this one wasn't all bad. Losses thinned, and the indexes avoided distribution.


Distribution involves a significant loss in rising volume, which points to institutional selling. A distribution day soon in a new uptrend is often a bad sign.


The market passed that first test and is set to take a fresh crack at follow-up gains Monday.


On Friday, **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) broke out past a 78.44 buy point in busy volume. The stock is still in the 5% buy zone.


Lighting manufacturer **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) also broke out, gapping up 7% in huge volume.


Overall, the week provided the most breakouts among top-rated stocks since late November. Breakouts included **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and, from a three-weeks-tight pattern, **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)).


Two breakouts — **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) — came from a group attempting to recover. The homebuilder group has been a strong performer since the market's mid-December low. Homebuilders are up 12% vs. 3% to 4% for the major indexes over that nearly four-week period.


The group, though, was a laggard in 2013 and performed in line with indexes last year.


Could 2015 be the year for a strong homebuilders rally?


The best way to answer that question is to not answer it. Let the market provide the answer. If you open a half position in a homebuilder breakout, the stock's action will tell you whether to put more cash in it or sell it.


Three words should guide your action: Is it working?


Another way to play housing is building suppliers. This group, which includes Acuity Brands, is highly rated. Wood and building materials supplier **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)) recently retook a 38.09 entry in fast trade. The stock, which is somewhat thinly traded, remains in the 5% buy zone.


In economic news, payrolls for December edged above the consensus view, and the jobless rate fell a tick more than expected.


The coming week marks the official start of the fourth-quarter earnings season, which could help define success or failure for the new uptrend.

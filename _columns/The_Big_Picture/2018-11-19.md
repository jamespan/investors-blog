Stock News Today: Software, FAANG Stocks Throttled As Nasdaq Dives 3%
======================================================================

So much for a quiet week of trading ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Nasdaq composite took another hit in the stock market Monday, with software stocks bearing the brunt of the selling. In stock news today, it wasn't a good session for the [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/), either, as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) ended with losses of more than 5% each.




The Nasdaq ended with a loss of 3%; the Russell 2000 small-cap index slumped 2%; the S&P 500 gave back 1.7% and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.6%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Friday, although it was a close call on the Nasdaq. It's expected to be a low-volume week for the market because of the Thanksgiving holiday.


Curiously, it wasn't a fearful market because the CBOE put/call volume ratio registered a tame reading of 0.94. Readings of 1.15 or above signify excessive fear and have been seen at market bottoms in the past.


It was also quiet in the bond market Monday as the 10-year Treasury yield eased 1 basis point to 3.05%.


Stock News Today: Software Stocks Nailed
----------------------------------------


Of the 10 worst-performing groups in the stock market Monday, eight hailed from the software sector. Enterprise software stocks were particularly hit hard, but the group has been acting weak for a while now. After a break of the 50-day moving average in early October, the group has struggled to attract meaningful buying interest (you can view industry group charts with [MarketSmith](https://www.marketsmith.com)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MP-1-2-111918b-188x300.jpg)In stock news today, **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), one of the better performing enterprise software stocks in recent weeks, slumped below its 50-day moving average, falling nearly 14%. Meanwhile, in other stock news today, former leader **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), fell further below its 200-day moving average. Shares dropped nearly 9% as it flirts with a break of the 120 level.


Underlying Market Health
------------------------


For the bulls, it's hard to find comfort in the technical pictures of the major stock indexes. The Nasdaq is flirting with a break below the 7,000 level. The Dow and S&P 500 are back below their 200-day moving averages.


Technically, the stock market rally that was confirmed by the Nasdaq on Nov. 7 with a follow-through day is still intact. That's because the index continues to hold above its Oct. 29 intraday low. But clearly, the uptrend is under a lot of pressure


The good news is that the harshness of the recent selling should be enough to eventually usher in new market leadership. That means it's important to monitor growth screens like theÂ [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) for new leaders.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is still holding support at its 50-day moving average as it works on a cup-with-handle base with a 357.68 entry.


Stock News Today: Growth Stocks Slammed
---------------------------------------


In the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) today, top-rated growth stocks lagged badly. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped about 5%. But the news wasn't all bad in the IBD 50. Small cap biotech **Innoviva** ([INVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVA)) ended at 16.48, up 0.9% as it works on a cup-with-handle base with a 16.94 entry.


Elsewhere, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) showed relative strength early as the stock cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 357.68 buy point. But a 3.5% intraday gain for Tesla faded to a loss of 0.2% by the close.


In other stock market news today, **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) reported earnings after the close. Shares fell 4% ahead of the results, but the retailer rallied 5% in after-hours trading. The stock got turned away recently at its converged 50- and 200-day moving averages. Like many other retailers, it's been struggling to attract buying interest.


Wall Street will get an avalanche of retail earnings reports Tuesday morning. Results are due from **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)), **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) and **TJX Companies** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)).

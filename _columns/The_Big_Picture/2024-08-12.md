Volatility in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)? Way down compared with last week. Small caps? Also down, but not as much as in recent days. But given the current environment for investors, a dull session can still show merits.




If declines in both the major stock market barometers and in highly rated growth stocks get smaller as the month progresses, it could signal that the most bearish and most fearful investors are getting exhausted.


Nonetheless, investors will also want to see evidence that the big boys and girls of the stock market are truly hungering for equities. And when that occurs, [excellent breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from proper bases will emerge.


Overall, the indexes' moves on Monday showed quite a mix of colors, sort of like a jar of Jelly Belly. While the Nasdaq composite drifted 0.2% higher, the S&P 500 finished virtually flat. At 5,344.39, it rose a measly 0.23 of a point, well below 0.1%. The S&P 500 ended the session with a gain of 12% year to date, which is still decent.


But the Russell 2000, which marked a 1.3% drop last week, lopped off another 0.9%. The Russell, at 2062, has seen its advance since Jan. 1 dwindle to less than 2%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP081224-229x300.jpg)Midcaps joined the weak side of the stock market. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) sank 0.6%. That virtually matched the decline seen in the Dow Jones transportation average.


Lately, more attention has gotten paid to the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility). Last week, the VIX soared to as high as 65.73 before nose-diving the same day and over the next four sessions. On Monday, the VIX made a meek move, up 1% to 20.71. Yet, the 65.73 intraday reading on Aug. 5 hit the highest level since the 2020 Covid-19 bear market. (You can see a historical chart of the [VIX on MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) by punching in "zero-VIX.")


Overall, investors can witness a rise in investor pessimism.


The weekly Investors Intelligence survey of pundits showed bullishness plunge to 46.9% last week. That's way down from a 2024 peak of 64.2%. The bears ratio rose to 18.7%, however, which is not at all an extreme level.


For instance, when the stock market showed a bullish turn with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on Nov. 1, 2023, by the Nasdaq, the bears ratio had climbed to 25.7% during the Week of Oct. 30, 2023, vs. 18% in July the same year.


Elsewhere, CNN's Fear And Greed Index on Monday edged up to 24, still in the zone of "Extreme Fear," on a scale of zero to 100.

What The Charts Say
-------------------


In terms of chart-related technicals, however, virtually all of the key stock market benchmarks look uniformly weak. Hence, it makes 100% sense to remain conservative with new buys.


Looking at the [Leaderboard model stock portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), if you excluded the longest and largest holding, total long exposure among recently added stock market leaders is truly limited to around 20% to 25%.


Could we expect more activity in the second full week of trading in August? Absolutely.


Tuesday, wholesale inflation numbers take center stage before the stock market opens. [According to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), producer level prices are seen rising 0.2% in July vs. June and increasing 2.6% year over year. But core prices, excluding volatile food and energy products, are still seen going up 3% vs. a year ago. That's above the Federal Reserve's comfort level of 2%.


The U.S. consumer price index follows right behind on Wednesday. Traders then greet monthly data on retail sales on Thursday.


Outside The Stock Market: Less Bearish Tone
-------------------------------------------


Commodities enjoyed a banner session.


Gold futures gained more than 1.5% to $2,511 per ounce. Indeed, 2024 has been a sparkling year for the precious metal. Silver has continued to back off its year-to-date peak of $32.75 an ounce, yet on Monday it rallied 1.6% to $28.03.


Even copper futures got into a bullish mood. According to Thinkorswim, futures of the metal said to have a Ph.D. in economics raced 2% higher to $4.07 a pound, up nearly 5% for the year.


Meanwhile, crude oil futures on the NYMEX rose 4.2% to $80.06 per barrel. That marked a three-week high.


Crude's heavy gains made a splash in the stock market as well.


Looking at the [industry groups tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), indeed, energy occupied a lot of space near the top. Early data showed at least six oil and gas related industries rising 1% or more. Gold and silver mining jumped 3.7%, the second strongest increase among 197 industries. Solar energy ramped up 1.1%.

On The Upside And Downside
--------------------------


At the individual stock level, **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) deserves close monitoring. The team-oriented business software expert blasted 14.8% higher in massive volume on Monday after reporting stellar results. Shares cleared a choppy consolidation near 250. Only five sessions earlier, Monday.com found itself testing vital support at the long-term 200-day moving average.


As noted in [Monday's IBD Live episode](https://get.investors.com/ibd-live/?src=A00616), the company has gained momentum in growing large contracts. It saw big leaps in the number of clients with an annual recurring revenue (ARR) contract value of $50,000 or more as well as $100,000 or more.


Monday.com is a "serial gapper," an expression coined by David Ryan, three-time winner of the U.S. Investing Championships and special guest on IBD Live every Tuesday. Put another way, the stock makes huge moves, both up or down, right after quarterly results. Such volatility makes the stock extra difficult to trade.

When Bottom Fishing Can Cause Bleeding
--------------------------------------


**JetBlue** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)), however, plunged more than 20% to 4.80, a seven-month low. Volume grew more than sevenfold to the highest level in more than a year. The airline announced plans to raise up to $400 million in convertible debt. That's a huge offering when you consider the potential dilutive nature of the plan. As on Monday, JetBlue's market value totaled $1.66 billion.


**ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) dropped hard again, despite reversing bullishly on Aug. 5 and reclaiming its 200-day moving average. The rebound, however, stopped short of a close back above the 50-day line.


Last week, the disruptive innovator within the cosmetics industry reported a surprise flat fiscal first quarter earnings at $1.10 per share, despite a 50% leap in sales to $324.5 million. A year ago, earnings soared 182%, making for an incredibly tough comparison for this year's quarter.


The stock's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) of 53 reflects the stock's diminished luster. Just four weeks ago, it was sparking at 96. But the [technical panel on ELF's MarketSurge chart](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) also highlights a poor three-month RS Rating of 14 and a six-month rating of 19.

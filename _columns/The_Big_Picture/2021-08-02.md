Major equity indexes got off to a cheery start to August but ended flat-footed. The reversal, however, did little to hurt an uptrend in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).




You'd like to see the top benchmarks keep their early-session gains, rather than drop them like a disastrous Olympic relay baton pass. But Monday's losses overall did not point to heavy institutional selling.


The Nasdaq gave up nearly all of a 0.7% morning advance to finish up less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 rallied 0.6% in less than 10 minutes of trading, then reversed course the rest of the day.


The S&P 500's loss of less than 0.2% came amid lower NYSE turnover, so the S&P 500 avoided [a distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Nasdaq volume picked up 3% vs. Friday. Yet the premier index for growth companies had not scored a meaningful gain in recent sessions; hence, Monday's action also fell short of [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/).


![MP080221](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP080221-226x300.jpg)While the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average got knocked back for a relatively gentle 0.3% decline, iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fell 0.5%; the popular small-cap gauge has now eased more than 4% since July 1.


Stock Market Today: U.S. Treasuries Impact Stocks
-------------------------------------------------


Monday's stock action seemed to come more in reaction to what was happening outside the stock exchanges.


A slight deceleration in U.S. factories last month suggested that the economy hasn't yet fully gotten its footing. The ISM survey for July came in at 59.5. That's still a robust reading. Yet it still missed the [Econoday view](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 60.8. It also declined from a hot 60.6 reading in June. Any figure above 50 denotes expanding factory activity.


Amid this news, institutions rushed back into the safe haven of long-dated U.S. Treasuries. As prices jumped, the yield on these securities tanked. [Cboe data](https://www.cboe.com/delayed_quotes/tnx) showed the benchmark 10-year bond yield fell to as low as 1.15%. Even at the day's close of 1.17%, it etched the lowest level since Feb. 11.


Painfully low interest rates force large fund managers to hunt elsewhere for income. Dividend-paying utilities appeared to benefit. The SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) gained 0.7%, buffing up its quarter-to-date gain to 5%.


Beyond Nasdaq: Oil, Steel Cool Off
----------------------------------


A fast slide in oil futures did no favors for oil and gas stocks. And metals plays seemed to fall in sympathy as West Texas Intermediate crude oil sank 3.6% to $71.32 a barrel, according to Oilprice.com.



**ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)) suffered its biggest drop in more than two weeks. Down nearly 3.4% on Monday, the steel giant is now tickling the top of a nearly eight-week base with a 34.06 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Volume was slightly below average.


Industry mate **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) took a break. Shares fell 1.9%, snapping a nine-session rally. Since peaking at 110.97 on June 1, Nucor has corrected long enough in time to construct a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


The U.S. Copper Index Fund ([CPER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPER)) notched its fourth drop in five sessions, backtracking 0.9%. It now faces a test of buying support at the 50-day moving average.


In general, 2021 has already had its fair share rocky declines. Yet, at least for the Nasdaq composite, we've only seen one true correction that surpassed 10% from a 52-week or all-time high.


Look at a large daily chart of the Nasdaq, and you can still trace a series of higher highs and higher lows. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, has closed every session, except one, above its 50-day line since May 24. The S&P 500 has more or less acted just as bullishly.

Picking Up Speed
----------------


Over the past three months, at least 25 industry groups have achieved price-weighted gains of 10% or more. And the variety of industries doing this well indicates that more than one sector of the economy can plow through the challenges that a new, even more contagious strain of Covid-19 present to the U.S. and abroad.


Just four industry groups — coal, department stores, dairy products and fabless semiconductor — hold gains exceeding 20% since early May. Shoe, consumer loan, desktop software and diversified medical stocks have also led the upside with three-month gains of 15% to 19%, according to MarketSmith.


Other large industries sporting double-digit gains over the past three months include enterprise software, security software, computer networking and medical systems and equipment.

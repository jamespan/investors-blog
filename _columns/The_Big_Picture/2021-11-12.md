  Stock Market Extends Rebound, But Was Shakeout Enough To Resume Advance?

Indexes rose into the close Friday, a bullish capstone for a week that saw the stock market briefly cool its advance. But now the question is, did the market's pause wring out enough excess?




The Nasdaq composite led with a 1% rally as technology shares sparkled. The Technology Select Sector SPDR rose 1.2%, and internet-heavy Communications Services Select Sector SPDR ([XLC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLC)) added 1.5%.


Semiconductor stocks were a hot spot. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 0.8% and climbed more than 1% for the week.


The S&P 500 rose 0.7% Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared higher on the NYSE.

Yet, the stock market's recovery healed much of the week's earlier damage, and a prolonged slump now seems less likely. The past week's moderate contraction served as a healthy shakeout, after the major indexes raced to record highs.


Now that the pause has happened, where does the stock market go next? Was the Nasdaq's 3.2% stumble from its all-time peak enough to reset the market and resume an already terrific 2021 advance?


While there's no clear answer, there are reasons to believe the stock market is still a bit frothy. The Nasdaq is still 5% above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 is 4.2% above its own 50-day line.


The Cboe Market Volatility Index, or VIX for short, suggests a complacent stock market. The index poked above its 50-day moving average Wednesday, but is trending back toward the year's lows. It slipped below the 10-day average Friday.


If the stock market is no obstacle to investing, finding suitable opportunities is. Relatively few leading stocks are in buy zones, most of them already extended from buy points. In the [IBD 50, opportunities are few](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/inside-ibd-50-a-white-knuckle-week-leaves-some-growth-stocks-in-bases-buy-ranges/). Many are volatile.


That's not necessarily a bad thing from a portfolio management viewpoint, because so many of the earlier breakouts are working just fine. [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s screen of recent breakouts lists more than 50 stocks, and few are real flops.


Small caps, which tend to follow growth stocks, lagged Friday. The Russell 2000 edged up 0.1%. The index broke a four-week win streak, although the long-term picture looks favorable.



The Russell 2000 this month climbed above resistance around 2350, a ceiling that's persisted since March. Prolonged consolidations often set up big gains in stocks and indexes. The Russell found support at its 200-day moving average in the final months of its consolidation, and the 50-day average is now pointing north. Those factors add up to a bullish outlook.


Only a few stocks broke out Friday. **Seagate Technology** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)) surged past the 106.32 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). But the disk drive maker's shares whittled down an 11% surge to just 2.7% at the close.

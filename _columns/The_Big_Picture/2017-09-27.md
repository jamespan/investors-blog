More than 10 months ago, U.S. stocks revved into high gear and IBD's outlook for the market upshifted from an "uptrend under pressure" to "uptrend resumes." The reason? Donald Trump's election victory and the sudden prospects of new tax cuts to bolster the economy.




On Wednesday, those hopes got re-energized. Growth stocks and small caps thrust ahead and defensive names bit their dust. Volume grew on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


A healthy rise in higher turnover is exactly what you want to see, unless you're a market bear and are hoping and wishing for the historic bull run to end.


The Nasdaq composite led the major indexes with a gain of 1.1%, its biggest advance in nearly four weeks. Strength in semiconductor equipment, software, beaten down fiber optical networking gear and data storage stocks helped the cause. At session highs, the gain reached 1.4%. That stretched the Nasdaq's year-to-date lead over the S&P 500, which managed to rise just 0.4% but hit an all-time high. The Nasdaq is now up 19.9% since Jan. 1, the 500 up 12%. The Dow industrials added 0.3%.

The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 2% and eclipsed the 900 level for the first time. A proposal by President Trump to slash the maximum corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% is likely to especially benefit smaller companies, which tend to see more of their revenue coming in domestically. Large multinationals, in contrast, have capitalized on lower tax rates in foreign countries.


The Russell 2000 gained 1.9%. At 1484, it's expanded the year-to-date gain to 9.4%, narrowing the gap with the S&P 500, which is now up 12% since Jan. 1.


The Nasdaq got a big boost not just from big-cap techs. Small and midsize lenders also make up a significant weighting within the market-cap-driven Nasdaq composite. Gains by the likes of **Zions Bancorp** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)) of Utah, **East West Bancorp** ([EWBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWBC)) of Pasadena, Calif., and thinly traded **Green Bancorp** ([GNBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNBC)) of Houston are part of the reason why the breadth of the rally on the Nasdaq was superior vs. the NYSE.


Another reason? Utilities, food, soap, gold mining and other defensive stocks tanked, weighing on indexes such as the S&P 500 and the NYSE Composite (up a paltry 0.2% on Wednesday).


On the Nasdaq, winners led losers by a nearly 3-1 ratio. On the NYSE the ratio was roughly 4-to-3.


East West Bancorp, which sports a solid 91 Composite Rating at [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-east-west-bancorp-inc-ewbc.aspx), has retaken its 50-day moving average and is carving out the right side of a shallow new base. Zions is trying to climb past the 45.56 entry in a six-month saucer-with-handle base.


Tax cuts made a huge difference during the two-term presidency of Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1988. The U.S. economy had suffered nearly a decade of torrid inflation and a stagnant economy. Back then, the media and experts called it "stagflation."


Today, it's hardly the case. The latest Q2 GDP report indicates that the economy is picking up some steam in America. Manufacturing is expanding across the U.S., yet the Federal Reserve's favorite gauges of prices imply an annual inflation that's below 2% a year. The unemployment rate is at historic lows already.


Back in the early 1980s, mortgage rates were in the high teens. Today, interest rates are still near multidecade lows.


Still, the prospects of further economic growth give new companies and leading firms in new markets the chance to prosper. The possibility of further strong increases in both the top and bottom lines and the decent number of recent new issues mean that a savvy growth investor will continue to have chances to buy excellent stocks when they break out of well-formed bases and hit new high ground.

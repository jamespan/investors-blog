The stock market squeezed out a modest daily gain Friday but still suffered a losing start to 2024. Now big bank earnings and new inflation data loom large.




Major indexes saw a nine-week win streak come to an end. The Nasdaq composite ended Friday up 0.1% but remains slightly below the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The tech-heavy index closed the shortened trading week down 3.3%.


The benchmark S&P 500 looks to be finding support at its 21-day line after ending Friday up 0.2%. Its loss of about 1.5% for the week was the worst performance after a weekly winning streak of at least nine weeks since 1963.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed higher late to close up 0.1%. Its weekly dip was lightest out of the three major indexes on the stock market as it fell 0.6%. **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) was the top performer here while **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) lagged.


Rough Week For Magnificent Seven
--------------------------------


There were slightly more advancers than decliners Friday on the New York Stock Exchange but decliners held the edge on the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP010524.jpg)Small caps closed off lows but the Russell 2000 still fell 0.3%. Growth stocks fared better though, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 0.4%.


One key area of strength in 2023 was the so-called Magnificent Seven, but all ended the week lower. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) struggled most with a 5.9% dip while **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) lagged with chastening weekly declines of more than 4% each.


Despite what is so far a modest pullback, the stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend. But keep on top of any sell signals within your portfolio, including triggers of the 20%-25% profit-taking rule.


Inflation Data, Bank Earnings Loom
----------------------------------


Friday's jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls had grown by 216,000 in December, well above Econoday views for 164,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate held at 3.7% rather than rising to 3.8% as expected, while hourly earnings rose 4.1% on the previous year, slightly above expectations.


This may not be the last word on the matter though, as the Labor Department also revised the job totals for November and October lower.


Additionally, the Institute for Supply Management's survey, a reading of business conditions at service-oriented firms, dropped to 50.6% in December from 52.7% the prior month. This latest figure was a seven-month low.


Inflation remains a key data point to watch as stock market investors bet on interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. The latest Consumer Price Index reading is due Thursday. Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 3.8% year over year. Additionally, Producer Price Index data is set to be released Friday.


Traders also will be keeping a close eye on a [slew of big bank earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-jpmoran-wells-fargo-headline-busy-week-financial-earnings/) which are set to drop. **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) are all on deck Friday. These could provide crucial insight into the health of the economy.

  Stocks Today Cool Off In Broad Reversal But This Asset Class Falls Harder; Will These Breakouts Go Bust?

For careful observers of the market, the move in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) was no doubt notable and interesting. A decent early start melted into mild losses Wednesday. Volume ended mixed. Some breakouts continued to flourish. Others floundered.




Yet the most intriguing action on Wednesday had less to do with stocks today and more with the tradable asset known fondly by some as "black gold." And in 2023, this asset class surely has lost its luster.


An initial pop higher of almost 0.7% by the Nasdaq composite withered to a nearly 0.6% decline by the close. For the bulls, disappointing for sure.


Yet that hardly compares with the 4.2% slide in near-expiration light sweet crude oil futures on the Nymex, comprising one of oil's worst days this year. At $69.25 a barrel, this means oil has now fallen to its lowest close since June 28, and is down 14% for the year.


Natural gas futures, meanwhile, have collapsed.


At $2.57 per million BTUs, gas futures have plunged 74% from their August 2022 peak just above $10.

Sell-Off In Oil
---------------



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP120623-208x300.jpg)Go to a weekly chart of the popular ETF, U.S. Oil Fund ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)), a proxy for crude oil futures, and you can witness a 30% slump from its June 2022 peak. Translation: Oil is in a bear market.


The slip in crude futures appeared to overshadow a piece of good news on the economic front — namely a cooling of the hot jobs market. The latest ADP survey showed 103,000 net new jobs created in November in the private sector, below expectations for a gain of 123,000, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Meanwhile, unit labor costs fell by an annualized rate of 1.2% in the third quarter, lower than the initial figure of -0.8%.


The more important non-farm U.S. payrolls report arrives early Friday. Still, the ADP data seemed to encourage confidence among investors that the Federal Reserve is not only finished with its monetary tightening campaign that started in March 2022, but that the central bank may also see a need to trim short-term interest rates next year to prevent a hard landing in the economy.


On Wednesday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond sank 5 basis points to 4.12%, the lowest close since Aug. 10, Cboe data showed. When bond prices rise, the yield (or return on interest payments) drops. The 10-year note's yield has now fallen in six of the past eight sessions.


Does the drop in crude oil mean we're headed for a serious recession? Not necessarily, even if some market pundits have expressed that thought. Like stocks today, commodities reflect a balance — or imbalance — of supply vs. demand. And thanks in large part to increasing production of both oil and natural gas by the United States, oil inventories in the U.S. have been climbing.


Lower oil translates into lower inflation in many price gauges. That's good for the economy as well as for the stock market. Investors always like to get reminded, after all, that consumer spending makes up nearly two thirds of U.S. GDP.


But don't forget business investment as well. Corporations also benefit from lower input costs.


Find The Right Entry
--------------------


Airlines, in fact, deserve attention as being one of the best performers in stocks today. **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)) led the upside, rallying 2.7% in volume that jumped 98% above the stock's 50-day moving average. More than 1 million shares exchanged hands as the stock gapped up at the open and closed almost at session highs.



At 124.12, the Irish discount airline giant has now lifted 10% from a [traditional buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 112.75 in a [four-month cuplike pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Ryanair's 28% move higher after it cleared a trendline entry near 96.50 might make investors feel like they want to kiss the nearest shamrock.


Such a move, however, for those who bought correctly is not predicated on luck. Before Ryanair's breakout, the stock showed excellent fundamentals. Earnings soared 51% in the third quarter to $7 a share on a 32% revenue bump up to $5.21 billion. The stock's relative strength line had already punched into new high ground since the base began forming, before RYAAY stock surpassed the 112.75 buy point.


The stock's 80 [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) and 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) also indicate its leadership status in stocks today.

Also In Stocks Today
--------------------


Strength in additional industry groups, ranging from drugstore chains and specialty retailers to mobile building and RV manufacturers, leisure products and medical software, helped cushion the overall blow for equities. The S&P 500 closed Wednesday off 0.4%, but turnover on the New York Stock Exchange jumped nearly 9% to 4.25 billion shares.


This meant that the S&P 500 got saddled with its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) over the trailing 25 trading sessions. Meanwhile, Nasdaq volume eased.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.2% lower, matching the Russell 2000. Disappointingly, the Russell squandered an early gain of almost 1.8%.


A confirmed uptrend can remain in place so long as these bouts of intense professional selling stay sporadic in frequency. In contrast, a flurry of distribution days, especially heavy declines, can derail a rally.


That does not seem to be the case for now. But indeed, after fantastic gains in November, it's totally reasonable to expect both major indexes and key leading stocks to take a break.


The Nasdaq, which currently has two mild distribution days on its own count, clearly is experiencing selling resistance near 14,500. That level coincides with a 14,446 peak seen in July. At the same time, as noted by [Market School rules](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/market/marketschool), the power trend remains fully in place.


When both major indexes and leading stocks trade neatly above their respective [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), they give individual investors a bullish signal to look for good entries in high-quality growth stocks. Big-volume moves past the correct buy point in [well-built bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/), pullbacks to the top of bases, and [trendline entries](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trendlines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) all give a higher probability of making money immediately.

Sell Rules Triggered In A Few Stocks Today
------------------------------------------


That said, earnings reports and vertical-like upward moves in some stocks can still lead to sharp reversals and expectation breakers.



**MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), the database software platform, and drone pioneer **AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)) offered two good examples on Wednesday.


The former dropped 10.7% in massive volume despite issuing solid fiscal third-quarter results, with per-share earnings up 317% and revenue 30% higher vs. year-ago levels. MDB stock gave back mild gains from a 412.67 buy point in a choppy, and thus flawed, [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).



AVAV has scored a much better move in recent months. But after the small cap delivered a 26% gain after clearing a base at 112.39 in early September, shares got trampled on Wednesday. The action serves as a great reminder to take at least partial profits in most of your winners — especially when the gain hits 20% to 25%.


Other stocks that need to be watched closely include private equity investor **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)), which reversed sharply for a 2.7% loss in heavy volume after trying to clear a cup without handle at 116.78.


Salvaged vehicle auctioneer **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)), often a mainstay in the MarketSmith Growth 250, has done a nearly complete round trip of mild gains after driving past a 47.05 early buy point in a [four-month consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).

  Nasdaq Rocked By Google Stock's Major Sell-Off; New House Speaker Johnson's Election Fails To Motivate Bulls

The Nasdaq suffered another sharp decline on Wednesday and made history in at least one way. Namely, one of its biggest companies, digital ad and video titan **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), led the sell-off with what was decidedly its worst bloodletting in market value — around $166 billion — for a single session in the stock's 19-year history.




While the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.4%, the S&P 500 sank 1.4% to 4186. That trimmed the large-cap benchmark's year-to-date gain to 9%.


The Nasdaq composite, at 12,821, is now down for the fourth quarter. It's also coming close to a key test of institutional support at the long-term 200-day moving average, which rose to 12,767 on Wednesday.


As a daily chart shows, the 200-day line has been rising quite nicely since early June, a few months after a follow-through day took place on March 29, the 13th day of a rally attempt back then.



The Nasdaq composite still holds an impressive advance of 22.5% since the start of 2023. But as has been noted frequently in this column and on [IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), the "Magnificent Seven" megacap tech issues have mostly driven that unusual performance.


The election of Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson as the new speaker of the House of Representatives failed to halt heavy selling in stocks. After the news hit the wires around 1:55 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq gained less than 50 points, then resumed its slide in the final 20 minutes of the regular session.

Nasdaq Equal-Weighted Indexes Banged Up Too
-------------------------------------------


Please take a look at Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)). The exchange traded fund, down 2.3% on Wednesday, marked its fifth decline in six sessions and has cleanly sliced through its 200-day moving average. At 71.57, QQQE is now up just 12.1% year to date. At one point, QQQE had boasted a 27% rise since Jan. 1.



First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) fund fell 2.3% as well and is sharply below its own [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%. Gains by three of its 30 components, including **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and insurance play **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), helped blunt the decline.


Meanwhile, the Russell 2000, off 1.7% to close at 1651 on Wednesday, now holds a 6.2% loss since Jan. 1. In 2022, the popular small-cap index slid 21.6% during one of the meanest bear markets since the start of the millennium.


Given the bad day for small caps, no wonder the market internals looked sick on Wednesday as well.


Early data showed losing stocks outdistancing gainers by more than a 5-2 margin on the Nasdaq and 3-1 on the NYSE. (See the official numbers for both Nasdaq and NYSE-listed stocks on the General Market Indicators link below.)


Volume edged lower on the Nasdaq but grew a touch on the NYSE.


Bullish investors really had no place to hide, at least in equities.


Key Economic Data Rolls In Thursday, Friday
-------------------------------------------


Investors need to keep an eye not just on quarterly results from major companies for the rest of the week and next week. New data on the U.S. economy arrives Thursday, including a forecast for 1% month-on-month growth in U.S. durable goods orders for September. Plus, a revised Q3 GDP forecast for 4.2% quarter-on-quarter growth is noted by [Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), up from a prior reading of a 2.1% annualized growth rate.


Friday, watch out for the latest monthly data on personal consumption expenditures and the PCE inflation index, a favorite of the Federal Reserve.


Econoday currently shows a consensus estimate for the PCE price index to rise 0.3% on a monthly basis in September, down from a 0.4% rise in August, and up 3.4% year over year vs. 3.5% growth in August.


Core PCE is seen accelerating 0.3% month on month vs. a 0.1% rise in August, but slowing to 3.7% growth year over year compared to a 3.9% lift in August.

Beyond Nasdaq
-------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP102523-232x300.jpg)The Dow Jones transportation average slumped 2.4%; that extended its drop from a July 31 peak of 16,717 to nearly 17%. Utilities gained ground, even as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond jumped 11 basis points to 4.95%. However, Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) has so far made only a modest bounce from an Oct. 6 low of 54.77. XLU is still nursing a 16% decline year to date.


[According to the latest IBD stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-oct-25-2023/), Utility ranks a lowly 31st among 33 broad industry sectors in terms of mid- and long-term price performance. The sector is also down 18% since Jan. 1. Through Wednesday's close, now only six of the 33 sectors host a year-to-date gain of 15% or more: Computer, Chips, Internet, Software, Building and Leisure.


Bitcoin continued to roar higher. It rose 3% to $34,666.


Has The Bear Returned To The Stock Market?
------------------------------------------


The broad fall by the Nasdaq and other equity indexes may lead IBD readers to ponder this question: Are U.S. stocks back in a bear market, or is it still a somewhat milder correction within a new bull run?


Before attempting to answer that one, let's discuss the outsize influence that the third largest company on the Nasdaq in terms of market value — nearly 7% — had on Wednesday's weak session.


Alphabet upset investors after its [cloud-computing revenue in the third quarter missed views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-beat-shares-fall-as-cloud-computing-growth-misses/). By falling 9.5% to 125.61, the YouTube and Google search engine behemoth sank to its lowest close since July 25. Volume ballooned 227% higher than usual to 83.2 million shares, the third busiest day of trading in the stock so far this year.


As can be seen in the accompanying daily chart, Nasdaq-listed Alphabet had already come quite close on a couple of occasions to surrendering its mild gains since the breakout from a cup with handle 127.10 buy point.



Overall, earnings came in nicely at $1.56 a share, up 42% vs. a year ago. That's the second biggest bottom-line increase over the company's past eight quarters. However, as a megacap tech, the Mountain View, Calif., firm has simply not grown earnings and sales at the same pace as when it was a true market thoroughbred and went public in August 2004, nearly two decades ago.


Alphabet's sales have now grown at an average pace of 5.6% year over year in the past five quarters.

Cash Is Still A Position
------------------------


So, back to the above question: Are we back in a bear market?


One could certainly argue such a case. For starters, the Nasdaq has now fallen 21% from its all-time peak of 16,212, set on Nov. 22, 2021. Most market observers would agree that a drop of at least 20% from a 52-week or all-time high would qualify. There was a bull phase earlier this year, though.


Two, the pool of fast-growing companies with the potential to break out to new highs has dried up to the size of a puddle.


[A MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) reveals that currently the 10-day moving average of Nasdaq-listed stocks rising to new highs is at 26. That's less than a tenth of the 10-day moving average of 310 stocks issuing new lows. (MarketSmith subscribers can track this daily by punching in "NASDQ" on a daily chart.) This likely marks the widest gap since October of last year. And on the NYSE? The ratio is 24 new highs vs. 185 new lows, as seen on the "NYEXG" chart.


Three, the action since July has traced a series of lower highs and lower lows on the Nasdaq and other key indexes. This is not the type of market condition that breeds strong moves by even the top stocks. Those who tried to buy on the dips have likely lost money.


Finally, there's the difficulty investors have had in making any progress since IBD noted a [Nasdaq follow-through day on Oct. 6](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-surge-despite-hot-jobs-report-triggers-this-fed-minutes-jerome-powell-inflation-data-looms/). At the time, the suggested allocation to stocks rose to a range of 20%-40% from 0% to 20%. However, just five trading days later, the outlook quickly got downgraded to "uptrend under pressure" with the recommended allocation reverting back to 0%-20%. And on Oct. 20, with distribution days piling up, the outlook got downgraded yet again to a market in correction.


Defensive Stocks Rise
---------------------


[Among IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), only 11 rose 1% or more. And most come from defensive areas of the stock market. Food industries made up four of those 11 groups. They also included oil and gas royalty trusts, education services, super and mini market retailing, and pollution control.


A stronger than expected rise in September new home sales (759,000 on an annualized rate vs. the Econoday consensus view of 685,000) helped lift IBD's homebuilding industry up 0.9%. Due to strong performance in the first six months of 2023, the industry group is still up 18% year to date.

  Stock Market Falls On Trump, China News; Indexes Close Off Lows

The stock market stumbled Thursday on news of the [President Trump impeachment](https://www.investors.com/news/why-dow-jones-shrugs-off-trump-impeachment/) investigation. Before the stock market's open, the House Intelligence Committee released the whistleblower complaint against the president. Meanwhile, [U.S.-China trade optimism](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/chinas-top-diplomat-says-beijing-willing-to-buy-more-u-s-products-idUSKBN1WB2RC?il=0) sparked a brief rally in afternoon trade that tapered off into the close.




The Dow Jones industrials closed with a loss of 0.3%, or 79 points, while the Nasdaq suffered the worst loss of the three major stock indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.6%. At the lows, the composite slid more than 1% before rebounding.


The S&P 500 ended the day with a 0.2% decline after it too pared losses. Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 closed with a 1.1% loss. Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's trade.


The recent news-driven volatility is typical of a stock market under pressure. On Tuesday, IBD's stock market outlook [was downgraded](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-today-see-downgrade-for-2nd-time-in-a-month-what-to-do-now/) for the second time in a month after the Nasdaq fell 1.5% on impeachment proceedings. On Wednesday, it reversed from early losses to rally more than 1% on [positive China trade news](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-shrugs-off-ukraine-impeachment-inquiry/). Thursday's headlines sent the indexes tumbling before coming off the day's lows.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP_4x4_092619-248x300.jpg)Despite the current volatility, the major indexes appear to be trying to hold their 50-day moving average lines. The Nasdaq closed just below that level, while the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 are above their 50-day averages.


With a stock market under pressure, investors should be playing more defense than usual. That means cutting losses sooner than usual (4% or 5% instead of a normal [7%-8% loss](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/)) and certainly no use of [margin](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-margin-trading/). Taking some profits makes sense, too.


IBD 50 Holds Up; Adobe Traces A New Base
----------------------------------------


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) edged 0.15% higher, handily outperforming the major stock indexes thanks to strength in software leader **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and top retail stock **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)).


Adobe stock gained 2.3% and is tracing a new buy point at 313.21, as a result of a flat base. Shares are rallying from their long-term 40-week moving average.


Boot Barn is approaching a 37.72 buy point in a cup with handle after a 1.7% advance Thursday. Shares are about 4% away from the entry.



On the downside, Chinese stock leader **Huya** ([HUYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUYA)) and **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) declined 0.9% and 3.3%, respectively. Huya stock gave up its recent 26.48 buy point in a double-bottom base.


Meanwhile, SolarEdge is easing from this week's highs. Shares are about 7% off their 52-week high, but remain squarely above their 10-week moving average after finding support there Sept. 12.


Top Stocks To Watch: Apple, Microsoft, Teradyne
-----------------------------------------------



[Dow Jones stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/)**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) continue to show [significant relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) amid the stock market volatility. Apple shares fell 0.5%, while Microsoft edged higher. Both stocks tried to break out in recent sessions, but were turned away amid the weak action on the major stock indexes.


Apple stock is trading just below a [flat base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) 221.47 entry, while Microsoft is about 2% off a 141.78 buy point in a flat base of its own.



Meanwhile, chip stocks mostly continued to outperform the overall market. [IBD Leaderboard stock idea](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) is in the 5% buy zone after last week's breakout above a 58.71 buy point. The stock's RS line is at new highs, a positive sign. Shares fell 0.3%.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Teradyne boasts a 98 out of a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) helps investors easily measure the quality of a stock's fundamental and technical metrics.


Other chip stocks to watch include **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)). Applied Materials is trying to break out past a 52.52 buy point in a [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), while Taiwan Semiconductor is breaking out above a 44.98 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).

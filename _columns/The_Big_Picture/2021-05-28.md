The stock market capped a solid week with modest gains Friday, even as April personal income and spending data showed more inflation.




The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 3.1% from a year earlier. That's well above the Fed's preferred target of 2%, but the Fed has repeatedly said it expects inflation to be temporary. The bond market shrugged off the data. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to 1.58%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite edged up 0.1%, but it's still below its May 7 high of 13,828, a possible resistance area. The index showed stalling-type action Friday, but lower volume prevented a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/).


The composite ended with a weekly gain of 2.1%, helped in part by a strong showing from **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). After rising 5.3% the previous week, the chip designer soared another 8.4% the last week of May, helped by a bullish earnings report. The Nvidia position was increased on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Friday. The stock closed above a 648.67 buy point.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line had been trending lower since mid-February, but the line has started to trend upward thanks to improving breadth. Despite the Nasdaq's late fade Friday, advancing stocks had a slight edge over decliners. The NYSE still has better breadth, with winners over losers by more than 2-to-1.

![MP052821](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP052821-300x294.jpg)The S&P 500 added 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index eased 0.2%.


The stock market uptrend is still under pressure, with six [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 and four on the Nasdaq. But with the major stock indexes above their 50-day moving averages and near highs, it won't take much to put the stock market back in a confirmed uptrend. The market's tone has definitely improved in recent days, with better action in individual stocks across a variety of industry groups.


Market Movers
-------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.7% but notched a weekly gain of 3.4%, helped by strong performances from **Cricut** ([CRCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRCT)), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), among others.


Snap broke out over a trendline the past week, which corresponded with a move above the 60 level. Zscaler is holding gains after it gapped up Wednesday on strong earnings. But the 200 level remains potential resistance. CrowdStrike reports earnings Thursday and was featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/crowdstrike-stock-rallies-https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/crowdstrike-stock-rallies-off-lows-amid-bullish-growth-prospects/off-lows-amid-bullish-growth-prospects/) story.

The provider of shipping container leasing services broke out of cup base with a 31.83 buy point. Shares jumped nearly 9% to 33.70.

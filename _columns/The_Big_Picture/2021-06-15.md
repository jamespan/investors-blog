The stock market stumbled Tuesday as the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting kicked off. The Nasdaq composite remains within striking distance of all-time highs. Tech giants **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) approach new buy points, while **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) is a stock market leader.




Ahead of the open, investors received a dose of economic weakness, as [retail sales unexpectedly](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-tumble-in-may-dow-jones/) fell 1.3% in May.


Up next, the Federal Reserve concludes a policy meeting Wednesday. Investors will be focusing on the Fed's stance on rising prices. [Federal Reserve officials](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-could-pencil-in-earlier-rate-increase-at-meeting-11623663001) could signal this week that they anticipate raising interest rates sooner than previously expected following a spate of high inflation readings.


On Tuesday, the May producer price index rose 0.8% from the previous month, more than economists had forecast.


![MP061521_2-](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP061521_2--225x300.jpg)The Nasdaq underperformed, sliding 0.7% and ending near session lows. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrials lost 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.3% but remains just shy of record highs.


Leading growth stocks also lagged on Tuesday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 0.9%. No. 46 [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) edged up 0.3%, moving closer to a 126.51 buy point in a cup base. The stock was [Tuesday's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/entegris-eyes-new-buy-point-after-231-percent-run-amid-strong-demand/) pick.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be slightly lower on the NYSE compared with Monday's figures.


Retail was one of the weakest sectors after the May retail sales report came in weaker than expected. Sales fell 1.3% from the prior month, worse than the consensus estimate of a 0.5% decline. Excluding autos, retail sales fell 0.7%.

Stock Market Direction
----------------------


Despite Tuesday's moderate losses, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 are on the verge of hitting new highs. The S&P 500 reversed from new highs Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is searching for support around its 50-day moving average.


The health of the stock market uptrend took a slight hit Tuesday, as the Nasdaq added a new distribution day. The Nasdaq now has two distribution days, while the S&P 500's count fell to four. The S&P 500's May 10 distribution day dropped off the count due to time. On Monday, the [Nasdaq lost a distribution day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-shift-emerging-nasdaq-leads-sp500-hits-record-high/) thanks to index gains from that time.


With the [stock market sentiment](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) still positive, investors should continue to be on the lookout for buying opportunities. But stay disciplined. Keep new positions small until this hesitant market uptrend proves itself. Be sure to cut your losses short if the market stalls around its old highs, where it appears to be having some difficulty maintaining upward progress.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Apple, Microsoft
-----------------------------------------

On the downside, top steel producer **ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)) tumbled 3.7% in heavy volume Tuesday.

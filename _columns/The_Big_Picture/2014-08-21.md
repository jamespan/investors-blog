Stock Indexes Up But Still Looking For Escape Velocity
=======================================================

Stocks posted modest gains in mixed volume Thursday, as the S&P 500 struck an all-time high.

  

The Nasdaq edged up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 added 0.3%. The IBD 50 fell 0.5%.

  

Volume rose slightly on the NYSE but eased on the Nasdaq.

  

Action has been sleepy on the Nasdaq recently. On Thursday, volume on the Nasdaq fell for a fourth consecutive session. The index also has kept to a tight price range.

  

Part of the reason for the quiet action could be the Federal Reserve's three-day conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which began Thursday. Fed chief Janet Yellen will give the keynote speech Friday, and market watchers will be parsing it for meaning.

  

Meanwhile, a small group of top-rated stocks have been stirring.

  

Among stocks that broke out since the uptrend was confirmed Aug. 13, fuel-card provider **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) is up 11% from its buy point. It benefited from an announced acquisition.

  

**GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), an April initial public offering, also is up 11%, though the IPO's ride has been wild. The company provides an online food takeout service.

  

**Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) is up 11%, but its boost came at least partly from takeover attempts and rumors.

  

Other leaders that broke out in June or July — and that may have been held for lack of sell signals — also are progressing. From buy points, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is up 12% and chip designer **Tessera Technologies** ([TSRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSRA)) is up 25%.

  

Many other leaders are still in the 5% buy zone. While this can provide a buying opportunity, bulls don't want to see too many leaders loitering after a breakout.

  

Ideally, the bulls want a cushion that allows the stock to retreat now and then without threatening losses.

  

Right now, many breakouts are vulnerable if the indexes were to run into a few rough days.

  

The market has dodged distribution in the first few sessions after the follow-through day, which was the minimal goal. Now stocks have to achieve escape velocity without relying on buyouts or special situations.

  

Economic news was mostly upbeat Thursday. First-time jobless claims were less than the consensus figure. The Philadelphia Fed's August manufacturing survey was stronger than expected. Existing-home sales in July and leading indicators for July also topped views.

  

However, the HSBC/Markit Flash China manufacturing index fell to a three-month low in August.

  

The seven China-based stocks in Wednesday's IBD 50 lineup struggled. Three fell in heavy volume (see the Market Pulse above). The other four made timid moves in below-average volume.

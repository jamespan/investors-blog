As Fed Hike Looms, This Leading Industry Will Surprise You
===========================================================

U.S. stock indexes bounced off the lows of the day Friday to finish moderately up.


The Nasdaq tacked on 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.4%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and fell on the NYSE.

The bulls have had difficulty finding traction in recent sessions, and Friday's reaction to economic news had to be a disappointment.


February's payroll number of 235,000 beat the Street's view for 200,000 by an impressive 18%. Even better, construction jobs rose 58,000, the most in 10 years, and manufacturing added 28,000 jobs. People not in the labor force fell by 172,000.


Given that the Street didn't come close to anticipating the good data, bulls might have expected a feast Friday. Instead, the market gave investors a light snack.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, building sector stocks grabbed three of the top 10 spots for the day.


Homebuilders have been steadily climbing in the ranks. Seven weeks ago, homebuilders ranked No. 130. Four weeks ago, they were at No. 98. In the week ended March 3, the group was No. 78. Intraday Friday, homebuilders were at No. 54.


The climb will mean more once the group cracks the top 40, where market leadership is most often found.


But already, a number of homebuilder stocks have broken out and are extended as the industry's leadership emerges.


The biggest player by market cap could be ready to break out. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) needs about a 3% gain to clear an entry at 34.66. An earlier handle at 32 was too low to be valid, and volume was weak as it cleared that area. D.R. Horton grew earnings 25% and 31% in the past two quarters. Revenue jumped 18% and 20% in the same periods.

The market-leading bank stocks were laggards Friday. On Thursday, the bank sector dropped to No. 3 from No. 1 of 33 sectors.


The Federal Reserve will conduct a meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The Street expects an interest-rate hike.


For the week, the Nasdaq slipped 0.15% while the S&P 500 fell 0.4%. Both indexes ended their six-week win streaks.

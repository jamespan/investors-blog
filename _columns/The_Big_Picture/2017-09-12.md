Stock Rebound Shows More Beef: These 2 Indexes Hit New Highs
=============================================================

All year long, the bias in equities has been to the upside. Tuesday was no different.


While the major indexes scored just modest gains and only a handful of stocks cleared new bases, the strength of the market uptrend again was clearly on display.


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials all gained roughly 0.3% for the day. The NYSE composite slightly outperformed the bunch, rising 0.4%. More important, this broad benchmark and the S&P 500 reached all-time highs.


Today's [Stock Spotlight column](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) addresses the recent spell of outperformance by NYSE-listed stocks, especially among those that are at or near new highs. Think **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) (the No. 1 online and mobile ordering service for burgers, fries, tacos and other food),Â **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) and the like.

Small caps did even better. The Russell 2000, a big winner in 2016 (up 19.5%), rallied 0.6% and closed virtually at session highs. A finish high in the day's range is bullish. The S&P SmallCap 600 jumped 0.7%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE. As longtime readers of this column know, a rise in higher volume than the prior day is exactly the type of interaction you want to see in a bull market, just like when an ace card pops up next to a king in blackjack.


"Well, what about all of those distribution days?" you may ask. Indeed, the load of intense sell-offs in higher turnover remains heavy. Keep an eye on this count over the next week, as time could lead to the expiration of some of these distribution days.


At the same time, you never know when the institutional crowd is prone to sell shares and take profits en masse. The threat of a nuclear showdown in North Korea, continued bitterness in Congress, future natural disasters, and distractions that prevent President Trump from carrying forward his promise to cut taxes and boost the economy are still drags on the market.


With that in mind, the individual investor still maintains an edge by doing these four things: 1) watch the major indexes on a daily basis; 2) monitor the health of your individual stocks; 3) watch the behavior of new breakouts; 4) steadily raise cash by taking some profits on the way up, and quickly selling your weakest plays. One way to do some of this? Check out the charts of the companies making the "Leaders up in volume" and "down in volume" sections of the Market Pulse.


A plethora of banks rose, helping the small-cap indexes, as continued confidence in the U.S. economy and the American consumer seemed to provide some of the background for a selling rout in bonds. When bonds fall in price, yields (a measure of investment return) rise, and that's good for lenders. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note slid hard all throughout July and August, sinking to as low as 2.05%. On Tuesday, the yield raced up to 2.17%.



The superregional banks rose 1.7% as a group. However, as seen in screens such as [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), market leadership coming from these midsize and Wall Street-level financial firms is rather scarce.


Case in point: **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) was the Dow 30's biggest point winner on Tuesday, up 4.89 to 225.95. But the big-cap investment bank has not yet reclaimed its 200-day moving average. It is still in a new base.


Also bolstering the market were oil drilling, heavy construction, construction and mining equipment, department store, drugstore chain, apparel retail and auto part stocks. With a long road of recovery ahead for residents in the storm-ravaged areas of Houston and South Florida, investors may have sought to pick up bargains among these beaten-down industry groups.




Homebuilders, benefiting from still low interest rates and the opportunity to build new homes in disaster-hit areas, are quietly taking a leadership role as well. Indeed, reports of millennials wanting to move out to the suburbs would be a plus, as would be continued high rates of employment.


The leaders of the homebuilder group? **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), based in Fort Worth, Texas; **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), focused on the entry-level home; Miami-based giant **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)); and luxury homebuilder **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) of Virginia.

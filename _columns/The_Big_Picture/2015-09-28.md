Stocks got hammered Monday as big sellers again made their presence felt. The Nasdaq slumped 3%, closing near its session low. It's getting close to the 4500 level, which it has stayed above on a closing basis since late October.

  

Health care stocks, which make up about 16% of the Nasdaq composite, again came under heavy fire. IBD's biotech industry group tumbled 7.6% after plummeting 15% last week.

  

The S&P 500 dropped 2.6%, breaching the 1900 level. Intraday, the index came within less than 1% from its Aug. 24 low.

  

With the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq near their August lows, those levels now become an important test for the market.

  

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average shed 1.9%, with 29 of its 30 issues ending lower. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell below its Aug. 24 low, sliding 2.9%. The IBD 50 tumbled 3.6% or slightly worse than the Nasdaq. Medical stocks made up about 18% of the gauge of leading stocks.

  

Volume rose on both major indexes from Friday's mixed pace. The rise in trade was more prominent in the Nasdaq, which had its busiest session since the quadruple witching on Sept. 18. Decliners thrashed winners by nearly 9 to 1 on the NYSE and by more than 5 to 1 on the Nasdaq.

  

Bad economic news out of China (see [Glencore, China Data Rattle Global Mining Stocks](http://news.investors.com/investing-international-leaders/092815-773077-a-tough-day-for-international-mining-stocks.htm)) pressured stocks from the start Monday. Nearly all 197 industry groups fell, with medicals taking the most heat. Even defensive food and beverage groups lost ground.

  

Monday's slide came just one day after IBD's market outlook shifted to correction mode as distribution days spiked in a short period of time.

  

With sellers having the upper hand, investors should be in a defensive position. Following sell rules is key to managing losses. Always sell if a stock falls 7% or 8% from your buy price. Watch out for stocks that are fizzling after scoring double-digit gains; don't let a big gain turn into a loss.

  

During the market's recent short-lived uptrend, some stocks cleared buy points from bases and other setups, but now many of them have unraveled. They include **Post Holdings** ([POST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POST)) and **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)). Both fell more than 8% below buy points at 67.50 and 90.28, respectively, on Monday. Homebuilder **D.R. Horton**'s ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) near 15% gain past a 28.80 cup-with-handle entry has now dwindled to less than 2%.

  

Avoid buying stocks until either the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 puts in another follow-through signal. But a market correction is a good time to work on your watch list.

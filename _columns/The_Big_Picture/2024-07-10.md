  Stocks Extend Record Gains As Apple Makes History Again, But Nasdaq Tempts Fate

The stock market Wednesday extended its July rally, making its best gains of the month so far, although market leadership is undergoing a significant shift.




Indexes saved their best work for the afternoon and buyers went on a frenzy in the final 15 minutes of the session.


The stock market seemed to like what it heard from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. While his congressional testimony to the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday caused little market reaction, stock investors Wednesday were encouraged with his remarks on his second day on Capitol Hill.


Powell repeated the Fed's mantra that it needs to see more evidence of cooling inflation before pivoting to interest-rate cuts. Yet, the Fed chief sounded at times like someone who's looking beyond inflation.


He told lawmakers the Fed won't wait for inflation to fall to its 2% target before making the first rate cut. He also expressed confidence inflation will get back to that goal. The labor market, he added, is returning to normalcy.


Financial markets are warming up to the idea of a rate cut. [Odds for at least a quarter-point cut at the Fed's September meeting have risen to 73.3%](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html). That's up from 50% just one month ago. The 10-year Treasury yield fell less than two basis points to 4.28%.


The Nasdaq composite led with a 1.2% increase for its seventh consecutive record closing high. Its seven-day win streak is the longest in more than a year. The S&P 500 rose 1% as it made a sixth straight record close. Its seven-day win streak matched one that ended Nov. 8, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Dow Jones, Small Caps Join In Stock Market Rally
------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP071024-187x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.1%. The Dow may be lagging other major indexes this year, but it's not the fault of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). The personal technology leader climbed to a record high and this week became the first stock to top a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion.


Small caps participated in Wednesday's gains, with the Russell 2000 up 1.1%. But the index still faces resistance at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE from Tuesday's levels. Advancers led decliners on the Nasdaq by about 11 to 6. On the New York Stock Exchange, gainers outdistanced losers by a 5-2 ratio.


With the Nasdaq already up nearly 5% this month, the index has climbed more than 5% from its [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) on June 20 and 28. That leaves the composite with a clean sheet and the S&P 500 with a manageable three days of higher-volume declines.


Sector Rotation Unfolding
-------------------------


Restaurants continued to backslide, down about 4% so far this week as the industry group's chart breaks support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The group has fallen to No. 43 from No. 18 a month ago. A few more stocks in the group fell below their 10-week lines, including **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) and **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)).


Footwear is another high-ranked group that's weakening. **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) slid 5.5% Wednesday and erased a 21% gain from its 916.65 buy point. **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) fell further below its 50-day line. **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) and **On** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) had already moved below their 50-day averages.


Homebuilders, refineries, apparel makers, hospitals and some software groups are some of the industries that have come under selling. While such weakness underscores the leadership, the stock market is undergoing a sector rotation.


Biotech, semiconductor and mining stocks are rotating into the buyers' side. **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)), a [relatively new position on IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), broke out of a cup base Wednesday, and **Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)) spoke for biotechs as it [broke above a trendline with an entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trendlines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) around 143.


Stock Market Remains Extended
-----------------------------


With leadership replenishing itself, the stock market could extend its uptrend.


In a research note Wednesday, Jessica Rabe of DataTrek said while the Nasdaq was up 23% year to date through Tuesday's close, it still underperforms the average recovery off its four prior cycle lows using comparable time frames from each cycle low.


From its Dec. 28, 2022 low, the Nasdaq has gained 80%. From the lows in 1990, 2002, 2009 and 2020, the Nasdaq was up an average of 89% in the same number of days. That said, the Nasdaq has narrowed the gap over the last three months, while the four prior recoveries stalled out over the comparable time.


Indexes seem to be tempting fate, as they grow more stretched from their 50-day moving averages. The Nasdaq is now nearly 9% above its 50-day average, the widest gap since June of last year.


And a frightful headline perhaps? The consumer price index — which comes out Thursday morning — could give investors an excuse to take profits.


What are investors to do? First, watch out for sell signals in stocks that are coming off their highs. Second, continue to watch for emerging leaders. [Taking profits in stocks more than 20% from their breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) is a good idea, too.

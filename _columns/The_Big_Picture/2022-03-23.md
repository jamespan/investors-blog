The stock market was slapped lower Wednesday as oil prices spiked again. But with the current uptrend still in the early innings, there are reasons for investors to remain optimistic.




One key is volume. The Nasdaq escaped a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) because volume was lower than on Tuesday. It also managed to hold clear of its retaken [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) despite suffering a drop of 1.3%.


The S&P 500 also dodged a bullet, after volume came in lower on the NYSE. The index skidded 1.2% and fell back beneath its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/). Investors will want to see it power back above this level as soon as possible.


The bears also gave a bloody nose to small caps and growth stocks. The Russell 2000 closed down 1.7%, making it the worst major index of the day. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), a bellwether for growth stocks, dipped 1.3%.


Oil Jumps, Pressures Stock Market
---------------------------------


The fact that oil gushed higher again hurt stocks. West Texas Intermediate crude popped about 5% to nearly $114 per barrel.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP032322-226x300.jpg)As a result, oil and gas stocks were among the leaders up in volume. **Shell** ([SHEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHEL)) rose more than 3% while **Comstock Resources** ([CRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRK)) popped nearly 12% and broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Leaderboard stock **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) rose more than 4%.


It emerged Wednesday that **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) CEO Jamie Dimon had touted a [so-called Marshall Plan for energy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/jamie-dimons-marshall-plan-puts-new-package-on-familiar-energy-proposals-51648063367) to President Joe Biden during a Monday meeting.


The executive suggested measures including America increasing natural gas production capacity so it can help Europe find an alternative to Russian supplies. It remains to be seen whether Biden will act on any of his suggestions, but it was still an encouraging sign for energy stock bulls.


Oil prices have been rising due to the Ukraine-Russia war, which looks to be approaching a stalemate.


Pocket Of Strength In Electronics, Coal, Oil
--------------------------------------------


As ever, certain areas of the market were able to shine despite the overall bearish action.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, consumer electronics retailers, coal miners and oil stocks of a variety of stripes fared best.


The devil is often in the details, though. **GameStop**'s ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) nearly 15% spike single-handedly lifted the consumer electronics group. Reports said Chairman Ryan Cohen bought additional shares to hike his stake in the firm to 11.9%.


On the downside, mobile home and RV manufacturers, desktop computer software plays, truck parts replacement stocks and leisure products names lagged the most.


Homebuilders Hammered On Sales Data
-----------------------------------


The Commerce Department said new home sales dipped 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 772,000 units in February. This was a second straight month of declines. It was also lower than analysts expected.



In addition, January sales were revised downward from 801,000 units to 788,000 units.


Also Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said mortgage refinance demand fell 14% due to higher interest rates.


Top homebuilder stocks fell on the news. **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) dipped 3.9%, **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) lost more than 2%. And **Taylor Morrison** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)), a recent [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) stock, fell 5.6%.


Homebuilder ETFs also got punished. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF ([XHB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XHB)) fell 3.9% while the triple-leveraged Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies fund ([NAIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NAIL)) closed down almost 12%.

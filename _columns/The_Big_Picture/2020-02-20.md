The stock market pared heavy losses Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off as much as 373 points at the day's lows in a sharp sudden sell-off that didn't have much of a specific cause.




The Nasdaq composite closed with a 0.7% loss. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved down more than 0.4%, or 128 points. The small-cap Russell 2000 led the way with a 0.2% gain, shaking off the market's weakness. Leading growth stocks were also hit relatively hard; the IBD 50 fell 0.8%.


Volume was significantly higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. Wednesday's turnover.

Stock Market Rally Sputters
---------------------------


The stock market rally received a setback Thursday with the sharp drop in the major stock indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both added [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) due to heavy volume on their declines. Distribution days, or institutional selling, occur when the Nasdaq or S&P 500 fall at least 0.2% on higher volume than the previous session.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP2020-238x300.jpg)The coronavirus outbreak continues to impact the daily action of the stock market, so worse-than-expected updates could negatively impact trading. Reports pointed to unexpected spikes in new cases of the deadly virus.


In the meantime, the Nasdaq remains stretched from potential support levels after a strong rally since Feb. 2. Including Thursday's drop, there have been only three down days in February so far. The tech-heavy composite remains at the high end of an [upper channel line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rises-confidently-unitedhealth-nike-lead-dow-jones/), indicating a pullback would still be quite natural.


On the downside, Leaderboard member **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) dove as much as 13% to 90.69 before paring losses to 7% by the close. Shares are clinging to their 50-day moving average after sliding below that level.


3 Breakout Stocks Mixed, But Domino's Pizza Soars
-------------------------------------------------



**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) surged 25% to [stage a breakaway gap](http://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-falls-coronavirus-concerns-twitter-stock-new-buy-point/) beyond a 299.08 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. The stock's opening price at 362.03 can be used as a proper buy point in this case. Domino's [was featured](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dominos-pizza-earnings-q4-2019-dominos-pizza-stock/) as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Additionally, it was added to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) service Thursday.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup,](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) [Domino's Pizza stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-dominos-pizza-inc-dpz.aspx) has a mild 70 out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), but that will surely improve after Thursday's strength.


Meanwhile, breakouts from **Ping Identity** ([PING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PING)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and **Zoom** **Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) ended the session sharply mixed after strong showings at the start of the day. [IPO Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) Ping advanced as much as 9% to 29.80 to [break out](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-ping-identity-cybersecurity-breaking-out-new-buy-point/) past a 28.11 buy point in a flat base, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Ping shares are in the 5% buy zone, which tops out at 29.52.


Square is in the 5% buy zone past an 83.30 buy point in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) after Wednesday's breakout. Shares ended a volatile session Thursday up 0.5% after falling more than 5% at the day's lows. The 5% buy range runs up to 87.47.


Zoom Video is trying to break out past a 107.44 buy point in a [deep cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) amid a sharp rally. Shares briefly topped the entry, rising as much as 6.6% to 110.75. But the IPO stock closed up 1.3% at 105.29 — squarely below the entry.


Stock Market Earnings To Watch: Floor & Decor, Universal Display
----------------------------------------------------------------



Top companies reporting earnings after the close Thursday included **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) and **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)).


Floor & Decor shares were extended past a 41.81 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) ahead of the company's results. After the close, Floor & Decor wasn't very active. The company reported [better-than-expected Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/floor-decor-earnings-q4-2019-floor-decor-stock-buy-range/), but offered cautious full-year revenue guidance.


Universal Display ended Thursday about 22% off its 52-week high. After the close, the company reported its [Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/universal-display-earnings-q4-2019-oled-stock/), badly missing expectation. Universal Display stock dove about 5% in the after-hours session to about 170 a share.

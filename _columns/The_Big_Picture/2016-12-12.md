The Nasdaq composite lagged Monday, but weakness went well beyond technology stocks, as names like **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), **Viacom** ([VIAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIAB)), **21st Century Fox** ([FOXA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXA)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) took big hits.


The Nasdaq lost 0.6%, ending a six-session win streak. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% and the Dow eked out a 0.2% gain, good for a fresh all-time high. Volume on the Nasdaq came in lower than Friday's levels. NYSE volume rose slightly.


Alexion tumbled 13% on news its CEO and CFO left the company amid an investigation into the company's sales practices; Viacom lost 9% after Shari Redstone, vice chairwoman of Viacom and CBS ([CBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBS)), said she's no longer interested in merging the two companies. 21st Century Fox slid nearly 7%. On Friday, the company announced a preliminary deal to acquire the rest of British pay-TV firm Sky it doesn't already own for $14 billion.


![mp121216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP121216-170x300.png)The Dow was helped by strength in **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)), **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)).


Small caps took a hit with the Russell 2000 down 1.1%. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) also lagged, falling 1.6%.


Oil and gas-related groups were among the day's top performers, thanks to another big jump in oil prices.


West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $52.83 a barrel, up nearly 3%. Saudi Arabia signaled it may be ready to cut output more than originally agreed upon at the recent OPEC meeting. Meanwhile, non-OPEC countries, including Russia, also agreed to an output cut north of 500,000 barrels a day.


The market remains in a confirmed uptrend, but actionable buys are getting harder to find. Many stocks are extended past proper buy points, and those that are trying to break out are having some difficulty.


Oil and gas stocks remain a nice pocket of leadership in the market, but making in the sector has been no easy task. Many oil and gas producers gapped up sharply on Nov. 30, the day that OPEC agreed to cut prices, but price action since then has been volatile, even among liquid, large-cap names.


Sellers have been in **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) after a Nov. 30 breakout over a 54.42 buy point. The stock erased a 6% intraday gain Monday, falling nearly 3%. Many other stocks in the group showed similar action. **Pioneer Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) has been having problems clearing a 193.49 buy point. A 4% early gain faded to 1% by the close.


**Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), the only oil and gas name in the latest IBD 50 has been exceptionally volatile after a breakout attempt over a 16.46 buy point. It also reversed lower, falling 2%.


Transportation, construction, financial and steel stocks lagged. The common bond among all four? They've been some of the biggest gainers since the election.


The 10-year Treasury yield was unchanged at 2.47%. That's still up sharply from a yield of around 1.6% in late September.


A two-day Fed meeting starts Tuesday and ends Wednesday with a decision on interest rates due at 2 p.m. ET. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. Futures traders currently have the odds of a quarter-point hike to 0.5% to 0.75% at 97%.


When Fed policymakers gave their economic projections in September, they signaled two more quarter-point rate hikes in the coming year and three additional hikes in 2018. The market will get more color on this Wednesday, although expectations are low that the Fed will sound overly hawkish in their policy statement.

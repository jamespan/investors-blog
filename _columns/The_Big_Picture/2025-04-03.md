The major stock indexes sold off Thursday, as President Donald Trump's bigger-than-expected tariffs battered the markets. Up next, Wall Street is preparing for Friday's employment report and a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.


In response to the Trump tariffs, blue chips on the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 4%, breaking down below its long-term 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, while the Nasdaq composite plummeted 6%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 6.6%.




Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange compared with Wednesday's session. Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors moved lower, with energy and technology pacing the losers. The consumer staples sector was the clear winner of the session as investors rotated into defensive stocks.


[Trump](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-tariffs-president-reciprocal-tariffs-liberation-day-sp-500/) announced his long-awaited "reciprocal" tariffs after the stock market close Wednesday, and they promise to be the biggest transformation in global trade in decades. There's a 10% tariff baseline, but much-higher tariffs on China, Taiwan, Japan, Europe and other trading partners.


The baseline tariffs will kick in on April 5, with the higher "reciprocal" tariffs starting April 9.


[*Here's what the Trump tariffs mean for the U.S. economy and the stock market.*](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-tariffs-what-they-mean-us-economy-stock-market/)


Up next, the Labor Department is set to release its March jobs report Friday morning. The U.S. economy is expected to have added 131,000 jobs last month, down modestly from February's 151,000 increase, according to Econoday estimates. The unemployment rate is expected to tick higher to 4.2%, up from February's 4.1%.


Finally, Fed Chair Powell is scheduled to speak about the economic outlook at 11:25 a.m. ET Friday at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing annual conference in Virginia.

What Investors Should Do Now After The Trump Tariffs
----------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MP04325.jpg)


The Nasdaq plunged to its lowest level since August with heavy losses Thursday. IBD maintained the recommended exposure level at 0%-20%. That's a clear sign that caution continues to be the obvious choice, which is a key element of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/).


With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 undercutting their recent lows, investors will need to be on the lookout for another rally attempt. Day 1 of an attempted rally begins when a major index closes up from the previous session. Neither volume nor the size of the gain matters. The only thing that matters is that the attempted rally stays alive.


For the attempted rally to stay alive, the index cannot undercut the low of Day 1.


On Day 4 or later of the attempted rally, the Nasdaq or S&P 500 must deliver a strong gain in volume up from the previous day. That big gain in rising volume is the [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/), which confirms that a new uptrend is underway.


Remember, not all [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) succeed, but no market uptrend has started without one.

Instead of buying stocks right now, [investors should consider new watchlists](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) with stocks that are holding up best in the current stock market correction. These could be some of the next uptrend's market leaders. And many previous leaders are moving up the right sides of new bases, [like](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-music-streamer-advertising-push/) **Spotify Technologies** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)). These stocks could reemerge as market leaders if the market is able to stabilize and then move higher.


An easy way to identify market leaders is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) to gauge an individual stock's relative performance. A rising relative strength line shows a stock is outperforming the S&P 500, while a downtrending line shows the reverse.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured three new stocks Thursday, which are all defensive names. And the Near Pivot list has dwindled to 10 ideas, a sign that a diminished number are poised for a potential move higher.

Stocks Market Leaders To Watch: NetEase, Ollie's, Spotify
---------------------------------------------------------


Amid the ongoing stock market correction, now is not the time to be raising exposure in growth stocks. Doing so would be fighting the current stock market trend. Instead, keep an eye on market leaders that are holding up and eyeing new buy points, including **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and Spotify.



Chinese internet leader NetEase is holding just below a 105.93 early entry as it builds a flat base with a 110.15 entry.


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Ollie's is breaking out above a 115.42 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a double bottom, according to [IBD MarketSurge chart analysis](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). The RS line is at a new high, a bullish indicator of market leadership. Shares fell just 0.6% during Thursday's stock market dive.



Finally, [Spotify](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-music-streamer-advertising-push/) is tracing a cup with handle that has a 621.20 buy point.

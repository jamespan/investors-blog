Major averages ended the week with a clunker Friday as Wall Street weighed more corporate earnings and continued unrest in Ukraine. The news wasn't good on either front.


The Nasdaq underperformed, falling 1.8%. It met resistance at the 10-week moving average last week as it reversed lower to finish the week with a small loss.


Lukewarm earnings from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and chipmaker **Freescale Semiconductor** ([FSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSL)) didn't help matters, and biotech stocks had another rough session.


The S&P 500 lost 0.8%. NYSE volume rose slightly from Thursday's total. Nasdaq volume fell a bit.


Ukraine strife was in focus again after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made stern comments to Russian President Vladimir Putin late Thursday. The U.S. is working with allies to impose tougher sanctions on Russia because Moscow is not adhering to commitments made earlier this month in Geneva.


Headline-driven markets are always tough to navigate. What's clear right now is that making money in stocks is difficult with the market in a correction.


Tobacco and utility names rose Friday, but that's to be expected when institutional investors get defensive. For growth investors, leadership in groups like those point toward an unhealthy market.


Shares of Amazon slumped 10% in huge volume. Earnings matched estimates, and sales came in better than expected, but Amazon forecast an operating loss for the current quarter. Amazon offers a good lesson on why it's important to pay attention to early signs of institutional selling.


The first meaningful sign of selling came on Jan. 31, when the stock plunged through its 50-day moving average. It met resistance at the 50-day line in March and remains in a downtrend.


IBD's biotech-industry group extended losses, falling for a third straight day after ending a four-day rally. The group fell nearly 4% on Friday. 


**Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)) all fell 3%.


A weak market eventually takes everything down with it. While chip stocks and oil and gas producers had been showing relative strength, both groups got hit hard Friday.


Chipmaker Freescale plunged 14% after institutional investors frowned at its Q1 report. Chip-equipment makers also fell on weak results from **KLA-Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)). Shares gapped down and fell 7%. The stock closed just above its 200-day moving average. **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) also gapped down and fell 4%.


IBD's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production group lost 2%. Heavy-volume decliners in the group included **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), down 3%, and **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)), down 4%.

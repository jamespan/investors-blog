The stock market snapped out of a new-year pullback on Monday as the Nasdaq composite led broad gains and the market's supernovas helped brighten the investing landscape.




The Nasdaq rallied 2.2%, wiping out much of last week's 3.3% tumble in a single session. The S&P 500 also recovered the majority of last week's 1.5% loss with a 1.4% jump Monday.


Notably, the S&P 500 found support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), while the Nasdaq reclaimed that level after closing three days below it.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) helped set a bullish tone for the S&P and Nasdaq. The stock broke out of a flat base in heavy trading. That and some others in the constellation of megacaps known as the Magnificent Seven had the most bullish action in at least a week.


Magnificent Seven Boost Stock Market
------------------------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) contributed with a bounce off the 200-day moving average of 2.4%. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) found support at their 50-day lines. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) made a new closing high.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP010824-227x300.jpg)Small caps also rebounded as buyers spread their trading across multiple asset classes. The Russell 2000 surged 1.9% and ended a six-session losing streak that had shaved more than 5% off the index.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6% despite the drag of **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). The aerospace stock slid 8% in the highest volume since Dec. 3, 2020, although it bounced off support at the 50-day line. Boeing alone deducted more than 130 points off the Dow, which added 216 points.


The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the company's 737-Max 9 planes after a section of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines Max 9 [suddenly blew off in flight](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-supplier-spirit-tumble-details-around-737-max-incident-emerge/), leaving a gaping hole in the cabin. [Airline stocks rose](https://www.investors.com/news/dal-stock-poised-for-breakout-as-airlines-earn-uprade-despite-alaska-airlines-incident/), however. Most carriers do not operate the 737-Max 9.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and eased on the New York Stock Exchange. Advancing stocks topped decliners by an 11-5 ratio on the Nasdaq and by about 13-to-5 on the NYSE. All S&P sector indexes rose except energy, which fell after Saudi Aramco said it would cut prices in all regions.


Good Start For Stock Market Week
--------------------------------


The stock market's behavior in the new year is a reminder of why investors need to be ready to pivot quickly. Last week, profit-taking sent most of the market lower and Investor's Business Daily shifted its recommended exposure level down to 60%-80%.


Monday, however, offered multiple signs — breadth, megacaps, leaders, support — to show the pullback is already over. Thus, IBD is changing its stock market recommended exposure to 80%-100% with a confirmed uptrend.


The IBD 50 index, a proxy for growth leaders, rose 2.7%.


The 10-year Treasury yield fell 4 basis points to 4.00%. The stock market, especially the growth sector, would cheer a resumption of the decline in yields. And the benchmark yield could be meeting resistance at the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/).


The stock market got off to a good start for a week that will bring inflation data and the first meaningful fourth-quarter earnings reports.


On Thursday, the December consumer price index is due for release, along with the weekly jobless claims report. For a Federal Reserve that's contemplating rate cuts, those data points will serve as important guideposts.


Earnings Season Starts
----------------------


On Friday, **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) will give stock market investors a glimpse into the nation's economy.


Dow component **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) are also on [Friday's earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/). **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) announces Wednesday, the first homebuilder to report as the industry tries to resume its rally.


FactSet estimates fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 will climb 1.3%, which would be the second straight quarter of year-over-year earnings-per-share growth. But it would be a slowdown from the 4.9% profit increase in the third quarter.


John Butters, FactSet senior earnings analyst, says in a report that analysts are turning more cautious in their outlook. Fourth-quarter estimated earnings fell by 6.8% from the end of September to the end of December.


The decrease was larger than the five-year average, down 3.5%, and the 10-year average, down 3.3%. It is also the largest decline in the EPS estimates for any quarter since the third quarter of 2022. Moreover, both the number and the percentage of S&P 500 companies issuing a negative earnings outlook for the fourth quarter are running higher than average.

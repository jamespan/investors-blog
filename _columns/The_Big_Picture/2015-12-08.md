Nasdaq Erases Early Loss; S&P 500 Suffers Distribution
=======================================================

Sellers were back in the market Tuesday, but the Nasdaq closed near its high for the session, erasing a good portion of early losses. The Nasdaq gave up 0.1% after falling as much as 1.1%. The S&P 500 lost 0.7% but closed in the top half of its intraday range. It added another distribution day to its count, bringing its total to seven in recent weeks. Small caps held up relatively well, with the Russell 2000 down 0.4%.


The IBD 50 bucked the trend, rising 0.3%, as 12 names rose 1% or more. **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) added nearly 2% in light volume. It's still basing above its 10-week line after a couple of unsuccessful breakout attempts. **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) reversed higher in light volume. Its current base shows a 258.49 buy point.


The market's attention never stays in one place for long. In recent weeks, it's been on the Fed and interest rates. But lately, it's been on oil prices.


Crude oil futures for January delivery fell 14 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $37.51 a barrel, the lowest settlement since February 2009, according to Bloomberg. It hit an intraday low of $36.64.

The distribution-day count remains elevated, which makes it all the more difficult for a growth portfolio to make headway. Sporadic distribution days are one thing, but when they start to cluster, they can be problematic.


Remember, though, that the month of October was a big one for stocks, with the Nasdaq up 9.4% and the S&P 500 up 8.3%. Both indexes added to gains in November, so the consolidation that we're seeing now is perfectly normal in that context.


Biotechs outperformed Tuesday, helping the Nasdaq. Institutional-quality names like **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Alexion** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) and **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) all rose 2% or more. Celgene and Biogen have suffered technical damage that will take time to repair. Alexion is the most compelling as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base.


**Becton Dickinson** ([BDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BDX)), shown below in the Leaders Up In Volume section, has been toying with a breakout over a cup-with-handle buy point of 153.35. It cleared the buy point Friday, fell below the entry Monday in higher volume and then reclaimed it Tuesday in even higher volume. Becton's action is typical of many breakouts lately: wishy-washy action at the buy point.


Some stocks are clearing buy points in light volume, but few are breaking out past buy points with conviction. Institutional buying is the fuel for any successful breakout, and there hasn't been much of it lately.


In the after-hours session, **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) soared 6% on strong earnings. It's working on a double-bottom base with a 40.90 buy point.


**MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), meanwhile, edged higher in after-hours trading after the company announced a $4 billion share buyback and raised its quarterly dividend by 19% to 19 cents a share.

At one point Monday, the Nasdaq composite was up 1.4%. It turned out to be a mirage, as the stock market indexes quickly faded and closed with more losses.




The faux rally was symptomatic of bear markets, when stocks often find strength in the early hours but buyers disappear by the close.


The Nasdaq ended the session 0.6% lower and is down more than 8% for the month. It is on pace for its worst September since 2008, the year of the financial crisis, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Russell 2000 small-cap index slid 1.4%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE as well.


Another Stock Market Index In Bear Territory
--------------------------------------------


With a 1.1% drop Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now fallen more than 20% from its Jan. 5 peak. That leaves the Dow in what is normally considered a bear market. Other indexes have already reached bear market territory.

The S&P 500 lost 1% and made a new 52-week closing low. The S&P and Russell 2000 so far are having their worst Septembers since 2011.


The major indexes are nearing their 2022 lows after falling five of the past six weeks. Those levels should be watched closely in coming sessions in case support and a reversal unfold.


The profiles of leading stocks, however, suggest there won't be a new market rally anytime soon.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFFY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFFY)) fell 1.3% and has underperformed the main indexes this month. The exchange traded fund is down about 16% for the year.


Energy Stocks Hurt IBD 50
-------------------------


The sudden slump in the energy sector is one factor driving IBD 50 losses. About one-fifth of the index is comprised of oil and gas stocks. Most are breaking below their 10- or 40-week moving averages, have fallen more than 8% below breakouts, or both. **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)), **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) and **Chart Industries** ([GTLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLS)) fit this doubly bearish category.


China e-commerce company **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), a recent addition to the index, has fallen more than 8% from its 68.81 buy point, resulting in a [sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Contract manufacturer **Sanmin**a ([SANM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SANM)) erased a 14% gain from the 45.77 buy point.


While a number of energy stocks have [moved off the IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/while-market-gets-mauled-these-17-stocks-join-the-ibd-stock/), some consumer, health care and technology stocks have taken their place.


It's been hard to find any rising assets this year, but the U.S. dollar remains strong and is one of the few safe havens. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index last week had its best gain since March 2020 and is at 52-week highs.


Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Index Bullish Fund ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) rose 1% on Monday, hitting a record high. The ETF — which tracks a Deutsche Bank basket of currencies — is now up nearly 5% from the 29.30 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/). It is also up about 4% in the past five sessions amid a dollar rally.


Dollar Strength And The Stock Market
------------------------------------


The U.S. currency is rallying thanks in part to [surging interest rates](https://www.investors.com/news/federal-reserve-may-have-gone-too-far-as-sp-500-tests-bear-market-low/). As Treasury yields expand, it is attracting global investors to U.S. government debt. That, in turn, raises demand for dollars to acquire that debt.


The greenback also got bid up after the British pound [slid to an all-time low against the dollar](https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-pound-bonds-roiled-as-tax-cut-plans-spook-investors-11664192138?mod=hp_lead_pos1). Count sterling as another stressed global asset. U.K. government plans for tax cuts and new spending sparked inflation worries. The Bank of England warned it could raise rates to combat inflation.


Currency fluctuations are another risk for global markets that are already grappling with inflation, fuel shortages, geopolitical issues and other problems.


Mark Haefele, UBS global wealth management chief investment officer, says markets are repricing a higher Fed funds terminal rate amid risk-off sentiment. That's leaving the dollar set for continued strength over the next six months.


"Instead of peaking at the year-end, we now expect the greenback to remain strong through the end of the first quarter next year. ... We recently upgraded the (U.S. dollar) from neutral to most preferred in our (foreign exchange) strategy to reflect a stronger dollar on a broad basis."

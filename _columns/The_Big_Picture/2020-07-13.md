  Stocks Reverse Lower; Why That Was Just One Of The Problems With The Market

The Nasdaq, which has spearheaded the stock market's uptrend for months, reversed lower Monday — a sign that the market may be ready for a breather. The S&P 500 also reversed lower, as did some leading stocks.




Selling started early Monday afternoon in New York. The Nasdaq composite closed 2.1% lower, the largest drop since June 26. It was even worse if you take into account the disappearance of nearly 2% in morning gains. The S&P 500 closed 0.9% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average salvaged only a fraction of what had been a 2.2% increase. The Dow again met resistance at the 200-day moving average.


As reversals go, this one was more bearish than the one on July 7, when the Nasdaq lost 0.9%. It also came as the composite touched the upper part of a long-term trend line. A number of leading stocks faltered, something investors haven't seen lately.

[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) slid 3.7%, its largest loss since April 20.


With volume higher in the stock market, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). That ended the Nasdaq's streak of zero distribution days and it marked a new one on the S&P 500. (The S&P Monday rose more than 5% from the June 24 distribution day, so that day came off the count at the same time that Monday's was added.)


[In last week's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-ends-win-streak-leading-stocks-outperform/), we noted that the Nasdaq was outpacing its 200-day moving average by 20%. That's an unusually high gap, and it grew even larger at Monday's peak. The Nasdaq at one point stood 22% above its 200-day average.


Summation: Stock Market Risk Is Higher
--------------------------------------



Sum it all up, and investors have reason to be more cautious. IBD's market outlook remains a confirmed uptrend, but that doesn't mean investors should relax. Be watchful of stocks that [surrender hefty gains from buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/). [Breaks of the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) could be harmful.


For weeks, the stock market has practically ignored the coronavirus flare-up and trade tensions with China. Now, the market faces a new risk. This week, second-quarter earnings season kicks off with several major banks and companies announcing results.


The reports are expected to be poor. The S&P 500's earnings are estimated to fall more than 40% from a year ago, for the worst profit picture since the 2008 financial crisis. But keep in mind that the stock market is always looking ahead several months. A bad first-quarter earnings season didn't really hurt stocks.


Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in report Monday that while Q2 reports will be bad, they won't be as bad as in the crisis fourth quarter of 2008. Also, Q2 should mark the worst performance of the coronavirus crisis. In fact, Colas added, Q2 should be more or less in line with the S&P 500's average quarterly operating earnings from 2010-15 of $24.91 per share.


"Not only is the Street confident that Q3 and Q4 2020 will show materially better U.S. corporate operating income, analysts are actually raising numbers a tad. ... Takeaway: We believe Q2 financial reports will, in aggregate, serve to reinforce the market's belief that earnings will 'V-bottom' (reminder: they always, always do) and also support the idea that there are clear winners and losers in the current macro environment."


Earnings Outlook And Its Risks
------------------------------


The pandemic is clouding the earnings outlook, says Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist for Ally Invest.


"Since analysts are effectively driving blind with companies withdrawing guidance for the year, it is possible there is more negativity baked into earnings estimates than is warranted," she noted in a report. "Additionally, 2020 and 2021 growth forecasts have stabilized over the past six weeks, which is a positive sign for the market. When estimates stop deteriorating, it has historically been a sign that earnings growth will stabilize and can begin to recover, barring any unforeseen hiccups."



An acquisition in the semiconductor industry boosted that sector, but only momentarily. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 1.7%. Chipmaker **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) said [it agreed to acquire rival](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adi-stock-mxim-stock-merger-news/) **Maxim Integrated Products** ([MXIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXIM)) in an all-stock deal worth about $21 billion. The acquisition will strengthen ADI as an analog semiconductor leader with increased breadth and scale across multiple attractive end markets. Analog shares fell nearly 6%; Maxim rose 8% after paring gains.


In the earlier hours of trading, the stock market embraced progress reported on coronavirus vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration granted **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) [fast-track designations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-biontech-pfizer-nab-speedy-designation-shares-pop/) for two of four coronavirus vaccines the companies are developing.

Stock Market Rallies Hard With 'Subsequent' Follow-Through Day; This Element Is Now Critical
=============================================================================================

Was Wednesday the stock market's true [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/)?




On Jan. 31, IBD made what some market observers may have viewed as a pretty bold call.


That session, in [Day 6 of a new rally attempt](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-positive-move-as-nasdaq-again-rallies-more-than-3-percent/), both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted meaningful gains of 1.9% and 3.4%, respectively. Volume on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq rose vs. the prior day. The final day of January, in sum, had virtually all the elements of a new confirmed uptrend.


But if a new tradable rally were a hamburger, perhaps the missing ingredient was the patty.


For active investors, the "meat" usually comes in the form of tasty breakouts by dynamic, fast-growing companies with exciting new products or services. And good breakouts always spell new highs.


Stock Market Today: Watch This Stat
-----------------------------------


What did the new-highs picture look like on Jan. 31?


You can go to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the "Stock Lists" on the homepage of [Investors.com](http://investors.com), choose [New Highs](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/), then adjust the month and day within the URL. IBD's New Highs List on Jan. 31 didn't look so appetizing. It noted 29 stocks making 52-week or all-time new highs on the Nasdaq vs. 58 new lows. On the NYSE side, 20 stocks marked new highs; 33 etched new lows.


Since that critical Jan. 31 session, remarkably, major indexes have mostly avoided serious distribution — that is, intense sell-offs that would have knocked the nascent rally off the tracks. The Feb. 3 sell-off? Certainly distressing. Yet turnover didn't increase. In fact, through Wednesday's action, the Nasdaq has seen only one distribution day, a 0.6% drop in higher volume on Feb. 7.


Surely, [Wednesday's picture of new highs vs. new lows](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-feb-09-2022/) has brightened meaningfully.


On the Nasdaq, new highs topped new lows 60 to 51. On the NYSE, 89 stocks hit new highs while 37 sank to new lows. These ratios point to greater demand for stocks.


The Finance, Insurance, Bank and Energy sectors led the way. Stocks in these sectors combined for 45 new highs.


CPI Data Shock?
---------------


Wednesday's action hinted that Wall Street might take Thursday morning's monthly inflation data in stride.


The Econoday forecast calls for a 7.3% rise in U.S. consumer prices for January vs. a year ago. That would top a 7% gain in December. Economists also see core CPI up 5.9%, accelerating from a 5.5% bump in the prior month.


The Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 bolted 2.1% higher. That outstripped gains of nearly 1.5% by the S&P 500 and 0.9% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Small caps and midcaps fared nearly as well as the Nasdaq benchmarks: The Russell 2000 gained 1.9% and the S&P MidCap 400 tacked on 1.8%.


Plus, volume grew on both main exchanges — exactly what you want to see on a healthy advance.


The S&P 500's move to 4587 represents an 8.6% boost off this year's low of 4222. The Nasdaq, at 14,490, still more than 10% off its all-time peak of 16,212, has climbed 10.6%.


Yet if you view their daily charts, please note that their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) continue to slope lower.


It will take plenty of fresh new rallies for both of these indexes to power back above their 50-day lines and get them moving back up as well.


The New Critical Factor
-----------------------



Nonetheless, a few more breakouts are trickling into the market's scenery.


[IBD Live on Wednesday](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) covered bullish action in **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)), which is not only an expert in electrical systems and components but also stands out as a play on solar panel infrastructure. The midcap growth stock ($5.3 billion market value,  44.9 million shares outstanding) powered past a new entry in an 11-week double bottom at 116.05.


Read more about Atkore and see the chart annotations on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), which welcomed Atkore as a new half-size position.


Strong market rallies thrive on the emergence of growth stocks hitting new highs, just like Atkore. Will more emerge?



The current list of "Recent Breakouts" among stocks in the MarketSmith Growth 250 is admittedly still thin at 29 issues. They include **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) in farm equipment, **Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)) in lodging and **Stifel Financial** ([SF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SF)) in investment banking. All three are seeing their relative strength lines racing to multimonth highs. This means they are now outperforming the S&P 500 in a big way.


In technology, breakouts are scarce.


Remember, many former top leaders have fallen 25% to 45% off their 2021 peaks. This means it takes rallies of 33% to 80% or more to recoup such severe losses.


**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), which had a nice run in [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) until earlier this week, lies 25% off its high. **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), a former monster winner, is up 5% for the week. But that still leaves the e-commerce platform more than 47% below its November 2021 peak.


**NortonLifeLock** ([NLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NLK)) represents potential new tech leadership. The cybersecurity play gained 2% on Wednesday, moving further past a 27.78 buy point within a long base. The consolidation pattern also shows a 29.02 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).


A Longer-Term Look At Inflation
-------------------------------


Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis, foresees a sharp drop in inflation later this year. The reason: At one point the gap between the growth rates in U.S. retail sales and manufacturing hit a record 25%, spurring a big jump in prices. But that gap has narrowed to 10%.


The economist points out in a Jan. 24 note to clients that "the spread between the retail sales and industrial production growth rates is highly correlated with the movements in inflation and leads inflation by eight months." Hence, "this ought to be factor in FOMC deliberations because policymakers have sounded unduly hawkish in recent weeks."


The CME fed fund rate futures market currently is pricing a 75% probability the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by a quarter point and a 25 chance for a half-point boost at its March 15-16 meeting.


On Wednesday, the Cboe 10-year Treasury bond yield slipped 2 basis points to 1.92%.

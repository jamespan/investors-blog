Dow Jones Keeps Win Streak Alive Even After 11th Fed Rate Hike; These Industry Groups Jam
==========================================================================================

Wednesday's [11th hike in interest rates](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-just-hiked-again-is-it-done-sp-500-waiting-on-jerome-powell/) since March of last year led to a mixed finish by key stock market indexes. More importantly, it did not have the effect of derailing the nearly [four-month-long confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-leads-bullish-turn-in-stock-market-but-still-must-clear-these-potential-pitfalls/). Plus, the Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its win streak to 13 straight sessions.




For sure, a 0.2% gain by the 30-stock Dow wasn't much. But it indicates a much different mindset among investors toward the Federal Reserve's efforts to calm inflation compared with how the market responded to rate hikes made in 2022. And the near-term focus should remain on corporate earnings.


The S&P 500, down less than 1 point for the day, meandered inside a relatively narrow intraday range — less than 0.8% from low to high, in fact. Volume edged up on the NYSE vs. the prior session. The tiny drop, however, by the large-cap index reflected an absence of heavy institutional selling.


The Nasdaq composite finished off 0.1%. Volume declined. At 14,127, the index is holding on to solid gains for the quarter so far (up nearly 2.5%). The Nasdaq is also staying ahead of its [rising 21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) as well as the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. Megacap techs fell a touch more. Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) fell 0.3%.


Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) eased a penny to 33. The growth stock-focused ETF holds a 2.2% gain since July 1.

Doing Better Than Dow Jones
---------------------------


![Market Pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP072623-192x300.jpg)Meanwhile, lenders of virtually all sizes and geographies had a fine session.


Looking at IBD's 197 industry groups, at least five of the top 10 performers Wednesday came from the bank sector. They included the West and Southwest regional banks, up 3.5% on a price-weighted basis; Northeast lenders, up 3.2%; superregionals, rising 2.8%; and Midwest banks, moving 2.7% higher.


Southeast banks rolled 2.7% ahead. Savings and loan companies rose 2.5%.


No wonder, then, that the Russell 2000 enjoyed a 0.7% advance on Wednesday. The index still lags the Nasdaq in terms of year-to-date performance (up 12.4% and 34.9% since Jan. 1, respectively). But IBD readers may feel heartened to see a broader participation in the market advance. Indeed, breadth continued to improve.


Planes, Trains And Railroads
----------------------------


Doing even better than the Dow Jones industrials? Check out the Dow Jones transportation average. Made up of key players in the airline, trucking, shipping and railroad industries, the Dow transports soared 2.7% to 16,621. That marked the highest close since March 29, 2022. The sector-based index has now barreled 24% higher since Jan. 1.


That advance truly smothers a 7.2% advance by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


Such a move also strengthens the case — at least in the eyes of market participants — that the economy may in fact avoid a serious slowdown, even after experiencing one of the fastest rises in borrowing costs over decades.


The fed funds target rate, now at a range of 5.25%-5.5%, hit the highest level since the fed funds got cut by 50 basis points to 5.5% on Jan. 31, 2001.


Headed into Wednesday's session, the 10-day moving average of the NYSE advance-decline line had already been rising sharply for the past three weeks. (You can view this technical indicator by punching "GMIAA" on a daily chart at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), and "GMIAB" for the Nasdaq version.)


The A-D line itself has glided to its highest altitude since January of 2022.

In The Dow Jones: A New Breakout
--------------------------------


Some industrial companies also moved bullishly.


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), following an [encouraging second-quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-boeing-earnings-q2-2023-updates-737-787-jets/) that included 18% sales growth in the second quarter, jumped 8.7% to 232.80, a new 52-week high. Volume rushed 378% above its 50-day average.


The big gains hoisted the Dow Jones industrials component above a new base's [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 223.91. [The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) from this buy point goes up to 235.11.



Going back to the lenders, **Bancorp** ([TBBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBBK)) deserves recognition.


The member of IBD's Northeast banks industry group rallied 3.1% in heavy turnover Wednesday. At 40.59, the Wilmington, Del., small-cap lender extended its gain past a 36.78 buy point in a five-month cup with handle to more than 10%.


TBBK is now up 43% year to date. That gain even eclipses the Nasdaq composite's bullish flight over the same time frame.

Fed Will Keep Watching The Data
-------------------------------



In both a statement issued at 2 p.m. ET and during a news conference held by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the market got the clear message that the U.S. central bank will continue efforts in order to return the economy to a desired long-term inflation rate of 2%.  So, [how will it get done?](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-just-hiked-again-is-it-done-sp-500-waiting-on-jerome-powell/)


Powell made a point of monitoring key price and employment data closely. He stressed that the bank's governors can go over two months' worth of data before making any decision on what else needs to be done at its Sept. 20 meeting.


He acknowledged that history shows that Federal Reserve actions to tighten monetary conditions do not occur without impacting the jobs market. But Powell expressed satisfaction that the jobless rate, still well below 4%, has actually changed very little since the central bank began raising the fed funds rate from its ultralow level of 0%-0.25% back in March of last year.


Powell also pointed out that the "real federal funds rate" — or the current nominal rate of 5.25%-5.5% now, minus the current rate of consumer-level inflation at around 3% — is positive. That is, the cost of money continues to serve as a restrictive measure on the economy, even if the Fed stands pat for a while.


Put another way, monetary conditions are tightening and could lead to further progress in getting inflation to a more comfortable level.


Some market observers point out that the risk of recession is still significant.


"Prior to the last three recessions in the U.S. (not counting the Covid recession), the economic downturn began from 9-22 months after the fed funds (rate) crossed estimates of neutral," Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, wrote in a comment emailed to IBD. "With the Fed eclipsing neutral last October, that 9-22 month lag time could put the recession start date anywhere between August 2023 and September 2024."


The wealth management firm manages $41.5 billion.


In other markets, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond dropped 6 basis points to 3.85%, according to Cboe data.

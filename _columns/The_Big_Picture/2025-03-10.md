Stocks continued to suffer from blows inflicted by tariffs while increasing fears of a deteriorating economic outlook also put a stranglehold on the market Monday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 500 points to start the session, and selling intensified as the day progressed. Blue chips ended the day down nearly 900 points, or 2.1%. The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, but the Nasdaq suffered the biggest rout and plunged 4%. Perhaps most important, the Cboe fear gauge, known as the VIX, spiked to a seven-month high.




Small caps on the Russell 2000 dropped 2.7% while growth stocks in the IBD 50 suffered a 3.4% loss. And the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 10 basis points to 4.21%.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange compared with the same time Friday. Breadth was poor as decliners outnumbered advancers on both exchanges.


In early trades, decliners beat advancers 2-to-1 on the NYSE, while on the Nasdaq that ratio was nearly 3-to-1. But selling worsened throughout the day as decliners outnumbered advancers by around 4-to-1 on both exchanges.


Productivity Outlook Gets Cut; Inflation Data Due
-------------------------------------------------


On Monday, Goldman Sachs downgraded its economic outlook and cut its GDP outlook for 2025 to 1.7% from 2.4% and noted that "trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse" since the start of the year.


Despite a rally attempt the session before, major indexes undercut Friday's lows on Monday after President Donald Trump [noted on Sunday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-trump-tariff-slump-tesla-powell/) that he would not rule out a recession.


February's inflation data is due on Wednesday.


Investor's Business Daily's recommended exposure now stands at 0%-20%.

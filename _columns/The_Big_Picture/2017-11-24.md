U.S. stock indexes advanced cautiously Friday, mainly due to typical post-Thanksgiving trade and partly because of the looming Senate vote on the tax-cut bill.




 The Nasdaq rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 tacked on less than 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a 0.1% gain.


Volume fell across the board in the abbreviated session. On Friday, the stock market closed three hours early, at 1 p.m. ET.


The expected vote in the Senate on a tax-cut package also gave fund managers a reason to stand back. The House passed their own version Nov. 16.


The Republicans in the Senate can only afford two defections, if the Democrats remain united as expected.

An agreement could become a market catalyst. When the tax-cut package in the House was approved Nov. 16, the Nasdaq bolted 1.3% higher, while the S&P 500 added 0.8%. The Russell 2000 popped 1.6%.


Normally, legislative outcomes are baked into the stock market before a vote occurs. However, "normally" isn't a word that fits the current political climate. Predicting the level of Republican unity on any issue has been difficult in the Trump era.


Meanwhile, the FANG stocks — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Google's **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — have been predictable. They have stayed strong most of 2017, and were up for the week.


Facebook rose 2.1% for the week; Amazon, 5%; Netflix, 1.3%; and Alphabet, 2%. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which is sometimes added to group, surged 2.8%.


The stock indexes trailed the FANGs' pace but were still positive for the week. The Nasdaq advanced 1.6%, and the Russell 2000 1.8% for the week. The S&P 500 and the Dow each added 0.9%.


Technicals in the market improved in the holiday-shortened week. The Nasdaq unloaded two distribution days. The Oct. 18 and 19 distribution days fell off Wednesday and Friday, respectively, because of time. After 25 sessions, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions.

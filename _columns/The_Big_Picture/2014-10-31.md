Bulls rumbled ahead Friday, as the major stock indexes pushed to good gains in strong volume.


The Nasdaq pegged a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average added 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively. The IBD 50 tacked on 1.2%.


Volume rose across the board.


The Nasdaq hit a 52-week high, while the S&P 500 is closing in on an all-time high and notched a closing high Friday.


Breakouts have become commonplace since the Oct. 21 follow-through day signaled a new uptrend was under way.


On Friday, more stocks either broke out or triggered secondary entries.


Semiconductor designer **Broadcom** ([BRCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRCM)) jumped 3% in strong volume, clearing a 41.75 buy point in an erratic consolidation.


Mountable camera maker **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) bounced off its 50-day area in strong volume, setting a secondary buy opportunity.


**FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) gapped up to clear a 150.02 buy point. The stock has been rising for more than two years.


In economic news, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey and the Chicago Purchasing Manager Index topped the Street's estimates. Personal income and spending, however, were weaker than expected.


Japan, though, made the big splash when it announced an increase in its monetary stimulus program.


Still, news doesn't appear to be the chief driver of this uptrend.


The uptrend has been showing enough strength and breadth that asking why seems off the point.


Stocks are rising because of demand from institutions. The big buyers include funds or companies buying back their own shares. Goldman Sachs recently pointed out that companies are not free to buy back shares in the five weeks before earnings are released. Most Q3 earnings are now out, which means those corporations can begin buying their own shares again. Since 2007, 25% of corporate buybacks occurred in the last two months of the year, according to Goldman Sachs.


For the week, the Nasdaq rose 3.3%, the IBD 50 3% and the S&P 500 2.7%. The small-cap S&P 600 jumped 5.2%.


Earnings season lightens in the coming week, but companies reporting include **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), **El Pollo Loco** ([LOCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOCO)) and **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)).

Stocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A Break
================================================================

The stock market paused Monday, although the losses didn't do much to stop its feverish advance.




 The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fell 0.7% while the Nasdaq shed 0.5%. In need of a breather perhaps, indexes closed near session lows and broadly lower. Decliners led advancers by 9-to-2 on the NYSE and by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq.


Volume increased from Friday's total on the Nasdaq, which gave the Nasdaq a new [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). Volume also rose on the NYSE, which resulted in a distribution day for the S&P 500.


That's still only a few distribution days, not the level that should cause any angst. The market indexes remain in relatively steep price advances in January, which has been nothing short of stellar.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP_3x2_012918-232x300.png)This month, the Nasdaq is up more than 8%. For the S&P 500, it would be the best January since 1976, when it boomed 11.8%. Back then, the S&P also had just finished a strong year (up 31.5% in 1975), just like the S&P did in 2017 with its 19.4% burst.


Indeed, the market's bigger-than-normal gains are one reason for investors to tap the brakes and avoid getting caught in a wave of euphoria, especially now that the thick part of earnings season is arriving.


It's not just the number of companies announcing this week, but also the high caliber of companies whose reports may hold big sway on equities going forward. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) are on the docket, and all are capable of upsetting the market's perceptions. Of course, good results and stronger than expected outlooks could just extend the uptrend.


Monday's action showed a small spike in fear among options players. The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX for short, jumped to the highest level since Dec. 1. Such spikes can be good for the market because the options market tends to be wrong at extreme levels of sentiment. The put-call volume ratio, another gauge of market sentiment, remains at levels that would be considered low-fearing, if not complacent. That's another reason for caution. (See the put-call graph at the bottom of the Nasdaq chart in the General Market Indicators page via the link at the bottom of this article.)


A third major sign that the indexes might need to pace themselves lies in their charts. The Nasdaq had already broken above the upper line in a price channel from September and now has broken above another longer-term upper price channel from June.


[Taking profits on stocks that are up more than 20%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) from their entries is one way to exercise caution. Be careful holding any company that is reporting earnings soon; a bad report could lead to big losses.


Leading stocks' advances are mainly intact, with no clear signs that institutional investors are dumping shares. A few are in trouble, including **PetMed Express** ([PETS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETS)), **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) and **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)). Watching the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) on a daily basis is a good way to see how the leadership is doing.


Breakouts are still occurring, although for some it's more of a struggle. For example, **Take-Two Interactive** ([TTWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTWO)) rose above a 120.28 buy point Monday but reversed to close below the entry. Volume was pale, too.


Contrast that move with **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), which [roared past a cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) in heavy trading. The biotech formed a 19%-deep base after a strong prior uptrend. But the relative strength line is lagging the stock price.



Cracks are appearing in the foundations of homebuilding stocks, which have been leading the market for months.


**LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **William Lyon Homes** ([WLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLH)), **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) have moved below their [10-week moving averages](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) for the first time since September, when those stocks were still forming bases.


Other builders have already slid below the 10-week line, indicating that the industry group could be topping. D.R. Horton reports earnings Wednesday, while **MDC Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)), **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) and **M.I. Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) [announce results Thursday](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/homebuilder-stocks-continue-to-slide-on-nvr-miss-ahead-of-key-earnings-reports/).


The transportation sector showed relative strength, thanks to shipping, transportation equipment, railroads and airlines. The Dow Jones transportation average slipped 0.1%, however.

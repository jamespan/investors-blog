Stocks sauntered to an indifferent finish Thursday, ending the four-day week on a listless note. The Nasdaq retreated 0.1%, while the S&P 500 backed off even less. The IBD 50, a proxy for leading stocks, lost 0.3%. The Dow Jones utility average led the market Thursday with a 1.4% pop. Analysts at Morningstar and Credit Suisse said the sector was undervalued.

  

Volume in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) fell on both major exchanges in the run-up to the three-day July 4 weekend.

  

On a Monday-through-Thursday comparison, volume rose vs. the previous week on both major exchanges.

  

Distribution in the market remains heavy, but the indexes managed to avoid sell-offs in rising volume every day last week. It was only the second time in the past seven weeks that the indexes went without distribution for the entire week.

  

However, Monday had the tone of distribution — spared only by an impossible comparison with the previous session's annual Russell index rebalancing.

  

Still, considering the shadow that Greece cast on the world's financial picture during the week, the market has done OK.

  

In the coming week, the market will have an opportunity to improve the distribution-day count. The Nasdaq will see two distribution days expire because of time, and the S&P 500 will lose three. Of course, the reduction in the count will come only if the market can avoid fresh distribution.

  

Another factor that could be signaling an improved market is the put-call ratio, which closed at 1.03 Thursday. In four of the past five sessions, the ratio ended above 1.0, hinting at a short-term bottom in the market. While secondary indicators can be hit and miss, the put-call ratio has been fairly accurate in the past year or so.

  

Skeptical investors might wonder how much help they can expect from an improvement in the market's condition. Breakouts have had trouble making progress this year, even in those times when the market has been in a confirmed uptrend.

  

For example, in the first four weeks after the May 14 follow-through (which confirmed a new uptrend was under way), the average gain for a breakout — from ideal buy point to temporary peak — was 9%. The median gain was 7%.

  

Narrow gains make it difficult for growth investors to bag profits.

  

Going back earlier this year, some breakouts proved profitable and easy to hold. They include: **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), up 28% from a January breakout; **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)), up 24% from a February breakout; and **Carter's** ([CRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRI)), up 22% from a February breakout.

  

Each chart shows an advance that found consistent support at the 50-day line.

  

Economic reports Thursday were disappointing. Payrolls, first-time jobless claims and factory orders were worse than the Street expected.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 lost more than 1%, according to preliminary data. The Nasdaq dropped 1.4% and the S&P 500 1.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average also fell 1.2% as 27 of the 30 blue chips lost ground for the week.

  

On Sunday, a referendum in Greece was expected to accept or reject terms offered by creditors.

  

Long-term, it isn't clear which would be better for world markets — a result that would lead to Greece's departure or a result that means the economic zombie will stick around to perhaps cause more problems in the future.

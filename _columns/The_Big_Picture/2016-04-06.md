Nasdaq Leads Another Broad Show Of Strength In Stocks; Volume Mixed

Is growth back?


Perhaps that sentiment started to strengthen among traders Wednesday as the Nasdaq composite paced a solid session of all-around gains. Volume was mixed. Winners handily topped losers on both exchanges.


The Nasdaq jumped 1.6% and finished the day almost at its intraday high. The Nasdaq 100 equaled that score. Turnover on the fully electronic exchange climbed modestly, less than 3% higher.


A modest pickup in volume is positive for long-only investors -- even if volume in total was below its 50-day moving average. Why? It's a subtle clue for alert IBD readers that perhaps the institutional investors are getting more serious about deploying cash into stocks.


And when the big boys and girls -- the portfolio managers at investment banks, hedge funds, mutual funds, endowments and the like -- deploy serious amounts of cash into high-quality stocks, good breakouts in heavy volume usually emerge.


![MP040616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP040616-218x300.jpg)Such has been the case in recent weeks. On Wednesday, just 10 of the names in the latest IBD 50 showed above-average volume, but all 10 rose in price, including biotech **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) (breakout past a 114.10 entry), GPU leader **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) (33.16 handle entry) and LED lighting expert **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) (gap up past two handle buy points and the left side of an excellent symmetrical cup base).


Also check out Leaderboard, which IBD launched in July 2011. After the selling carnage in the first week of January, the Leaders list was chopped down hard, from 12 stocks to 5. A week later, the list shrank to 3.


Yet since the Feb. 17 Day 4 follow-through, which served as a fact-based signal that a new uptrend may be in place, that list of premier growth stocks has returned to the sort of level that you would expect if you had confidence to buy stocks that broke out to new highs and kept heading higher.


The [current list](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), which added another name on Wednesday, is now back to 14 names. Just two of them -- tobacco titan **Reynolds American** ([RAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAI)) and the SPDR Gold Trust ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) ETF -- may be considered defensive plays. The current list also is not yet at peak numbers seen in 2014 or 2015.


While the Nasdaq has not yet wiped away its losses since Jan. 1, the strong move back above the 200-day moving average was certainly encouraging. As this column has noted repeatedly this year, a market tends to be healthy when the major averages are above this long-term support line, not below it.


The S&P 500, getting a boost from oil stocks, rallied 1.1%. Crude oil futures ramped up 5% on signs of shrinking U.S. supplies. Small-cap stocks didn't slouch. The Russell 2000 gained 1.2%. The Dow utilities took a backseat on Wednesday, slipping less than 0.1% lower.


Wednesday's rally was set in motion well before the minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest meeting on interest rates hit the wires at 2 p.m. ET. Nor did the minutes generate much reaction on Wall Street. It's no secret to anyone that the U.S. central bank will take extra-slow steps to raise the cost of money this year.

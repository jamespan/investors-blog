Major Indexes End Flat, But Some Leaders Rise Sharply
======================================================

A promising early rebound fizzled Wednesday, leaving the major indexes to a flat finish.

  

Indeed, if such movement continues in the stock market, expect more players to get worn out rather than shaken out.

  

One divergence lies within the leadership, however. As the Market Pulse table shows, more top-quality growth stocks rose in heavy volume than fell in above-average trade.

  

The Nasdaq composite's early 0.7% rise got squeezed to a measly 0.1% by the close. The Nasdaq 100 also ended 0.1% higher. Both indexes took back little of losses from the two prior sessions.

  

The S&P 500 closed less than 1 point lower. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.

  

A rally on Friday, spurred by a decent if not fabulous monthly jobs report, made it appear that the market would regain some of the traction witnessed during a seven-week run-up that began in mid-October.

  

No such luck. On Wednesday, a disappointing U.S. retail sales report was the likely culprit behind the market's poor action. While sales were flat month to month, sales ex-autos were up just 0.1% vs. the Street's 0.5% forecast.

  

For some investors, the market's sideways action is likely depressing. Even swing traders are having a tough time making headway. But the sideways action should not be a surprise. Uncertainty reigns high over the future of U.S. interest rates, Greece's finances, Middle East instability and China's efforts to keep its economy growing at full speed.

  

The S&P 500 is up less than 2% since Jan. 1. Over that same period, the ratio of bullish pundits surveyed by Investors Intelligence has dipped to 47.5%, the lowest level since November. (See the graph on Page B11.) This is likely a good thing. Over-optimism is a long-term negative for stock prices.

  

The IBD Mutual Fund index was up 4.1% as of Wednesday's IBD, doubling the S&P 500's rise.

  

An active manager has the advantage of avoiding lagging industries and building positions in great stocks. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is an example. The stock thundered past a 389.47 buy point last month on good top-line growth (+15%) and a big surprise in its cloud revenue.

  

The stock pulled back for a third straight day on Wednesday, but volume was whisper-thin. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is solid at A-.

  

Other stocks moving nicely upstream include LED lighting expert **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), which joined Leaderboard on Jan. 9, **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), noted in today's Industry Themes [story](http://news.investors.com/investing-ibd-industry-themes/051315-752444-sport-shoes-sales-rise-in-first-quarter.htm).

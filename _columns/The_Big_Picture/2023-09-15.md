The stock market ended a wild week lower as indexes failed to hold above key levels. Now investors' attention will turn to the forthcoming Fed meeting.




The Nasdaq composite plunged 1.6% and reversed back below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) just a day after recapturing the benchmark. This means the tech-heavy index ended lower for the second week in a row. Nevertheless, it remains up around 32% so far in 2023.


The S&P 500 is also back below its 50-day line after diving 1.2%. The benchmark index has now fallen in five of the past seven weeks. It has also seen its gain for the year atrophy to just over 16%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up best out of the major indexes but still skidded 0.8%. Despite turning in a fractional weekly gain, it reversed back below its 50-day line. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) was the worst performer on the blue chip index, while **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) fared best.


Small caps were mauled by the bears, with the Russell 2000 tumbling 1.1% and closing near its 200-day moving average. Growth stocks fared even worse, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) plunging 1.3%.


The current stock market uptrend remains under pressure. Due to Friday's negative action IBD is recommending investors once again take their market exposure down to the 20% to 40% range.


Stock Market Reverses As Fed Meeting Looms
------------------------------------------


The Federal Reserve looms large in the coming week, with the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee taking place Tuesday and Wednesday.


While central bankers are almost certain to hold interest rates steady, investors will be looking for guidance on where things are headed further down the line.


The tone taken by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during his post-meeting media conference will once again be key. The CME FedWatch tool raised the likelihood of rates being held steady at the November meeting to just over 73% on Friday but that could easily change.


Powell and Co. are not the only Fed that will be on people's minds in the coming week. **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) will report earnings. Other companies posting results include **Darden Restaurants** ([DRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRI)) and **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)).


Outside of earnings, more housing data is also set to drop. Both building permits and housing starts data is slated for release on Tuesday.

Chip Equipment Group Lags
-------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors all ended in the red. Technology and consumer discretionary lagged the most as the defensive utilities area held up best. This was the first time this year all 11 sectors fell following a day in which they had all closed higher.


Once again, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a deeper insight into the performance of the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Specialty Consumer Products plays, gold miners and diversified operators, a group which includes Warren Buffett-led **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)), all performed well.


In contrast, computer hardware stocks, dairy products plays, semiconductor equipment firms and steel producers were hit the hardest.

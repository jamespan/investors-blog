title: Stocks Drop, As Market Ignores Good News On Earnings

U.S. stock indexes failed to overcome resistance areas Friday, as the market ignored the big banks' earnings beats.




The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%. The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.5% each.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


From a bull's perspective, Friday was a half-a-loaf session. Lower volume helped the indexes avoid distribution, which can be deadly early in an uptrend. But the major indexes failed to retake their [50-day moving averages](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/).


The market has time to work on those resistance levels, but bulls would've preferred a quick kill.


Sellers Dash Early Optimism
---------------------------


Before the opening bell, the market saw promise in the earnings reports of a half-dozen banks. Most of them surpassed the Street's view on earnings.


Those beating the Street's estimates included **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **First Horizon National** ([FHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FHN)) and **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)).


**PNC Financial** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)) only matched the consensus estimate.



The bank stocks responded with sizable gains in premarket action. But it didn't last. After opening on the upside, they quickly soured.

What happened?


The Meaning Of 466
------------------


One possibility can be summed up in a number: 466. As of Friday, that's how many days the 115th Congress has gone without rolling back the Dodd-Frank law in part or full.


Changes could yet come, but bank lobbyists are fearful that the Republicans are about to kick away a chance to gain some kind of victory on bank regulations.


Apparently, the stock market shares those concerns. The first three sessions after Tuesday's [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) day have been mixed.


(A follow-through day is a confirmation that a new uptrend is underway.)


Stocks Up Friday
----------------


Positive action Friday included **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)), which broke out of a flat base after William Blair upgraded the stock; **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)), which is just under a buy point; and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which rose for the eighth time in nine sessions as more analysts made bullish comments.


On the downside, China stocks staggered. Among the 43 ADR stocks in IBD's database trading above 15, all but 10 dropped.


In the coming week, companies reporting quarterly results include Netflix, **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) and **Skechers USA** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)).

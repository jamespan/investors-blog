==========================================================

Early gains for the stock market faded badly Monday as jitters over first-quarter earnings season trumped a day of outperformance for material and financial stocks.


For the seventh time in nine sessions, major averages closed near session lows. The Nasdaq erased a 1% intraday gain Monday, falling 0.4%. The S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, and the Dow industrials eased 0.1%. The IBD 50 lagged slightly, falling 0.5%.


The selling was pronounced in the last hour of trading, but the Nasdaq avoided a distribution day because volume fell from Friday’s levels. Its distribution-day count dropped by one: The March 4 stalling day fell off the count due to time. Volume rose on the NYSE, giving the S&P 500 its fourth higher-volume decline since March 23.

Breadth wasn’t too bad, with NYSE advancers beating decliners by around a 3-to-2 margin. On the Nasdaq, winners and losers were nearly evenly matched.


A pullback at this point for the Nasdaq, as is struggles to hold its 200-day moving average, wouldn’t be out of the ordinary. The index has rallied strongly off its February lows and might need some time to catch its breath. An elevated distribution-day count is a yellow flag that could be pointing toward softness ahead, which is why the market outlook was lowered a notch after Thursday's session to uptrend under pressure.


Crude oil for May delivery settled at $40.36 a barrel, up 64 cents, or 1.6%. June gold jumped $14.20, or 1.1%, to $1,258 an ounce. The metal remains a safe-haven trade amid concerns about growth and expectations for a lackluster Q1 earnings season.


Last week, IBD reported that overall earnings in the S&P 500 are expected to fall 7.1% from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters. That would be the biggest drop since the third quarter of 2009 and the third straight quarter of declining growth.


An earnings beat and sales miss for Alcoa late Monday didn’t do much to help the stock late Monday, as shares fell 4% in after-hours trading.


Later in the week, some high-profile financial results are due from the likes of **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)).


Breakouts were few and far between Monday, but **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)) passed muster. The fast-growing real-estate investment trust added 1%, closing just above a 26.45 flat-base entry.

The stock market sold off Thursday, as a key inflation rate hit a 40-year high. Meanwhile, oil prices tumbled after President Joe Biden tapped the nation's emergency oil reserves.




Tech titan **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) are among the top stocks to watch in the ongoing stock market uptrend.


Stock Market Uptrend
--------------------


Ahead of the market open, the [personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-inflation-rate-update-pose-risk-to-s-and-p-500-rally/) — the inflation rate most closely watched by the Federal Reserve — showed that price pressures accelerated to a new 40-year high, but prices excluding food and energy were a bit tamer than expected. The PCE price index rose 0.6%, the biggest monthly gain since 2008. The annual inflation rate rose to 6.4%, highest since January 1982. Core prices, minus food and energy, rose 0.4% on the month. The annual core inflation rate picked up to 5.4%, the most since April 1983.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.6% Thursday, while the S&P 500 also ended 1.6% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off 1.5%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 slid 1%. All four major stock indexes declined for a second straight day.


Top growth stocks also fell sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.9%. A few leaders bucked the drop. Inside the IBD 50, **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) advanced 2%. **MP Materials** ([MP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MP)) jumped 1.7%.


On the IBD 50's downside, chip stocks **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) tumbled 13.3% and 8.3%, respectively, for the two worst performances in the index. AMD shares were downgraded from overweight to equal-weight at Barclays. The stock's price target was slashed from 148 to 115.


Treasury Yields, Oil Prices Fall
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP033122_2-231x300.jpg)The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked down to 2.32% Thursday, falling for a third straight day. CNBC reported that in late trading Thursday, the yield on the corresponding 2-year note ticked up to 2.377%, marking a further inversion of the yield curve.


A yield curve inversion, or when the cost of borrowing money in the near term is higher than the cost of money in the longer term, has often signaled a warning that the economy is at high risk of entering a recession.


Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices retreated, as West Texas Intermediate crude tumbled more than 6% to trade below $101 a barrel. The [Biden administration](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-is-expected-to-tap-oil-reserves-to-control-rising-gasoline-prices-11648695581) will release roughly 1 million barrels of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil a day for several months with a total release up to 180 million barrels.


Volume ended a touch lower on the Nasdaq but rose more than 13% on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session. With the higher volume on the NYSE, the S&P 500 added its [first distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) since the [March 16 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-as-fed-chair-powell-grasps-this-challenge-these-areas-shine-brightest/).



With the stock market in a confirmed uptrend and still [no days of institutional selling](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) on the Nasdaq, investors should continue to carefully raise exposure by buying top stocks breaking out past [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in [high-quality bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Remember, not all breakouts will work, so it's important to keep losses manageable by selling at the [7%-8% loss-cutting level](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


For example, promising breakout **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)) hit the 7%-8% sell trigger Wednesday. And shares tumbled another 6.9% Thursday.

Top Stocks In Or Near Buy Zones
-------------------------------



Despite Thursday's profit-taking session, Apple, Regeneron, Teck Resources and Vertex are among the top stocks to buy and watch in the ongoing stock market uptrend.


Dow Jones leader Apple gave up its [double bottom's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) 176.75 buy point following Thursday's 1.6% decline. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) tops out at 185.59.



Biotech leader Regeneron remains in buy range above a 673.96 [flat-base entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) in the wake of a March 16 breakout. REGN shares tested the buy point on March 23 before regaining the buy point on March 24. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) tops out at 707.66. The stock was up 0.9% Thursday.


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Teck Resources is about 5% away from an [ascending base's](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rare-ascending-base-can-lead-to-powerful-gains/) 42.48 buy point, per [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares dropped 1.2% Thursday. Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [TECK stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-teck-resources-ltd-teck.aspx) boasts a 98 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).



[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Vertex rallied 1.7% Thursday after the [company announced](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vrtx-stock-is-not-feeling-the-pain-shares-deepen-breakout-on-opioid-alternative/) promising test results for its opioid alternative. VRTX shares moved higher in the 5% buy area past a 255.03 flat-base entry. The buy range tops out at 267.78.


Per Leaderboard commentary, the current base is [first stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) after a long, deep decline since 2020. Early-stage bases have more upside potential than later-stage formations.

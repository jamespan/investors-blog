Indexes End Mostly Flat In Half Session; Airlines Soar

A half day of trading Wednesday resulted in a listless session as major averages ended mostly flat.

  

The Nasdaq added 0.2%, the Dow rose less than 0.1% and the S&P 500 fell a fraction. Volume was naturally light due to the shortened session. But based on 3-1/2 hours of trading, NYSE volume ended fairly close to Tuesday's level and Nasdaq volume fell.

  

The market uptrend has resumed, but an elevated distribution day count is problematic. The Nasdaq currently shows seven distribution days. Five have come in the month of December alone. In this context, it's no surprise that growth stocks are generally having a hard time making headway.

  

It's reasonable to have some exposure to stocks, but an aggressive posture doesn't make sense. Market risk is still elevated.

  

Six days into a rally attempt, it's still important to keep an eye out for a follow-through in the form of big percentage gains for the major averages in higher volume.

  

The latest market decline was brief and shallow, so it may not have done much to wash out weak holders as a deeper correction would have.

  

In 2014, the market saw four follow-through days. Three that came after modest declines for the indexes didn't amount to much. The one on Oct. 21 worked the best â€” it came after a 10% pullback for the market.

  

Biotechs, airlines and utilities outperformed Wednesday. Oil and gas-related groups lagged again as oil fell again.

  

The biotech industry group added 1.6% after falling 6% the prior two sessions.

  

**Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) reclaimed their 50-day lines, rising 2% and 3%, respectively.

  

**Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) also recovered a bit. Shares rose 1.5% after falling nearly 5% Tuesday in heavy volume. To its credit, it has managed to hold above its 50-day moving average, but it's still below 2% below a prior 347.85 buy point.

  

In the airline group, new issue **Virgin America** ([VA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VA)) was the star of the day. Shares soared 14.5% on positive analyst chatter. It cleared an IPO base buy point of 39.24 and closed near the high end of a buy range, 4.5% past the buy point. There's a lot to like about the company, but single-digit sales growth in recent quarters gives pause.

  

So far this year, the airline group is up 81%. That's on the heels of a 74% gain in 2013. Most names in the group are well extended past proper buy points.

  

Crude oil lost $1.28, or 2.2%, to settle at $55.84 a barrel. On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said commercial crude stocks rose 7.3 million barrels from the previous week to 387.2 million barrels. Analysts expected a small decline.

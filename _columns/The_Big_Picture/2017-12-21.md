Stocks Rise Modestly; Here's The Next Potential Pitfall In Washington
======================================================================

U.S. stock indexes Thursday got an early start on the preholiday stance, as small caps showed the only substantial gains.




 The small-cap Russell 2000 pushed ahead 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 added 0.2% each. The Nasdaq eked out a 0.1% gain.


Volume was slightly down on the Nasdaq, no surprise in the run-up to Christmas. NYSE volume was slightly higher.


Congress' approval of the final wrap on the tax overhaul bill appeared to please the stock market. The corporate tax was slashed from 35% to 21%, which was high on Wall Street's wish list.

Corporate profits are far more important to the stock market as potential drivers.


The bill is now awaiting President Trump's signature. Because of technicalities that would trigger cuts in Medicare if the bill is signed in 2017, Trump might wait until early January to sign the tax overhaul into law.


Meanwhile, Congress dealt with another obstacle, a potential government shutdown. A stopgap spending bill, if approved, would keep government operating until Jan. 19. Congress faces a midnight Friday deadline. CNN reported Thursday that the Senate needs eight Democrat votes for the stopgap spending measure to pass.


In other news, the final reading on Q3 GDP rolled in at 3.2%, a tick below expectations for 3.3%. The range of estimates was tight (3.1% to 3.4%) so the miss wasn't an outlier.


Market action involved a slew of breakouts Thursday, but volume was subdued for most.



Stocks clearing buy points in strong volume — quite an accomplishment on a slow day — included oil plays **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) (regaining a 120.99 entry), **Concho Resources** ([CXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXO)), **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) and **RPC Inc.** ([RES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RES)); construction services provider **MasTec** ([MTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTZ)); insurer **American Financial Group** ([AFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFG)); and **WisdomTree Investments** ([WETF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WETF)) and **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)).


Those clearing buy points in volume less than 40% above average — the minimum thrust for a proper breakout — included airliners **Allegiant Travel** ([ALGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGT)) and **JetBlue Airways** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)); **Bank of Montreal** ([BMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMO)); miners **BHP Billiton** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) and **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)); carmaker **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)); and integrated oil companies **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) and **Royal Dutch Shell** ([RDSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDSA)).


Stocks that break out in insufficient volume should not be ignored. Individual investors should watch for big volume to kick in a bit late; they also might look at volume on the weekly chart.

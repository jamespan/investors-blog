U.S. equities perhaps needed to cool off after posting strong gains in the first week of 2021. The losses in stocks today no doubt helped tone down widespread enthusiasm, and that can be a good thing for Wall Street.




The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) jumped from a severely low level of 0.48. Meanwhile, the Cboe Market Volatility Index, or [the VIX](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), rose 11% for the week.


The S&P 500, hurt by intense selling in solar, oil and gas, airline, metal ores, gold mining and other commodity-related stocks, fell 0.7%. That decline got sandwiched by a 0.6% loss for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 0.9% retreat by the Nasdaq.


**Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) helped kick off a new season of quarterly results Thursday. Perhaps no one expected rosy numbers. The aviation giant [lost $2.53 a share for its fourth straight quarterly net loss](https://www.investors.com/news/delta-stock-delta-earnings-q4-2020-airline-stocks/). Sales plummeted 65% to $4 billion. Yet the stock ended just down a dime for the week. The Street thinks Delta will post earnings of $3.71 a share this year.



Delta stock respected the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) as well, and it's forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). The 10-week line has been rising since late May.


A Dec. 9 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the count for the S&P 500 due to time. However, the S&P 500 also picked up a new distribution day as NYSE turnover rose briskly. Thus, the count remains at five for the large-cap benchmark. Nasdaq volume dropped. This indicated that professional selling was limited.


![MP011521_3](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP011521_3-239x300.jpg)Friday's pullback did not change the fact that small caps are in the driver's seat.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) suffered its biggest loss of the year so far, down 1.5%. But at 210.67, it still posted a 10th up week over the past 11. The popular small-cap gauge also stands 7.4% higher since Jan. 1.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) eased 1.1% but preserved a 7.6% year-to-date gain. The ETF rallied 18.2% in 2020.


Poor economic data, headlined by a bigger than expected drop in December U.S. retail sales, wasn't a big surprise. America is facing a major dilemma in keeping the economy open while discouraging citizens from getting together. The distribution of Covid-19 vaccines has been criticized as too slow.


Portfolio managers perhaps are also raising a bit of cash ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of the 46th U.S. president as federal and state authorities wrestle with security issues. Plus, what will Joe Biden propose in the first 100 days in office? Will a large infrastructure plan and more direct relief to citizens help offset a potential tax hike, a $15-per-hour minimum wage and other policies?


For now, the two best things to do: Brush up on [key sell signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/lightning-strikes-twice-multiple-sell-signals-can-trigger-the-same-day/). Don't chase stocks [too far beyond a proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).



**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) demonstrated unusual weakness recently. The former fell 7% from a 217.75 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a seven-week flat base.

Meanwhile, other leaders including **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) are acting in healthy fashion.

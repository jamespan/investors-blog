title: Uncertain Stock Market Can't Find Direction, But This Sector Looks Bullish

For a stock market that hasn't found lasting direction in months, Monday seemed like the same old song and dance.




Indexes changed direction multiple times before ending about the middle of the day's price range.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 slid to new lows in a downdraft that is now nearly three weeks old. Despite the seesaw action, index price ranges Monday were narrower compared with the previous several sessions. Both indexes closed with losses of about 0.1%.


The S&P 500's hold on the 4400 level is in doubt. But the index made its low at 4370. That's significant, because it's 13 points above the 4357 close on March 16, when the S&P made its [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). So, technically the shaky uptrend survives.


 Nasdaq Still Looks Weak
------------------------


The same cannot be said for the Nasdaq, which undercut its March 18 follow-through more than a week ago. The tech-heavy index should be considered to be in a correction. And the generally poor action in tech stocks only reinforces that notion.


Four of the [lowest-ranking industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-apr-14-2022/) are in the software sector. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 10% so far this month.


Dow Finds Support
-----------------


While the Dow Jones Industrial Average lacks the breadth of other indexes, it nonetheless offered a positive signal Monday. The index's drop Monday came to a halt at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The Dow fell 0.1% also.


Indeed, the Dow has mostly held above this level since mid-March. The Dow's highs since then are trending lower, making it possible to draw a trendline over them. A move above that line would be another good sign. On Thursday, such a move started to happen, only to fade late in the day.


But small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 lost 0.7%, after the index met resistance at the 50-day moving average last week.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower also on the NYSE. That's a surprise because volume slowed on Thursday ahead of the three-day holiday break. Monday's NYSE trading was the third lowest this year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


In fact, since the quadruple witching on March 18, volume has been trending lower. Only seven days have seen above-average volume on the Nasdaq. NYSE trading topped the 50-day average only once in that span.


That could be another way the stock market is showing its lack of commitment. The uncertainly is why IBD's market outlook is "uptrend under pressure." Investors should be guarded about making any stock or ETF purchases. Keeping a good amount of cash is a good strategy for now.


Energy Sector Looks Strongest Of Stock Market
---------------------------------------------



There is still a bull market in the energy sector, where **Murphy Oil** ([MUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUR)) broke out of an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/) Monday. The oil and gas exploration and production company is in buy range from the 43.30 buy point to 45.47. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) also made new highs, a bullish sign.


The sector could have more gains ahead: Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 1.5% to lead all S&P sector ETFs. It broke out above the 80.32 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/).


**PDC Energy** ([PDCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDCE)) and **Shell** ([SHEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHEL)) are other oil stocks that broke out from [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/) in the past week.


The price of U.S. oil futures for May delivery rose 1.2% to $108.21 a barrel. Surging crude prices are one factor weighing on the rest of the stock market, just like rising Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-year yield added 3 basis points to 2.86%.


The stock market has plenty on its hands this week, with [dozens of earnings reports due](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/). Tuesday's headliners include **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)).


And it's not just the result that the stock market wants to know. Investors are watching how higher costs, labor and materials shortages could affect the coming quarters.

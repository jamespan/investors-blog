Stocks snapped back from early weakness to close with strong gains Monday as the market saw bad news as good news.

  

Helped by energy stocks, which were boosted by a 6% jump in oil prices, the S&P 500 jumped 0.7% and closed back above its 50-day moving average.

  

The Nasdaq rose 0.6%. Once again, the tech-heavy index defended its 50-day line.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.7%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.4% gain.

  

Friday's dismal employment report for March, which showed that the economy added the fewest jobs in 16 months, sent stocks reeling at the open. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell as much as 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively, before bouncing back.

  

The disappointing jobs data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve may hold off on raising interest rates. Stocks also benefited from a lower dollar .

  

Volume ended higher across the board, breaking a negative trend of gains in lower trade. But Thursday's soft trade made for an easy comparison.

  

Breadth was positive Monday, with winners beating losers by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE and about 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq.

  

Also on the plus side, the Feb. 27 distribution day fell off due to time. A distribution day is no longer relevant after 25 sessions.

  

But it still left the Nasdaq and S&P 500 with eight distribution days â€” an elevated level. So investors should continue to trade with a cautious stance. Buy only the top growth stocks breaking out of bases in big volume. Let the chart show you if there's healthy appetite from big investors for shares. Always sell when a stock falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price, if not sooner.

  

**Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) blew past a 63.60 buy point from a flat base. Monday's volume of just over 2 million shares was about five times its daily average, showing huge demand. The provider of outsourced IT services was No. 11 in Monday's IBD 50.

  

**Penske Automotive Group** ([PAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAG)) also broke out in strong turnover. The stock cleared a 52.80 buy point in a flat base and drove into new-high ground.

  

Still, for a big up day in the market, top-rated stocks up in big turnover were few. In the IBD 50, which rose 0.5%, only one-third of the 36 stocks up for the day rose in above-average trade. This trend shows selective buying on the part of professional investors.

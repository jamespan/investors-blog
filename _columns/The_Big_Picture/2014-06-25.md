IBD 50 Outperforms As Market Rally Gets Back On Track
======================================================

The major indexes made short work of Tuesday's negative reversal, posting solid gains on Wednesday. Volume was mixed.

  

News of a much deeper first-quarter contraction in the U.S. economy and a bigger-than-expected drop in May durable goods orders didn't faze the bulls. Leading stocks, meanwhile, outperformed the market, exactly what an IBD-style investor wants to see.

  

The IBD 50 rose 1%.

  

The Nasdaq composite, boosted by strength among large-cap techs, paced the field with a 0.7% gain Wednesday. That eclipsed Tuesday's 0.4% loss.

  

Volume shrank, perhaps the sole blemish on a day that featured positive technical action. Nasdaq gainers exceeded losers by more than a 3-to-2 margin.

  

On the NYSE, winners beat losers 2-to-1 as the S&P 500 gained 0.5%, recouping nearly all of Tuesday's 0.6% drop. NYSE volume edged higher. Big gains by oil plays **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)), **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) and **Cimarex Energy** ([XEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XEC)) helped the cause.

  

Tuesday's decline marked a third distribution day for the S&P 500 since the Nasdaq forged a follow-through on May 27. The nature of those declines, however, has been mild.

  

It is common to see traces of intense institutional selling along the way. Wednesday's action instills confidence that top-rated stocks are still in the right environment to break out to new highs.

  

The Market Pulse table shows numerous stocks with outstanding fundamental and technical traits that shoved higher in heavy volume. Make no mistake: Equity trading desks of top funds across the country are busy finding stocks that they believe will outperform the market.

  

It hasn't been easy to beat the market this year, if IBD's Mutual Fund Index is any guide. This index of top growth and value-style funds has not been able to keep pace with the S&P 500. However, certain sectors have been dominating the major indexes.

  

The second-ranked auto sector was up 17.8% through Wednesday; No. 3 energy was up 16%, No. 4 computers 11.5% and No. 6 chips 10.5%.

  

The sectors are listed partly in order of three-month price performance, not year-to-date performance. So it's possible for a higher-ranked sector to actually show a smaller gain measured from Jan. 1 to today than a lower-ranked one.

  

Meanwhile, the Sector Leaders list continues to generate buy ideas. The Sector Leaders continue to show a 12-month return that's well more than two times that of the S&P 500.

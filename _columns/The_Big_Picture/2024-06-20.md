For a stock market uptrend that's rested largely on the technology sector, Thursday's weakness in techs was a sobering change in behavior.




The Nasdaq composite — where techs dominate with [more than 62% of the index](https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/index/Breakdown/NDX) — reversed lower from a new high and closed down 0.8%. It ended a seven-day win streak, its longest since December.


More than 8% above its 50-day moving average before Thursday's slide, the market-leading index had become quite stretched, as [The Big Picture warned](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-today-nasdaq-sp500-dow-nvidia/) earlier this week.


The Nasdaq reflected the Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)), which also reversed lower from a new high and fell 1.1%. The sector exchange traded fund had climbed 12 of the previous 13 days, racing more than 13% higher from a May 31 low.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), one of the [most important tech stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-overtakes-apple-microsoft-as-most-valuable-company/), made a bearish reversal of its own. After rising to a record high, shares closed with a 3.5% loss. It was Nvidia's worst day in June so far. Other [artificial intelligence-related stocks fell](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-ai-chip-stocks-retreat-from-record-highs/) as well.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average bucked the rest of the market, rising 0.8% as it holds above the 50-day moving average. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) gave the Dow about 117 points of its nearly 300-point gain.


The S&P 500 lost nearly 0.3% just after it hit the 5,500 level.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Tuesday's totals (Markets closed Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday). That gave the S&P 500 and Nasdaq a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). The totals — four on the S&P and one on the Nasdaq — are tolerable.


Stock Market Breadth Weakens
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP062024.jpg)But market breadth is another worrisome trend for the stock market. While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have been rising, the advance-decline lines have been trending lower since mid-May. On Thursday, decliners topped advancers by a 9-to-7 ratio on the Nasdaq and losers edged by winners on the NYSE.


In the S&P 500, 67.2% of stocks are above their 200-day moving average. That's near the year's low of 63.8% made on June 14, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The reason the major indexes have climbed is mainly because of the extraordinary strength of major technology stocks such as Nvidia, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).


"It has been common in past cycles, as the stock market is coming into a meaningful top, that the biggest growth names are the ones carrying the load," Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, wrote in an analysis Thursday.


And such a thin leadership appears to be the case today, he added, as a handful of growth and tech companies rally thanks mainly to the artificial-intelligence theme.


Quoting Bloomberg data, Wren wrote that through May, the top five contributors to the S&P 500's return this year were responsible for nearly 58% of the index's gains. The average return of the top five was 40.8% while the rest of the index averaged less than 5%.


Small Caps Remain Stressed
--------------------------


The underperformance of small caps is another sign of concentrated stock market gains.


"Early in a new cycle, as investors anticipate and eventually see clearing skies on the horizon, they are typically more willing to take on additional risk and buy smaller companies as represented by the (Russell 2000)," Wren said. But the Russell lagged the S&P 500 through May (2.1% vs. 10.6% for the S&P). And the big-cap S&P 100 index was up 12.8%.


The Russell 2000 reversed lower 0.4% on Thursday, down nearly 2.6% so far in June. The index met resistance at the 50-day moving average, which is starting to bend downward. The S&P MidCap 400 index also met resistance at its 50-day line and fell 0.3% on the day.


Should investors be thinking defensively? Some moderation sure seems appropriate.


The stock market is needing to take a break from a productive month of June and work off some froth. IBD is keeping its recommended exposure level at 80% to 100%. That doesn't mean investors shouldn't take some profits. Aiming for 80% exposure makes sense right now.


The Nasdaq still has some rope left as it sits well above potential support levels at 17,000, the 21-day exponential moving average at around 17,245, and the 50-day average near 16,540.


The IBD 50 index fell 1.8% Thursday. **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) and **AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)) reversed lower from morning new highs.


Further, **Aspen Aerogels** ([ASPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASPN)), **Hims & Hers Health** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)) and **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) fell 8% to 10%, causing damage to the IBD 50.

A widening coronavirus outbreak chilled global markets Monday, sending the Nasdaq composite to the worst decline since December 2018 and causing a rethink of the market's outlook.




The Nasdaq sold off 3.7% and traded around session lows most of the day. It was its worst day since Dec. 4, 2018. The composite index closed below the 50-day moving average for the first time since Oct. 10.


The S&P 500 was routed 3.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.6%. Both wiped away all gains for the year. The S&P 500 closed 2% below its 50-day line.


Declines below these levels could signal a change in market direction to the downside. Volume swelled, marking the third straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq (four total) and the sixth total on the S&P 500.


With bearish signs piling up, IBD lowered its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure." Investors should avoid new stock purchases other than in exceptional cases. More important, [sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Get off margin, and take some profits to reduce exposure.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP022420-207x300.jpg)Selling was broad, with declining stocks over advancers by almost a 9-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by more than 6-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Most of the selling followed a trail back to coronavirus, which has [infected more than 79,000 people and killed more than 2,600](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200224-sitrep-35-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=1ac4218d_2). Outbreaks were reported in Italy, Iran and other countries.


The airlines industry group dived more than 5% as fear of catching the virus cools demand for travel. Economically sensitive sectors such as energy, retail, consumer discretionary and financials were down more than 4%. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) dropped more than 4%, as the virus causes key tech suppliers to shut down.


A Wedbush analyst warned that [Apple's supply chain is not likely to return to full capacity until late April](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-other-techs-fall-coronavirus-outbreak-spreads/) or early May.



Apple shares slid below the 50-day moving average for the first time since the stock's breakout Sept. 11. Shares of tech suppliers such as semiconductor companies were rattled. IShares PHLX Sox Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) gapped to a loss of 4.7% and sank below the 50-day moving average.


The unpredictable progress of the disease leaves investors in a fog, and uncertainty is the market's enemy. The more factory closures, supply chain disruptions and travel cutbacks, the greater the chance of a global economic slowdown.


Foreign Stock Markets Also Lower
--------------------------------


In Asia, the Shanghai composite fell 0.3% overnight, ahead of the sell-off in U.S. stocks. But the Hang Seng benchmark in Hong Kong lost 1.8%. Losses were larger in Europe. London's FTSE 100 plunged 3.5%; the German DAX lost 4%; Paris CAC 40 slid 3.9%.


The U.S. bond market — which had been signaling weaker economic conditions since the start of the year — saw more money rush in. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.369% late Monday afternoon after hitting a session low of 1.355%, according to TradeWeb. The record low intraday yield is 1.325%, set on July 6, 2016. The 30-year Treasury yield hit a Monday low of 1.812%, a record low for the 30-year Treasury.


Fear is growing in the stock market itself. The Cboe market volatility index, or VIX, [shot up to the highest level since January 2019](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility). The put-call volume ratio topped 1.0, the highest since a 1.06 reading in late January.


Ultimately, such elevated levels of fear can be good for the stock market. The way the market works, excessive fear is often detected at market lows. In early August, when the VIX saw a similar spike as on Monday, the S&P 500 made a low that would hold the rest of the year and into today's market. The put-call volume ratio, though, has not climbed to the levels that marked previous index lows.


The IBD 50 slid 3.4%; there was no refuge in leading stocks. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) lost nearly 8% in heavy trade. But the chip designer, which is in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), held at its 50-day line. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) slid 7%; **Ichor Holdings** ([ICHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICHR)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) shed about 5% each.


Health care was another sector down broadly, but perhaps for different reasons. Health insurers plunged 6.8% in an apparent response to Sen. Bernie Sanders' caucus victory in Nevada. The vote sharpens Sanders' lead for the Democratic nomination and raises the odds of the elimination of private health plans. **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)), **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)), **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) and **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) gapped below their [50-day averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).

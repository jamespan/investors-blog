What To Do Now
--------------


IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60%-80%. The overall outlook remains "confirmed uptrend."


The indexes remain pretty far above their 50-day moving averages, which would be a logical support area if the market pulls back further. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 continues to carry a high number of distribution days, with seven.


Still, there's nothing that should keep investors from looking for new breakouts or strong rebounds from key support levels.


A great resource for finding daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks topping buy points. In Thursday's list, there were five breakouts, including **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) and **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)).


The MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows a handful of stocks nearing buy points in bases. For example, **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) is within striking distance of a flat base's 156.01 buy point.

Dow Jones, Nasdaq Post Weekly Gains; Is Market Psychology Overly Bullish? Here's What One Fund Manager Thinks

Amid fresh signs that America will get closer to a pre-Covid-19 state of living, investors accumulated more stocks to cap a solid week for the indexes.




As New York City began to allow indoor dining at limited scale and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a plan to reopen schools across the country, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 finished Friday 0.5% higher. That edged out a 0.3% rise by iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) and a 0.1% move up by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


Even sector indexes participated. The Dow Jones transportation average rushed 1.7% higher.


Many market veterans like to see this market sector rise in tandem with the Dow and other key indexes. It suggests growing confidence that the economy is picking up steam.

![MP021221-](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP021221--269x300.jpg)Interestingly, a dour initial report on the University of Michigan's consumer survey — 76.2 for February, below the 80.9 [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) — did not dissuade the bulls. Investors harvested more profits in long-dated U.S. Treasurys. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond jumped to 2%, to an 11-month high.


Better Than Dow Jones Or Nasdaq
-------------------------------


Headed into the Presidents Day holiday weekend, [CAN SLIM-type stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) continued their year-to-date dominance.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), up 1.3% on Friday, stretched its advance since Jan. 1 to 19.8%, vs. up 5% for the SPDR S&P 500 ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) exchange traded fund. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) is up 7.3%.


Earnings results may help explain why. Ed Yardeni at Yardeni Research says the size of profit and revenue surprises among S&P 500 firms "have been much greater over the three quarters of the Great Virus Crisis (GVC) than they were coming out of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC)." He added that the "big difference is that the GFC involved a severe recession caused by a prolonged credit crunch."


The CBOE Volatility Index ([the VIX](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility)) closed the week at 19.97, down 6%. Far cry from the Jan. 27 spike up to 37.51 amid a new wave of coronavirus cases plaguing the U.S. Is complacency too high? Not necessarily.


Watch The VIX
-------------


Andrew Slimmon, who leads Morgan Stanley Institutional U.S. Core (MUOIX) and two more funds, notes the VIX tends to shoot up after a sharp single-session drop in the 2% to 3% range. This fear spike hints at investors heading to the exits, raising cash. But he thinks this gauge of market volatility on the S&P 500 index options will eventually drop to pre-coronavirus stock market crash levels.


Focus on the 11-to-12 level, which the VIX in fact reached often from March 2019 to February 2020, "because that's the final euphoria phase. People feel safe. That's the blowoff phase," Slimmon told IBD in a phone chat on Tuesday.


[Bullishness among pundits polled weekly by Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) dropped below 60% in early February.

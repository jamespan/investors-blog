Stock market bears slammed the bulls again Friday, extending the market's losing streak to five sessions for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average reduced its loss to 0.4% after being down as much as 1.25%. The Nasdaq skidded 1.3%, while the S&P 500 sliced off 0.7%. The small-caps Russell 2000 dropped 1.1%.


Volume declined across the board, helping the market avoid a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). A distribution day points to institutional selling.


The Street wrapped up an odd week. The market got two big things it wanted: a decent number of strong earnings reports and an interest-rate cut.

The major stock indexes fell every day of the week — the first time that has happened since early March.


Top-Rated Stocks In The Stock Market
------------------------------------


Also, many top-rated stocks skidded. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) fell 6% for the week; **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), 5%; **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), 8%; **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), 4%; **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), 3.6%; **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), 6%; and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), 4.5%.


**ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) closed below its 10-week line in volume more than 60% above average. That's a sell signal for the stock, which has been a winner in 2019.


On the upside, customer contact software maker **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)) rocketed 20% for the week; analytics software maker **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)), 7%; and October initial public offering and Brazil payment processor **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)), more than 6%.


President Trump fueled a negative reversal in stocks Thursday, when he revealed he would smack China with additional tariffs.


Trump Reaches Trade Agreement With Europe
-----------------------------------------


On Friday, Trump conducted a signing of a trade agreement with Europe. The two sides hammered out a deal on U.S. beef exports after roughly 10 months of negotiations.


If there was an unspoken message surrounding the showcasing of the beef agreement, the message was for China. Trump appeared to signal that deals are possible but not if China reneges as they did in May.


Also, the beef agreement demonstrated that Trump's trade strategy can be realistic. The question now is: Can China bend for the overall good?


The stock market seemed to find a bottom for the day with the beef news but couldn't reverse the market's negative tone.


For trade news to move the stock market now, it appears it must be more than a promise. A solid agreement is necessary.


Technically, Friday was a session begging for more evidence for the bulls and the bears. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each closed near their 50-day moving averages. A battle for control at that key line is likely in the coming week and its outcome will influence the market's trend.


Exchange Traded Funds
---------------------


Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 4.3% for the week, while Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) echoed the move. Both closed under their 10-week lines.


The SPDR Utilities ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) stayed positive, creeping 0.3% higher for the week as investors sought havens. Electric utility **Southern Co.** ([SO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SO)) rose 0.7% Friday and 2.9% for the week. Southern is up 31% so far in 2019.

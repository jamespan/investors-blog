title: Stocks Rally Late To Extend Win Streak; Three Lessons From The Coronavirus Market

The stock market surged in the final minutes of trading Tuesday, securing a third straight gain and extending a surprisingly headstrong advance for the market.




Facing multiple crises simultaneously, the stock market just keeps climbing. It seems that nothing can rattle indexes off their upward course.


A week of sometimes violent protests has shaken U.S. cities, but not Wall Street. Even retail, the sector most affected by looting, is up more than 3% this week.


The May jobs report on Friday is expected to show an [unemployment rate of nearly 20%](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). That seems to be no problem for the stock market. The coronavirus pandemic, and rising tensions with China? Just a flesh wound, to quote an old Monty Python movie.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP060220-261x300.jpg)The S&P 500 rose 0.8% Tuesday for a third consecutive gain. After a pause in the first two weeks of May, the S&P 500 is trending higher again. The Nasdaq composite added 0.6%, although the index sputtered for much of the day until the final 15 minutes. There were no headlines to explain the sudden rally, leaving only strong investor demand as the cause.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 1%. After slumping late last week, the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.9% and is up for the week. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE, indicating that institutional investors only increased their pace of buying.


IBD 50 Climbs But Health, Mining Stocks Fall
--------------------------------------------


The IBD 50 rose 0.5% after mining and health care stocks underperformed. IBD 50 stock **GoDaddy** ([GDDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDDY)) broke out past the 78.54 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a deep [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in volume 31% above average.


The technical lessons of this stock market uptrend are surprising and valuable to study. Indexes crashed with breakneck speed starting in late February, as the severity of Covid-19 and its economic damage caught investors off-guard. Such [black swan events](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp) can alter the normal behavior of markets, and that happened this year with the worst pandemic in about 100 years.


Another lesson is that the coronavirus bear market unfolded in atypical fashion. Most bear markets see three waves of selling before they bottom out for good. This time, the market went pretty much straight down until its low on March 23. With the Nasdaq near new highs now, it's hard to argue that the market could be headed for another leg down.


A third lesson was the way in which the market rebounded, and it also reflects the unusual circumstances. A [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on April 2 seemed suspicious at first. A vertical violation that saw indexes crash through their 50-day moving averages suggested that the follow-through may fail. Instead, another follow-through came a couple of days later on the Nasdaq and the market was on its way.


Perhaps we saw a preview of the 2020 market way back in January. The market sold off after the U.S. killed a top Iranian general, sparking an international crisis. But by Jan. 9, the conflict was over and the market was rising.


Don't Overlook The Fed
----------------------


Today, Wall Street appears to believe the social unrest won't last much longer. Its main focus remains on reopening the economy. But don't overlook the Federal Reserve, which analysts believe is propping up the market with overwhelming stimulus.


UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investment officer Mark Haefele said in a research report that data on the virus does not show a second wave of infections so far, allowing for lockdown measures to continue lifting. "But extraordinary levels of central bank liquidity provision should support higher-than-normal equity market multiples over the course of the coming year, particularly if investors begin to 'look through' the coronavirus crisis."

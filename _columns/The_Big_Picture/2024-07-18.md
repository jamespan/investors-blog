The stock market ended sharply lower Thursday, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite extended Wednesday's sell-offs. Two more of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), succumbed to selling to close below key levels, while **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) slipped on earnings after the close.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.3%, reversing lower after posting another record high. The S&P 500 lost 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 0.7%. For the Nasdaq, it was the largest two-day decline since Oct. 25-26, 2023, per Dow Jones Market Data.


The small-cap Russell 2000 index dropped nearly 1.9%, as broad-based selling hit the stock market. All but one of the 11 sectors that comprise the S&P 500 traded lower; the energy sector was the sole winner.


Volume dipped on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That prevented the Nasdaq and S&P 500 from adding new [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). Declining stocks topped advancers by about a 3-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Late Thursday, **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and Netflix reported their quarterly earnings results. Intuitive shares jumped almost 7% in extended trading, while Netflix stock pared losses to less than 1%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


In the Dow Jones index, recent breakouts **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) were the biggest losers, both declining 3.2%. Amid broad selling, only three Dow components ended positive: **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)).

[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), Amazon and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) were the latest tech titans to give up their 50-day moving averages. Amazon slipped 2.2% and Google stock lost 1.8%, closing slightly below its 50-day average.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) sold off 2.2% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) sharply outperformed, rising 1.5% to hit a fresh high.


Wednesday marked a change in character for the stock market, as the Nasdaq closed below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) for the first time since May 2. And because the important tech sector saw more damage, IBD reduced its recommended exposure level to 60%-80%. It had been at the most bullish 80%-100% level for six weeks.


Investors should continue to monitor their stock holdings, and right now any stock that breaks a support level or falls more than 7% from a buy point should be sold promptly. For example, **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) plunged as much as 10% at its lows before bouncing above the 50-day line. Shares nearly erased the entirety of a big gain from a 36.17 cup-base entry, which triggered a [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/key-sell-signal-saved-stamps-com-stock-investors-from-posting-big-losses/#:~:text=Any%20time%20a%20stock%20surrenders,rules%20to%20protect%20your%20portfolio.).


Lastly, [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list was barren Thursday, which makes sense given the session's broad selling.


In this environment, the name of the game is to respect the rotation. Cut your losses in positions that aren't working out and refocus into the areas that are working. But remember to pace yourself and don't chase extended stocks.

S&P 500 Leader D.R. Horton Surges To All-Time High
--------------------------------------------------


Stocks to watch include **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Garmin** ([GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)) and **Toast** ([TOST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOST))


S&P 500 stock D.R. Horton surged more than 10% Thursday after the company's June-quarter results beat market expectations. Shares rallied to a fresh high, and are sharply extended past a 157.72 double-bottom entry, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).


Garmin closed down 1.1% Thursday, just below a 171.64 buy point in a flat base. And Toast ended the session with a 0.4% loss, still in buy range above a 26.29 entry in a cup with handle.

title: Stock Indexes Undercut Lows, But Rebound Sharply, Leaving This Big Question

The stock indexes gave investors a fright Tuesday but also a delightful rebound. The question now is, will the market extend its rebound or fade like it did in recent days?




The best way to find out is to keep tracking the day-to-day action in both price and volume.


Stocks sold off around the world as worries mounted over [economic growth](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/dow-jones-index-recovers-global-economic-boom-fades/), geopolitical flare-ups, tariff disputes and other issues. London's FTSE 100 fell 1.2%, Germany's DAX 2.2% and the Paris CAC 40 1.7%. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index plunged 3.1%, the Shanghai composite 2.3% and the Nikkei 2.7%.


Selling spread to Wall Street, where the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 plunged as much as 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively, early Tuesday. The two indexes undercut their Oct. 11 lows, which is no small matter.

A [follow-through bottoming signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) will need to wait at least a few more days.


Watch The Intraday Action
-------------------------


Selling was most intense in the first 45 minutes of trading. From that point on, the indexes started to bounce back and continued recovering practically into the close.


The Nasdaq composite closed 0.4% lower and the S&P 500 down nearly 0.6%. With indexes closing near session highs, the day appeared to serve as a good shakeout. Volume rose across the board.


At today's low, the Nasdaq was down more than 10% from its prior high, which is how investors usually define a market correction. IBD already had [cut its market outlook to a correction on Oct. 10](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/bears-stocks-correction/) and it remains in that status.


The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5% after slouching as much as 2.2%. The industrials found support around the 25,000 level, much as they did a week and a half ago.


It wasn't clear what caused stocks to rebound. Regardless, stock investors were relieved to see the market erase sizable losses.

Tuesday's impressive price reversal puts the market back at a fresh rally attempt. But volatility could render a new rebound useless. Indexes made encouraging moves Oct. 12 and 16, only to turn right back to their losing ways.


How The Stock Market May Bottom Out
-----------------------------------


When indexes fall sharply below their 50-day moving averages, they tend to take a few tries before they settle into a sustained advance. In February through April, the market made at least three attempts before it secured an uptrend.


Another important point is that most leading stocks remain deep in corrections. [In the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), about three dozen stocks are below their 50-day moving average and a few more are below the 200-day line. Indeed, many leaders have not even started to form the right side of bases.


Only a few — **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) — seem better equipped for [potential breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



So far the market correction hasn't been long enough to leave leaders with [bases of sufficient length](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). Thus, investors should be prepared to be patient and stay in the comfort of cash for now.


Earnings season is getting to its most critical phase, with reports nearing for some more FANG companies. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are going into Thursday's earnings announcements with weakened charts.


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT,](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT%2C)) **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) are other headliners this week. Investors should brace themselves for more earnings-related volatility.


New Earnings Keep Driving Stock Prices
--------------------------------------


Five Dow Jones industrial components reported earnings Tuesday, which stretched certain components of the 30-stock blue-chip index in opposite directions. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) [plunged on their earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-earnings-united-tech-earnings-3m-earnings/), while **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) rose sharply. [McDonald's beat views](https://www.investors.com/news/mcdonalds-earnings-q3-mcdonalds-stock/) and was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


Historically, October is not kind to stocks and that's proving true this year. The Nasdaq's loss this month of 7.6% is the worst since January 2016. The S&P 500's 6% loss in October is the largest since August 2015. This month's correction is entering the same league as the nearly 12% sell-off that occurred from Jan. 29 to Feb. 9.

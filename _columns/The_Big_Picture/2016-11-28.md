Stocks took a breather Monday as Wall Street braced for a busy week of economic data. Miners and utilities outperformed, while retailers were generally quiet despite more data that showed the holiday shopping season is off to a strong start.


The Dow held up the best, falling just 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended near session lows with losses of 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in much higher than Friday's half-session. No big surprise there, but technically it counts as a distribution day.


![mp112816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP112816.png)Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by nearly 2-to-1. The ratio was slightly more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


The Russell 2000's 15-session win streak came to a grinding halt Monday. It lost 1.3%. The small-cap index, along with the Dow, were the first indexes to score all-time highs earlier in the month.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) lost 0.9%.


Selling might've been muted in the major averages, but a couple of stocks that were seen to be beneficiaries of a Trump presidency fell sharply after big moves, particularly aggregate makers like **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) and **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)). Vulcan slumped nearly 6%, while Martin Marietta lost 4%.


With many stocks extended past proper buy points, it's possible that some will pull back to buying areas in coming days. Keep in mind that when a stock pulls back into a 5% buy zone, it's always best to see the pullback occur in orderly trade and light volume. Using Vulcan and Martin Marietta as examples, Martin Marietta's pullback Monday looked much better than Vulcan's, which came in more than double the usual volume as the stock closed below the 127.30 buy point.


Several high-quality names are in good setups and near buy points, but are there enough institutional buyers around to fuel meaningful breakouts? The answer to that question isn't so clear.


**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) is near the top of a flat base with a 178.12 buy point; **Middleby** ([MIDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIDD)) is just below a 141.08 entry and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) is working on a double-bottom base with a 268.88 buy point. Ulta reports earnings Thursday after the close.


Among the day's movers, China-based **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) jumped nearly 6% to 51.79 in strong volume. It's back above its 50-day moving average as a potential base takes shape.


**Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), which recently cleared an 87.18 buy point in light volume, soared 9% in Monday's after-hours session on strong earnings.


Benchmark Nymex crude oil settled at $47.08 a barrel, up $1.02, or 2.2% on growing concerns that an output cut at Wednesday's OPEC meeting might not be a slam dunk after all.


U.S.-based oil and gas producers were hard hit. Fast-growing **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) reversed sharply lower after a breakout attempt. Shares slumped 7% in busy trading.


Retailers were generally quiet despite news of strong Cyber Monday sales. U.S. online retail sales on Black Friday rose 21.6% to $3.34 billion, according to data from Adobe. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was unfazed by the news, falling 1.7%. It's been consolidating gains below the 50-dayÂ  moving average since late October.


A busy week of economic data kicks off Tuesday with the release of second estimate to Q3 gross domestic product. Personal income and spending data are due Wednesday, the ISM manufacturing index is due Thursday and the November employment report is due Friday.

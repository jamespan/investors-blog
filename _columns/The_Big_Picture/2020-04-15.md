  Stock Market Pauses After Bullish Move Off Lows; These Leading Growth Stocks Show More Strength

The stock market ended firmly lower Wednesday, but the bulls walked away feeling pretty good as several institutional-quality growth stocks withstood the selling quite well.




**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) extended gains after recent breakouts. So did lesser-known names like **Livongo Health** ([LVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVGO)) and **Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)).


Headline flow has been positive around Netflix ahead of the company's earnings report next week. Earlier this week, Evercore ISI said global downloads of Netflix apps jumped 57% year over year in March. In the Asia-Pacific region, downloads surged 124%. Netflix got [price target hikes](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-hits-record-high-more-consumers-chill-with-its-service/) from Cowen & Co. and Pivotal Research Wednesday.


Small caps took the biggest hit as the Russell 2000 dived more than 4%. The S&P 500 slumped 2.2%, weighed down by another sell-off in oil stocks, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.9%. The Nasdaq composite was resilient again, down 1.4%, and the Nasdaq 100 eased just over 1%. The Nasdaq 100 barely budged after a bullish gap above the 50-day moving average Tuesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP041520-253x300.jpg)Sure, it would have been nice to see the Nasdaq composite hold above Tuesday's low, but the index traded in a tight range all day. It also held high in the gap area created with Tuesday's rally. After rising nearly 8% the prior four sessions, the Nasdaq's 1.4% drop Wednesday didn't look so bad.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) because volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday. There hasn't been one instance of distribution in the S&P 500 since the index's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) on April 2. The Nasdaq showed a mild one on April 7, one day after Nasdaq followed through on the 11th day of its rally attempt. But the distribution day dropped off the count Tuesday after the Nasdaq rallied more than 5% from its April 7 close.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


That growth stocks are acting so well is a good sign for the nascent uptrend. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) portfolio has several new positions that are working, and IBD growth screens are teeming with prospects. Many ideas are discussed on [IBD Live](https://www.investors.com/ibdlive) each day.


In IBD's [Long-Term Leaders portfolio](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/), **Amedisys** ([AMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMED)) jumped 3.5%. It's still in buy range from a buy point at 202.86. Long-term leaders **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) and **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) are also acting well.



Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) turned in a strong showing for the third straight session. It fell 0.8% but closed in the upper third of the day's price range, helped by strength in **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), Netflix, **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and Veeva Systems.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock Dexcom reclaimed a 281.07 entry in light volume. Fortinet is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 112.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Managed care firm **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) outperformed in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), helped by strong earnings from **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) before the open. UnitedHealth was the strongest performer in the Dow Jones today, up 4.1%. Centene broke out Wednesday, topping a 68.74 buy point, but recent gains have come in light volume.



Economic Data
-------------


The latest Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers showed the bulls rising to 40.9% from 33.3%. The bulls were at 30.1% on March 24, one day after the Nasdaq started a new rally attempt. Increasing bullishness normally isn't a good thing because the survey is a contrarian indicator. But the latest reading of 40.9% is well below the 60% threshold that has been seen near market tops in the past.


Two economic reports before the open spooked investors. [March retail sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/coronavirus-shutdown-jobs-report-jobless-benefits/) fell 8.7%, slightly worse than the consensus estimate of a 7.3% decline. Meanwhile, the Empire State Manufacturing index hit an all-time low of -78.2, worse than the consensus estimate of -35. The previous low point was -34.3, set during the financial crisis.


But the stock market always looks ahead, and a strong rally off lows is the market's way of saying that it sees brighter times ahead. The economy is expected to contract significantly in Q2, and again in Q3, with growth picking back up slowly in Q4.

VanEck Vectors Retail ETF ([RTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTH)) ended a six-session win streak, but it was an orderly decline. Shares fell 1.5%, but the ETF closed in the upper half of Wednesday's range.


The weak reports were a stark reminder of a tough road ahead for the U.S. economy. The reports also fueled a new round of bond buying, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 12 basis points to 0.63%.


U.S. crude oil futures settled at $19.87 a barrel, down 1.2%. Oil is at its lowest level since early 2002 amid waning demand and a production glut.

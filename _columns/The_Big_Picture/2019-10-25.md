The Nasdaq 100 put an exclamation point on another solid week of trading with an all-time high Friday. The stock market initially focused on a weak earnings report from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), but strong earnings from **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and optimism about a China trade deal trumped sluggish results from Amazon.




The Nasdaq 100 capped its fourth straight weekly gain, rising 0.8%, helped by strong showings from Intel, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and Leaderboard stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Bullish Performance For Stock Market
------------------------------------


The three major stock indexes also ended with solid gains. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.7%, the Dow Jones industrials rose 0.6% and the S&P 500 picked up 0.4%. The latter came to within less than 1 point of its late-July all-time high of 3027.98.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP102519-274x300.jpg)The Nasdaq's performance was particularly impressive considering that Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5% in premarket trading. Sentiment was weak early after Amazon reported disappointing [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-earnings-third-quarter-stock/) and issued cautious guidance. But Amazon significantly pared a 4.8% early decline, ending with a loss of just 1%. Shares fell as much as 9% in Thursday's after-hours session.


Stocks strengthened after a CNBC report said the U.S. and China are close to finalizing parts of a phase-one trade deal.


The Nasdaq lost two distribution days Friday, lowering its count to six. The Sept. 20 higher-volume decline fell off because enough time has passed to make it no longer relevant. The S&P 500 also lost its Sept. 20 distribution day. The Oct. 8 distribution day was dropped because of the Nasdaq's strong rally since that day.


Based on the market's recent action, the bulls have reason to be optimistic about a year-end rally. With the stock market in a confirmed uptrend, be on the lookout for new buys, but keep positions small to start.


Other Stock Market Movers
-------------------------


Intel gapped up and cleared a 53.60 entry following a [bullish earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chipmaker-intel-crushes-third-quarter-sales-earnings-targets/) and strong guidance. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) hit an all-time high, rising 2%.



Advanced Micro Devices is the next high-profile semiconductor stock set to report earnings. Results are due Tuesday after the close. AMD was featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/amd-stock-rallies-amid-semiconductor-turnaround/) column.


Strong gainers in the MarketSmith Growth 250 included **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)). Shares rallied sharply for the second straight session. Amid a lot of selling in the software sector in recent weeks, RingCentral continues to hold its own. Shares gapped up powerfully earlier this month on news of a [potentially lucrative partnership](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ringcentral-stock-rng-avaya-partnership/) with telecom **Avaya** ([AVYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVYA)).


Meanwhile, **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) and **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) continue to work on flat bases ahead of earnings reports.

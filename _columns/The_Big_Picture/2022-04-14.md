The stock market plunged Thursday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off sharply in the short week's final trading session. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield surged to 2.82%, its highest level since December 2018.




The stock market's biggest news of the day was Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk's buyout offer of **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)). [Musk offered to buy Twitter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-fell-after-elon-musk-made-offer/) for $54.20 a share in cash. "I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy," Musk said in an SEC filing.


Twitter shares reversed from big gains to fall 1.7%, while electric-vehicle giant **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) skidded 3.7% Thursday. It continues to form a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), however.


On the earnings front, **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) [smashed estimates for the first quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-crushes-q1-targets/) and guided higher for the current period. But shares reversed from early gains to drop 3.1% and are more than 30% off their 52-week high.

Both stocks ended slightly lower after erasing earlier gains.


Struggling Stock Market Uptrend
-------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3% Thursday, while the S&P 500 ended 1.2% lower and back below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dived 2.1%, more than giving up the entirety of Wednesday's gains.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, but it appeared to be higher on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session, resulting in a new distribution day for the S&P 500. The updated [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) stands at five on the S&P 500 and four on the Nasdaq. Amid the recent stock market volatility, the market outlook remains an "uptrend under pressure."


The Nasdaq has wiped out all gains from its March 18 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) and is below its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 is still above its March 16 follow-through, for now. (The stock market will be closed for Good Friday.)


Top growth stocks also moved down sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 1.1%. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Packaging Corp. of America** ([PKG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKG)) advanced 2.1% to hit a new high. On the IBD 50's downside, **W.W. Grainger** ([GWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWW)) tumbled 6.8% after an analyst downgrade. A weak attempt to clear the 527.16 buy point has faded quickly.

Ulta Beauty Is A Stock Market Leader
------------------------------------



Despite a struggling stock market uptrend, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) in one of the top stocks to watch. Shares are in the [5% buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) past a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) 408.83 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The buy area goes up to 429.27.


The stock's relative strength line is at new highs. Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [ULTA stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-ulta-beauty-inc-ulta.aspx) shows a solid 90 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


Keep in mind that if the general market conditions continue to deteriorate, even the best stocks will succumb to the weakness. Be sure to cut any losses at 7%-8% below the buy point to avoid further losses.



Earnings Season Heats Up
------------------------


Earnings season kicked off this week with results from a number of high-profile financial names. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), Goldman Sachs, **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) [all reported this week](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-jpmorgan-earnings-goldman-sachs/) with mixed reactions.


Next week, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) will report results Tuesday after the market close. [Netflix](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-braces-for-first-quarter-report/) could be set for its slowest growth in 10 years. NFLX shares are more than 50% off their 52-week high.

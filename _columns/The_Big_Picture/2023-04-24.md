title: Stock Market Remains Lackluster, But That Can All Change This Week. Here's Why.

Dull stock market trading could come to a swift end this week, when some of the best-known tech giants announce first-quarter results.




On Monday, indexes remained quiet and directionless, as if holding their breath for this week's reports. Roughly one-third of the S&P 500 companies will announce quarterly results this week.


That includes megacaps **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) [on Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) on Wednesday, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Thursday, and oil giants **ExxonMobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) on Friday.


There's no denying the biggest stocks have an outsize influence on the broad stock market, especially in market-cap-weighted indexes.


In the first quarter, the 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 were responsible for 90% of the index's 7% increase, according to Charles Schwab strategists Liz Ann Sonders and Kevin Gordon.


Apple, Microsoft and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) alone contributed more than 50%. The others were **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).

On Monday, the Nasdaq composite fell 0.3% while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed less than 0.2%.


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq, extending a trend of below-average trading since late March.


Stock Market Direction Unclear
------------------------------


With the major indexes still seeking direction, it's hard for investors to make money in stocks. Stock-picking is a prized skill in this type of environment.


On the one hand, the stock market's calm demeanor in past weeks can signal constructive action, showing investors holding onto sizable first-quarter gains rather than taking profits. An old Wall Street refrain says, "Never short a dull market."


On the other hand, lack of progress shows investors are unwilling to commit more capital.


One measure of stock market internals shows a soft spot in the Nasdaq, where new lows have outnumbered new highs since March. However, new lows and new highs are nearly even this month in the NYSE.


While market direction can be difficult to discern right now, investors do have some tools to judge risk.


Distribution, Leading Stocks Offer Clues
----------------------------------------



First, look at the degree of distribution in the main indexes, which can be a subtle indication of institutional selling. The Nasdaq has three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) in the past five weeks and the S&P 500 only one. That's a tolerable amount. The Nasdaq avoided another distribution day Monday, thanks to a slight decline in Nasdaq volume.


Leading stocks provide another important layer of market analysis. Taking the IBD 50 as a gauge of growth leadership, direction also is uncertain.


Both the IBD 50 and Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) indexes have been stuck in horizontal ranges since November. The IBD 50 index fell 0.2% Monday. The Breakout Opportunities ETF climbed 0.5%.


There have been dozens of breakouts to support the current stock market uptrend but many have been of dubious quality, lacking strong volume. So far, however, few breakouts have failed, even if many of the stocks are less than 5% above buy points.


On Monday, **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) **ExxonMobil** and **Hologic** ([HOLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOLX)) made low-volume breakouts.

The stock market ended with sharp losses Thursday on rising Treasury yields and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments on rate policy.




Midday Thursday, stocks were sent squarely into the red after [an auction of Treasury bonds](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasurys-24-billion-30-year-bond-auction-goes-poorly-trader-says-e2eeed5e) was weak, MarketWatch reported. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 12 basis points, settling at 4.63%.


Powell sent stocks further lower in afternoon trade after he said the Fed was "not confident" it had done enough to combat inflation. [Powell said](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerome-powell-outlines-cautious-approach-to-raising-rates-or-declaring-end-to-hikes-9546a3c3) it was too early for the central bank to declare an end to its interest-rate increases, even though he didn't make an argument for raising rates further.


Stock market leaders **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) are stocks to watch in the ongoing stock market uptrend.

[ARM stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/arm-stock-falls-as-chip-designer-disappoints-with-outlook/) tumbled 5.2%, while Duolingo shares leapt 21%. HubSpot shares dived 6.1%, and [CART stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/instacart-tops-sales-expectations-in-first-earnings-report-after-ipo/) plunged more than 10%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, indexes closed near their lows, finishing sharply in the red.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off 0.9% to snap its nine-day win streak. And the small-cap Russell 2000 led the way lower with a 1.6% decline.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP110923-230x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That gave the Nasdaq and S&P 500 their first [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) since the start of the new uptrend.


**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) led the Dow as shares surged nearly 7% after the media giant [beat earnings forecasts](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-dow-giant-looks-to-end-2023-on-a-high-note-streaming-rival-to-report-results/) and raised its ambitious cost restructuring targets. Disney reported adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share excluding certain items, a 173% increase from 30 cents per share last year. Revenue climbed 5% to $21.24 billion.


On the downside, **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) was the biggest Dow loser, sliding 3.4% Thursday. AMGN stock closed back below its 50-day line.


And top growth stocks were also slightly lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dipped 0.3%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/),Â **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) rallied more than 1%, closing above the 50-day line for the first time since Sept. 20.


What To Do Now: Watch Pullbacks
-------------------------------


Despite Thursday's losses, IBD recommends an exposure level of 40% to 60% until investors see how the stock market handles a normal pullback. Ideally, stocks should pull back in lower volume before finding institutional demand around support levels, such as previous buy points and moving averages.


In the meantime, continue to look for new breakouts. And a great resource for daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks that are breaking out past new buy points. Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows stocks nearing buy points in bases.

Stock Market Leaders: Celsius, Nvidia, ServiceNow
-------------------------------------------------



These stock market leaders are in or near buy zones in today's market action:


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Celsius made a bullish move back above its 50-day line this week, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. Shares are breaking out past an [early entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 175.63. But Thursday's 2.7% drop means this could be a risky entry. CELH stock continues to move up the right side of a cup base that sports an official buy point at 206.85.


[Graphics-chip maker Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/nvidia-stock-unleashes-barrage-of-ai-enhancements-storms-new-buy-point/) is trying to break out past a 476.09 buy point in a double bottom. The stock closed below the entry, up 0.8% Thursday. The 5% buy area goes up to 499.89.


ServiceNow is in buy range past a 607.90 entry in a double bottom. The 5% buy zone goes up to 638.30. The pattern may also be interpreted as a flat base with a 614.36 buy point.

The stock market kept bulls and bears woozy during the week with three big up days and two sizable down days.




Bears got the last word with discouraging losses Friday, but the major indexes still finished up for the week.


On Friday, the Nasdaq stumbled 1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. Small caps outperformed as the S&P 600 added 0.5%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume.

Coming into the week, Apple was battling just under its 50-day line. The stock was only 7% off its high.


Yet, after an [earnings report that included a weak outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-hide-iphone-unit-sales/), Apple skidded as deep as 12% off its high.


Three Realities To Ponder
-------------------------


The week left investors with three realities to consider.


No. 1, this pullback is resolving doubts in favor of the bearish interpretation. Consider how the nonfarm payrolls blowout was turned into a negative.


Jobs added came in at 250,000, about 30% more than expected and above the entire range of estimates.


The pessimists shifted their focus to wage gains and fears of inflation in order to stay negative.


No. 2, sound investing rules are proving their worth. On Thursday, stock action came close to a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). But close isn't good enough in investing. Wait for the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-prices-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/)Â to deliver a legitimate confirmation.


Investors can congratulate themselves if they raised cash when the uptrend came under pressure Oct. 4 and raised more cash when IBD switched its outlook to correction Oct. 10.


The cash shouldn't come off the sidelines until a new uptrend is confirmed.


No. 3, pockets of strength exist. According to preliminary data, the cement stock group gained 12% for the week. This is a play on a possible House win for the Democrats in the midterm elections.


While Trump and a Democrat-controlled House could lead to gridlock, infrastructure is one area of agreement.


The midterm elections are on Tuesday.


Fed Meeting Ahead
-----------------


The Federal Reserve will meet Wednesday and Thursday.


Odds for a rate hike are only 7% for November but a 72% chance is seen for December, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.


For the week, the Nasdaq advanced 2.6%; the S&P 500, 2.4%; the Dow Jones industrial average, 2.4%; and the small-cap S&P 600, 4.4%.

The stock market proved its resilience again on Wednesday, and this time investors can credit the beaten-down names.


Practically every retail and energy-related subgroup not only rose for the day, but they dominated the upside. (See the [daily 197 industry subgroup rankings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) for details.) The serious bargain-hunting among institutional investors overcame a general decline in other industry groups, including managed care and biotech, and sent most of the important indexes higher for the day.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP032917-184x300.png)The Nasdaq composite, benefiting from healthy demand among the large and very large tech firms, rose nearly 0.4% for its fourth gain in a row and fifth in six sessions.


The Nasdaq 100, compiling the 100 largest and mostly nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, gained a little more than 0.4%. Both of these indexes overshadowed gains of 0.3% by the Russell 2000, 0.2% by the S&P SmallCap 600 and 0.1% by the S&P 500.


The price-weighted Dow industrial average, hurt by losses of more than 1 point each in **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), sank 0.2%.


Volume fell on both exchanges.


While the current outlook remains at "uptrend under pressure," the selling pressure seems to be dissipating.


After the market got thumped by big declines in higher turnover March 21, around the time when it was growing clear that the Republican Party's efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare were going into a downward spiral, it would have been perfectly natural to expect more of the same price-and-volume action. But that hasn't happened yet.


Look at the daily chart of the Nasdaq (you can view a big daily chart by going to the link at the bottom of this article). Rather than dive below the 50-day moving average, the Nasdaq touched the line Monday and then quickly reversed higher, sort of like a rubber ball striking the concrete sidewalk. That's strength, not weakness. Ditto for the S&P 500.


Here's another clue that demand for stocks is still strong: On Wednesday, winning stocks overpowered losing ones by a nearly 2-to-1 ratioÂ on the NYSE, and by more than a 3-to-2 ratio on the Nasdaq. Notice how the NYSE advance-decline line (found on the daily chart in the S&P 500 in the link below) is now rising again, not continuing to sink like a stone.


Third, breakouts and rebounds off the 10-week moving averages by leading stocks are generally doing well.


Sure, not all top-rated names are excelling, especially after earnings (just look at new IPO **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) today). However, scan through the IBD 50 and you'll see fistfuls of companies that have not only risen 20% to 25% past solid buy points but are still rallying ahead of their 10-week moving averages.


While the media gave plenty of airplay to Wednesday's official start of negotiations between the U.K. and its divorce from the euro zone, it's just old news. Big investors appear to be more focused on what the continued strength of the U.S. economy and the dollar may have on corporate earnings and the future fortunes of economically sensitive industries, including retail.


The 2.5% jump in WTI crude oil prices to $49.60 a barrel is also "new" news. Some bearish traders are likely covering short positions in the futures arena, following a bigger than expected dip in U.S. gasoline inventories last week. As seen in IBD's daily rankings of 197 industry groups, international oil exploration, field services, oil machinery and royalty trust were among those groups that rallied 2% or more for the day.


What's also "new" news? Wednesday's chatter in Federal Reserve circles over the possibility that the U.S. central bank will conduct [more than three rate hikes](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-policymaker-wants-4-rate-hikes-in-2017-markets-yawn/) in 2017. No surprise, given Monday's data showing a huge rise in the Conference Board's monthly measure of consumer confidence.

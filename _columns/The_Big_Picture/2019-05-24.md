Stocks Make Little Progress But Avoid Another Hit
==================================================

U.S. stock indexes tried and failed to patch over much of recent losses, as the market headed into the three-day Memorial Day weekend.




The market was closed Monday.


Small caps led Friday as the Russell 2000 advanced nearly 0.9%. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 inched up 0.1% each. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%.


Volume fell across the board.


The past week, the market had to struggle with trade trouble vs. China, losses in the semiconductor sector, then a 90-day reprieve for Huawei Technologies, the Federal Reserve minutes and a spike in the put/call volume ratio Thursday to a 1.17 close. Given all that, stocks could have done worse.

Big Hits Elsewhere
------------------


The sharp action was elsewhere in the market.


Chips in the Philadelphia semiconductor index dropped 6.5% for the week, bringing its [three-week loss to 16.5%](https://www.investors.com/videos/semiconductor-sector-takes-the-brunt-of-the-blow/).


Oil stocks also took hard hits. The oil and gas drilling stocks dropped 10.6% for the week.


The Dow Jones utility average spurted nearly 2% higher for the week, defying the overall market trend as investors sought defensive assets.


From a wider angle, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost ground for the third consecutive week, a losing streak not seen since December. (After the three week losing streak in December, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 32% and 26% respectively to their early May highs.)


Bulls might hope for a replay of that rally, but there are several factors that might make a repeat tough.


Tough Conditions For Rally
--------------------------


First, despite the 26% rally in the S&P 500 from week ended Dec. 28 to May 3, a longer view of the stock chart shows the gains were made within the context of sideways, rolling action.


The Nasdaq did better but still showed rolling, sideways action. The only difference was the rolling part had more of a bulge in the Nasdaq.


A second difficulty is that this is a news-driven market. If the U.S. and China could come to an agreement on trade, the market might take off.


Keep in mind the rolling, sideways action in the indexes began with Trump's first tariffs Jan. 23, 2018.


Coincidence? Probably not.


History's Lesson
----------------


Whether the student of stock market history is looking at Herbert Hoover or Benjamin Harrison, tariffs didn't work out well. The Depression deepened with Hoover's tariffs, and a bear market followed Harrison's tariffs.


The chief difference today is that Europe, not China, served as the boogeyman back then for anti-trade policies.

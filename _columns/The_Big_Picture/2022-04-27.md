The stock market tried to rebound following Tuesday's shellacking only to get ambushed by the bears. The market saw gains fade late, a worrying trait.




The Dow Jones ended the day higher due to strong earnings reports from **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)). Nevertheless, its early jump faded to a gain of just 0.2%. Big-cap investors will be hoping **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) earnings report Thursday leads to more gains.


The S&P 500 ended up surrendering the bulk of its gains, though it closed up 0.2%. The fact it failed to defend the 4,200 level was disappointing, given that it spent the bulk of the day above it. [The S&P sectors closed mixed](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/), with materials and energy the biggest winners. Communication services was by far the worst laggard.


Growth stock investors are usually more concerned with the Nasdaq. This was a sore spot as it reversed lower, though its loss was fractional.


Bears Snack On Small Caps
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP042722-234x300.jpg)Small caps have been becoming a favorite feasting area for the bears. After Tuesday's shellacking they returned for more on Wednesday. The Russell 2000 saw all its gains gobbled as it closed down 0.3%.


Growth stocks had a little more luck. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ended the session up 0.3%.


The bond market did not deliver any aid to stocks, with the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note up 5 basis points to 2.83%. The yield remains almost exactly where it sat last week, however.


Visa Surprises, Highlights Consumer Strength
--------------------------------------------


One of the top performers on the stock market today was Visa, which was boosted by an earnings beat. It turned in a powerful gain of 6.5%, gapping up through its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) in the process.



Its next challenge will be retaking the [200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). Rival **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) also got a boost, rising 5.1%. It soared after turning in EPS of $1.79 on revenue of $7.2 billion. It cleared Wall Street expectations on both counts.


The firm underlined the fact the U.S. consumer remains strong, at least for now, noting that inflation, the Ukraine war and rising interest rates haven't hurt spending trends.


The company also highlighted continued recovery in travel spending. This news was welcome as it's another indicator that consumer activity remains strong. In addition, Mastercard said it has yet to see a major impact on global payments volumes due to inflation or supply chain issues.


Can Apple Earnings Aid Stock Market After Microsoft Boost?
----------------------------------------------------------


It was very much a tale of two tech giants Wednesday, with Microsoft arguably the star of the day. It was among the top performing stocks on both the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones as it rose 4.8%.



Strong performance from its cloud computing business was key as it beat Q1 estimates on the top and bottom lines.


Perhaps more importantly, revenue guidance for each of the [Leaderboard stock's](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) three business segments came in higher than analysts expectations, according to FactSet.


A fly in the ointment was **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). It ended the day down 3.7% after March-quarter earnings and revenue missed Wall Street targets.


The mixed results from Big Tech this earnings season raise the stakes for Apple when it reports after the close Thursday. An upside surprise could help fuel a market rally, while a nasty downside skew could add weight to the bear case that indexes should be lower still.


Bulls Overpower Bears In Key Gauge: Consider This
-------------------------------------------------


The latest advisors sentiment weekly report from [Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) showed bullish sentiment is in the ascendancy once again.


The bull-bear spread again moved to positive ground, up 1.3%, vs. down 1.2% last time. The proportion of bulls rose to 34.2% from the previous week. This compares to 32.1%, 35.8% and 39.1% going back over the prior three surveys.


In contrast, the bears receded slightly to 32.9%, from 33.3% last week. The group remain shy of the [mid-March peak of 36.5%](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears). The number of advisors projecting a correction also slipped, dipping from 34.6% to 32.9%.


Given this is a contrarian indicator, the indecisive nature of the results makes it more difficult to gauge whether a rally is set to take place. It can be a positive for the market when bears exceed bulls.


With the overall uncertain action so far this year, the day-to-day action of the indexes and stock market leaders retain their importance as the principal guide.

Industry Groups And Stocks To Watch
-----------------------------------


Another key indicator for investors is the best and worst performing industry groups.


On Wednesday, coal plays, newspaper stocks, department stores, travel booking plays and transport shipping stocks all excelled.


Reflecting the importance of Alphabet's results, internet stocks were slammed. The network solutions and content groups were among the worst hit today. Leisure-movies, which is dominated by hero-to-zero stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), and integrated computer systems stocks also lagged.



Investors should be beefing up their watchlists now that the market is in the grip of a correction. Here are a few names worth considering.


**Genuine Parts** ([GPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPC)) is worth tracking as it gets set to form a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The Automotive replacement parts distributor's cup base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) is 143.07. A handle would lower the entry to 141.21. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) is at new highs.


Additionally, **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) is holding above its major moving averages as it eyes a long cup-with-handle buy point of 167.08, [according to MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


Jazz is in the top 10% of stocks in terms of price performance over the past 12 months, though earnings growth is not ideal.

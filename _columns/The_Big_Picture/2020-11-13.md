Investors were left in a good mood Friday after U.S. stocks climbed more than 1%, although industry group performance showed the coronavirus trade continued to unwind.




Travel, department store, consumer and some cyclical groups led the market. Enterprise software, cybersecurity and medical products were some of the weaker ones. As it was the case for much of the week, the results pointed to a sunnier outlook for the companies hammered by social distancing restrictions. At the same time, many of the work-from-home stocks that led the market for months kept softening.


**Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) slid nearly 6% and closed 31% off its Oct. 19 peak. **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), whose software enables online commerce, lost 12% for the week. IBD's enterprise software group fell more than 6% for the week, though it surged nearly 10% the previous week.


![MP111320](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP111320-255x300.jpg)In whole, U.S. stocks were solid Friday. Indexes closed near session highs. The Nasdaq climbed slightly more than 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 added 1.4%. Advancing stocks led decliners by nearly 5-to-1 on the NYSE and close to 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume fell.


Small Caps Lead
---------------


The Russell 2000 led with a 2.1% increase. The small-cap benchmark — out of favor for much of 2020 — is holding around this year's highs and is outperforming the Dow. The Russell 2000 is now up 4.5% this year, vs. 3.3% for the Dow industrials.


Strength in small-cap financial and energy stocks helped the Russell outperform. Specifically, regional banks extended a rebound. The 10-year Treasury yield has been trending higher since October, which helps the rate-sensitive smaller banks.


But the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose only 0.5% in a lukewarm performance for leading stocks. The growth index fell 5.5% for the week, which compares unfavorably to the S&P 500's 2.2% gain and the Nasdaq's 0.6% drop. Eight IBD 50 stocks fell more than 10% for the week, including **Logitech** ([LOGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGI)), **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)).


Coronavirus Worries Hang Over U.S. Stocks
-----------------------------------------


Ironically, [encouraging news on Covid-19 vaccines](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/) from **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and other companies came as the U.S. and many other countries face a surge in coronavirus cases. In the U.S. alone, more than 150,000 new cases were reported Friday, according to [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). U.S. deaths topped 243,000.


As U.S. stocks undergo a sector rotation, health officials are sounding the alarm. Authorities are moving to reimpose social distancing limits, and that has the stock market worried about a relapse in the economy. After a turbulent Tuesday, the market has been more steady. Investors should check their stocks for damage, but market exposure should remain high.


Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a new round of social distancing orders Thursday that may last 30 days. Some city officials urged residents to cancel Thanksgiving gatherings. In New York City, Mayor Bill De Blasio told parents to prepare for schools to close as early as Monday. In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer warned Thursday that "quick action" may be needed as the state faces rising cases and hospitalizations.

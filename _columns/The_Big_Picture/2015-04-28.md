The stock market fought back from early weakness Tuesday, but many leading stocks weren't so fortunate.


The Nasdaq was down more than 1%, then quickly bounced back as it became clear that a merchant ship seized by Iran did not have Americans on board.


The composite closed with a loss of 0.1%. Interestingly, it found support near the 5,000 level.


The S&P 500 climbed 0.3%, also closing near session highs. Small caps fared better, as the Russell 2000 added 0.5%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE. Advancers beat decliners by a 12-to-7 ratio on the NYSE and by about 3 to 2 on the Nasdaq.


The reversal was the type that suggests the market will keep rebounding, at least short-term.


Despite those positive take-aways, the market is passing through a treacherous moment. The Fed's new policy statement expected Wednesday and a flood of earnings reports make for nervous moments on Wall Street.


The number of distribution days remains high. The S&P 500 appears to be meeting resistance around 2120.


Many leading stocks are coming under heavy fire, and some have suffered unusually harsh sell-offs.


**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) plummeted 18% after its quarterly results, which were leaked early, disappointed. The company's Q1 sales missed estimates and management dimmed its outlook.


**Endurance International Group** ([EIGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EIGI)) plunged as much as 28% before paring losses. A short-selling firm questioned the business cloud-computing company's earnings.


**Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) was routed 22% Monday. **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)) is down 12.5% so far this week. The biotech's first-quarter sales came in below expectations.


Also bothersome is the fact that many of the breakouts of the past couple of weeks are faltering.


**Synaptics** ([SYNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNA)), **Harman International Industries** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)), **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) are examples of leaders that topped buy points but have sunk back to the entries or below them.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is the latest to show trepidation. The stock cleared a buy point in early trading after the company posted strong quarterly results. But by the close, Apple shares were 2% below the 133.70 buy point.


The lack of follow-through is as poor a reflection of the market as it is those individual stocks.


The weakness in leading stocks was evident in the IBD 50, which lagged with a 0.6% loss Monday.


The medicals sector has been particularly roiled this week, and it's never good when a pillar of the market starts to come apart.


Biotechs and other drugmakers have been selling off.


But among leading stocks as a whole, there are still relatively few sell signals.


Metals and financials were among the better sectors Tuesday.


Homebuilders rose after the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.0% for the year, the fourth straight month to see an acceleration.

The S&P 500 teased investors with afternoon gains, but a late slide repeated a frustrating theme for the stock market: You can expect any big rally to fizzle pretty fast.




The S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.6% around 2:30 p.m. ET. But the index and other market gauges faded in the final 90 minutes of trading. The S&P 500 closed 0.4% lower and the Nasdaq sold off 1.2%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average salvaged a 0.1% gain despite also fading late in the day. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE as well.


For any investor watching this year's stock market, Monday's letdown should not have come as a surprise. It seems that every time the Nasdaq rises more than 2%, the market lacks any type of follow-through buying. What little buying power is left in the market gets absorbed in a single day.

Monday's Losses Comparatively Better
------------------------------------


Monday's stock market losses were comparatively better, however. The Nasdaq managed to protect about two-thirds of Friday's 3.8% gain. The S&P 500 held to most of Friday's gain, despite ending in the red.


So this time, it wasn't a total wipeout like previous occasions. That offers some hope for the stock market, following a positive reversal on Thursday and the next day's jump. As long as Thursday's lows hold, the market has a chance at a [rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


The S&P 500 came within a fraction of falling 20% from its November peak — a decline that would have met the traditional definition of a bear market. The Nasdaq is still about 28% below its peak, well into bear market territory.


For now, investors should continue to avoid buying stocks or adding to positions. **Mondelez International** ([MDLZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDLZ)), **J.M. Smucker** ([SJM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SJM)), **Beacon Roofing Supply** ([BECN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BECN)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) are just some examples of the frustrating lack of strength in breakouts during market corrections.


Precious few top-rated stocks are setting up in bullish chart patterns. And the stock market has plenty of reasons to be apprehensive. Goldman Sachs Senior Chairman Lloyd Blankfein said in an interview with Bloomberg that [U.S. companies and consumers need to prepare for a recession](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-15/goldman-s-blankfein-says-companies-should-prepare-for-recession), calling it a "very, very high risk."


Big Cap 20 Index Down Less Than 3% This Year
--------------------------------------------


Investors tend to hide in big caps, among other options, during uncertain times. Big caps have performed relatively better, with the Dow down 11.3% this year and the S&P 500 off 15.9%. Compare that to the Nasdaq, which has lost 25.5% this year.


IBD's [Big Cap 20 index](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) is down less than 3% so far in 2022. That's much better than the IBD 50's drop of 30% year to date. That reflects the defensive appeal of big caps plus the liquidation of growth stocks.


The Big Cap 20 has benefited mainly from a number of energy and fertilizer leaders that are outperforming the market, plus some relative strength in health care. The index also has the advantage that it is reformulated daily, so the better stocks tend to stay longer on the screen.



By sector, the stock market didn't look much different from usual. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) jumped 2.6% to a 52-week high after the price of Nymex crude for June delivery rose 3.4% to $114.20 a barrel.


Agricultural Stocks Sprout
--------------------------


Sectors that at least partly act as defensive plays also rose: Health care, consumer staples and utilities. But the S&P technology index slid 0.9%. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) fell 2.2%, hurt in large part by its two largest components: **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) (off 5.9% Monday) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) (down 2%).


Agricultural stocks are rebounding. IBD's agricultural operations industry group led the [197 groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-may-13-2022/) with a 1.7% increase. Farm machinery rose 1.3% and fertilizers more than 2%.


If the market does turn around soon, there are some stocks to watch in the fertilizers group. **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)), **Sociedad Quimica y Minera** ([SQM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQM)) and **ICL Group** ([ICL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICL)) have climbed back above their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).

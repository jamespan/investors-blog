  The Big Picture: Stock Indexes Reverse Higher Despite Muddy Market

U.S. stock indexes reversed higher Thursday, as the S&P 500 avoided a close under the 200-day line. The Nasdaq lost less than 0.2% after being down 1.5% in late-morning trade.




The S&P 500 trimmed just over 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended a pinch above flat.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE.


The positive reversal was undeniably bullish, but the market's situation remains muddied. In this case, mud is found at the key moving averages. The Nasdaq is comfortably above the 200-day line but sinks every time it tries to retake the 50-day line.

In fact, Thursday's reversal came after the index dipped below the 200-day line.


Despite the slow going, the positive reversal Thursday was a clear sign of funds stepping in to add shares.


What should the contradictory signals tell investors?


Step back to look at the larger picture and there's no reason to stretch for anything other than a mixed situation.


Daily stock action has been wide and loose since late January. The Nasdaq has twice bounced off near the 200-day area while failing to retake the 50-day line.


The S&P 500 Thursday made another test of the 200-day line.


Quality stocks haven't escaped the contradictions. **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) reported view-beating quarterly results in late March. The stock gapped and is en route to its sixth straight up week.


This is what is supposed to happen in a strong market. But earnings winners like Lululemon have bee rare.



**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), another quality stock, reported view-beating results several days ago. The stock leapt about 8% and then gave back half the gains by the close. It since has moved sideways.


This is what often happens in a weak market.


But take the two examples together, and this is normal for an uptrend under pressure.


On a more confident note, paving products provider **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) beat views on the top and bottom lines. The stock gapped up about 8%, retaking its 50-day and 200-day lines. Adjusted earnings rose 29% in Q1 vs. views for a 35% decline.


Industrywide there was no good news on the infrastructure front. Market watchers don't expect action on President Trump's infrastructure proposals until 2019.


China Trade Talks
-----------------


Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived in China for two days of trade talks.


Tariffs and trade issues have troubled the stock market ever since Trump fired the first shots Jan. 22-23. The January moves to slap tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines drew protests from China.


Other tariffs since moved the tariff issue into the spotlight, especially vis-a-vis China.


The Nasdaq peaked four sessions after Trump's first volley and pulled back more than 10% since the Jan. 22 close.


Some market watchers see Trump's stance on trade as a negotiating tactic. But whether Trump is crafty or not, the market is still stuck with uncertainty.


Until the trade issue becomes more or less settled, pricing it into the stock market will be difficult.


A Handful Of Breakouts
----------------------


Breakouts on Thursday included some stocks with decent ratings.


**Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) drove 4% higher in huge volume. Earnings topped the consensus estimate by almost 12%. The automaker stock cleared a 131.30 buy point. Ferrari has a Composite Rating of 88.


The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 88 means the stock is in the top 12% among all the stocks in IBD's database.


Pawnshop operator **EZCorp** ([EZPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EZPW)) beat Q1 earnings estimates by about 10%. The small cap carries a 90 Composite Rating.


**Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) broke out in strong volume. The stock punched past an 18.76 buy point. Marathon has a Composite Rating of 85.

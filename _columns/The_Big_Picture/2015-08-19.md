Stocks ended off their intraday lows after a volatile session Wednesday. But the day's action still reeked of unusually intense selling by professional investors.

  

The Nasdaq lost 0.8% after having been down as much as 1.3% and up a hair during the session. It again closed above 5000, still a key support level.

  

Likewise, the S&P 500 ended down 0.8% after it too fell 1.3% at Wednesday's low. The benchmark index ended back below its 50-day line, but again finished above the 200-day line.

  

Despite the nice bounce off their intraday lows, both indexes have wiped out gains from Monday's impressive upside reversal.

  

The action still warrants high caution for both longs and shorts.

  

Stocks in the vast energy sector took it on the chin as crude oil futures hit its lowest levels in more than six years, closing down 4.3% to $40.80 a barrel.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1%. The IBD 50 was off 0.4%, according to early calculations.

  

Stocks opened weak and had started to rebound around midday. Comeback efforts accelerated following an early release of the minutes from the Fed's July meeting. The minutes revealed that policymakers are getting close to raising interest rates, but just not there yet.

  

Volume spiked on both major exchanges from Tuesday's low levels. The higher trade along with the big losses gave the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each an additional distribution day. The level of distribution on the Nasdaq is still manageable. While the S&P 500 is just 2% below its 52-week peak, its own distribution count is still unusually high.

  

Decliners beating advancers by nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE and more than 2-to-1 on the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

  

On a bright note, secondary market indicators are in favor of the bulls. The put-call volume ratio (Page B2) closed at 1.11, up sharply from 0.92 Tuesday. It's again at a level that has ushered short-term market bounces.

  

Also, the Investors Intelligence survey of bullish and bearish investment advisors noted that the level of bulls dropped off to 37.7% from 40.2% in prior week (see page B11). It's now approaching the October 2014 low of 35.3%, where the Nasdaq soon went on to rally 17% in about six weeks.

  

But the market was in a lot worse shape back then. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell 11% and 10%, respectively, from their September highs. The market fell into a correction Oct. 1 as the Nasdaq got hit with its eighth distribution day and the 500 its seventh.

S&P 500, Nasdaq Mark New Highs; Why Are Growth Stocks Outperforming?
=====================================================================

 Weaker-than-expected manufacturing data from the New York Federal Reserve Monday didn't have much effect on the stock market as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 scored fresh all-time highs and growth stocks turned in another solid session.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 added 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.4%. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.8%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose slightly from Friday's levels.


The Empire State manufacturing index registered a reading of -1 in May, below the consensus estimate of 8. Readings below zero indicate worsening conditions, but it's hard to read anything into one month of data, especially after several positive readings in a row. Data also showed that firms remain optimistic about future conditions.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MP051517-177x300.png)It hasn't been easy in recent weeks to find a follow through after a breakout, but [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) name **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) have obliged. Nvidia extended gains after last week's bullish breakout, rising 5%. Trade Desk, meanwhile, soared 30% Friday on strong earnings and extended gains Monday, rising 3%.


The price performance of Nvidia and Trade Desk post-breakout shows that institutional investors still have an appetite for growth stocks as the S&P 500 tries for a convincing breakout over the 2400 level, while the Dow tries to punch through the 21,000 level with conviction.


Headed into Monday, the IBD 50 was up about 14% year-to-date, pretty much doubling the S&P 500's performance. The index of leading growth stocks outperformed again Monday, rising 1.1%.


Growth stocks have been rising nicely as institutional investors look for opportunities to pump up their performance. During confirmed market uptrends, it's good to see a healthy supply of breakouts, and there's been a fair share of them lately.


With the market tide still flowing positive and a light distribution day count, it makes sense to continue to target fundamentally strong stocks breaking out of bases.


Elsewhere, **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) blasted out of base with a 92.56 buy point. There was no news, but earnings from the fast-growing enterprise software name are due June 1 after the close. Workday is a current holding of Fidelity OTC Portfolio ([FOCPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOCPX)), a highly-regarded growth fund which is up more than 20% year-to-date.


Chip-equipment firm **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) jumped above its 50-day moving average, rising 5.5% to 71.54, as it works on a flat base with a 72.52 buy point.


Benchmark crude oil for June delivery settled at $48.85 a barrel, up 2.1%, after Russia and Saudi Arabia said they both supported extending oil output cuts to March 2018.


Security software stocks were in focus after the WannaCry ransomware attack that started Friday dominated the headlines. **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) gapped up over an 82.09 handle buy point, although its open price of 84.72 (near an 84.46 alternative buy point) was another legitimate entry. Shares closed at 86.60, up 7%. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) added more than 3% to 40.45. It's slightly extended from a prior entry at 38.43.


Oil and gas-related stocks were also among the day's top performers, but after sharp losses in the sector, it's hard to find any charts to like.


Oil drillers outperformed Monday, but headed into Monday, the group ranked near the bottom of IBD's 197 group rankings at No. 195. **Patterson-UTI Energy** ([PTEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTEN)) jumped nearly 5%, but it's still in a downtrend, about 27% off its high.


In the integrated group, Argentina-based **YPF Sociedad Anonima** ([YPF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YPF)) is getting support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout.

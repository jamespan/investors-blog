  Nasdaq Leads Stock Market Drop, Masks Emerging Strength In These Sectors As Wall Street Keeps Close Eye On Hurricane Milton

The Nasdaq perhaps offered the most disappointing action among the key indexes on Monday. Yet IBD readers who looked beneath the hood saw even more unusual upheaval.


China has unleashed a storm of rapid-fire measures to stoke its economy. On Monday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond shot back above 4%, raising the cost of money in the near term. Finally, fear of another serious hurricane expected to slam the Florida coast in just days affected stocks, many of them leading Wall Street higher, across multiple industries. All of these news items helped shape fierce crosswinds hitting the stock market.




The Nasdaq composite's 1.2% drop wasn't necessarily terrible, particularly when you view how other popular stock market benchmarks did. The S&P 500 lost almost 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 0.9%. The Russell 2000 backtracked nearly 0.9%. But for those who heralded the Nasdaq's 1.2% rally on Friday in response to a mostly buoyant U.S. jobs report, Monday's action was disappointing.


Nasdaq And The Stock Market Today
---------------------------------


When you are in a strong confirmed uptrend, you'd prefer to see the Nasdaq and other major indexes fall modestly after a nice up day. You'd also like to see turnover cool off.


Instead, Monday's action showed the direct opposite. The decline virtually wiped out Friday's bullish move. And volume on the Nasdaq rose 2% to 5.24 billion shares vs. Friday.


By itself, that's not a dramatic increase in shares exchanging hands. Yet the 1.2% drop was not light, and the sell-off in higher volume translates into an [authentic distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


On the NYSE, 3.64 billion shares traded hands on Monday, up nearly 5%. Again, that's not a tremendous increase. Yet the decline added to the distribution-day count of the S&P 500 as well.

Tracking Professional Selling
-----------------------------


As the accompanying Market Pulse shows, the count of distribution days, or bouts of heavy professional selling, is at an uncomfortably high level.


So, why does the current outlook for the stock market also remain strongly bullish?


First of all, despite Monday's sell-off, most major stock market averages are trading fairly close to all-time highs. At 5,695, the S&P 500 lies less than 2% beneath its all-time high of 5,737.


The Nasdaq 100 tracker, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), finished the session 4.3% below a pinnacle of 503.52. The SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund is just 1.5% below its summit.


Second, when looking at each individual distribution day on the Nasdaq, only one other session, namely Oct. 1, saw the key index drop at least 1%. The other three distribution days — a 0.2% gain and stalling session on Sept. 17, a 0.3% dip on Sept. 18, and a 0.4% fall on Sept. 20 — did not supply a vicious bite.


And third, money continues to flow nicely into sectors that make sense. A few oil and gas firms exceled on Monday amid a nearly 4% spike in Nymex crude oil futures, based on the December expiring contract.


**Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)), a leader in power generators, broke out of a base as Tampa and Orlando brace for what could be a catastrophic hurricane expected to make landfall in Florida on Wednesday evening. Generac drove past a 158.27 early buy point within a base last week. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, early Monday raised the level of Hurricane Milton as a Category 5 storm, the highest rating.



Meanwhile, building products retailers **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) have rallied sharply off their spring and summertime lows as hurricane-hit communities from the Panhandle region of Florida up through Western North Carolina rush to rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which hit the U.S. shores as a Category 4 disaster.


Almost all of the [Magnificent Seven megacap techs](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) did even worse, weighing not only on the Nasdaq but also on other large-cap indexes.


Also In The Nasdaq
------------------


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), falling 1.6% in accelerating turnover, dropped sharply below its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/).


**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), behaving very bullishly since its Sept. 19 breakout to new highs, turned tail after eclipsing the 600 price level. Shares reversed for a 1.9% loss. Volume fell vs. the prior session and finished 12% below average.


The sell-off among insurance companies was far harsher.


Take **Kinsale Capital** ([KNSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNSL)), part of [IBD's Long-Term Leaders list](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). The property and casualty insurer wasted nearly two weeks' worth of gains after diving 7% to 452.26. Turnover bulged 74% above the stock's average over the past 50 sessions. While 268,900 shares exchanging hands on Monday does not sound like a lot, Kinsale still trades at over 450 a share. More important, Kinsale sharply undercut the 50-day moving average and fell further away from a potential breakout point of 494.27 in a large cup with handle.


Kinsale is a midcap growth stock with a market value of $10.5 billion.

Stocks ended mixed Monday in another orderly session that saw biotech stocks prop up the Nasdaq composite and oil stocks weigh on the S&P 500.


The Nasdaq composite gained 0.4% and closed in the top half of its intraday range. It bumped up against the 5200 level and is within striking distance of its all-time high 5231.94 set just over one year ago.


The S&P 500, Dow and Russell 2000 small-cap index each lost 0.1%. Volume on both exchanges fell from Friday's levels.


The IBD 50 rose less than 0.1%. Its top performers included China-based **Yirendai** ([YRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YRD)), up 10%, and **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), up 4%. **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) added 2% ahead of next week's earnings report.


![MP080116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP080116-153x300.jpg)At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas intermediate crude oil for September delivery lost $1.54, or 3.7%, to settle at $40.06 a barrel. Nearly all of the day's worst-10 performing industry groups hailed from the oil and gas sector.


Gold stocks outperformed again, even though price action in the metal itself was muted. Gold for December delivery added $2.10, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,359.60 an ounce. A slew of gold miners are extended in price at this point, but **Franco Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)) is still intriguing. The large cap is showing supporting action at its 10-week moving average after a base breakout over a 71.58 buy point.


Meanwhile, biotechs continued their recent string of outperformance. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechology ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) gained ground for the eighth time in nine sessions, rising 1.6%. **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), the third highest-weighted stock in the exchange-traded fund, rallied 4%, helped by unexpected good news on a drug it's developing with **Ionis** ([IONS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IONS)). Biogen is still in buy range after a breakout from a bottoming base with a 291.02 buy point.


The ETF broke out July 20 over a descending trend line. Also on that day, **Ligand** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) cleared a 130.06 cup-with-handle buy point. Similar to Biogen, Ligand cleared a handle area seen on the daily chart but not the weekly.


With the market still in a confirmed uptrend and distribution days a nonissue for now, it's OK to look for stocks to buy, but be careful not to chase names that are extended in price. Base breakouts are still out there, but the supply seems to be dwindling. That's OK, though, because pullbacks to support levels after a breakout can present alternative entry points.


In merger-and-acquisition news: Fresh off a deal to acquire **Yahoo**'s ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) core assets for $4.8 billion, Dow-component **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) announced another transaction, agreeing to acquire **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) for around $2.4 billion. Fleetmatics is a provider of software for fleet and mobile-workforce management. Shares of Fleetmatics soared 39%, while those of Verizon gave back 1.6%.


In economic news, the [ISM manufacturing index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/ism-manufacturing-index-for-july/) fell slightly to 52.6 in July, just below the consensus estimate of 53.2.


Later in the week, the Bank of England is widely expected to announce economic stimulus measures to prop up the economy since the June 23 Brexit vote. A key interest rate in England has been at 0.5% since March 2009.

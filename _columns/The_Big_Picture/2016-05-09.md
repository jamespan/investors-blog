The stock market kicked off the week with a mixed and mostly unchanged performance Monday, a dull day after Friday’s more upbeat showing.


The Nasdaq added 0.3%, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Dow fell 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Friday’s levels. Despite lower trade, the S&P 500 added a distribution day due to mild stalling action.


NYSE decliners outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin as mining, steel and energy stocks lagged. On the Nasdaq, advancing stocks topped decliners by a 7-6 ratio, helped by strength in biotech stocks. A front-page feature story in the latest IBD Weekly mentioned innovative drugs and continued M&A activity as potential catalysts for the biotech sector, which has been hit hard by institutional selling in recent months.


Benchmark crude oil lost $1.22, or 2.7%, to $43.55 a barrel as fears abated about the impact of wildfires in Alberta, Canada, on oil output.


![MP_050916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP_050916-161x300.jpg)The U.S. dollar index rose for the fifth straight session but remains in a technical downtrend.


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) weighed on the Dow, with losses of 3.5% and 1.5%. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), meanwhile, was a classic case of “sell the news.” Shares rose 1% early on news of a strong weekend for “Captain America: Civil War,” but the stock ended with a loss of 0.2%.


The market uptrend remains under pressure, which is not the time to be aggressively going long -- not with nine distribution days on the Nasdaq and seven on the S&P 500. On Friday, the S&P 500 rose after dipping


There’s still an ample supply of institutional-quality growth stocks showing hesitant action around buy points (see **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB))). Meanwhile, breakouts that are working tend to be less liquid, more speculative names (see **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN))).


The IBD 50 turned in a good performance, rising 0.7%. The index was boosted by a strong performance by **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) ahead of its earnings report Tuesday before the open. Shares rose 5%. The stock briefly cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 29.87 but ended just below it. Quarterly profit is seen rising 58% from a year ago to 52 cents a share, with sales up 39% to $167.55 million.


Other movers included real estate investment trust **Equity LifeStyle Properties** ([ELS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELS)). Shares rose nearly 3% in strong volume. It’s still in buy range from a 74.05 flat-base entry.


Retailer **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) added close to 2% to 58.16 in light volume as it continues to work on a flat base with a 59.78 buy point.


**Intercontinental Exchange** ([ICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICE)) added close to 1% in heavy volume as it vies for a breakout. Shares jumped 7.5% last week after the company abandoned plans to make a counterbid for London Stock Exchange that would have impeded LSE’s planned merger with Deutsche Boerse.


**[ICE isn't the only strong performer in IBD's Financial Services-Specialty group. See who the other leaders are with IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-intercontinental-exch-ice.aspx)**.


Food producers **Tyson Foods** ([TSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSN)), **Fresh Del Monte Produce** ([FDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDP)) and **Hormel** ([HRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRL)) also outperformed during Monday’s session. Tyson beat profit expectations and raised its outlook, citing lower feed costs.

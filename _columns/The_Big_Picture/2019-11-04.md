Stocks closed off session highs Monday, but not before the Dow Jones Industrial Average made a record high — another indication that the market is getting through a period of risk just fine, thank you.




The Dow Jones industrials became the last of the three major indexes to make all-time highs, after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached records last week. The Dow added 0.4% Monday, while the Nasdaq rose 0.6% and the S&P 500 tacked on less than 0.4%.


Small caps also had something to celebrate after the Russell 2000 moved above its September high. The small-cap benchmark added 0.5%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE. Advancing stocks led decliners by about a 3-2 ratio on the two exchanges.

Yet Wall Street sentiment is buoyant, with indexes finally rising past their summertime highs. One key reason is progress on the China-U.S. trade talks.


High-level meetings raised hopes that the first phase of a trade accord will be finalized soon. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday [the U.S. is "very far along"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-04/ross-meets-with-chinese-premier-li-as-progress-seen-on-trade?srnd=premium) with the "phase one" trade deal.


Market Extended?
----------------


After a good month of October (the Nasdaq rose 3.7%, the S&P 2%), the market may be ready to pause. Indexes are starting to poke into oversold levels. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) sank to 0.67 Monday, the lowest since June 20.


This is not a reason to curtail investing, but it is something to watch if you plan to add shares or otherwise increase exposure.


At the same time, there's evidence the market uptrend keeps broadening. The NYSE's advance-decline line is at new highs, and the Nasdaq's line is near the May highs.


The [Accumulation/Distribution ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) for stocks as a whole are improving. Stocks with A or B ratings (noting accumulation) total about 3,300, much better than the 1,600 stocks with D or E ratings (that indicate distribution). Stocks with neutral C ratings number about 1,500.


The IBD 50 lagged with a 0.3% drop despite strong showings in Chinese stocks. **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **Huya** ([HUYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUYA)), **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) surged 2% to 10%. The strength in Chinese ADRs can be interpreted as a barometer of trade talks.


But 29 of the IBD 50 stocks fell. Several real estate investment trusts that play a defensive role were among them. Payment firm **Qiwi** ([QIWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIWI)) and solar play **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) slid 7% and 4%, respectively. Security software, aerospace and retail stocks were on the losing side.


What Stocks Are Working?
------------------------


So, what's working in this uptrend?


A screen of stocks with minimum 60 composite ratings that [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) the past several weeks shows consumer, construction, industrial, health care and technology have the most successful breakouts. By successful, we define that as an increase of at least 5% from the buy points.


Many of those winning breakouts are in the [industry groups that have rallied the most](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-jobs-report-nasdaq-hits-record-high/) since the early-October lows.


Monday's stock breakouts reflected this trend. In chips, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) rose past the 35.65 buy point of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in heavy volume. **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) jumped above the 26.63 entry of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/). Thinly traded **Alpha & Omega** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)) edged past a 13.77 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


In industrials, electric power equipment company **Regal Beloit** ([RBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBC)) broke out after reporting earnings and setting a share buyback. Metal processor **Timken** ([TKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TKR)) and industrial equipment maker **ITT** ([ITT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITT)) also broke out.


With the market improving, defensive plays are relatively weaker. Real estate, utilities and consumer staples were the worst S&P sectors today.


Analysts Downgrade Utilities
----------------------------


CFRA Research gave a weaker outlook on the S&P 500 Utilities sector Monday, downgrading it from marketweight to underweight.


"The group has benefited from investor uncertainty over the past several months as well as the search for yield in this rate-cutting environment," Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said in a note.


But now, the sector trades at a relatively high premium to its average forward-looking price-earnings ratio, and vs. the S&P 500's average P/E. Utilities also have a below-average percentage of companies with favorable investment recommendations, and the sector's relative strength has begun to deteriorate vs. the S&P 500.


The stronger sector charts include industrials, materials, financials and techs. Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLI)) broke out Friday and on Monday made new highs. Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) rose past a 59.42 buy point. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) and Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) are following through on breakouts.

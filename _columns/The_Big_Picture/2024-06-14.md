  Stock Market Ends Week Higher Heading Into Juneteenth; Retail Sales Data Due Next

The stock market ended Friday mixed but made weekly gains as investors continued to digest the latest Fed meeting and inflation data fallout. A new retail sales reading is the key data point to watch out for in the shortened Juneteenth holiday week ahead.




The Nasdaq composite continued its relentless upward march as it rose 0.1%, and holds a solid cushion above its short-term moving averages. It notched a record high and gained 3.2% for the week. The tech-heavy composite now holds a gain of 17.8% for the year so far.


While the S&P 500 slipped fractionally, it ended Friday essentially flat. The benchmark index turned in a weekly gain of 1.6% and sits clear of its rising moving averages. It has gained in seven of the past eight weeks, and is now up 13.9% in 2024.


The fortunes of the equal-weight S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes highlight a broader malaise, with both ending the day lower as they continue to lag their regular, market cap-weighted counterparts.


Decliners led advancers nearly 3-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was mixed.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other two major indexes with a 0.2% dip. It sits below the important [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), though it remains within striking distance. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was the strongest component while **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) lagged.


The bears mauled small caps, as the Russell 2000 dived 1.6% and lost ground on the 50-day line. Growth stocks were also hit, with the Innovator IBD 50 exchange traded fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) sliding 1.3%.


Retail Sales Due Before Juneteenth Holiday
------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP601424-2.jpg)Stocks ended higher this week amid benevolent inflation readings, which cheered investors even as the Federal Reserve lowered its outlook on interest rate cuts this year. Meanwhile, Friday the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers showed consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly in June. There were expectations for a lift.


The coming week is a fairly busy one for economic data. It comes despite the stock market's Wednesday shuttering for the Juneteenth holiday.


The Empire State manufacturing survey is due Monday, housing starts data comes Thursday and S&P flash U.S. services and manufacturing PMI data comes Friday. There will also be a smattering of Fedspeak, with Fed Gov. Lisa Cook, Dallas Fed President Laurie Logan and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee all making appearances during the week.


But the key data point this week will be U.S. retail sales for May. Economists see that metric rising 0.2% vs. the flat previous reading. This should provide a deeper insight into the health of the American consumer.


Noteworthy [earnings reports due in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/kb-home-lennar-earnings-calendar-10-year-yield-dives/) include **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), **Jabil** ([JBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBL)) and Olive Garden-parent **Darden Restaurants** ([DRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRI)).

Netflix Strength Boosts This Stock Market Group
-----------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended mostly lower](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) on Friday. Communication services and technology made the best gains while materials and industrials lagged.


As always, the performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups offered more nuanced insight into the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).



Desktop software plays, toy stocks, which popped after **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)) got upgraded from neutral to buy by Bank of America, and fabless semiconductor companies were among the best performers.


The movies group also captured a spotlight, aided by outperformance from **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which rose 2.5% and ended near the top of a buy zone from a cup-with-handle entry of 639.


In contrast, specialty steel alloys companies, solar stocks and dairy products firms were among the laggards.


Home furnishing stocks also struggled. The group was hit after **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, plunged 17.1% on an earnings miss.

Stocks traded in a tight range early Tuesday, but an afternoon downdraft resulted in another mild distribution day for the Nasdaq.


The S&P 500 fell 0.6% while the Nasdaq gave up 0.3%. Nasdaq volume rose 2% from Monday's level. NYSE volume fell less than 1%.


Resilience in the small-cap arena encouraged the bulls. The Russell 2000 edged lower by 0.1% while the S&P SmallCap 600 rose a fraction.


The IBD 50 performed mostly in line with the market, dropping 0.5%. Declining stocks had a slight edge over advancers on both exchanges.


The Nasdaq's advance/decline line has been trending higher after some distribution days earlier in the month, but it hasn't hit a new high despite a recent new high for the Nasdaq. It's not a red flag but noteworthy nonetheless.


Growth investors have a confirmed uptrend working in their favor, but the distribution day count remains stubbornly high. It's OK to nibble here and there, but fresh prospects aren't exactly plentiful as many names started their moves weeks ago.


Social media stocks buoyed the Nasdaq as names like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and outperformed. Twitter surged 6% in solid volume. It cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 50.11 buy point in nearly double-average volume.


Meanwhile, medical products firm **MiMedx** ([MDXG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDXG)) soared nearly 9% in heavy trade. It gapped out of a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 10.70. It closed nearly 4% above the buy point.


Group peer **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) was another big mover. After a series of tight weekly closes, the stock surged 18% after the FDA approved the company's miniature blood pump system. The device maintains heart function during procedures like angioplasty and stenting.


In economic news, the consumer price index rose 0.2% in February, in line with expectations. The gain snapped a string of monthly declines. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, came in a little hotter than expected. It rose 0.2%, slightly above the consensus estimate of 0.1%.


Homebuilders outperformed on solid new-home sales data for February. Sales ran at an annual rate of 539,000, up 7.8% sequentially and 24.8% from a year ago. The new reading was the highest since February 2008. IBD's homebuilder group rose 0.8%. Leaders in the group include **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **Ryland Group** ([RYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYL)) and **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)).


After the close, drive-in restaurant chain **Sonic** ([SONC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SONC)) reported solid earnings. Shares rose nearly 3% in the regular session and another 1% after hours. Sonic recently cleared a rare ascending base pattern with a buy point of 34.30. The pattern formed after three brief pullbacks from December to March.


Also after the close, fast-growing new issue **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) was mostly unchanged despite a nice revenue beat. Q4 revenue rose 45% vs. a year ago to $24.9 million, above Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $23.5 million. Shares jumped 4% in strong volume ahead of the results.

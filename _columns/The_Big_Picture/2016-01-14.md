Bulls haven't had much to applaud so far this year, but on Thursday the Nasdaq scored its first 2016 gain in rising volume. The Nasdaq shook off an early 1.2% loss and reversed to a 2% climb. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively.


The IBD 50 advanced 1.6%.


Volume rose across the board.


Considering the sharp daily losses so far this year, a relief rally was perhaps overdue. However, "overdue" is a word that probably has more meaning in the library than in the stock market.


As old investors learned in countless market pullbacks, bulls can insist their stocks are overdue, but that doesn't mean the bears will return them promptly and in good condition.

One factor providing hope is the support the Nasdaq is finding at the 4500 area. If that level holds, this will be the third time since August that support emerged there.


The S&P 500 is conducting a similar test around 1870-1880.


Percentage-wise, the indexes' losses, so far, look familiar.


In this downtrend, the Nasdaq dipped as low as 13.6% from its early December high. The S&P 500 fell 11.2% from its early November high.


These percentage losses are about in line with some of the recent pullbacks. Still, there's no guarantee the downtrend is over.


In August, the Nasdaq skidded 18% from a July high, but the drop included a one-day flash crash.


On Thursday afternoon, stocks perked up.


As shown in the Market Pulse, leaders up in strong volume far outnumbered those down in strong volume.


Leadership, though, has taken on a different cast. **Consolidated Edison** ([ED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ED)), a diversified utility and Big Cap 20 stock, wouldn't have made an IBD screen too long ago. The same is true for IBD 50 members such as **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)), No. 48 in Wednesday's IBD 50, and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), No. 31.


Aggressive growth investors might look at the utility, soup and discounter stocks and say no thanks to them and yes to cash.


That might be a good stance until the market confirms a new uptrend is underway.

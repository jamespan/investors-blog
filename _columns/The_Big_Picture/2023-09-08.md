The stock market ended the week on another bum note as the market uptrend continued to struggle. Now investors have to worry about more inflation data and retail figures in the week ahead.




The Nasdaq composite saw early gains mostly evaporate as it turned in a modest gain of less than 0.1%. This means the tech-heavy index ended the week down 1.9% and saw an attempt to rally back to its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) fall short. On the plus side, it managed to avoid turning in its worst losing streak since October 2022.


The S&P 500 also ended well off highs for the day, finishing with a tiny gain of 0.1%. It sits just below its own 50-day line and snapped a three-day losing streak. The benchmark index remains up nearly 17% for the year.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the strongest major index, but climbed a mere 0.2%. It turned in a weekly loss and is stuck below its 50-day line. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were the best performers on the blue chip index, while **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) lagged.


Small caps failed to fend off the bear attack though, with the Russell 2000 dipping 0.2%. Growth stocks were given a worse mauling, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) falling 0.5%.


The current stock market uptrend remains under pressure. With the action uncertain, IBD is recommending investors limit market exposure at 20% to 40% for now.


Inflation Data, Retail Sales On Deck
------------------------------------


Investors attention will now turn to the upcoming release of inflation and retail data.

CPI is seen rising 3.6% year-over-year while core CPI is expected to pop 4.3%. Producer Price Index data is due the following day.


U.S. retail sales are also set to be released Thursday, with economists expecting them to rise 0.1% year-over-year. This report will offer crucial clues into the current health of the U.S. consumer.


"As the cost of capital continues to rise, the economy will gradually weaken," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients. "The latest retail sales report will show the consumer is much weaker, partially due to the restart of student-loan repayments and as households nearly exhaust all their excess savings."


Notable earnings reports in the coming week include Leaderboard stock **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), homebuilder **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)).

RH Earnings Hit Home Furnishing Group
-------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors finished the day mixed with a bias to the upside. Energy and utilities were the top performers while industrials and real estate lagged.


Once again, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups offered a more granular view on the performance of the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Computer hardware plays, oil drillers and refiners, and hotel stocks all performed well.


Conversely, medical research equipment and services plays, farm machinery firms and office furnishing companies all lagged. Home furnishings stocks were the worst performers after **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) plunged on an earnings miss. A warning from CEO Gary Friedman that high mortgage rates and a weak housing market could weigh on its results into next year spooked investors.

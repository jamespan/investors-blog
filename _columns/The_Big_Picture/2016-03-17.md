After a wobbly start Thursday, the stock market battled back to respectable gains for the day.


The Nasdaq added 0.2% to its scorecard after being down 0.5%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Small caps outperformed as the S&P 600 thrust 1.7%. The IBD 50 inched up 0.3%.


Volume rose across the board.


Leadership in this uptrend has been puzzling, with most of the bullish moves belonging to either beaten-down issues or stocks that lack top-notch fundamentals and chart action.

Quarterly results beat views on the top and bottom lines, but guidance was weak.


Michaels carries a Composite Rating of 68, which means almost a third of  the stocks in IBD's database rate higher. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.


Other stocks bouncing firmly higher are far off their highs.


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) rumbled 2% higher in volume 77% above average. The stock is still 35% off its February 2012 high.


**U.S. Silica** ([SLCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLCA)) broke out of a base Thursday. However, the stock is still 69% off its September 2014 peak.


Breakouts among top-rated stocks have been more scarce than the bottom-fishing plays.


Baby and children's apparel provider **Carter's** ([CRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRI)) broke out early in the day but closed under the 103.58 buy point. Volume was 41% above average. The apparel sector is up 11% since Jan. 1. Carter's Composite Rating is 90, putting it in the top 10 percentile.


Economic news was mostly bullish, especially on the manufacturing front.


First-time jobless claims were about 2% fewer than expected, but leading indicators for February came in at 0.1% -- less than the consensus target of 0.2%.


However, the Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing gauge for March trounced expectations: 12.4 vs. views for a negative 1.4. It was the first positive reading in seven months. This followed Tuesday’s Empire State manufacturing gauge, which rose 0.6 vs. views for an 11.25 drop. The positive reading was the first in eight months.


The item that is attracting the least attention -- the M4 Divisia money supply including Treasuries -- might be the most important. The broadest gauge for the money supply grew 4% in February. Growth has been 3.3% or higher since July.


Growth in the broad money supply is linked to GDP growth, according to monetarists. The final Q4 reading on GDP is expected March 25.

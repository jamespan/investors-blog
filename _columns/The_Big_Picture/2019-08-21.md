Stock indexes logged gains but stayed under their 50-day lines Wednesday. The market struggled briefly in reaction to the latest Federal Reserve minutes.




Overall, the stock indexes kept most of their gains for the day.


The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9% each. The large-cap S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.8% each.


The Nasdaq came close to reaching its 50-day moving average, where it met resistance earlier this month. The S&P 500, which also met resistance at its 50-day line this month, has more ground to make up. It closed Wednesday about 0.8% below its 50-day average.

NYSE volume was slightly higher, according to preliminary data. Tuesday's Nasdaq volume was the lowest in six weeks, making for an easy comparison on the Nasdaq.


Stock Indexes And Catalysts
---------------------------


Factors shaping Wednesday's stock indexes included unexpectedly strong retail earnings, existing-home sales slightly above estimates and the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting.


Retailers delivering upside surprises included **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), [which leapt 20%](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-q2-2019-target-stock-buy-point/); **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), up 1.6% and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), [up 10%](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/home-depot-earnings-q2-2019-home-depot-stock/) to a three-month high.


Home Sales
----------


Meanwhile, home sales narrowly topped the Street's target, but homebuilder stocks took the news as an optimistic signal. Small-cap **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) rose 2.8% to a 52-week high. Volume was about 20% above average.


Small-cap builder **Century** Communities advanced 2.6%, clearing a 28.86 buy point in a [flat consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/). Volume was 15% above average, below normal for a proper [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Large-cap **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) climbed 1.1%, putting it almost out of the 5% buy zone. Volume was 25% below average.


**Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) added nearly 1%. Volume was 59% above normal. Shares are extended from a 21.75 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Going into Wednesday's session, homebuilders ranked No. 5 among 197 industry groups. Year to date, the group is up 47%.


New Highs Gauge
---------------


In addition to the stock indexes' battles near the 50-day line, the new highs vs. new lows gauge is trying to settle a similar fight.


New lows outnumbered new highs in nine sessions so far in August while new highs gripped the top position in six sessions through Wednesday.


Bulls would like to see the new highs take and keep the upper hand, a common ingredient in a bull market. Ditto the 50-day lines of the major indexes.


IPOs Stab Higher
----------------


Three initial public offerings stirred. Online used car seller **Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)) zoomed 8% in strong volume. The Arizona-based stock knifed back above a 76.95 buy point.


**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), where users can share images for many interests, stabbed 6% higher in vigorous volume. Neither Pinterest nor Carvana has yet to turn an annual profit.


China-based educator **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)) jumped 9% in fast trade. GSX chalked up a profit of a penny a share in 2018. Analysts expect GSX to earn 17 cents a share this year.


Federal Reserve
---------------


The Federal Reserve released the minutes from its July meeting, revealing nothing new. The stock market's reaction was brief. At first stock indexes dipped but then quickly recovered.


Minutes showed little that the market didn't already know. Members debated a bigger rate cut but settled on a quarter-point cut.


The Fed also wanted to communicate that it will adjust course when and if incoming data suggests change.


On Thursday and Friday, the annual central bank symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., will be held. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell will speak at 10 a.m. ET Friday.

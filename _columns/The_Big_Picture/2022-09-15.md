Tech stocks led the stock market lower Thursday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a fresh recent low, as another wave of selling hit the major stock indexes.




Amid a stock market uptrend that is failing to stabilize after Tuesday's market dive, these four leaders — **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) — are holding up well.


Key Economic Data, Adobe Earnings
---------------------------------


The Labor Department's initial jobless claims dropped to 213,000. They were expected to rise to 228,000 vs. 222,000 in the previous week. A strong job market gives the Fed more room to raise rates. And U.S. retail sales rose 0.3% in August vs. July, handily beating Econoday estimates for no change. But the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index posted a -9.9 reading, far below the expected 3.1.

That news briefly lifted rail stocks such as **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) and **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)). CSX shares reversed from early gains to fall more than 3%, while Union Pacific slashed gains to just 0.2%.


It didn't get any better for transportation stock after Thursday's close.


**FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) dived more than 15% in extended trade after the company warned for its fiscal first quarter and withdrew its full-year guidance. The shipping giant also announced cost-cutting measures, including the closing of 90 office locations.


"Global volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter, both internationally and in the U.S.," CEO Raj Subramaniam said in a news release. "While this performance is disappointing, we are aggressively accelerating cost reduction efforts."


**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) reported [better-than-expected earnings](https://investors.com/news/technology/adbe-stock-adobe-falls-on-mixed-report-acquisition/) for its fiscal third quarter, but revenue slightly missed as the company released results before the open instead of its customary report after the close. The reason for that was because the software giant confirmed it's buying online design collaboration firm Figma for $20 billion. ADBE stock dived almost 17%, closing at its lowest level since April 2020.

Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Hits Fresh Low
--------------------------------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6% to hit a fresh recent low, making its lowest close since July 14. The S&P 500 closed 1.1% lower. The Nasdaq composite declined 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.7%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 held a fraction above their Sept. 6 lows.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and appeared to be slightly higher on the NYSE.


Top growth stocks underperformed Thursday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slid 2.1%, and is back below its 50-day line. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) was one of the few bright spots, rising 0.3% Thursday. Shares continue to rebound from their 50-day line.

Stock Market Trend: What To Do Now
----------------------------------


Amid this week's sharp losses, the stock market trend remains "under pressure." The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since Sept. 6 and fell further below its 50-day line. So investors should still be focused on defense.


If the market is able to stabilize around its recent lows and stage a serious rebound, then investors should have a list of top stocks that are trying to rise despite the market's downward pressure. Identifying proper buy points and potential follow-on opportunities, like three-weeks-tight formations and 50-day rebounds is a good start.


The best way to identify potential market leaders is by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500 and is the blue line on every IBD chart. If the market's down, good stocks will outperform by treading water. When the market rebounds, the stocks with best relative strength should bounce back even stronger than the market.


The [RS Line Blue Dot list](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/), an IBD MarketSmith premium list, identifies stocks whose relative strength lines are hitting new highs, while the stock is building a new base or breaking out past a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). In addition, the [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/) includes a list of top-rated stocks with relative strength lines at new highs. (This week, [IBD MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=MarketSmith-Free-Access) is providing free access.)


Current stock market leaders on the RS Line Blue Dot list include **Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)) and **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)).

Stock Market Leaders To Watch
-----------------------------



Amid the stock market volatility, four leaders are among the stocks to watch: Arista Networks, Palo Alto Networks, Tesla and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.


Arista Networks has added a handle to a [double-bottom base,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) placing the correct entry at 132.97, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. An early entry at 126.80 is also in play. Arista's RS line is close to highs, even as the stock gave up its 200-day line during Thursday's 4.3% decline.


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Devon Energy continues to trace a cup with handle with a 75.37 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Meanwhile, shares topped a trendline entry during Wednesday's gain, but they are below that level following Thursday's 3.7% slide. Devon has made a big run already, so any future breakouts entail much greater risk.


Cybersecurity leader Palo Alto Networks is nearing a 193.01 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) despite Thursday's 1.3% fall. An early entry around 187 exists due to a trendline, according to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) commentary. Shares were unchanged Thursday.


Electric-vehicle giant Tesla arguably has a short base, within a much-larger consolidation, that has a 314.74 buy point. Bullishly, the stock's RS line is at its highest level since April.

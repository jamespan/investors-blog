Small Caps Cool Their Heels; The Seven-Letter Word You Need To Beat The Market In 2021
=======================================================================================

A clash in Congress on Tuesday over how much in direct aid should be given to Americans hit hardest by the worst pandemic in over a century put a wet blanket on [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Yet after weeks of muscular gains, the major indexes perhaps needed an excuse to let off some steam.




The biggest drop belonged to small caps. While the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fell 1.9%, the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund surrendered nearly 1.1%. The former looks poised, with just two trading days left in 2020, to halt an eight-week winning streak.


Meanwhile, other key benchmarks made smaller moves. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq composite logged drops in the 0.2% to 0.4% range. But megacap techs, on the whole, squeezed out a tiny gain. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq, backtracked off its session high to add less than 1 point. At 312.96, however, QQQ holds a 1.1% gain for the week.

Due to strong gains lately, the Nasdaq eliminated the Dec. 9 distribution day.


![MP122920_1](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP122920_1-200x300.jpg)Nasdaq volume fell mildly, and NYSE volume also was lower Tuesday.


Interestingly, cyclical and tech sectors showed pronounced action on both the upside and the downside.


In Stocks Today: Mixed Industry Action
--------------------------------------


IBD covers 197 industry groups each day. On the upside, travel booking, discount retail, movie, gaming software and steel firms managed to advance 0.3% to 2% on a preliminary basis. But automation, solar, computer hardware, biotech, gaming, fiber optic, leisure products and RV stocks sank 2% or more. The final results show up at both [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) and in the Reports section of [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a stand-alone vote on boosting the $600 one-time distribution of aid to $2,000 as hoped for by both President Donald Trump and leading congressional Democrats. However, TheHill.com noted that McConnell would move forward with bigger checks "with a repeal of a tech shield that has emerged as a top target for Trump and election-related investigations."



**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)), accused by Trump of muzzling the free speech of his supporters on its social media platform, and other media giants have shown bullish action over the past week.


Twitter is just above a 53.03 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an awkward [seven-week cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


YouTube and Google search engine owner **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), highlighted during the [IBD Live show on Monday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), is finding bullish support at its 10-week moving average following a slow yet steady breakout past a 1,681.42 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Remember This Seven-Letter Word: Courage
----------------------------------------


The year 2020 illustrated not only how the [N in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/new-product/) serves as a tenet of good growth stock investing. The surprising rebound off the March 23 lows only proved that pessimists cannot hold the equity markets down for long or for good for [CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Indeed, 2020 gave another lesson in how the successful investor learns to respect the [market's signals that a new uptrend may be underway](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) and acts upon it.


But it requires courage.


[On the Tuesday episode of IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), panelists gave thoughts about how 2021 will play out. One key point: When the market follows through, [IBD founder William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) made a point of buying at least one stock. Dip one toe in the water. Use that stock — or perhaps an ETF — as feedback on what the market really wants to do.


Numerous IBD readers over the years have confessed that they did not believe the market would roll higher, even if a follow-through gained momentum, moving averages bottomed out and tilted higher, high-quality stocks broke out, and subsequent pullbacks failed to take out near-term lows.

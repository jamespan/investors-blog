title: Stock Market Slips Amid Economic 'Hurricane' Warning; Bulls Gain On Bears In Key Gauge

The stock market closed lower after a choppy trading day Wednesday. The decline was more a digestion of some rally gains rather than a precipitous decline, despite warnings of a possible incoming economic "hurricane."




Volume once again played a key role. The fact the day's decline came in lower and below-average volume saved the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq from adding another distribution day.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq bled 0.7%. It closed comfortably off both its highs and lows for the day. It also held clear of its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which is a plus.


The broader S&P 500 saw an attempt to rally back into positive territory fall just short as it fell 0.7% for the day. It is holding steady in the no man's land between 21-day line and its 50-day moving average.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) told a story, though. They were all in negative territory apart from the energy sector, which made a muscular upside move. Health and financials were the worst performing sectors.

It ended the day down 0.5%. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was the clear leader on the index as it surged 9.9% on [quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-q12022/). **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) fared worst on the Dow, falling 2.5% and 1.9%, respectively.


Growth Stocks Flex Amid Weakness
--------------------------------


Growth stocks turned in the most impressive performance as they managed to move higher. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) closed the day with a gain of nearly 1.2%. It means the index is continuing to fight back after dropping almost 29% in 2022.


Small caps disappointed in comparison, with the Russell 2000 slipping 0.5%.


Overall market action remains cloudy, despite the return to a confirmed uptrend. Investors should consider taking smaller pilot positions and then buy more aggressively if the market uptrend strengthens.


Jamie Dimon Turns Gloomy
------------------------


Influential **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) CEO Jamie Dimon helped boost sentiment when he softened his tone on a possible U.S. recession last week. But his mood has soured over the past eight days.


"I said there were storm clouds. But I'm going to change it. It's a hurricane," he said at an AllianceBernstein conference Wednesday.


Dimon believes things appear fine at the moment because people are confident the Federal Reserve can tackle the growing economic problems, but this may not come to pass.


"That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way," he said. "We don't know if it's a minor one or Superstorm Sandy. You better brace yourself."


Last week he had gone as far as to say it does not look like economic problems could cause a "hurricane" like the one before the last major recession in 2008, so it is quite a course correction for Dimon.


Meanwhile the Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing PMI index climbed to 56.1 in May, up from 55.4 in April. This was better than expectations for a decline to 54.5.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said positive economic data has actually increased expectations the Fed will not ease up on its rate-hiking campaign, especially when coupled with aggressive rate-hiking talk by the Bank of Canada.


"The U.S. economy is still looking pretty good and that means the Fed may need to stick with the half-point rate hike pace beyond the summer," he said.

Energy Stocks Gush; Fertilizer Stocks Stink
-------------------------------------------


The industry group performance was another telling indicator of which areas were shining brightest.


It was a good day for energy stocks, with oil & gas explorers and producers, drillers and refiners all shining. Coal stocks were also an area of strength.


In contrast, agriculture chemicals stocks, which are still up mightily in 2022, were among the worst performers. Fertilizer plays like **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) and **Nutrien** ([NTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTR)) fell more than 3%.


Specialty and consumer electronics retailers also lagged, with consumer-loan plays also having a tough session.


Bulls Gain But Bears Still Reign In Key Gauge
---------------------------------------------


The latest advisors sentiment weekly report from [Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) saw the bulls charge closer to the bears, though they still have some ground to make up.


The bull-bear spread significantly narrowed. It slipped from -12.6% the previous week to -2.8%. Overall sentiment has now been negative for nine of the past 13 weeks.


The number of bearish advisors fell to 38% from 40.8%. Meanwhile, the bulls rose to 35.2% from 28.2%. The ratio of newsletter editors now projecting a correction also decreased, falling from 31% to 26.8%.

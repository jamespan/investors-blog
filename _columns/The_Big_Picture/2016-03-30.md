Stocks Rally; Breakouts Add Beef; Nasdaq Finally Tops 200-Day Line
===================================================================

With one trading session left in the first quarter of 2016, stocks on Wednesday gave growth investors a little more confidence to wade deeper into the market.


The major indexes padded Tuesday's gains with a broad -- albeit mild -- advance. Volume declined.


The gains by the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and even the S&P 100 -- which tracks the 100 largest companies by market cap -- all came within a tight range of 0.4% to 0.5%. Small caps underperformed, yet the S&P SmallCap 600 still mustered a rise of about 0.2% following Tuesday's 2.7% catapult.![MP033016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP033016-209x300.jpg)


Technically speaking, Wednesday's trade featured two key takeaways.


One, the Nasdaq composite reclaimed the 200-day moving average for the first time this year. The index's close on Wednesday wasn't ideal because it finished in the lower half of the intraday range. Yet the Nasdaq's volume was below its 50-day average, so there was no chance of stalling. In fact, the Nasdaq advanced enough during Wednesday to knock out the Feb. 26 stalling day that has been counted as a form of distribution, or serious institutional selling.


Hence, the Market Pulse table now shows the Nasdaq's distribution count at four. The average loss for those remaining four distributions? A mild 0.4%.


The second takeaway: Alert IBD readers are seeing more genuine breakouts. A few are seeing light volume, a concern. Yet the good news is, they're not all coming from the utility sector, one of the strongest areas of the market since Jan. 1. Indeed, IBD's New High list has shown large numbers of utilities (13 on Monday, 25 on Tuesday), totally understandable in an era of still near-zero short-term interest rates and increasing recognition of dividends for total return. IBD's business services, medical, building and retail sectors also lead the market in terms of stocks hitting 52-week or all-time highs.


Wednesday's solid if not spectacular ADP report in private-sector job growth (up 200,000) feeds well into a theme of investing in consumer-oriented names. IBD's restaurant industry group may still have a unsavory six-month ranking (111th as of Wednesday's IBD), but action by **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) (the newest member of [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx)), **Sonic** ([SONC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SONC)) and the world's largest all-day breakfast joint, **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), is encouraging.


One must resist the urge to bottom-fish. Yes, you may think the beef patties taste better at **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) (63% off its 52-week peak) or **Habit Restaurants** ([HABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HABT)) (off 52%). Yet these stocks have dry Composite Ratings of 54 and 53, respectively, and their [Relative Strength Ratings](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) still stink. It could take months, if not years, before such names truly bottom out, form solid bases and break out to new 52-week highs. That's a habit of great market winners, as seen by IBD research going back to the 1880s.


Lower gas prices have helped boost American households' capacity to spend lately. Yet the crude oil market's relatively stable action following a nearly six-week-long rebound has also helped stocks.

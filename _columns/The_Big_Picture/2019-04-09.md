  New Tariff Threats Sink Dow Jones; 3 Reasons Why The Stock Market Drop Didn't Smell So Bad

The S&P 500 halted an eight-session winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered bigger losses than the Nasdaq due to its heavier weighting in cyclicals. Small caps slid the hardest. Yet Tuesday's sell-off appeared less odorous than the headlines suggested.




President Donald Trump announced a 14-page list of $11 billion worth of European-made goods that could get slapped with tariffs at U.S. ports. They included wines and fine cheeses with the names of Roquefort, Pecorino and Gouda. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund slashed its global economic outlook for the full year. Oil traders quickly responded. U.S. near-term futures sank 1.1% to as low as $63.68 a barrel before cutting most of those losses.


"The producers who make specialty cheeses probably won't be that worried," Richard Scheper, an analyst at Rabobank, was quoted as telling Bloomberg. Scheper added that specialty cheeses are already expensive and it would be hard to substitute with American-made products in large quantities.


The major equity indexes, meanwhile, saw a middle-afternoon rebound attempt fizzle. Yet the overall session did not seem to give off indications that stocks are ripe to take a bearish turn.


The Nasdaq's nearly 0.6% drop almost matched the size of its March 27 decline. But Wednesday's pullback followed a strong run over the prior nine sessions in which the composite index rallied more than 4%.


The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones industrials shed 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.2%. The S&P SmallCap 600 also sank 1.2%, ending practically on top of its rising 50-day moving average.


Volume on the Nasdaq edged higher, by 4 million shares, to 2.06 billion shares. That's well less than a 1% increase. Nonetheless, it was enough to send the distribution-day count back up to four on the Nasdaq.

Just nine sessions earlier, on March 27, the Nasdaq's distribution count stood at a heavier-than-usual six days. Back then, IBD's outlook for stocks was at "uptrend under pressure."


Three Reasons Why The Stock Market Decline Was Not Bearish
----------------------------------------------------------


One reason Tuesday's drop wasn't alarming is that despite expectations of a severe slowdown in earnings growth for the current and subsequent quarters ([see the Monday Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/indexes-reverse-higher-repeat-bullish-theme-stock-market/) for more details), the market has so far not been forced to react to a slew of negative warnings on upcoming results.


Two, market internals did not look so terrible. Sure, losers outmatched winners by a meaningful margin, nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE and 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq. Yet in a positive divergence, more stocks notched new 52-week or all-time highs vs. new lows, according to early data.

Three, leading stocks did not have an awful day.


As seen in the Market Pulse table, the number of true market leaders falling in heavy volume was limited. Ditto for [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) itself. Few, if any at all, of the components saw a significant drop in volume that soared well above a stock's respective 50-day average.



The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund lost nearly 0.6%. While that pretty much matches the decline in the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, consider that a day of quasi-outperformance for the leaders. Why? Since the top growth stocks tend to bullet higher at a much faster rate than the major benchmarks, they also tend to drop harder on down days on Wall Street.


At 33.89, the IBD 50 ETF holds a 22.7% gain year to date, blasting a 14.9% return excluding dividends for the S&P 500.


The View From The Debt Markets
------------------------------


Bond traders also seem to have treated the new tariff plays by the White House in stride.


The spread between three-month T-bills and 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds finished the day at 10 basis points, up from six basis points at the start of the month. Fears of what a yield curve inversion would do to the economy and U.S. stocks have faded.

Medicals Lead Stocks Up, But Market Trains Its Sights On Fed
=============================================================

Stocks closed barely higher Tuesday after wiping away a decent amount of gains, a symptom of apprehension ahead of the Fed's new policy statement.


The S&P 500 salvaged a fractional gain while the Nasdaq rose 0.1%. Both were up as much as 0.6% earlier, and closed near session lows for a second day in a row. The indexes got up off the floor during afternoon trading, but a final blast of selling came in the closing minutes.


The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.3%. But the index held above its 50-day moving average and printed a minor loss compared with Monday's 0.6% gain.


The market tends to quiet down ahead of a policy statement from the Federal Reserve. Relatively few investors expect the Fed to raise rates Wednesday, but the mere possibility has kept traders on edge. Thus, Tuesday's slowdown in trading was no surprise.


![MP092016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MP092016-194x300.jpg)Few leadership-quality stocks jumped up in high volume. Health care stocks continued to outperform, notably biotechs and other drug manufacturers. **Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)) cleared the 203.47 buy point of a base within a larger consolidation.


**Supernus** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)) and **Glaukos** ([GKOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GKOS)) -- newer stocks that went public in 2012 and 2015 —  are among the sector's emerging leaders. **Amphastar** ([AMPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMPH)), which had its IPO in 2014, surged 12% on news that it's being added to the small-cap S&P 600 index.


Since the market low on Sept. 12, biotechs have taken the lead — up more than 9% as a group in that span, compared with a 2% increase for the ethical drugs industry group and 6% for generic drugs.


Because the market uptrend is under pressure, buying stocks has been riskier than normal. Wall Street could get more visibility from the Fed after it announces its rate policy and economic outlook Wednesday afternoon. The Nasdaq's rise from its 50-day line looks encouraging, but that's offset by a weaker bounce in the S&P 500 (which remains below its 50-day average) and a high number of distribution days.


Despite the risk, there's been a passel of leaders that has performed well the past couple of weeks, if investors braved the market current and timed their purchases correctly.


**Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) and **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) are some of the high-rated stocks that found support during normal-looking price pullbacks and are higher now.


**Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)) ended a four-day win streak. Shares fell 3%, a normal drop in the context of its high-velocity advance from support at the 50-day line. **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)) broke out of a base Sept. 2 and is up 4% from the 85.50 entry.


Troubled breakouts are no doubt a danger for investors. **BroadSoft** ([BSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSFT)), for example, tried to clear a 47.60 buy point Sept. 7 but has fallen back into its pattern. Broadsoft is in the IBD 50, which fell 0.3% Tuesday.


A couple of mid-tier stocks broke out of bases Tuesday — nothing to get the market stirred up much. **Dolby Labs** ([DLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLB)) topped the 51.54 buy point of a flat base, in volume 35% above normal. **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)) edged past the 46.14 buy point of a base-on-base pattern. But the seller of computer software and hardware closed below the entry, and volume was not impressive.


Homebuilders were weaker after housing starts fell more than expected. Earlier reports on the housing market were more positive, and much of the August drop in starts was due to rainy weather in the South.


Media stocks were broadly lower after **Sinclair Broadcasting Group** ([SBGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBGI)) cut its Q3 revenue forecast, saying political-ad spending is weaker than expected. It pegged Q3 political spending at $46 million, down from an August forecast of $58 million to $68 million. Sinclair shares tumbled 9% to the lowest level in nearly a year.


After the close, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) announced a $40 billion stock buyback and an increase in its quarterly dividend to 39 cents a share, up 8%. The software company's shares rose 1% in extended trading.

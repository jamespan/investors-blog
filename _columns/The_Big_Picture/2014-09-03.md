Nasdaq Suffers First Distribution Day Since Follow-Through
===========================================================

The Nasdaq encountered its first session of uninhibited institutional selling Wednesday. But the rest of the stock market largely didn't match the weakness.

  

The tech-centered Nasdaq composite fell 0.6%, taking a big slice out of the gains from the prior two sessions. The Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000, a benchmark for small caps, also dropped 0.6%.

  

Volume was just modestly higher on the Nasdaq, but it was enough to mark the session as a distribution day. A sudden flurry of distribution days over a matter of just a few weeks can be enough to overwhelm any uptrend, big or small, young or old.

  

In this case, though, distribution remains sparse since the Nasdaq triggered a follow-through to signal a new uptrend under way. The S&P 500 had suffered a stall-type distribution day Aug. 26. Light distribution is a good thing for the bulls. It means that the market's heavy hitters — namely mutual funds, banks, hedge funds and insurance companies — are generally more eager to accumulate shares than dump them.

  

The S&P 500's tiny decline of less than 0.1% in lower trade reflected this overall stance. The NYSE composite rose 0.2%.

  

Initial gains at the open appeared to be inspired by news reports of a truce between Ukraine and Russia. The market, however, didn't believe it for long.

  

In a strong market, it's common to see opening losses melt into gains, not what happened on Wednesday. Yet perhaps the market was due for a pullback after a torrid rise since early August.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL))'s 4% sell-off in nearly triple usual trade dominated the Nasdaq's decline. But most market leaders didn't lose much ground. The IBD 50 edged up less than 1 point.

  

Helping the IBD 50's cause was a unified show of strength among top Chinese names, including **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) and **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)). Today's International Leaders column on Page B10 notes strong data in China's service sectors may signal the Middle Kingdom's progress on expanding the consumer side of its economy.

  

Back in the U.S. markets, breadth was tilted toward losing stocks on both exchanges — including a 17-10 margin on the Nasdaq. Today's new highs list was beefy (see Page B1), but numerous leaders reversed. Bullishness among market newsletter editors jumped this week to 56.1%, according to the latest Investors Intelligence survey. Yet that's still far below its year-to-date peak of 62.6% registered in mid-June.

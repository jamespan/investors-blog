So, you are a growth investor. Which horse in the stock market would you have ridden on today -- the utilities or **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL))?


Kind of a tough choice, right?


The question, in some respects, neatly sums up most of Wednesday's action. That is, it wasn't the sort of day that the bulls would feel absolutely gung-ho about, following Tuesday's broad sell-off in heavier trade.


Apple's 3.6% rally to 111.83 and breakout from a bottoming base at 110.33 was a spectacle itself and helped to hoist the Nasdaq composite to a nearly 0.4% gain Wednesday. The rest of the market showed bland action. Apple's big gain failed to lift the Dow Jones industrials, which edged about 0.2% lower. The S&P 500 reversed from a humdrum early gain to finish less than 0.1% lower. The NYSE composite followed course, falling 0.2%.


![MP090616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MP090616-1-205x300.jpg)Volume slipped on both exchanges.


The only other index to hit the upside? Yes, you guessed it -- the Dow Jones utility average, up 0.4%. Electric, gas and water suppliers continue to beat their peers by more than a few horse lengths; the Dow utilities are up 14.5%, vs. a 4.1% gain for the S&P 500.


An Aug. 9 stalling day, a rare form of distribution (or day of heavy professional selling), fell off the count due to time. However, as the accompanying Market Pulse table shows, the market is still shouldering an elevated amount of heavy drops in higher volume that the risk of spilling over into a correction is still relatively high.


As Tuesday's Big Picture column noted, the low probability of a U.S. recession continues to make it tough sledding for the bears. A rising yield curve is also positive for the market, even though the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield is still south of 2.5%. The nation's banks likely view near-zero interest rates in much the manner of seeing the prospects of squeezing blood from a stone.


But Wednesday's action also masked the positive emergence of a small number of younger companies with the sort of earnings and sales increases and great products that are so critical to institutional investors. Some are certainly feeding off the immense power and success of Apple, which started its mighty run more than 12 years ago on March 4, 2004, when it leapt out of a superb cup-with-handle base at 24.94. Adjusting for stock splits (a 2-for-1 and a 7-for-1), that pivot point would be 1.78.


Apple's sales and earnings are no longer growing at triple-digit or high-double-digit rates. Instead, the company has become a bellwether for the smartphone industry. Investors are enthused by reports that some cellular service providers are reporting robust preorders for the iPhone 7.


If you wish to find the next thoroughbreds of the stock market, you have to think new. That's the N in CAN SLIM, after all.


If you are from Laguna Hills, Calif., you might be scratching your head and wondering: How did an innovative medical tech firm with a novel treatment for glaucoma wind up in this Orange County beach-area town? But that's what **Glaukos** ([GKOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GKOS)) is all about. The small-cap play, the latest company highlighted in IBD's The New America column (see the latest IBD Weekly print edition), is putting the finishing touches on a cup base, yielding for now a 36.60 buy point. It's posted two quarters in a row of earnings following years of net losses.


Look at the **[top 40 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-sep-13-2016/)**, and you'll see that computer networking and security software stocks have surged from way back in the crowd. Eight weeks ago, the former was ranked 132nd among 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance; the latter ranked No. 147th.
Now, these two groups host emerging new leaders like **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) (up 4% past a 79.80 narrow handle entry on a long cup pattern).Â **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) (99 Composite), No. 2 in the IBD 50, is part of the related telecom-infrastructure industry group, ranked No. 63 as of Tuesday's close.


On Wednesday, other high-growth-oriented industries rallied too, including fiber optics, chipmakers, fabless semiconductors, biotechs and discount retailers. The groups that led the market's downside -- solar, wholesale drug supply, airlines, shipping and hospitals -- have largely sat out the market's thin rally in 2016 so far.

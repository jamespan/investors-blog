  Why The Stock Market Sell-Off May Be Pausing

The stock market sell-off initially continued Thursday, but indexes pared losses enough to suggest a new period of intense selling is subsiding.




The Nasdaq composite was down as much as 2.4% but battled back impressively to close 0.4% higher. The S&P 500 also reversed positively, down less than 0.2% after erasing a loss of nearly 3%. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.3% lower.


Not only were the reversals bullish, but some indexes seemed to hold at critical technical price levels.


The Nasdaq found support near 7000, a level that drew buyers in late October and November. The Dow is holding around 24,250, roughly its floor during the autumn swoon.

The S&P 500 undercut its Nov. 23 near-term low by a modest amount, though it acted just as bullishly as the other main indexes.


With a good shakeout Thursday, the market now attempts a new rebound. But judging from the market's volatility since October, any bounce is far from certain.


Earlier this week, indexes met resistance at the 50-day moving averages. That short-circuited a rally building with the [Nov. 28 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-cheers-powell-remarks-bottoming-signal/). That's now two follow-throughs followed by sharp weakness.


The Dow and S&P 500 erased the year's gains at the depths of the session but salvaged small gains by the close. The Nasdaq has a 4% year-to-date gain. The Russell 2000 small-cap index, down 0.2% on Thursday, sank to its lowest level since Feb. 9 before recovering.


Volume rose from Tuesday's totals, but the S&P 500 did not suffer a new distribution day since its loss was minuscule. The stock market closed Wednesday in honor of former President George H.W. Bush's funeral.


Energy, Financials, Materials Lag
---------------------------------


The S&P 500 had a tougher time Thursday because of steep declines in energy, financial and material stocks.


The energy sector was the weakest. [An OPEC meeting failed to calm worries over a supply glut](https://www.investors.com/news/opec-meeting-crude-oil-production-cut-oil-prices/). The price of U.S. oil futures skidded more than 4% earlier, and late Thursday traded down 2.3% at $51.66 a barrel.


Financials got whacked after bond yields continued a monthlong decline. The yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year note lost 4 basis points to 2.87%.


The market opened sharply lower Thursday after news that a top executive at Chinese technology company Huawei was arrested on charges of violating sanctions against Iran. The arrest angered China and threatened to undo the goodwill China and the U.S. forged in trade talks over the weekend. Already, details of a 90-day halt on tariffs puzzled Wall Street.


But the market found some comfort in an afternoon report that the [Federal Reserve may be tapping the brakes on monetary tightening](https://www.wsj.com/articles/restrained-inflation-reduces-urgency-for-quarterly-rate-increase-pattern-1544127856?mod=breakingnews). While the market expects a quarter-point increase in the fed funds rate later this month, the Fed is pondering slowing the pace of rate hikes next year, the Wall Street Journal reported.


Remember, it was Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's dovish remarks that sparked the Nov. 28 follow-through. On Friday, the jobs report for November comes out before the market opens, and it's likely to add to the discussion on interest rates.


IBD 50 Also Rebounds
--------------------


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) erased almost its entire morning loss. However, it is down nearly 20% from its prior high and the average IBD 50 stock is 11.5% below its prior high. That reflects the fact that so many leading stocks still have some work to do on their [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Earnings reports haven't been kind to many leaders. After the close, **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) skidded following their [quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/ulta-beauty-earnings-ulta-beauty-stock/).


Earlier, **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) plummeted 17% after it gave weak guidance for the holiday quarter. **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) fell nearly 3% after it too [gave mixed guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/five-below-earnings-despite-stock-market-closure/).


Both Ollie's and Five Below are retailers that had made tremendous runs already. Their sell-offs weren't surprising at this stage of their long-term advances and are symptomatic of the market environment.


The stock uptrend is not dead, but it remains under pressure. Investors need to reduce exposure and be extra picky with any new stock purchase. It is important to heed sell signals.

Nasdaq, S&P 500 Hit All-Time Highs; Snap Is A Stock Market Leader
==================================================================

The stock market turned in a solid performance Thursday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 marched to all-time highs. Tech giants **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) are in or near buy zones as more technology stocks pick up the pace.




The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%. The S&P 500 gained 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrials rose 1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 moved up 1.3%. Leading growth stocks outperformed on Thursday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.3%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose slightly on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


Following solid gains earlier in the week, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 notched more record highs Thursday, providing additional confirmation of a [strengthening market trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains just below its 50-day moving average.


![MP062421](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP062421-260x300.jpg)On Tuesday, IBD [upgraded its market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-bullish-step-why-one-money-manager-sees-sp-500-hitting-5000-in-2022/) to "confirmed uptrend." Following Thursday's action, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both have three distribution days, a modest amount of institutional selling. Investors should feel confident buying top stocks breaking out past correct buy points in heavy volume.


But recent breakouts have shown mixed results. Strong performers include **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) (up about 17% from a 236.21 buy point) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) (up nearly 19% from a 648.67 buy point). Slow-going breakouts include **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)). Both are in buy range above their entries. Keep in mind you have to be patient with breakouts and give them time to develop. Cutting them too soon could have you missing out on potential upside.

Stock Analysis: Snap
--------------------


[Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/snap-stock-ibd-stock-of-day-closer-to-buy-territory/), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), is just out of buy range past a 63.94 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a cup with handle, according to [IBD MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The 5% buy zone tops out at 67.14. Shares initially broke out on June 11, but quickly ran into resistance. After falling as much as 7% below the entry on June 16, the stock regained its entry on Wednesday and extended gains Thursday. An alternative entry in a cup base exists at 65.96. That 5% buy zone goes up to 69.26.


While the parent of Snapchat has yet to turn a profit, Snap has posted three quarters in a row of accelerating revenue growth — from 17% to 52%, 62% and 66% — and is expected to maintain that streak in the current quarter. [Accelerating sales growth](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accelerating-earnings-trigger-upcoming-big-stock-moves/) is a fundamental hallmark of big stock moves.



From a technical perspective, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) is at recent highs, indicating strong stock market outperformance. An RS line at new highs on the breakout day indicates a market leader.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [SNAP stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-snap-inc-cl-a-snap.aspx) boasts a strong 97 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/), a confirmation that the stock exhibits both fundamental and technical strength. Snap is also an [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: PayPal, Roku
-------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock PayPal climbed 1.8% Thursday and is trading above the 5% buy zone from a 277.96 entry in a [cup base,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) a pattern that formed within a larger consolidation. The 5% buy zone runs up to 291.86.


Leaderboard noted the stock's five-week win streak makes up for a lackluster [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/). The stock's RS Rating is 80 out of 99, barely what should be considered a leadership level. PayPal is also an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/).


[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock Roku edged up 0.5%, extending a win streak to six sessions. Shares are tracing a base, although Leaderboard identified a 397.79 buy point in a deep double-bottom base. The stock is extended from that buy area, leaving the February high as the next possible entry.

Stocks Rise Broadly, And Why Small Caps Are Beating The Main Indexes
=====================================================================

In a day of solid and broad gains for the stock market, it was small caps that rocked again.




The Russell 2000 rallied 2.3% to reach a new high for the second day in a row. The small-cap benchmark is running away with stock market performance since November. Last month, the Russell 2000 beat other major indexes with an 18.3% romp, and so far in December, it is up more than 7%. That's more than double the Nasdaq's increase of nearly 3.3%.


Small-cap stocks that stand out include **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)), which broke out of a base in more than double its average volume Tuesday. Cannabis farm owner **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) is climbing from a three-weeks-tight pattern. **Renewable Energy Group** ([REGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGI)) is following through on a breakout.


The small-cap rally isn't so surprising in the context of an economic recovery. Historically, smaller stocks tend to outperform in these times.


![MP121520](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP121520-200x300.jpg)So far, small-caps have lagged the recovery in leading indicators such as the ISM Index, the yield curve and inflation expectations, Solita Marcelli, head of CIO Americas at UBS Financial Services, said in a report Tuesday. Marcelli also sees a valuation advantage for small caps. So she expects some upside in the coming months. The MSCI World Small Cap Index price-to-book ratio has reached a multi-year low compared to large-caps â€” a 35% discount vs. a historical average of 18%.


Broad Gains For Stock Market
----------------------------


Unlike [Monday's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-tech-in-favor-as-small-caps-nasdaq-lead-stocks/), gains Tuesday were spread out among most sectors and indexes. Every S&P sector rose. Advancing stocks led decliners by a 3-1 ratio on the NYSE and by 7-to-3 on the Nasdaq.


The advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE are near new highs. That shows a good amount of breadth in the current stock market uptrend.


Indexes closed at session highs. After a bad reversal Monday, the S&P 500 now looks to be rebounding from a test of the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average came close to touching their own 21-day lines, and also held above that price trend indicator.


The Russell 2000's surge overshadowed strong gains from other indexes. The Nasdaq climbed 1.2% and the S&P 500 1.3%, while the Dow added 1.1%. Even the faltering Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) bounced 2% after falling for about five weeks.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE as well.


The IBD 50 stood high with the rest of the market. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed 1.6% and reached an all-time high. **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) broke out of an undefined base in heavy volume, topping an 81.33 buy point.


Breakouts So Far Productive
---------------------------


With a handful more [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) Tuesday, growth investors have plenty of opportunities. Breakouts are working for the most part. Taking breakouts of stocks with Composite Ratings of at least 90, the average stock is up more than 8% from its [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


While growth investors have reason to cheer, remember that by some indicators, the stock market is getting a bit frothy. If stocks get rattled, plan in advance when you'll sell a stock, or reduce exposure. That way, you won't sell in a panic and commit a trading error.


The S&P 500 has five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which cannot be dismissed either.


The stock market appeared to climb on new hopes for a stimulus package to help Americans and businesses hurt by coronavirus restrictions. Late Tuesday, congressional leaders were meeting to try to reach an agreement. Lawmakers face funding deadlines, which is spurring more discussions.

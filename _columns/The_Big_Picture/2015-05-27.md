Merger. Mania. Again. Another potential blockbuster deal in the ever-evolving semiconductor sector helped light a fire among technology stocks Wednesday as the rest of the stock market followed higher.

  

The Nasdaq composite led with a 1.5% rebound, more than recouping Tuesday's 1.1% decline. Volume increased nearly 5%, a positive sign for the bulls; it indicated that institutional trading desks had gotten busier and demanded more stocks.

  

At 5106, the Nasdaq posted an all-time closing high, eclipsing the old mark of 5092 seen on April 24.

  

The Nasdaq is also just half of 1% away from taking out the all-time high of 5132.52, set on March 10, 2000.

  

The Nasdaq 100, a gauge of the 100 largest nonfinancial names on the Nasdaq exchange, rallied 1.6%. At 4546, it has a lot more work to match its 2000 all-time peak of 4816.

  

The Philadelphia semiconductor index, or the SOX, jumped 3.9%. The IBD 50 rallied 1.9%.

  

**Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), a Singapore-based supplier of chips for a variety of industries, powered well past a 136.38 buy point as it rose 10.19 to 141.49. The 5% buy zone stretches to 143.20. It's reportedly in talks to acquire broadband and mobile chip expert **Broadcom** ([BRCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRCM)). Avago recently completed its buy of Emulex to beef up its offerings in high-speed data networking.

  

The scene in the chip space is not unlike what investors have been seeing in the ethical drug and biotech arena.

  

Thanks in part to the low cost of money, strong cash flows and steady demand for medicines, companies like **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) (trying to break out past 305.87) to **Mallinckrodt** ([MNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNK)) (forming a new base) also stand in the market's vanguard.

  

As of Wednesday's IBD (see Page B6), the No. 1 chips sector was up 15.4% since Jan. 1. Medical was No. 4, up 13.2%. The sector rankings factor in multiple performance periods.

  

The S&P 500 lagged the Nasdaq, up 0.9% Wednesday. Several oil-related groups sank.

  

Nevertheless, the S&P 500 showed bullish action. As seen on the large daily chart on Page B2, the large-cap benchmark held above its rising 50-day moving average. Since March, this key support line has helped contain a number of mild pullbacks.

  

Breadth was encouraging. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by nearly 3 to 1. On the Nasdaq, the ratio was more than 2 to 1. If the new high list grows, it would be another good sign for the rally.

Modest winning streaks for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq came to an end Tuesday, but damage was limited. The Nasdaq fell 0.7% in higher volume, resulting in a distribution day, but it managed to close in the upper half of its intraday range. Biotechs were weak again, but overall breadth wasn't too bad on the Nasdaq as declining stocks outnumbered advancers by about 3 to 2.

  

The S&P 500 eased 0.4%, helped in part by a rising energy sector. Crude oil jumped $2.27, or 4.9%, to $48.53 a barrel, its highest settlement since late August. The gain came after OPEC forecast big cuts to oil investments that will likely ease production and reduce supply.

  

On the NYSE, advancing stocks topped decliners by a small margin.

  

The Dow added 0.1%, buoyed by **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)), which soared nearly 8%. Wall Street liked news that CEO Ella Kullman is stepping down at the end of next week. Former Tyco CEO Edward Breen was named interim CEO, which means that big changes could be in store regarding DuPont's cost structure and overall strategy.

  

The IBD 50 lagged badly, falling 1.6% as 19 names lost 2% or more. **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)), **Inogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)) and **Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)) got hit the hardest, with losses of 5%-8%.

  

Tuesday's distribution day for the Nasdaq shows that sellers are still around in this market. The market remains in a confirmed uptrend, thanks to Friday's follow-through for the S&P 500, but it's still a risky environment.

  

The Nasdaq's 50-day moving average is a potential resistance level. The S&P 500 closed just below its 50-day moving average Tuesday. Even if it climbs above the line, it still has its 200-day line to contend with at around 2,060.

  

There is one main difference between the Nasdaq's Sept. 8 follow-through, which failed quickly, and the one that the S&P 500 flashed on Friday: The latter is working better â€” at least for now. In September, a bearish reversal in higher volume right after the follow-through raised immediate doubts.

  

This time, more top stocks are breaking out, too.

  

Monday's session served up several breakouts from the likes of **Verisk Analytics** ([VRSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRSK)), **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)), **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) and **Autobytel** ([ABTL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABTL)).

  

All four names turned in solid showings Tuesday, either extending gains or refusing to give up much ground.

  

Tumbleweeds blew through Tuesday's breakout screen, but **J2 Global** ([JCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCOM)) made the cut. After soaring nearly 5% Monday in solid volume, the midcap cleared an eight-week base with a 75.72 buy point. **Monolithic Power** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) tried to break out from a lengthy consolidation but closed near its low after early strength.

  

After the close, **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) plunged 18% after the company reported disappointing earnings. **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) fell after the company updated its guidance.

  

It's a quiet week for economic data, but all eyes will be on the minutes from the Sept. 17 Fed meeting when they're released Thursday. CME Group FedWatch has the odds of a rate hike at the Oct. 27-28 meeting at 5%.

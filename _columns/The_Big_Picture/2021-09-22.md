  Fed Taper Decision Bolsters Budding Rebound; These Growth Stocks Spearhead Leadership

Fed clarity, for the most part, wins the day.




Led by its chair, Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve soothed investors' concerns over the economy and how the most powerful bank on the planet will go about slowly weaning Wall Street off its financially induced multiyear IV drip — in the form of quantitative easing, or QE.


[As noted in IBD](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-surprise-fed-rate-hike-in-2022-fed-chief-powell-dow-jones-rallies/), Powell made it clear that the U.S. central bank first wants to see even more progress on the jobs front. Second, the Fed could begin reducing its $120 billion worth of monthly Treasury bond and federal agency mortgage-based securities possibly after the next meeting on interest rates on Nov. 2-3.


And the QE-type monetary easing policy could get wrapped up by as early as the middle of 2022.


What Will The Fed Do Next
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP092221-201x300.jpg)"With the addition of 2024 to the dot plot, investors get the first glimpse of detail on the frequency of rate hikes the FOMC has in mind," Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede, wrote in a note sent to IBD.


"The verdict for now is that the Fed plans to take its time normalizing interest rates, at somewhere between a bi-annual or tri-annual pace of rate hikes beginning in 2023 through 2024," Pride wrote. "However, it is difficult (if not straight up impossible) to predict economic trends multiple years in advance, so actual developments may cause the FOMC to change course, particularly if inflation and labor market frictions prove more stubborn than transitory."


The benchmark U.S. Treasury bond fell Wednesday, sending the yield up 1 basis point to 1.33%. Cboe data shows the yield started the year at 0.91%.


A 1% gain Wednesday by the Nasdaq composite, following a limp 0.2% rebound the prior session, failed to recoup all of Monday's 2.2% thumping. Yet for now, in a partial victory for the bulls, the tech-centered index made its way back above its still-rising [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


The S&P 500 matched the Nasdaq's gain. So did the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dashed 2.1% higher and made fresh all-time highs.


Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


A Modest Pullback So Far
------------------------



The Aug. 17 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 expired on time.


Small caps outperformed. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) rose almost 1.6%. The popular ETF also came within 2 pennies of closing smack dab on its 50-day line.


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund, up 0.9%, came short of retaking its own 50-day moving average. Yet at 369.57, the yardstick for the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq stands less than 3.5% beneath its all-time high.


That type of pullback, for now, seems to befit an IBD decision on Friday to downgrade the current market outlook to "uptrend under pressure."


Beyond Fed Talk: Breadth Still A Concern
----------------------------------------


Market breadth brightened. The number of gainers far outstripped losers on the NYSE, by a 3-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, winners led 5-to-2.


As the accompanying Market Pulse shows, more leading stocks in tech, medical, retail and other key sectors generally rose in heavy turnover than those that fell in brisk turnover.



When the uptrend is under pressure, IBD is telling readers to be very cautious about making new buys. Certainly, numerous breakouts have failed. Some quickly turned into losses of 7% or 8%, forcing new buyers to [cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Others, such as **Figs** ([FIGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIGS)) and **Cameco** ([CCJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCJ)), have forfeited all of their recent gains from breakouts or rebounds off the 10-week moving averages.


A move to "uptrend under pressure," sort of a yellow light for growth investors, has already taken place three times since May. Yet each time, the major indexes found a way to recoup losses or reach new highs. That's a positive sign even as a wall of worry remains tall.

Pain caused by the news surrounding Chinese property developer Evergrande has likely lost some of its sting — for now.


Goldman Sachs has reportedly estimated a $350 billion potential hit to that country's economy if the firm were to default on its interest-rate payments. Evergrande is expected to default on its interest payments due on Thursday. Day-to-day volatility in the U.S. stock market could stay high as investors wait to see how China's government handles its latest financial crisis.


A Trading Coach's Advice
------------------------


For sure, Monday's sudden sell-off reaffirms the importance not only of staying disciplined with each position, but also to immediately look at one's recent trades and try to spot mistakes.


Among investors, "By and large there's a big gap between their best trades and their worst trades," Jared Tendler, a coach to fund managers and trading pros over the past decade and author of "The Mental Game Of Trading," told IBD in an interview. "A lot of investors often measure improvement based on their best decisions. But they forget they need to improve on the worst decisions. Maintaining consistency is a byproduct of knowing how to handle your worst misses."


The best investors, Tendler says, "are almost maniacal" in striving to eliminate their worst trading mistakes. Big errors not only burn a lot of capital. They make anyone feel frustration, which is the source of anger.


Tendler, a former collegiate golfer, also coaches professionals on the PGA and in the poker circuits. He recently finished a stint advising Team Liquid in the esports gaming field. With four months left in the year, Tendler makes all his clients pay attention to diet, rest and sleep in order to optimize performance.


"An idea that has helped non-athletes is to think of themselves as athletes. That is, your decision-making process is equivalent to a golf swing or a pitcher's motion. If you think like an athlete, what helps you stay at your best becomes even more important," he said.

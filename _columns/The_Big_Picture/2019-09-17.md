Did The Stock Market Today Show A Change In Psychology On Interest Rates?

One-hit wonders. Positive vibes after [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Solid action by the major benchmarks. And a bit of puzzling investor psychology.




As quiet as Tuesday's [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) may have seemed, it also left careful IBD readers with a lingering taste in their mouths, wondering how Wall Street will react to the next decision by the powerful Federal Reserve.


Let's first consider the question of investor psychology.


The biggest drop seen by market watchers today? One could easily argue that it was the more than 6% plunge in crude oil futures to below $59 a barrel, a day after West Texas Intermediate near-term future prices rocketed more than 12%. But something fell even harder: the chances that the Federal Reserve will lower the cost of money again.

A Bigger Drop Than Crude Oil
----------------------------


On Tuesday, the probability of another quarter-point cut in short-term interest rates, as measured by the CME Group analysis of fed funds rates futures traders, plunged to 51.9%. On Sept. 10, the chances stood at 92.3%. That's a big drop indeed. Chances remain good, though, for at least one more 25-basis-point cut by December, at roughly 84%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP091719-227x300.jpg)So, curiously, why didn't U.S. stock prices fall?


After all, since December, the market has shown a strong willingness to sell equities on any whiff of a future hike in interest rates. Indeed, in January, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell publicly walked back his view on raising the fed funds rate, stocks soared. Jan. 4 turned out to mark a [new follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).


[The Jan. 4 Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/) showcased the pivotal move in stocks.


"I don't Powell is any more or less focused on market values than his predecessors (including Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen), but he is attuned," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the U.S. SPDR exchange traded funds business at State Street Global Advisors, told IBD in a phone interview. "


Yields On The Long End Going Up
-------------------------------


On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond slipped 3 basis points to 1.81%, but still up 34 basis points vs. the start of the month. Three-month T-bills are at 1.99% and two-year notes at 1.72%. The 30-year bond yields 2.27%.


Perhaps Tuesday's light gains (up 0.4% by the Nasdaq composite, up nearly 0.3% for the S&P 500) reflect a budding confidence among institutional investors that interest rates are low enough to allow the economy to keep growing. Nonetheless, we should expect to see more price swings on Wednesday, when the U.S. central bank decides what to do with the current rate on overnight loans to big banks.


On July 31, it made history again by cutting the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to a 2%-2.25% target range. That marked the first reduction in more than a decade.


Volume trickled 0.1% higher on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. NYSE volume fell.


The Russell 2000 cooled off, but its 0.4% decline proved very mild. For now, it holds a nice cushion above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), which flattened out last week and is starting to inch higher.


Meanwhile, **Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)), **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) (which announced that [carne asada](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-stock-carne-asada/) will go onto the menus of all its U.S. stores for a limited time), **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and other consumer spending-oriented leading stocks are behaving well after posting [new breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) or rebounding off the 10-week moving average after a good breakout.



One Hit Wonders In The Stock Market Today
-----------------------------------------


The one-hit wonders on Wall Street? Oil and gas explorers deserve that moniker. Reuters reported Saudi energy officials expressing confidence that the flagship Abqaiq oil production complex can return to full capacity within two to three weeks.


Britain's **BP** ([BP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BP)) lost two-thirds of its nice Monday gains with a 2.1% flop on Tuesday. Volume fell vs. the prior session, yet still bulged 83% above normal levels. Go to a [MarketSmith daily chart](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks), and you'll see that the stock still stands deep in the shadow of its falling 200-day moving average.


One small section of the gargantuan energy sector still continues to stand out in glorious exception: the photovoltaic energy specialists.


Will Solar Soar?
----------------



**SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) showed another day of bullish gains amid a test of the 10-week moving average, its second since August. Shares climbed 4.7% in heavy volume. It trades on average 1.04 million shares a day.

**SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) surged 12% and is showing that institutional investors believe the solar panel maker has turnaround potential.

The [solar energy group ranks No. 2 for six-month relative price performance](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-sep-17-2019/) among IBD's 197 industries.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) turned in its fourth gain in five sessions, and Tuesday's 1.1% lift is the biggest among the four up days. At 33.11, it's getting close to taking back a 20% year-to-date advance.


Beyond The Stock Market Today: The Long-Term Risk
-------------------------------------------------


Going beyond this week's action, Arone at State Street Global Advisors thinks "the biggest risk to the U.S. economy continues to be sluggish business spending." And near-zero interest rates have much to do with it.


He notes that corporate executives have seven options to use excess cash flows. They include paying higher dividends; retiring outstanding debt; increasing share buybacks; hiring more workers and raising employee salaries; making acquisitions; investing in more capital goods and equipment; and saving for a rainy day.


Arone believes near-zero interest rates do not inspire executives to boost capital expenditures. Why? They do not offer what Arone calls a "reasonable hurdle rate" that encourages corporate risk taking for creating long-term growth.


"How much more capital do Apple and Microsoft need? If you ask the question, 'Who needs zero rates?', the answer comes down to three groups: governments with heavy debt burdens that want to keep the costs of interest down, the over-leveraged consumer and weak businesses that lack long-term profitability," Arone said.

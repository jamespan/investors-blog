The stock market hit record highs again Tuesday, and leading stocks continued to flourish — precisely the time for investors to be on guard.




The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.4% for its ninth new high in the past 11 days. The S&P 500 added 0.8%, in the seventh consecutive session in which the index made a record high.


Indexes rallied into the close. Advancing stocks led decliners by 12-to-7 on the New York Stock Exchange and by nearly 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq. The only quibble was volume, which fell from Monday's levels and seemed light for the magnitude and breadth of the day's gains.


Tuesday's advance was the latest chapter in an astonishing summer rally during which the Nasdaq jumped 6% in June, 6.8% in July and 9.6% in August.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP090120-231x300.jpg)With indexes in full rally mode, several [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) dropped off the count in the past week. That gives you an idea how strong the advance has been. Occurrences of heavy institutional selling are not sticking long enough to count.


The IBD 50 rose to a record high of its own Tuesday, up 2.7% and the best increase since July 20. **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) gapped up on a 41% vault after the videoconferencing company [trounced second-quarter earnings and sales expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zoom-earnings-zoom-stock-zm-q2-2020/). **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) surged more than 11%, another big contributor to the IBD 50.


Breakouts in the past few weeks have been abundant and productive. Among stocks with 90-plus Composite Ratings, only a few, such as **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) are not following through from buy points.


The stock market, it seems, faces little opposition on the way to even more new highs.


Stock Market Getting Too Hot?
-----------------------------


Yet, the market still lacks an important element — a good sell-off to sober up the crowd. While there are scant signs of a top, there's some evidence of froth in the market.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are starting to veer above price channels. September is historically a down month for stocks.


By at least one measure, complacency is creeping into the market. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) has fallen below 0.6 for several days. It was 0.5 on Tuesday. That's considered a danger level, when bearish bets fall to unusually low levels. It's a bearish sign because investors tend to be wrong at extreme levels of market enthusiasm or pessimism.


But keep in mind this is a secondary indicator. The put-call volume ratio fell below 0.6 in late July, and the market hardly flinched. In early June, there was a similar dip in the ratio but again the market indexes fell only modestly.


At the moment, there is no reason to curtail your exposure to stocks. But be prepared for a sudden cabin depressurization. Not that a pullback would necessarily be that harsh.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8% Tuesday. Dow component **Walmar**t ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) rose more than 6% after the retailer [announced its Walmart+ membership program](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-walmart-plus-amazon-prime/) with digital ordering and delivery service. Many view the new service as a challenge to **Amazon.com**'s ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Prime service.


Small caps made up for Monday's poor performance with a 1.1% jaunt in the Russell 2000. The index found support at its 21-day exponential moving average.

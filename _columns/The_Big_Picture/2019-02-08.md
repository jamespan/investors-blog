The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a seventh weekly gain in a row, even though it melted a touch on Friday. The Dow lagged small gains by the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Russell 2000, all of which shuffled ahead around 0.1% each. Volume cooled.




Blame a nearly 0.3% drop by the price-weighted Dow Jones industrials in large part on health care sector component **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)). The medical insurance and health care data titan slumped more than seven points to 261.90.


Despite UnitedHealth's first weekly loss since the start of 2019, the Dow managed to eke out a weekly advance of nearly 0.2%. Perhaps more importantly, the Dow has been closing above its long-term 200-day moving average for several days.


Dow Jones Shows This Bullish Move
---------------------------------


In general, the equity markets have shown healthy action when the key averages led their 50- and 200-day moving averages higher. The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 have yet to do so. Yet a quick rundown of other positive factors should embolden IBD readers to be disciplined in buying good stocks at the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MP020819-291x300.jpg)Since the [Jan. 4 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/), more stocks have been hitting [new highs vs. new lows](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has risen nicely for nearly seven weeks. And most breakouts have been working. Some have retreated to their [pivot points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). That's normal.


Given the gloomy headlines in recent days regarding the struggles by U.S. and Chinese negotiators on bilateral trade, a cooling of the German economy, and the political and economic chaos engulfing Venezuela, it would be understandable to mentally surrender to such news. Yet the market is refusing to throw in the towel.


Good Action Friday
------------------


Indexes wiped out sharp early losses Friday and ended near the top of their intraday ranges. (See the charts up close via the General Market Indicators PDF at the bottom of this story.) That's bullish. It means institutional demand for equities is still heavy.


Meanwhile, it would not be an exaggeration to declare that top-rated growth stocks are body-slamming the performance of the major indexes. One only has to view the post-breakout gains of names such as chip designer **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) (up 19% past a 95.28 [breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)), fast casual chain **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) (extended past a 501.08 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [solid double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/)), enterprise software innovator **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) (its second breakout attempt past an 89.92 entry on Jan. 22 worked out) and **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) (up an amazing 39% after clearing an unusual yet valid [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) at 23.96 on Dec. 10 last year).



Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) and Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) are hammering the market with year-to-date returns of 14.4% and 10.9%, respectively.


IBD Readers Can Pound The Dow Jones Return As Well
--------------------------------------------------


Those who are brand-new to IBD can sharply improve individual results and even score a chance to body-slam the major indexes. How? First, wipe out the bad habits that lead to big losses, including letting losing investments spin out of control. That's what the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) is for. Never let a loss grow more than 8%.


Here are five steps to beat the market:


1. Focus on market direction and buy only when the Market Pulse shows a current outlook of "market in confirmed uptrend."
2. Focus your money on leading sectors (see the [stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/)) and the top 40 industry groups, or those that are climbing fast up the rankings.
3. Try to buy only the No. 1 or No. 2 name in a top industry group. Don't settle for the shell. Go for the oyster. Use [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) to compare stocks in the same group.
4. Use charts to spot the right buy points. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) can help you sharpen your timing skills.
5. Put more money in companies that are making you money, not losing. Don't feed your losers.

Stocks rebounded furiously Wednesday. Investors treated news from the Federal Reserve's final meeting in 2014 on interest rates like it was a Christmas gift from a cherished relative.


The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.1%, ending a three-day slide and recouping well more than half of those losses.


The S&P 500 wasn't far behind, up 2%. Volume grew on both exchanges, a sign that bullish traders were eager to buy.


Neither index could keep up with small caps, however. The Russell 2000 catapulted 3.1% higher while the small-cap S&P 600 rallied 2.7%.


Market players had waited to see if the U.S. central bank would unveil any change in its stance on when to boost the fed funds rate, or what large banks pay for overnight loans. There was no such change.


Moreover, the Fed added that, despite further improvement in the jobs market, "it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."


Since December 2008, the fed funds rate has held at zero to 0.25%. The Fed wants banks to make more loans and investors to pour money into areas in which they could get a bigger return.


Once the news hit the wires, stocks of all stripes ran higher. Beaten-down oil stocks surged. Only two of IBD's 197 industry groups lost ground.


The IBD 50 jumped 2.4%; every stock in Wednesday's list was up.


If buyers continue to flood the market, the likely prospect is that the current correction may turn out to be milder than the 10.7% slide seen by the Nasdaq in September to mid-October. So far, the latest decline has been confined to 5.5%.


However, Wednesday's action was not enough to change the Market Pulse's current outlook. What to do now? Keep watching the market every day.


The market's technical picture improved a bit. On the NYSE, winners thumped losers by a nearly 8-to-1 margin. That should affect the look of the NYSE's advance-decline line. The sensational drop of crude oil prices has certainly rattled some equity investors. The latest Investors Intelligence survey (see Page B11) shows bullishness among pundits falling below 50% for the first time in eight weeks.


IBD's air freight group fell as industry heavyweight **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) announced a 36% rise in November-quarter earnings per share that missed the consensus view. It gapped down 4% in huge trade.


On Oct. 17, FedEx retook a 155.41 flat-base buy point and rose as much as 18%. When the market is in a correction, take gains more quickly. Often a breakout rally won't hit 20%.

Sellers were in the stock market for the better part of Monday's session, but a round of buying in the last half-hour of trading lifted the indexes off lows.


Airlines took it on the chin, partly due to a new immigration policy set in motion over the weekend by the White House. Names like **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)), and **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) all broke below their 50-day moving averages in heavy volume, giving current longs with a profit good reason to trim positions or sell outright.


The Nasdaq composite fell 0.8%, trimming an intraday loss of 1.4%. The S&P 500 and Dow lost 0.6%. Small caps didn't recover much as the Russell 2000 shed 1.3%. Decliners on the Nasdaq outnumbered advancers by more than 3-to-1. The ratio was just over 2-to-1 on the NYSE.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) performed mostly in line with the Russell 2000, down about 1.1%, weighed down mostly by weakness in financials. Just over one-third of the latest IBD 50 is comprised of financial-related names.


![mp_7-5_013017](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP_7-5_013017.png)Volume rose from Friday's levels, resulting in a fresh distribution day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The count now stands at an elevated 7 for the Nasdaq and 5 for the S&P 500.


The price action of the CBOE Volatility Index, a fear index also known as the VIX, was noteworthy Monday. It spiked 12% to 11.88, its largest percentage gain since Nov. 3. Boring, dull price action in the VIX ever since the election led many to call the market complacent in recent weeks.


Some view the VIX as a contrarian indicator. In other words, the lower it goes, the greater the likelihood of a pullback. It's worthwhile noting that the VIX's 200-day moving average was above 14, topping a resistance level since early December.


The put-call volume ratio was 1.06 Monday, nearing a level that indicates excessive fear.


Another contrarian indicator, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers, has been in danger territory, above 55%, for nine weeks in a row now. According to Investors Intelligence, when the percentage of bullish newsletters is 55% or higher, it is a strong warning of a trading top; above 60% suggests it is time to start taking defensive measures. In the latest week, the bulls fell to 58.2% from an 18-month high of 60.6% the prior week.


These two contrarian indicators, plus the fact that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite are still showing a somewhat lofty distribution-day count give investors plenty of reason to be cautious.


Mining stocks and several retail-related groups held up well, while oil and gas stocks lagged.


Several discount retailers reversed higher, although there's not much leadership in the group. The stock showing the best relative strength at this point in the group is **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)). Shares added 2% to 30. Retailers might've been helped by news that personal spending rose 0.5% in December, in line with expectations, but up from November's 0.2% gain.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark crude oil for March delivery fell 1% to $52.63 a barrel.


Sellers were in **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) again after Friday's bearish reversal. Shares lost 2.5% to 823.83. While it's common for stocks to pull back to buy points after a breakout, there are healthy pullbacks and unhealthy ones. Gentle pullbacks in soft trade are much more desirable than bursts of institutional selling. Alphabet is an example of the latter.


Elsewhere, losses were contained in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) ahead of its earnings report Tuesday after the close. Shares eased 0.3% to 121.63. After three straight quarters of sales declines, growth is expected to pick back up as Wall Street gets a look at Apple's first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales.

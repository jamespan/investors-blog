The stock market rallied in higher volume Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq gaining 0.6%. The rally was spurred on by President Donald Trump's comments on [U.S.-China trade talks.](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-talks-trump-negotiates-dow-jones-deal-hopes/)




Trump tweeted, "Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House." Meanwhile, Vice Premier Liu He said the country is ready to "make serious exchanges with the U.S." The comments capped a wild day of conflicting reports on the progress of the trade talks that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fall more than 300 points overnight.


All three major stock indexes continue testing their 50-day moving averages, where there's been resistance.


The Dow Jones industrials closed with a gain of 0.6%, or 150 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite also ended the day with a 0.6% advance. Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 closed with a 0.4% rise. Volume rose across both main exchanges compared with Wednesday's trading. It was the first time in weeks that an index gain came in higher volume.

The back-and-forth action is a great reason to never tune out. The stock market could be just one headline away from a new confirmed uptrend — or a new correction.


IBD's stock market outlook remains "uptrend under pressure" amid the mixed market conditions. On a negative note, there haven't been many successful breakouts among top growth stocks. Conversely, downside pressure appears to have partially alleviated after the major stock indexes tested their 200-day lines last week.


Stock Market Remains Under Pressure
-----------------------------------


On Sept. 24, the market stumbled, shifting IBD's market outlook into "uptrend under pressure." Last week, the major stock indexes found much-needed support around their 200-day moving averages. Now, the major indexes are once again testing their 50-day resistance levels. If the indexes are able to regain those levels in strong fashion, then record highs could be imminent.


Yet the 200-day line could still be in play if U.S.-China trade talks fail to achieve meaningful results, or more signs emerge of an economic slowdown.


With a stock market still clearly under distribution (the S&P 500 has seven distribution days), investors should maintain a defensive mindset with an eye on keeping losses small. If a new uptrend turns out to be real, there will be plenty of time to make meaningful money. But trying to force profits in an indecisive market is clearly a risky venture.


IBD 50 Underperforms In Stock Market Rally
------------------------------------------


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied just 0.3% Thursday, underperforming the main indexes. The index of top growth stocks is climbing back toward the 200-day line after spending most of the past month below it. Among the day's winners were **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) and **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


SolarEdge is nearing an all-time high just five trading sessions after finding bullish support around its 50-day moving average. The solar energy stock moved up 3.3%.


Lululemon regained a 194.35 buy point in a flat base after a couple of weeks below that level. The relative strength line is nearing a new high amid the recent outperformance. Lululemon stock broke out on Sept. 6 when it jumped past the entry on strong earnings. On Thursday, the stock advanced 3.1% to close at 198.13. The retail leader is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock idea.



[Tuesday's pick](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-new-oriental-rare-buy-point-trade-war/) for [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/), **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), gained 1.6%. The top Chinese stock is approaching a 115.98 buy point in a rare ascending base. With a relative strength line holding near highs, the stock has done a tremendous job of shrugging off the stock market weakness amid the U.S.-China trade war. Look for a breakout in heavy volume above the entry to signify strong institutional demand.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), the Chinese leader [boasts a 98](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-new-orientl-eduandtech-ads-edu.aspx) out of a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) helps investors easily measure the quality of a stock's fundamental and technical metrics.


On the downside, **Qiwi** ([QIWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIWI)) and **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) were two of the day's losers, declining 3% and 3.2%, respectively. Russian payment processor Qiwi may be creating a new base after a big move from a 16.54 buy point.


Kirkland Lake Gold is testing its 50-day moving average line, as the top gold stock continues to consolidate after hitting an all-time high on Sept. 4 at 51.08 a share.


Top Stocks To Watch: Apple, Microsoft
-------------------------------------



The recent action emphasizes the importance of never tuning out the market. On Oct. 2, the Nasdaq tumbled 1.6% to its lowest level in over a month. Just six trading sessions later, the Nasdaq is looking to regain its 50-day line, a key resistance level. Keep a close eye on stocks that are holding up best during a volatile market; they tend to have [strong RS lines.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/)


Among top stocks to watch, [Dow Jones](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) leader **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is regaining steam after sputtering from its breakout. Shares broke out past the flat base's 221.47 buy point on Sept. 11, but quickly gave up that level amid weakness in the indexes. Now, the stock is nearly extended beyond the 5% buy range. The buy zone runs up to 232.54. Apple closed Thursday at 230.09, up 1.4%.


Apple's RS line is at its highest level since early November.



**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), is looking to regain a 141.78 buy point in a flat base after recapturing its 50-day line on Wednesday. Shares pared gains to about 0.6% Thursday and are just 2% away from the buy point. Microsoft's RS line is just off new highs.

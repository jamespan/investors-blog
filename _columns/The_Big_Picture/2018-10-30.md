What To Make Of Tuesday's Rally In Stock Indexes, And Its Role In A Possible Bottom
====================================================================================

Stock indexes closed more than 1.5% higher Tuesday as the market made its latest attempt to find an elusive bottom.




Indexes opened lower but soon started climbing. The advance stalled one hour into the session, and stocks spent the rest of the day trying to stay above water. A solid push in the final hour secured the day's win.


Such is the desultory and erratic nature of the market, which is trying to pick itself back up from [the worst Nasdaq correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/bears-stock-market-growth-stocks/) since an 18.7% rout in December 2015 to February 2016. This month, the Nasdaq has fallen as much as 14.9% from its Aug. 30 peak.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MP_103018-277x300.jpg)It takes at least a few days to know if the market has truly touched bottom. For now, Tuesday's solid gains in higher volume mark the first step in the market's rehabilitation.


Interestingly, the Nasdaq composite bounced near the 7000 level and the S&P 500 at 2600. Round numbers sometimes act as psychological guideposts. But the next important signal would be a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). For that to happen, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 must start by staying above Monday's lows.


Volume was barely lower on the Nasdaq, and early data showed higher NYSE volume. Advancers led decliners by about a 7-3 ratio on the NYSE and by better than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Indexes closed at session highs. All those factors are favorable for a continued rebound.


But we've been here before, with the market making a big gain that ignites hopes of a rally attempt, only to get knocked even lower. So patience is important. Don't fall into the temptation of bottom-fishing, or bottom-guessing. The market will give its signal. Even then, caution will be necessary. Follow-throughs may give false signals.


Small caps led Tuesday's advance. The Russell 2000 jumped 2%, and it was the second time in three days that the index surged around 2%. Technology, consumer, utility and energy stocks led the small-cap rally.


Semiconductors gave the tech sector a boost. The Philadelphia semiconductor index surged 4.2%. Gaming software, internet networking and data storage were other industry groups up more than 3% in the tech sector.


Transportation was another strong sector, with the Dow transports up 2.8%. The railroad industry group steamed ahead 3.6%, shipping 3.5% and airlines 2.8%.


Leading stocks participated in the advance, but not impressively. The IBD 50 rose 1.5%, basically on par with the 1.6% gains in the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The IBD 50 index, a proxy for high-quality growth stocks, sank more than 20% from its prior high, what would be typically regarded as a bear market for leaders.


The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.8%. Intel galloped 5.2%. **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) added 3% and is now extended from a 55.31 buy point. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) is following through on a breakout from a 100.31 buy point. **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) cemented a move above a 46.97 buy point.


The building sector was a surprising leader Tuesday, even as new questions about the housing market emerged.


The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national index rose 5.8% in August, but the gain on a year-over-year basis was below 6% for the first time in 12 months, said economist Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economics. On the plus side, the Conference Board reported that household confidence rose to its highest level in eighteen years.


IBD's cement & aggregates, manufactured homes & RVs, building products, and homebuilding were all in the top 25 of 197 industry groups. They all rank in the bottom half of IBD's industry table.


In the construction aggregates group, two companies rose after earnings reports. **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) soared 17.5% and **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) 10.5% in heavy trading. Both stocks rose from deep corrections. Eagle Materials missed expectations, while Vulcan's earnings came in above views.

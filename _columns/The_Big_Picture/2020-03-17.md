  Coronavirus Sell-Off Gets A Reprieve: What To Search For Next

As would befit a normal St. Patrick's Day celebration, U.S. stocks on Tuesday ended in the green. But as many IBD readers have discovered in recent weeks, one up day amid a [coronavirus-inspired stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) doth not make a durable new uptrend.




Megacap techs helped the cause somewhat as the Nasdaq composite paced a brisk rebound with a 6.2% advance. But actually many of the FAANG plays rose less than that. The S&P 500 rose 6%.


Small caps have tended to underperform since the start of 2018, but not this time. The Russell 2000 barreled nearly 6.7% higher.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 7.2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP031720-247x300.jpg)News that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is rushing a $850 billion economic stimulus package to Senate Republicans likely gave institutions another reason to hunt for bargains. It includes a package of $50 billion to aid the airline industry. And President Trump is reportedly mulling a plan to help American homeowners facing a loss in pay a chance to delay payments on mortgage loans.


Economic data was a mixed bag. U.S. retail sales in February fell 0.5%, [missing the Econoday forecast for a 0.2% rise](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). But industrial production grew in the same month vs. January by 0.6%, edging the consensus view of up 0.4%.


Tuesday's biggest performers, at the industry group level, ranged from chipmaking and semiconductor equipment firms to select retailing (think drug store chains, discount and variety, supermarkets and minimarts) to all sorts of utilities and telecoms. These industries all rallied 10% or more. (See the full list and daily price-weighted changes at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Another sign that institutional investors breathed a little easier today? Long-dated Treasuries sold off, sending yields sharply higher.


Coronavirus Stock Market Crash: Bonds Yield To Profit-Taking
------------------------------------------------------------


The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. government bond spiked 29 basis points to 1.02%.


That's the first time for the key long bond to return back above the 1% level since March 4 — a little more than a week after pounding losses in the equity markets on Feb. 24-25 triggered back-to-back changes in the IBD current outlook for stocks. On Feb. 24, that outlook sank to "uptrend under pressure." One day later, it deflated to "[market in correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/)," the best time to raise a lot of cash and avoid making new stock buys.


Now, celebrating St. Patrick's Day without having any Irish bars open across the country (or even in Ireland) just isn't the same. ([Go to the IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) to see how the team toasted the special occasion.) And a 6% advance would normally deserve a round of cheers. But that gain actually pales compared with the record-breaking 12.3% thumping that the Nasdaq took on Monday and similar drops by other key indexes.


So at this point, IBD readers should keep focused on a future [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/).


Volume rose on both main exchanges Tuesday. But here again, higher volume or lower volume wouldn't have mattered, really. What would? A future big gain from here that sees an increase in total exchange turnover from the previous day.


Build A Watchlist Now
---------------------


As you keep an eye on the day-to-day action in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, don't forget to construct a glowing watchlist of potential future leaders. They should generally show a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 90 or higher. A 95 rating or higher? Even better. Also, their [relative strength lines should be rising](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), not falling. And they should be making fine progress in building a [sterling chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), including the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and the [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/).


All of the companies noted in the "Leaders up in volume" section of the Market Pulse have this in common as well: They are trading well above their long-term 200-day moving averages. Or they rebounded back above their respective 200-day lines on Tuesday.


**Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), one of those elite companies in this new bear market and hustling to make an anti-viral drug to defeat coronavirus, is today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/regn-stock-jumps-speedy-coronavirus-treatment-plans/).

  Stocks Bounce But Can Market Find Enough Energy To Extend Gains?

Indexes bounced from Friday's tumble, although the stock market still needs to do more to convince the skeptics.




The S&P 500 rose 0.5%, exactly the amount of Friday's loss. After two weeks of uncertain action, the index is still holding above its 50-day moving average. That's an indication that the market, despite its foibles, is maintaining altitude.


The Nasdaq composite led with a gain of more than 0.7% but remained below its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq is standing farther off its all-time high than the S&P 500, but not by a lot (4% below its high vs. 1%, respectively). Weakness in software, solar, biotech and other technology and health care groups is hurting the Nasdaq more than the S&P 500.


This mixed picture is why IBD's market outlook got cut to "uptrend under pressure" on Sept. 24. Investors should be cautious with their exposure, [cutting losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) and avoiding margin.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP_093019-264x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%. Volume fell from Friday's pace on the Nasdaq but edged higher on the NYSE.


Small caps lagged. The Russell 2000 rose just 0.2%. Yet, the Russell 2000 is bouncing off the 200-day moving average. The index met resistance around 1600 all year and faces that hurdle if it continues to rebound.


Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, rose nearly 1% thanks to strength in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and a few other major components. Apple, an [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) member, climbed back above its 221.47 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The major indexes, including the Russell 2000, ended September with gains. Weakness in the second half of the month wasn't enough to offset gains in the first half of September. In a month when growth stocks were largely out of favor, the Nasdaq rose 0.5%, the S&P 500 1.7% and the Dow industrials 2%.


The IBD 50 rose 0.9%, outperforming the market. But the problem for leading stocks remains that they're [not rising much from breakouts](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-extends-dull-trading-breakouts-sputter/). There are some IBD 50 stocks approaching [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), including **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) and some financials that have rotated into leadership spots.


Distribution Rising In Stock Market
-----------------------------------


In a matter of two weeks, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 piled up a number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The current count of four on the Nasdaq and five on the S&P 500 is higher than normal. That's another reason to be cautious.


Today's stock market is dealing with multiple uncertainties on a number of fronts, making it difficult for growth stocks to make progress. Institutional money quickly moves to dividend stocks and safe havens at the first sign of trouble.


The U.S.-China trade war is still Wall Street's main problem, and it's an issue that can take surprising turns. Reports Friday said the U.S. is considering restricting U.S. portfolio investments in China, including delisting Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges.


But top U.S. officials later said Chinese delistings are not planned. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell was the latest to dismiss the reports](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/mcconnell-dismisses-idea-of-delisting-chinese-companies-in-the-us.html). Chinese stocks were generally higher Monday.


Meantime, the Fed seems set on one more interest-rate cut this year. But it's unclear what the Fed wants to do next. Board members are not in unison regarding future rate policy.


An impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is now afoot, increasing political uncertainty. It could become a distraction in Congress and threaten Trump's agenda. Geopolitical flare-ups are another issue, whether it's Iran or someplace else.


On the plus side, the American economy remains in good shape. But soft spots in manufacturing are one reason some Fed governors are more dovish.


Tuesday morning, the [PMI manufacturing index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) comes out with a fresh look at the sector. "Will the ISM manufacturing index return to neutral terrain in September after dropping to 3-½-year lows and into contraction territory in August?" asked a report from BMO Capital Markets Economic Research.

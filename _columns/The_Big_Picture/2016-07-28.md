title: Stocks Reverse To Gains; GDP Data Due Before Open

Stocks spent the morning mostly under the break-even line, but a late rally salvaged the day.


The Nasdaq outperformed with a 0.3% gain, while the S&P 500 added less than 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1%.


Volume fell across the board. The lower volume could've been tied to a market waiting for Friday's first estimate on second-quarter GDP. Analysts expect GDP to come in at 2.6%, but the range of estimates runs from 2.2% to 3.4%.


If GDP contains any surprises, upward or downward, it isn't clear how the market would react. Not too long ago, the market regarded strong data as bad. A market hooked on the economic heroin of quantitative easing and low interest rates didn't want to see that end.

After a head-fake up on Dec. 16, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, the Nasdaq corrected about 17%. The confidence the Fed showed in the economy by raising the rate was seen as bad for stocks.


But the last time the market posted a GDP number was June 28. The Street's consensus number was 1%, but GDP edged above the target with 1.1%. How did the market react to that small beat?


Over the next three days, the Nasdaq rose 2.1%, 1.9% and 1.3%. The S&P 500 advanced 1.8%, 1.7% and 1.4%.  The three-day spurt -- coinciding with the post-Brexit rebound -- also confirmed that the market was back in an uptrend. And that call, by IBD's follow-through-day mechanism, proved accurate.


Did this signal a shift toward normalcy (good news is good news), or did the market decide the small beat in GDP (bad news is good news) was insufficient to allow for higher rates?


Earnings season seems to suggest that good news is back to being good news. Consider the big players and how the market has reacted to companies topping their consensus estimates.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) beat the quarterly target by 3%, gapped up almost 7% Wednesday and then retook its 200-day line Thursday with a 1.3% pop.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) reported after Wednesday's close and topped the Street's earnings estimate by 18%. The stock rose 1.3% Thursday.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) reported after Thursday's close and beat the consensus earnings estimate by almost 5%. After hours, Alphabet rose almost 6%.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) also reported after Thursday's close and trounced analysts' consensus estimate by 60%. The stock was up 1.4% in extended trade.


Granted, some of the share-price gains are moderate compared with the size of the beats. But the important thing is that the market appears to be on the same page as quarterly results.


Friday's GDP could offer more clarity on the situation. If GDP hits the Street's 2.6% target, that will be the best since 2015's second quarter growth of 3.9%.


From a follow-the-money aspect, a big beat would not be as much of a surprise as a big miss. The broadest gauge of the money supply -- Divisia M4, including Treasuries -- has shown strong growth on a year-over-year basis from November through June. Gains have ranged from 3.8% to 5.9%, with the average growth at 4.6%.


Yet, as always, it's wise to let the market itself have the last word.

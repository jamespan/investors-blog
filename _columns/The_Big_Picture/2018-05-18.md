U.S. stock indexes wandered in different directions Friday, wrapping up an unexceptional week that had a couple of startling exceptions.




The first exception was the small cap S&P 600, which logged gains for a third week in a row, up 1.6%.


The S&P 600 gained 0.15% Friday, sharing a low-wattage spotlight with the Dow Jones industrial average, which was barely up. The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 lost 0.4% and 0.3% respectively.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq but edged lower on the NYSE.


The day's price and volume action slapped a distribution day on the Nasdaq.

Friday was an options expiration day, which tends to boost volume.


For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.7%. The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones slid 0.5%. All three major averages rose more than 2% in the prior week.


Strength In Right Space
-----------------------


Strength was evident to investors in the right space, which in at least one niche supplied the week's second startling exception.


The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) has delivered weekly gains of 1.9%, 3.7% and most recently 1.9%.


The FFTY exchange-traded fund reflects the IBD 50.


During the past three weeks, a half dozen IBD 50 stocks stormed higher.


They included **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), up 30%; **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), 27%; **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) and **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)), 25% each; **Ligand Pharmacuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)), 24%; and **Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)), 21%.


On the downside, **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) slid 16% and **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) fell 15%.

Few Quality Breakouts
---------------------


According to William O'Neil + Co. data, 15 stocks broke out Friday, but only three had a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


**Raymond James Financial** ([RJF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RJF)) cleared a sloppy consolidation temporarily but then fell. The stock has a 97 Composite Rating, putting it in the top 3% among all the stocks in IBD's database.


Thinly traded but highly rated **First Merchants** ([FRME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRME)) made a new high but then retreated. The Muncie, Ind., bank has a Composite Rating of 94.


Door and window maker **PGT Innovations** ([PGTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGTI)) broke above a 19.70 buy point in twice its usual trade. The CR is 91.


China Trade Hints
-----------------


News on the China-U. S. trade talks led to hints but nothing more. Rumors swirled that the Trump administration was near a trade deal.


Meanwhile, a House vote is expected Tuesday on changes to the Dodd-Frank law.

Stock Market Today: Fed Rate Hike Halts Nasdaq Rally As Bears Reject Bulls At 12,000
=====================================================================================

Ultimately, what did the sour end by the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) tell us? For the Federal Reserve, controlling inflation is Job No. 1.




At 2 p.m. ET, as widely expected, the Federal Reserve announced that it raised short-term interest rates by a quarter point, doing so for the second time this year. This pushed the [fed funds target rate to a range of 4.75%-5%](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-hikes-key-rate-signals-one-more-to-come-sp-500-rises/), the highest level since September 2007. It also marked the ninth rate increase since the central bank lifted the cost of money from nearly zero to a 0.25%-0.5% range on March 16, 2022.


Afterward, a squadron of reporters barraged Fed chief Jerome Powell with questions that ran the gamut.


They included concerns on how the collapse of two superregional bank operators, **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) and **Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)), could lead to tighter credit conditions for small businesses and consumers; the state of the overall financial system; the health of commercial real estate loans held by smaller banks; and whether future fiscal policy could help the cause in getting inflation down to the U.S. central bank's desired level of 2% in the long run.


"Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation," the Fed wrote in a statement following its two-day meeting. "The extent of these effects is uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks."


Stock Market Today: Still Correction Mode
-----------------------------------------


Given the fact that fed funds rate futures traders had still been holding out hope for signs that the Fed would consider cutting interest rates later this year in order to prevent an economic hard landing. But Powell's comments during the 45-minute press conference seemed to smash that idea into little pieces.


As of late Wednesday, the CME's FedWatch Tool showed a practically 50-50 chance that a third quarter-point rate hike will take place at the May 2-3 meeting. But on June 14, traders indicated a 14% probability that the Fed would then trim the cost of borrowing back down to a 4.5%-4.75% level. A sharp drop from a 46% probability on March 15.


The Nasdaq composite swung from an early gain that almost hit 1.3% to end Wednesday's heavily watched session off 1.6%. Not only was that a beefy decline, but it punctuated quite a wild intraday swing as indexes gyrated during Powell's comments. Wednesday's stock market reversal certainly disappointed. Sellers capitalized on the index's attempt to retake 12,000, perhaps a key psychological level.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP032223_2-270x300.jpg)Second, the loss took away a big slice of the Nasdaq's two-day, 2% rally. Plus, Wednesday's late-hour sell-off spoiled the chances for a seventh gain in eight sessions for the premier index of big growth companies.


The Nasdaq 100 fell a little less, but still closed down 1.4%. Perhaps the fact that this index is devoid of financial stocks made the difference in relative outperformance.


The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6% to 1.7%. Meanwhile, small banks led the smacking of small caps; the Russell 2000 slid 2.8%.


SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)), down 2.5% on Wednesday, ran into resistance at its flattened 200-day moving average.


The Bearish Underbelly
----------------------


Understandably, the stock market showed weak internals.


Early readings by **Charles Schwab**'s ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) Thinkorswim platform showed losers topping winners by a 5-2 ratio. On the NYSE, declining stocks beat gainers by nearly 3 to 1.


Clearly, as [IBD's Stocks On The Move table](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) illustrates, a greater number of stocks in general showed above-average turnover on the downside.


When more names in the stock market are falling than rising, it underscores difficult conditions for CAN SLIM-style stock pickers to make money. Wednesday's action can feel like position traders got the rug yanked out from underneath.


Hence, a heavy cash position remains good defense amid a market that has gyrated from strong early gains to virtually little progress to show for the year so far.

Beyond The Market: What To Do Now
---------------------------------


Does this mean it's time to throw in the towel? Absolutely not.


One thing has not changed: In the stock market, human emotions rule. Fear can quickly turn into greed. Put another way, institutional investors can change their thinking from market valuations as being excessive to offering good value.


How can one spot the early signs that the large players are putting capital to work, especially in exciting growth sectors? For one, keep looking for renewed strength among specific sectors.


A daily check of the industry group rankings and the 33 sector rankings, both accessed through [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), will help you.

New Issues To Watch
-------------------


Within [IBD's IPO Leaders screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), small cap **Xponential Fitness** ([XPOF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPOF)) has proved sticky.



The owner of popular fitness brands that cover Pilates, barre, cycling and other forms of exercise fell 1.4% on Wednesday. But that did not spoil an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rare-ascending-base-can-lead-to-powerful-gains/) in the works, according to MarketSmith's pattern recognition premium tool.


An ascending base features three controlled declines following a stout breakout. Notice on its daily chart how during each of these pullbacks, XPOF shares landed on its feet at the rising [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


The [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)? For now, it's 30.80, 10 cents above the peak before the third pullback. On Nov. 11, Xponential originally broke out past a structure that has the skeleton of a [nearly eight-month cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 21.41.


Xponential has yet to log a full year of profits. Yet net losses have shrunk in a big way, from -88 cents per share in 2018 to -7 cents in 2022. Wall Street sees the Irvine, Calif., firm earning 92 cents a share this year and $1.38 in 2024, up 50%.


The top line has grown 67%, 60%, 98%, 73%, 66%, 56% and 44% vs. year-ago levels in the past seven quarters. Trailing 12-month sales hit $245 million.


Meanwhile, on Wednesday, research firm Ipsos announced its monthly U.S. Consumer Confidence Index reached 52.6, the highest level this year. Meanwhile, global consumer confidence remains stable at 48.5, down just 0.2 point vs. February.


Ipsos also noted that 4 in 10 of those surveyed "are more comfortable making major and other household purchases compared to six months ago."


Watch This Key Stock Market Leadership List Too
-----------------------------------------------



Meanwhile, [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) continues to get stuffed with leadership-quality stocks chiefly in the tech and consumer spending-oriented areas of the stock market. They include travel giants [Airbnb](https://www.investors.com/research/airbnb-abnb-stock-buy-now/) ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) and **Booking** ([BNKG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNKG)), owner of the Priceline and Booking.com franchises. Both stocks have recently made nifty tests of buying support at their 10-week moving averages.


Booking has driven a 27% gain year to date for shareholders, well outpacing a 2.5% move up by the S&P 500.


Airbnb is testing a [deep cup-with-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/) at 121.50 amid a [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/google-stock-breakout-from-bottoming-base-in-2009-yielded-perfect-entry/). The stock peaked in February 2021 at 219.

  Stocks Close On A Whimper But These Stocks Seem Ready To Climb

The stock market limped into the close Friday, ending at session lows and looking a bit tired after a few weeks of gains.




The Nasdaq composite was up 1% early but closed 0.4% lower as selling accelerated in the final hour of trading. The S&P 500 reduced a 0.9% gain to a minimal 0.01%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq. But trading rose on the NYSE. That means the S&P 500's fading action resulted in a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/). That's a type of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), reflecting a lack of fortitude among institutional investors.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up with a 0.4% increase. **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), the highest priced stock in the price-weighted Dow, climbed 1.6%. UBS raised its price target on the managed-care firm to 330 from 319. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) climbed 2.3% and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), which [won approval in the EU to return its 737 Max jetliner to service](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-return-to-service-before-years-end-europe-boeing-stock/) by year end, rose 1.9%.

Market signals were mixed this past week, but nothing that would alter the market's confirmed uptrend. The Nasdaq made a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) Monday, which strengthened the new market uptrend. But the S&P 500 suffered distribution during the week. Indexes closed near the week's lows.


Main indexes nonetheless rose for a third straight week, or four weeks in the case of the Nasdaq. A pause at this point may be natural.


IBD 50 Packed With Bases
------------------------


The IBD 50 lost 0.7% Friday and eased 0.1% for the week. Overall, this index of growth companies is one of the best pieces of evidence that the stock market is on firm legs. More than 20 stocks in the IBD 50, [including many software leaders](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/software-stocks-near-buy-points-covid-19-boosts-business/), are [forming fresh bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). With that, there's ample opportunities for investors seeking [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Most breakouts are working. But **Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)) shows a chart in disarray, and **SciPlay**'s ([SCPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCPL)) breakout failed. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) reversed lower Friday and can't seem to get its breakout going. In fact, a rally in homebuilding stocks has stalled.


A strong September retail sales report showed U.S. consumers are busy spending, despite a lack of new stimulus. Sales breezed past forecasts with a 1.9% increase from August.


"The firm activity even late in the quarter pretty much runs precisely counter to what many were expecting, given the drying up of extra unemployment benefits," Douglas Porter, chief economist of BMO Capital Markets Economic Research, said in a report. "But, as we opined last week, households overall can deal with a (temporary) lull in income support until after the election, thanks to the massive savings buffer built up earlier this year."


Curiously, the retail sector lagged the market. SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) fell 1%. Department stores led with about a 4% increase and specialty retail chains climbed more than 1%. But the 16 other IBD retail industry groups were lackluster. Still, retail so far is one of the best performing sectors, with the Retail SPDR exchange traded fund up 9% in October.

Stock Market Takes Another Hit As 10-Year Yield Approaches 4%; GlobalFoundries Triggers Sell Signal
====================================================================================================

The stock market took a harsh step back Tuesday as rising interest rates and an earnings sell-off for **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) weighed on sentiment.




Investors looked past an earnings beat and raised dividend from Home Depot, focusing instead on a [revenue miss and soft outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/home-depot-earnings-hd-stock-slides-wage-costs-hit-outlook/). For its current fiscal year, Home Depot forecast flat revenue vs. the FactSet consensus of $158 billion, up 0.4%. The company also said full-year earnings would fall in the "mid-single digits" vs. expectations for flat EPS.


Meantime, after hitting a low of around 3.33% on Feb. 2, the 10-year Treasury yield rallied another 13 basis points to 3.96%. Two more quarter-point hikes in March in May have pretty much been baked into the stock market already. But the chances for another quarter-point hike in June have risen to more than 70%.


Besides a busy week of earnings reports in the retail and oil-and-gas sectors, some key economic reports also loom large. The minutes from the Feb. 1 Federal Reserve meeting will be out Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, and the second estimate to Q4 gross domestic product will be released Thursday before the open.

The stock market on Friday will get another key reading on inflation with the release of the Personal Income & Spending report for January. Inside the data, the Fed will be watching its preferred inflation gauge — the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — for more signs of cooling inflation.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MP022123-240x300.jpg)After making a stand at its 21-day exponential moving average Friday, the Nasdaq composite fell sharply below the support level Tuesday. The Nasdaq closed lower by 2.5% and now looks poised for a test of its 200-day moving average. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, giving the index a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The weak action prompted a change in outlook in the accompanying Market Pulse to "uptrend under pressure." Headed into Tuesday, exposure between 60% to 80% was fine. But after Tuesday's selling, lowering exposure to 40% to 60% is appropriate. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) portfolio lowered market exposure to around 50% Tuesday, from more than 80%.


Now's the time to assess your current holdings and start raising cash by cutting your laggards loose. When it comes to profitable positions, consider trimming your winners or taking profits outright, depending on how the stock is acting at key support levels.


In the [semiconductor sector](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news), **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) lagged badly in the Nasdaq 100. A breakout for GFS looked good last week when the stock topped a 69.40 entry. A strong earnings report was the catalyst, but GFS stock extended its losing streak to four sessions Tuesday and flashed a sell signal.


INTC stock also took a hit after DigiTimes Asia reported that the company is delaying orders for 3-nanometer chips from **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) until the fourth quarter of this year.



IBD's three chip-related industry groups ended with losses of at least 3%.


In other stock market news, retail-related industry groups were some of the hardest hit ahead of a busy week of retail earnings reports. Results from **TJX Companies** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) are due early Wednesday. Coffee drive-thru chain operator **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) announces Wednesday after the close.


S&P 500 Tests 4000
------------------


After rallying off lows and closing just above its 21-day line Friday, the S&P 500 slumped 2%, ending just below the 4000 level. NYSE volume rose from Friday, giving the index its fourth distribution day.


Declining stocks swamped advancers on the NYSE by more than 7-to-1. On the Nasdaq, losers beat winners by just over 4-to-1.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average knifed through its 50-day moving average, falling 2.1%. Home Depot and Intel lagged badly, but **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) closed with losses of around 3%.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), which had been holding support at the 21-day line, slid below the line, falling nearly 3%. It was the Russell 2000's worst day since Dec. 5, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


The selling found its way into some stocks that had been holding up well.


Sellers knocked **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) below its 21-day exponential moving average ahead of Thursday's earnings report. Results are due after the close. The stock is back below its 88.82 buy point, causing a [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/amazon-stock-amzn-triggered-key-profit-taking-rule-before-flashing-sell-signals/).


**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), meanwhile, slumped below its converged 10- and 21-day lines, falling nearly 10%. Those who bought CROX when it first broke out in early November got a signal to take at least partial profits Tuesday with a break of the 21-day line.



There weren't too many bright spots in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), but software firm **Box** ([BOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOX)) was one. The stock reversed higher and closed above its 21-day line after testing a prior 32.10 entry. Earnings are due next week.

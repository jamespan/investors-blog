Dow, S&P 500 Pierce 200-Day Lines As Bears Rule Roost Again
============================================================

The bulls were hoping for a nice bounce for the stock market today, especially after the put/call ratio hit an extreme level Wednesday at 1.15. But stock market bulls were left disappointed Thursday as major stock indexes extended losses. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in higher than Wednesday's levels.




The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fared the worst in the stock market today, falling just over 2%. After the Nasdaq gave up support at its 200-day line Wednesday, the Dow and S&P 500 did the same Thursday. The Nasdaq composite gave back 1.25% after rising 1% intraday. The Russell 2000 fell 1.9% after crashing below its 200-day line with conviction Wednesday.


From an intraday high of 8,133 to an intraday low of 7,274 set Thursday, the Nasdaq corrected 10.6% off its high. That's a little less than the pullbacks seen in early February and in March. The Nasdaq is now 9% off its recent high; the S&P 500 is 7% off its high and the Dow is 6% off its high.


Fearful Market
--------------


Meanwhile, fear gauges in the stock market point toward the possibility of a near-term bounce. The put/call ratio hit 1.20 Thursday. That's considered an extremely high level, and high readings like this have come ahead of market rallies in the past. Another fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), jumped nearly 9% after soaring 44% Wednesday. The thinking is that when investors are overly fearful, it's the time to be bullish — and vice versa.

With the market now in a correction, it doesn't make sense to buy low and sell high. That's tough to do when institutional investors are liquidating positions. It does, however, make sense to monitor stocks holding up well. When the stock market does start to rally again, the strongest stocks will have the best chance of being new market leaders — not the weakest ones.


It's also important to remember that when the stock market starts to rally again, it could be a brand-new crop of stocks leading the charge. That means staying married to software stocks, a leading sector in the market for many months now, might not be the best strategy.

Stock Market Today: Gainers
---------------------------


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) and **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) ended with decent gains Thursday. They're not actionable yet, but ServiceNow is probing support at the 200-day moving average, while Match Group and CF Industries are battling for support near their 50-day lines.


The 10-year Treasury yield eased 2 basis points to around 3.14% after [consumer prices](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) came in weaker than expected. Meanwhile, U.S. crude futures slumped another 3% to $70.97 a barrel after dropping 2.4% Wednesday. Early Thursday, the [Energy Information Administration](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-stocks-fall-opec-economic-growth-warning-eia-data/) reported a third straight weekly rise in oil supplies. The weakness in oil prices comes after crude hit a four-year high earlier this month.


Top-rated oil and gas producers extended losses, but a couple of names in the sector continues to hold up relatively well. **Energen** ([EGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGN)) fell nearly 4% in light volume, but it's still holding above its 50-day moving average and close to its last breakout area. **Centennial Resource Development** ([CDEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDEV)) is also above its 50-day line as it trades just below a 21.09 buy point.

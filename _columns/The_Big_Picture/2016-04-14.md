Stocks moved essentially sideways Thursday, keeping to a tight range as volume faded.


The Nasdaq was fractionally down, while the S&P 500 was fractionally up. The Dow Jones industrial average tacked on 0.1%.


![MP041416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP041416-168x300.jpg)The IBD 50, a list comprised of stocks with the strongest fundamentals and technical traits, was down 0.4%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


Although action in the indexes had a do-nothing quality, a beaten down group of stocks raised some interesting issues.


The 3D printing stocks, which are found in IBD's metals handling and automation industry group, made big moves in strong volume after receiving an upgrade from Bank of America analysts.


**Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)) sprang 6% in volume about 175% above average. Rival **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) jumped 10% in volume 265% above average. **ExOne** ([XONE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XONE)), a thinly traded 2013 initial public offering, popped nearly 8% in volume about 115% above its usual pace. **Voxeljet** ([VJET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VJET)), another thinly traded stock, rose 9% in volume about 350% above average.


The 3D stocks peaked in early 2014, and since then the story has been mostly glum.


However, in IBD's Jan. 4 new-year outlook issue, "[6 Factors That Could Shape Stocks In 2016](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-big-picture/)," 3D was one of the six factors:


"Manufacturing with 3D: This was supposed to be the next big thing. But weak capital spending smashed 3D stocks in 2013-15. The Street, though, expects Stratasys and 3D Systems to grow earnings 300% and 115% respectively in 2016. Worst case: Manufacturing lags, and the market continues to ignore the 3D stocks. Best case: The trend finds traction."


Despite Thursday's action, the picture remains cloudy for 3D stocks and manufacturing. Those shares remain in deep slumps.


The Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing report for March reported that manufacturing expanded for the first time in six months.


However, one month does not make a trend, and the charts of these stocks remain beaten up. IBD-style investors should wait until the fundamentals improve and the charts provide a legitimate entry.


On Friday, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for April will be released. The Street expects a reading of 3.0, but the range varies from a negative 0.5 to a positive 10. Granted, the gauge is regional, but it still might provide another clue on the manufacturing picture.


In economic news Thursday, first-time jobless claims dropped to 253,000 vs. expectations for 267,000. The reading was the lowest since 1973.

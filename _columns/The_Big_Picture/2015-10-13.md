Stocks stumbled Tuesday in a session that suggested the market is ready to take a break from its feverish advance. The main indexes turned lower just as they reached levels where sellers have emerged in the past.

  

The Nasdaq fell 0.9% and closed right back below its 50-day moving average. That's the same price-trend indicator where the composite hit its Sept. 17 peak.

  

The S&P 500 lost 0.7% after hitting a high at 2022.34. Curiously, that was about the same level where the index topped in September.

  

Indeed, a pullback would not come as a surprise at this point, given the market's rapid ascent the past two weeks. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq surged about 8% from their Sept. 29 lows.

  

At the least, the market rally is moderating. Besides exhaustion setting in, the market faces the usual risk that comes with each earnings season.

  

Quarterly reports are starting to ramp up, so apprehension should be expected as traders brace for the possibility of bad surprises.

  

Volume was well below average but still higher than Monday's sleepy totals. The index losses and higher volume added up to a new distribution day.

  

It was only the second time since the Oct. 2 follow-through rally confirmation that institutional investors sold heavily.

  

The IBD 50 slid 1.2%, comparable to the 1.4% drop in the small-cap Russell 2000.

  

A few of the IBD 50 components suffered significant losses that weighed on the index. 

  

**Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) skidded nearly 6% in heavy trading, its 8% gain from a 75.93 buy point nearly depleted.**Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) dropped 5% as resistance around 80 persisted. 

  

**LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) erased 4%, but the highflying homebuilder has given back little of a 65% run from its Aug. 5 breakout.

  

While a market pullback might be normal, it could complicate the picture for the leading stocks that have broken out over the past couple of weeks.

  

Most of those breakouts have modest gains from their buy points, so even a moderate slump in the market could leave shareholders with losses. If the market were to give back, say, half its October gains, those leaders could fall enough to trigger sell signals.

  

Take for instance **Ultimate Software Group** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)). The workforce-management software company broke out Oct. 6 and quickly stalled. It closed Tuesday nearly 2% below the 189.31 buy point. A drop of about 13 points would leave it in a sell situation.

  

Transportation stocks lagged the most, as airline, trucking, shipping and others in the sector slid.

  

Airline stocks descended after analyst downgrades.

  

JPMorgan cut **JetBlue** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)) to neutral from overweight. Late Monday, the airline reported a 13.3% rise in passenger traffic in September and load factor (percentage of seats sold) of 81.1%, an increase of 0.2 points from a year ago.

  

Evercore ISI downgraded both **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) and **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) to hold. 

  

**Ryder System** ([R](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=R))plummeted 9% to a 20-month low after the truck-rental company cut its full-year profit forecast.

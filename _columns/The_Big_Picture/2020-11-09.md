The stock market faded but still closed higher Monday on news that a coronavirus vaccine is proving to be effective. But as the pandemic hit a potential turning point, a great rotation in U.S. stocks could be just starting.




**Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) announced that [its Covid-19 vaccine was effective in more than 90% of cases](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-succeeds-phase-3-test-pfizer-stock-rockets/) during a late-stage trial. The breakthrough opens the door to an approved vaccine perhaps by year-end. Pfizer shares broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) but trimmed gains. **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)), which is partnering with Pfizer on the vaccine, surged nearly 14% and broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Global stocks rallied, though U.S. stocks ended mixed. All key Wall Street indexes made new highs early, but then faded.


The S&P 500 jumped as much as 3.9% before closing only 1.2% higher. Transportation and energy sectors led as the vaccine news brought hope of greater mobility. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) shot up more than 14% and traded above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since August.


![MP110920](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP110920-217x300.jpg)IBD's airline industry group soared 17% to the highest level since June. [Hotel and other travel stocks also rallied](https://www.investors.com/news/airlines-stocks-boeing-stock-soar-positive-coronavirus-vaccine-news/). **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) gapped above the 1,866.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) in big volume.


That double bottom formed next to a [large cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/), another [bullish chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average — which kicked out Pfizer in August — gapped up to a gain of 3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 closed 3.7% higher after backing off from new all-time highs.


But the Nasdaq composite reversed lower, closing 1.5% lower after it erased a 1.8% early jump. Ironically, the Nasdaq saw its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) of the market uptrend that began with last week's market [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


[An outside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-an-outside-day-in-stock-charts/) and resistance around the 12,000 level were other blemishes on the Nasdaq's chart.


Key Trend To Watch In U.S. Stocks
---------------------------------


The dichotomy in U.S. stocks was stark and largely the result of the coronavirus news. The whole Covid-19 trade that made work-from-home and social distancing stocks the leaders suddenly went out of favor. Surely, this new development deserves close watch.


**Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), a company almost synonymous with coronavirus, [plunged 17.4%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zoom-video-stock-plunges-vaccine-news-pfizer/) and slid below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). **Logitech** ([LOGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGI)), which saw a surge in sales of video cameras and other PC accessories, broke below its 50-day line also.



**Teladoc Health** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)), the platform for doctor visits via video, closed below the 200-day moving average.


Monday's weakest industry groups were predominantly lockdown plays: Online retail, streaming video, video game software, airfreight, home furnishings and consumer electronics fell more than 3% each.


Direxion Work From Home ETF ([WFH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFH)) dropped 3% but remained in a sideways trend.


The move away from social distancing stocks certainly did not favor the IBD 50. The index — heavy with pandemic favorites — plunged 5.5% Monday. Ten of the 50 stocks slid more than 10%.


Election Clarity Helps Market
-----------------------------


Over the weekend, news organizations declared Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election. The news helped clear up some election uncertainty, although President Donald Trump is challenging some tight races in court.


As far as the U.S. stock market was concerned, the election was over on Wednesday. That's when the [S&P 500 made a follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/) that caused IBD to raise its market outlook to "confirmed uptrend." Investors now have a [clearer picture of political risk](https://www.investors.com/news/election-results-2020-best-stocks-to-buy-biden-trump-race/), although the final Senate races won't be known until runoff elections in January.


The main market indexes are the ultimate judge of market direction, and they've signaled a new uptrend. Monday's trading saw a lot of institutional money move off the table, perhaps in a "sell the news" move. So far, investors should continue to raise exposure to stocks, but they should study the software and other leaders that were roiled Monday.

A daunting headline in the technology sector didn't stop the Nasdaq and S&P 500 from turning in solid performances Monday.

  

The Nasdaq jumped nearly 1.4% on the fourth day of its rally attempt. Normally, that would be a strong enough gain to qualify as a follow-through day, but NYSE and Nasdaq volumes were well below Friday's levels. Volume was unusually high Friday due to options expiration.

  

The S&P 500 added 0.9% while the Dow Jones industrial average turned a 0.7% intraday loss into a 0.1% gain by the close. The blue-chip index was weighed down by weak results from **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)). Shares slumped 7% in heavy volume.

  

That much of the tech sector shrugged off IBM's weak quarter shouldn't come as a big surprise. IBM has been a laggard for some time now — in a downtrend since March 2013 — as the company tries to transition into new markets.

  

The Dow's performance was impressive, considering that the blue-chip average is a price-weighted index. IBM is the third highest-weighted stock behind **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)).

  

Advancing stocks topped decliners on the NYSE by more than 3-to-1. On the Nasdaq, winners beat losers by more than 2-to-1. The IBD 50 rose 1.2%, its third straight gain of more than 1%.

  

Major averages are making a case that they're ready to start a new uptrend, but it's not a convincing case yet, especially with the S&P 500 still below its 200-day moving average. The Nasdaq closed just above its 200-day line Monday after six straight closes below it.

  

It could take a while longer before clear new leadership emerges. Top-rated chip companies like **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) and **Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) recently found support near their 200-day moving averages, but it'll take more time for new buy points to emerge.

  

While many leading growth stocks have come under stiff pressure in recent weeks, several others have held up relatively well.

  

**Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) outperformed Monday, rising 5%. It's near the top of a seven-week consolidation.

  

Top-rated biotech **Enanta Pharmaceuticals** ([ENTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTA)), meanwhile, cleared a buy point from a 17-week consolidation, rising 7% in strong trading. Along with its partner **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)), Enanta has fast become a formidable player in the hepatitis C market. It's more than tripled in price since its March 2013 [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) at 14 a share.

  

Earnings movers in the after-hours session included **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), up 10%; **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), up 1%; and **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), down 4%.

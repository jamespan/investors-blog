U.S. stock indexes stepped back Thursday, ending a win streak at four sessions for the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and the small-cap S&P 600.




The Nasdaq suffered a 0.7% dent, while the S&P 500 got by with a 0.1% scrape. The S&P 600 fell 0.3%.


Nasdaq volume rose solidly, slapping the composite with a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). The S&P 500's loss was too small to meet the definition of distribution.


Distribution involves a loss of at least 0.2% in rising volume, which is a sign of institutional selling.


Bulls would've preferred to see the decline come in soft volume.

3 Items To Consider
-------------------


Recent stock-market sessions have generally been positive. Three items emerged in the past day or two and they could be worth an investor's attention.


No. 1: News has been a market shaper, but the news Thursday didn't appear to have much effect on the stock market.


President Trump reached an agreement with Chinese tech giant ZTE. Sanctions will be eased on the company. As part of the deal, ZTE will pay a $1 billion fine and submit itself to a U.S. compliance team.


Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the deal as a bad outcome for U.S. national security. But some market watchers say Trump is using ZTE as leverage in trade negotiations.


No. 2: Americans remain optimistic and that could help the stock market. The IBD-TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to from 53.6 in May to 53.9 in June, staying positive for the 21st consecutive month.

CLOSE




No. 3: New highs have easily outscored new lows in recent weeks. The bank sector has produced most of the new highs since mid-May, though the tilt has been toward smaller bank stocks.


For example, on Wednesday the bank sector accounted for 69 new highs. Of the 69, small caps delivered 43 and micro caps 10. Midcaps accounted for 14 stocks, large caps one and IPOs one.


A Closer Look
-------------


Before an investor dismisses the tally as too small to bother with, a closer look is in order.


The tally included midcap **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), which has made an occasional appearance in IBD's most stringent screen, Sector Leaders.



**PacWest Bancorp** ([PACW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PACW)) hit a new high Wednesday and Thursday as it cleared a first stage base.


Large cap **East West Bancorp** ([EWBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWBC)) also scored new highs in the past two sessions.


The point is that not every bank scoring new highs is thinly traded. There are opportunities for those who are willing to dig.


Meanwhile, breakouts Thursday included fast-food chain **Sonic** ([SONC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SONC)), up 16% in heavy volume after its earnings report; 2017 initial public offering **ShotSpotter** ([SSTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSTI)), up 12% in fast trade; and cloud security firm and March 2018 initial public offering **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), up 23% also after beating profit views.


Growth stocks had a hard time making progress Thursday. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.4% — its biggest daily loss in six weeks. The exchange-traded fund, which reflects the IBD 50, lost 2.4% on April 24 just before beginning a 12% advance.

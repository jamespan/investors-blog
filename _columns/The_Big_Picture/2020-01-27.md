The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 suffered their largest losses of the new year Monday, the latest sign that a pullback is unfolding in the stock market, even if it wasn't so surprising.




Indexes came further away from last week's record highs, part of a global sell-off. Investors backed further away from stocks with every new report that the coronavirus is spreading and causing deaths. Wall Street started selling off Friday with reports of a second U.S. coronavirus case. By Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had identified five cases.

U.S. indexes gapped down to the largest losses in months. The Nasdaq slid 1.9% after being down 2.4%, and the S&P 500 shed 1.6%. It was the largest single-day drop on the Nasdaq since Aug. 23, and the S&P 500's largest since Oct. 8, when it also fell 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 1.6% Monday.


Volume fell less than 2% on the Nasdaq vs. Friday's session but rose on the NYSE. That gave the S&P 500 another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), its fourth in the past several weeks.


A global comparison showed U.S. indexes fared better than other major stock markets.


In Asia, Japan's Nikkei gapped down to a loss of more than 2%. (Chinese exchanges were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.) London's FTSE 100 index tumbled 2.3%, the German DAX lost 2.7% and the Paris CAC 40 2.7%. Brazil's Bovespa tumbled 2.9%. Emerging markets also got hit. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ([EEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEM)) gapped below its 50-day moving average, touching its lowest level in nearly two months.


Commodities and bonds also reflected a fearful market. The price of U.S. crude fell nearly 3% to $52.72 a barrel, dropping to the lowest price since Oct. 10.


Gold prices rose to a multiyear high. Copper prices lost more than 3%. Bond yields fell as investors sought the safety of Treasuries. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell 8 basis points to 1.61%, a 3-1/2-month low.


Travel, Movie Stocks Drop
-------------------------


Travel booking, airlines, movie and other industries ranked low in Monday's table. All are taking a hit from the virus scare as the public avoids travel and crowded areas.


The CBOE Market Volatility index, or VIX, shot up to [levels of excessive fear](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility). That's ultimately a good sign, because similar spikes in the VIX often have signaled market lows. If the market will rebound, watch for elevated fear. The put-call volume ratio topped 1.0 but would need to rise more to trigger a bottoming signal.  




The previous big scare for the stock market was the Iran crisis of earlier this month, when the U.S. killed a top Iranian commander and Iran retaliated with a missile strike. Indexes hardly broke stride. This time, the selling is much more severe.


Harsh as it may be, the market's two-day decline is not a surprise. Indexes had been rising to record highs, extending the solid fourth quarter on Wall Street. The Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 had already extended themselves above an upper price channel line. That was a warning that the stock market was overheating. The larger question is, how much can the market drop?


The Nasdaq still is holding above a trend line touching the lows of the four-month advance. But the S&P 500 closed below a similar line Monday.


There were a few pockets of strength, at least on a relative basis. Utilities Select Sector SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) eased only 0.3%. Small caps fared better than larger stocks. The Russell 2000 fell 1.1%.


Housing-related stocks rose after [December new home sales](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) fell 0.4% month over month, but jumped 10.3% from a year ago. Economist Joel Naroff saw a mixed report. December sales in the West doubled from a year ago. "That makes no sense," he noted. "So, you have to conclude that the large increase in annual sales was somewhat overstated."


The IBD 50 was no refuge, sliding 2% for its worst day of 2020 so far. A handful of real estate stocks (most of them dividend-heavy REITs) escaped the selling.

Nasdaq Retakes The 50-Day Line; 3 Bearish Factors In Stock Market Today Are Crumbling
======================================================================================

A confluence of economy-boosting headlines set the stage for sunny gains in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). And it came on the heels of yet another piece of highly anticipated news from the biggest central bank on the globe.




With the stock market today in a confirmed uptrend, it remains the best time to quickly hone a watchlist of top stocks, closely examine the quality of bases, and to buy shares in stocks breaking out in rising turnover.


The Nasdaq composite — enjoying robust gains in the solar, electronics, chip, software and telecom fields of the market — led the way up, rising 1.4%. It climbed back above the 50-day moving average with gusto, doing so for the first time since May 16. Although the composite gave up a chunk of its early 2% advance, the premier index for growth stocks still ended in the upper half of the day's range.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP061819-224x300.jpg)The tech-rich Nasdaq's gain outdistanced rises of 1.1% for the Russell 2000 and 1% for the S&P 500. Indexes climbed above a sideways trend that lasted about a week.


The IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) and silver futures both rose 1.1%. Crude oil rose 4.1%. And the Philadelphia semiconductor index added 4.3%.


Volume grew on both major exchanges. That's bullish. Why? It clearly signals that equity trading desks across the world weren't snoozing.


Stock Market Today: Good News Drives Buyers
-------------------------------------------


On one side of the Atlantic, you had Europe's chief banker, Mario Draghi, affirm a dovish stance on the cost of money in the EU. Indeed, the ECB chief has not diverged from his "do whatever it takes" stance to support the European economy.


And on this side of the pond, you had President Donald Trump, no doubt mindful of the economic future of America, tweet that he had a "very good" phone chat with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on the topic of trade. Trump said he is planning an extended meeting with the China leader to hammer out a way to meet in the middle on imports, intellectual-property rights and other key business issues. The two will meet at the G-20 summit next week in Tokyo.


A Meaningful Amount Of GDP At Stake
-----------------------------------


Jason Pride, chief investment officer in charge of private wealth portfolios at the $40 billion buy-side wealth management firm Glenmede, neatly sums up the stakes of both countries amid an unresolved trade war. "Were Trump to impose 25% tariffs on all Chinese goods, as he has threatened in the past, Glenmede estimates this could represent 0.4% of U.S. GDP," he wrote.


Meanwhile, both Pride and numerous observers on Wall Street see the Federal Reserve taking a proactive stance toward monetary policy in light of multiple signs that the U.S.-China tariff spat is already hampering growth in both nations.


The likelihood that the Fed will cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in nearly 10 years edged up to a 24.2% probability, according to data from CME Group. That's not a high chance, but up from 20% last week. You should expect a quarter-point shave in the fed funds rate at the end of the Fed's two-day meeting on July 31. The probability has jacked up to 94.1%, and some bond traders see a half-point cut to a target range of 1.75%-2%.


Fear and uncertainty may keep some IBD readers on the sidelines, even after some decent gains have arisen after the [Nasdaq follow-through on June 7](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-posts-big-gains-ushers-in-positive-signal/). Even the pros are twiddling their thumbs. Since June 14, only [48% of all pundits polled by Investors Intelligence showed a bullish view toward stocks](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears). But at this moment, IBD sees at least three bearish factors dissipating.


Vanishing Bearish Factor No. 1: Distribution Days Are Far And Distant
---------------------------------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq's 0.5% decline on June 14 remains the worst sell-off since the market's near-term bottom.


Volume fell that day vs. the prior session. Translation: Mutual funds, big quantitative trading firms, banks, insurers and other institutions were reluctant to sell.


The S&P 500, like the Nasdaq, has yet to log a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) since the June 7 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).


Weakening Bearish Factor No. 2: Technical Picture Gets Rosier
-------------------------------------------------------------


Rising stocks hammered falling ones by more than a 2-1 margin on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. More than 500 stocks and ETFs hit new highs. (See the sector-divided list each day at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/)).


The S&P SmallCap 600, up 1.3% on Tuesday, is another 0.9% gain away from crossing back above its 50-day line.


Dwindling Bearish Factor No. 3: The Stock-Picking Picture Is Improving
----------------------------------------------------------------------



Look at the sharp gains by video streaming innovator **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), [Leaderboard member](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), and frequent [Sector Leaders stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)). They prove that the art of savvy stock picking isn't dead yet.


They also show that you have to be willing to buy the stock that not everybody knows.

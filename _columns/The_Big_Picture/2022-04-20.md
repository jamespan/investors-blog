Just as the major indexes looked to be fighting back, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) earnings gave its own stock a real body blow. And for a while, it caused a stock market drawdown on Wednesday.




Nevertheless, important signs of strength emerged.


Consider the fact only the Nasdaq ended the day decisively in negative territory. Most S&P 500 [sectors closed higher](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/), with communication services and consumer discretionary the only major losers. Tech also suffered a slight loss.


Meanwhile, a key psychological gauge showed that bearish sentiment has overcome bullishness, at least for now. This is often a contrarian indicator that often signals a rally, but caution is advised due to the current uncertain state of the market.


Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Leads As Nasdaq Stumbles
------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP042022--200x300.jpg)Sellers slapped the Nasdaq for the third time in four sessions, and the composite index fell 1.2%. Mildly higher volume meant this counts as another distribution day for this index. In addition, an attempt to reclaim its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) has failed for now. Given **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) [posted an after-hours earnings beat](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-tesla-jumps-on-accelerating-earnings-growth-after-netflix-slams-nasdaq/), it could launch another assault on the key level tomorrow.


The S&P 500 slipped by a hair, closing less than 0.1% lower. This was not enough to trigger another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days). It remains above its 50-day line for now.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best out of the major indexes as it closed 0.7% higher. It is trading above its major moving averages, while the relative strength line is showing slight overperformance.


Small caps also closed higher, the Russell 2000 rising 0.4%. Growth stocks also managed to end with slender gains. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) inched up 0.2%.


There was some respite for stocks from the bond market. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond slipped 8 basis points to 2.83%. They remain higher than where they sat last week however.


Bitten By the FANG: Netflix Hurts Stock Market
----------------------------------------------


Netflix had been a major stock market winner amid Covid lockdowns but its first decline in subscriber numbers in a decade led to a brutal beatdown.



It gapped down and ended the day with an excruciating loss of 35%. That led to Netflix's lowest close since Jan. 19, 2018, when it ended the day at 220.46.


It also suffered its biggest decline percentagewise since Oct. 15, 2004, when it fell 40.91%.


The reverberations were felt throughout the stock market. It was the major reason the Nasdaq ended the day in negative territory.


NFLX is also a big holding in the Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF ([FCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCOM)), which closed down 4%.


In addition, the MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN ([FNGU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNGU)) was the worst performing ETF of the day as it fell more than 18%.



It has been a mixed 12 months for the so-called FANG stocks. Netflix is now down 56% while Facebook parent **Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has given up 34%.


However **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) remains up 25% while Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is up 12%. It certainly seems the acronym is dead in the water, at least for now.


Movie Group Ails As Hospitals Offer Comfort
-------------------------------------------


It is always important for investors to keep track of the best and worst performing industry groups. Construction had a constructive day, with wood building products stocks, and cement and concrete plays shining. Drugstores and auto parts retailers also did well.



The hospitals industry group was another top performer. **HCA Healthcare** ([HCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA)) boasts a decent Composite Rating of 88. It closed the day in a buy zone after clearing a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a buy point of 272.36, [according to MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Earnings are due Friday though, so caution is advised.


It was no surprise to find IBD's Leisure-Movies industry group as the day's worst performer. It closed the day down almost 20% thanks to Netflix, which is by far the biggest stock in the group.

Bears Rise Again In This Key Gauge
----------------------------------


The latest advisors sentiment weekly report from [Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) showed bearish sentiment is once again more prevalent.


The proportion of bulls dropped to 32.1%. This was down from 35.8% and 39.1% in the prior two surveys.


In contrast, the bears came in at 33.3%, up from 32.1% a week ago. It remained shy of the [mid-March peak of 36.5%](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears), so there could be room for more negative sentiment to take hold.


The number of advisors projecting a correction also rose, from 32.1% to 34.6% in the latest issue.


With the current uptrend still under pressure, the rise in bearish sentiment on this contrarian stock market indicator could be a sign relief is on the way. Why? When more market pundits are bearish than bullish, it tends to mean they have already sold stocks heavily, expecting share prices to fall even further. But when willing sellers disappear, buyers usually step back in.


But given the overall uncertain action so far in 2022, investors should make the day-to-day action of the indexes and stock market leaders their principal guide.

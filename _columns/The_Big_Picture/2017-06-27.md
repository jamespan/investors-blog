More Distribution For Nasdaq Puts Uptrend Under Pressure
=========================================================

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 got tagged with a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) Tuesday as the stock market sold off in afternoon trading. Leading growth stocks had a rough go of it as more than half the names in the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) fell 2% or more.




News that Senate Republicans delayed a vote on TrumpCare fueled negative sentiment. So did a 2.5% drop in shares of **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) after the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for skewing search results to benefit its own shopping search service.


Meanwhile, Fed Chair Janet Yellen gave a vote of confidence to the banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the one seen in 2008 is unlikely "in our lifetime," but her comments didn't do much to curb the selling in the broad market.


The Nasdaq cratered 1.6%, closing just above the 50-day moving average, weighed by weakness in chip and biotech stocks. Several recent erratic price swings in the index starting with the June 9 tumble isn't what the bulls want to see.


The S&P 500 lost 0.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.5%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index fell 0.9%. Volume on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 came in higher than Monday's levels.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MP062717.png)Money flowed out of bonds, lifting the 10-year yield higher by 7 basis points to 2.20%. The bond sell-off came amid a better-than-expected reading on consumer confidence from the Conference Board. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for the U.S. economy for this year and next.


The bright spot Tuesday was financials, which outperformed ahead of a second round of stress test results Wednesday.


One of the top-performing financial groups in IBD's database Tuesday were the regional banks. **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) rose 1% to 71.80 as it sits just above the 50-day line but below a 73.51 buy point. **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) added 1.3% to 95.42. It's still in buy range after a breakout over a 92.39 buy point.


Meanwhile, two popular exchange traded funds in the financial sector are setting up for possible breakouts. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name Direxion Financial Bull 3x Shares ([FAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAS)) is just below a 49.60 cup-with-handle buy point, while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) is in the same boat, just below a 24.69 cup-with-handle entry.


Semiconductor stocks lagged Tuesday, but **Power Integrations** ([POWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWI)) bucked the trend, rising nearly 3% to 74.90 after an analyst said **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is using the company's power adapter product for the upcoming iPhone 8.


Among the FANG stocks, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) closed Tuesday just above their 50-day moving averages, but it was a different story for **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Alphabet as both names closed below their 50-day lines.


Oil rose for the fourth straight session ahead of weekly supply data Wednesday. August-delivery West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 86 cents, or 2%, to settle at $44.24 a barrel.


The risk level in the market has been elevated for a while, even when the market was in a confirmed uptrend. It's even more elevated now as institutional-quality growth names come under fire. IBD's market outlook changed from confirmed uptrend to the cautious "uptrend under pressure" after Tuesday's trading. Investors should be looking to take profits and certainly should cut losses once they reach 7% or 8%.

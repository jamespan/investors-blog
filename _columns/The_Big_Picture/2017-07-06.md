title: Stock Indexes Fade; Why This Market Could Go Either Way

U.S. stock indexes tried to backfill early losses Thursday but couldn't get the job done.




The Nasdaq lost 1% but had been down as little as 0.4% before sellers stepped back in. The S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 1.4%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which slapped the Nasdaq with a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). That's now seven for the composite, a number that casts a cloud over the market. NYSE volume also increased, which gave the S&P 500 a distribution day as well.


Overall, this appears to be a market that is only one step away from an escalator. But it isn't clear if the market will choose the down escalator or the up escalator. Recent distribution suggests the path is down, but signs of rotation suggest there could be new winners ready to move up.


Individual investors who have been riding recent winners might look to take some profits. If it turns out the next move is down, then the investor has a start on building a cash position. If it turns out the next move is up, the money could be redeployed among new leaders.


Thursday's session was odd in many respects. Price action was bad, but hardly any leaders did their suffering in heavy volume. Meanwhile, groups that did well had only one or two stocks to thank for it.


The day's most surprising news revolved around oil inventories, but a boost for oil stocks faded. Although the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil surged as much as 3% intraday Thursday, it finished up only 0.4%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP2-070617-227x300.png)Late Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a 5.8 million-barrel draw in U.S. oil inventories. Analysts expected a 2.8 million-barrel draw. On Thursday, the Energy Information Administration reported a 6.3 million-barrel draw in U.S. oil inventories vs. expectations for a 2.5 million-barrel drop.


Analysts are generally bearish on oil prices in [the current market](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), but there is a minority case. Raymond James analysts expect oil prices to rise, based on U.S. inventory data since March.


A few oil groups scored big gains early — only to give the gains back. For example, the oil drilling group rose 1.9% intraday but then reversed to a 2.3% dent for the day.


For IBD-style investors, a quick glance through the IBD 50 and Big Cap 20 finds no stocks from the oil patch.


Look further, though, and several oil-related stocks appear in the IPO Leaders screen.


**Jagged Peak** ([JAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAG)), an oil and gas explorer, has been consolidating since its Jan. 27 initial public offering. The stock is trying to build the right side of a cup pattern and is 13% off its high. The company has earned either 1 cent or 2 cents a share in past three years, but the Street expects a profit of 40 cents a share this year and then a surge to 96 cents a share in 2018.


May IPO **Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure** ([SOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOI)) is working on a base. The potential buy point is 12.57. The stock is 6% off its high.


Field services provider **NCS Multistage** ([NCSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCSM)) is also working on a consolidation. The April IPO's potential entry is 29.17.


**Antero Midstream Partners** ([AM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AM)), a 2014 IPO, is shaping an awkward consolidation that began in February. The potential buy point is 35.84. Antero is more of a dividend play, with an annualized dividend yield is 3.6%.

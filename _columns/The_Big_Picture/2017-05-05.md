U.S. stock indexes advanced moderately Friday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 notched their third weekly gain in a row.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each added 0.4%, closing high in the day's range. The Dow Jones industrial average tacked on less than 0.3%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

News had something to do with the cautiousness.


The Federal Reserve meeting ended Wednesday without any words that would either disturb or energize the market.


The unexpected House passage of a health care bill Thursday tapped into the market's wariness. The reaction was muted both before and after the vote.


Unemployment and payroll data Friday came in better than expected. The jobless rate fell to the lowest level since May 2007. Nonfarm payrolls for April spurted 14% above the consensus view. But again, the market showed little reaction.


This last item was somewhat surprising, considering the payrolls number reinforced the belief that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in June. CME Group's FedWatch Tool increased the probability of a rate hike in June to almost 79%, up roughly 10 percentage points from before the economic data were released.


Higher rates should be a boon to banks because they improve net interest margins. But money centers moved roughly in line with the market for the week.


A look at IBD's 197 industry groups adds some vibrant tones to the overall picture.


For the week, the cement stock group rose 6%. Fiber optics and wireless telecom groups also rose 6%. Home furnishings rose almost 5%.


Some big-name stocks also did well. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) popped 3.5% for the week. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) rose 2.7%. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) added 3%. **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), which now carries a best-possible Composite Rating of 99, gained 3%.


**Coming up**: Monday's market will parse the meaning of France's weekend election.


On Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business will release its optimism index.


On Wednesday, the Energy Information AdministrationÂ will offer its weekly reading on crude oil inventories.


On Thursday, first-time jobless claims will be released.


On Friday, retail sales for April and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge for May will be released.

title: Stock Indexes Sag; Bulls Look To Financials For A Boost

For the fifth session in a row, stock indexes were little changed. Neither bulls nor bears have been able to do much since the solid gains of Oct. 5.




The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each lost less than 0.2% Thursday, while, the Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was just under flat.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The major indexes scored new highs, but the accomplishment seemed more routine than meaningful.


Heading into this week, the bulls had hoped that the banks and financials — including some major ones reporting Q3 results this week — might light a fuse.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP101217-182x300.png)The hope wasn't totally unfounded. Going into Thursday's session, banks and financials had scored the most new highs for 16 sessions in a row.


**BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)), the world's biggest financial assets manager, set a bullish tone when it reported Wednesday. Results beat the Street's estimates for the top and bottom lines. The stock climbed above the 5% buy zone from its 442.93 buy point.


But big money center banks **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) reported Thursday, and the stocks couldn't find traction. The two banks topped the Street's estimates, but neither stock could convert the beats into stock gains. Instead, they lost ground.


So far, the early hopes for Q3 earnings have disappointed the optimists, though it is very early in the season.


**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) will report before Friday's open.


The most bullish Q3 commentary so far came from BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink. At the earnings call Wednesday, Fink said "the market environment has improved considerably" and he sees "greater economic certainty" worldwide. (When was the last time a CEO at an earnings call talked about economic certainty?)



Fink added that "large cash balances remain on the sidelines."


For IBD-style investors, this is a very interesting setup.


Add the ingredients — economic certainty, an improved environment and cash on the sidelines — and the possibility exists for a fresh market run-up or perhaps even a melt up.


On Thursday, the market's ingredients had a cautious flavor. The dairy products group, which is last among 197 industry groups, rose 2%. Top losers for the day included retail and oil groups.


Among the FANG stocks — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — action was dull. Perhaps the most interesting action belonged to Amazon.


Since retaking its 50-day line Oct. 5, Amazon has built a 3% cushion above the line and is only 7% off its high. The stock's current base is 14% deep.


Amazon is testing the 1,000 level, an area that provided resistance in June. A conquest of the 1,000 level in July was short-lived. The testing resumed in August, September and this month.


The fortunate element is that Amazon can work on this test without triggering an immediate buy point. In other words, individual investors can wait to see how the battle is settled and continues watching until the stock reaches its 1,083.14 entry.


Trump's Order And Health Stocks
-------------------------------


A political factor came into play Thursday, though it had been kicked around for a while. President Trump signed an executive order that is bad news for ObamaCare.


Trump's executive order clears the way for more choices in the health care market. The order wasn't unexpected, as [health-related stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-executive-order-could-rewrite-obamacare-move-these-health-care-stocks/) show.


The hospitals group dropped in seven of the past eight sessions, lopping off almost 8%.


Others falling Thursday included managed-care stocks **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) and **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)), each down for a fourth consecutive session.


Stocks expected to profit from greater choices showed constructive action. Online discount insurer **Health Insurance Innovations** ([HIIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIIQ)) has risen in eight of the past 10 sessions. Health savings account provider **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) hasn't change much pricewise lately but has sketched a handle in a base.


Economic News
-------------


First-time jobless claims were almost 4% fewer than expected.


The Producer Price Index for September was in line with the Street's consensus estimate.


Coming Up
---------


On Friday, data is expected on consumer prices; retail sales in September; business inventories for August; and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge for October.


Earnings season continues. In addition to Bank of America and Wells Fargo, other companies reporting include **PNC Financial Services** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)) and trucker **JB Hunt** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)).


The trucking industry group is up 19% since the market notched a short-term low Aug. 21. The Nasdaq rose 6% in the same period.

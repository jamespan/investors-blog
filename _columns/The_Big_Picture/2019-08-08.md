U.S. stock indexes battled to retake their 50-day moving averages Thursday, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 getting the job done. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remains under its 50-day line.




The Nasdaq knifed 2.2% higher, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Small caps, as gauged in the Russell 2000, rose 2.1%.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The market remains in a correction, though IBD-style investors should be ready to act if and when the situation improves. Certainly, indexes Thursday gave the impression that buyers are coming back already, and leading stocks put on a strong performance.

Thursday marked Day 3.


Stock Indexes And The Follow-Through Day
----------------------------------------


A follow-through day doesn't always work, but research shows that the success rate in August makes it one of the better months for this bottoming signal.


Still, individual investors should avoiding jumping the starter gun, which would be no better than guessing.


Given that the stock market has been news-driven, any guessing is nothing more than an attempt to predict the news. Can anybody feel comfortable guessing what President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping will do?


Shift In China News
-------------------


Regime uncertainty has kept the two nations' trade policies in a fog. And so news related to China has been battering the U.S. stock market.


However, that shifted slightly Thursday.


China reported that exports in July rose 3%. Analysts had expected a 2% decline. The beat eased fears of a worldwide economic slowdown.


Also, the South China Morning Post reported that U.S.-China trade talks scheduled in September are still very much alive.


Earnings Step To The Front
--------------------------


Most professional investors would prefer an earnings-driven market over a market pulled and pushed by the vagaries of international news.


On Thursday, plenty of stocks were riding earnings reports higher. They included streaming-device developer **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), up 21%, and bank software provider **Q2 Holdings** ([QTWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QTWO)), up 15%.


Four other breakouts developed after shaping some bullish consolidations.


Online Latin American e-commerce company **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) stabbed 12% higher in heavy volume. The stock cleared a 672.65 buy point. MercadoLibre [beat consensus views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mercadolibre-stock-quarterly-earnings-report/) on the top and bottom lines.


Hamburger chain **Wendy's** ([WEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEN)) barreled 2% higher as it closed in on a 20.24 buy point. The midcap company topped the consensus estimate on earnings by about 6%. Revenue was 1% lighter than analysts' views.



**Career Education** ([CECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CECO)) cleared a 20.49 buy point in heavy volume. The for-profit education chain's adjusted earnings trounced the Street's estimate by 35%.


Cloud-platform developer **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) popped above a 192.59 buy point after a nearly 12-week consolidation. The stock rose 5% Thursday. Its earnings report late Tuesday [beat analyst expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hubspot-stock-earnings-hubs-q219/).


Meanwhile, chip designer **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) surged 16% on [good news for its second-generation data-center chips](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-rockets-as-google-twitter-adopt-its-new-data-center-chips/). Brazil payment processor **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) rallied more than 7%.


Leading Stocks Outperform
-------------------------


What made Thursday's session even more impressive was the gain among leading stocks.


Innovator IBD 50 Fund ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) advanced 2.9%, outperforming the major indexes. The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities Fund ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) ETF added 2%.


More than 20 of the stocks in the IBD 50 climbed 3% or more in a broad advance for top-rated stocks. It was the best day for the IBD 50 index since Jan. 4.


The United States Oil Fund ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)) gained 1% after falling in five of the previous six sessions.

Stocks Battered As Medicals Lead The Way Down
==============================================

Stocks battled to a dismal finish Friday as the indexes lost ground in fast trade.

  

The Nasdaq choked on a 1% chunk while the S&P 500 swallowed a 0.3% loss. The IBD 50 lost 1.9%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

Friday was a quadruple witching day in futures and options, which normally jacks up stock trading.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each suffered a distribution day, adding to the session's gloom.

  

While some market watchers might argue that quadruple witching artificially created the distribution day, excuses can't tote water or douse even a small fire.

  

The uptrend remains under pressure, and neither Friday's action nor leading stocks did anything to relieve it.

  

Leaders wrote a sorry prescription as medical stocks came under heavy selling.

  

Market watchers attributed the sell-off to members of a House committee who demanded that biotech **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) explain the pricing on its new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.

  

The prospect of politicians posturing over biotech pricing can't be good for medical stocks, but there probably was more at work in the sell-off. Selling went beyond biotechs to the ethical drug, generic drug and medical research equipment groups.

  

Medical sector stocks have been leaders for some time, topping the new-highs tally in 32 of 40 sessions in the first two months of the year. An early sign of weakness came two weeks ago. On March 10, the Big Picture noted that medical stocks led the market with 24 new highs for the day, but "16 of the new highs involved negative reversals and closes low in the day's range â€” clearly bearish action."

  

Housing is another group showing weakness. The homebuilder industry group rose 14% through early March, but recently has given back most of the gains.

  

Bulls aren't finding much consolation these days, but if investors step back from the day-to-day grind and take a longer view, there are some signs of strength.

  

First, rotation in the leadership could be underway.

  

Chip stocks are showing some life. (See the Stock Spotlight on Page B10.) Financials also are clicking. (See the Industry Themes column on Page B11.)

  

Second, initial public offerings are popping. In a front-page story Tuesday, IBD noted the "blistering pace" in stock-price appreciation for IPOs this year.

  

For now, the chief challenge might be holding onto positions that you don't truly want to drop.

  

Staying in a profitable position, even if it means giving back some gains, isn't necessarily a bad strategy. However, if a profit threatens to cycle into a loss, it's only prudent to sell.

  

At that point, what an individual investor prefers means nothing.

Two normally healthy biotech stocks suffered critical declines Friday, while most other medical names on the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/top10/default.aspx) remained in fairly stable condition.

  

Still, the biotech illness spread to other drug stocks. As a result, six of the seven biggest losers hailed from the medical sector, including generics and ethical drug makers.

  

**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), No. 5 on last week's list, fell 13.87, or 8%, to 159.79 in heavy trade as it closed below its 10-week moving average for the first time since late October. The Connecticut-based biotech's sole marketed drug, Soliris, used to treat a rare disease called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, sells for upward of $400,000 a year.

  

While there was no specific Alexion-related news, its sell-off may have stemmed from a letter several House Democrats sent to **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) asking the biotech to explain why its Sovaldi hepatitis C [drug costs $84,000](http://news.investors.com/technology/032114-694173-sovaldi-pricing-scrutinized-by-congress.htm?nav=NewsLatest). As a result, some states' Medicaid programs are funding Sovaldi only for the sickest patients, the letter said.

  

**Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) gave up 28.51, or 8%, to 318.53 in fast turnover. The stock is 11% off its recent high, but remains 7% above a 298.92 buy point from a flat base it cleared in January. The move marks its second pullback to its 10-week line.

  

The Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech's portfolio of drugs includes Avonex, Tecfidera and Tysabri for multiple sclerosis.

  

Biotechs have outperformed recently, ranking No. 1 or No. 2 the past six weeks among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.

  

**Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)) held up despite the biotech downdraft. It ended down 54 cents at 42.61 in below-average volume and managed a small weekly gain. Shares are extended more than 50% past a 27.90 buy point from a cup base they broke out of in October.

  

The stock spiked 33% Feb. 26 after the Bedford, Mass.-based company said it won FDA approval for its Monovisc osteoarthritis treatment, for which it will receive royalties and milestone payments from a **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) unit.

  

Generic-drug maker **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) shed 6.35, or 3%, to 209.37. The stock is still 26% above a 166.42 three-weeks-tight buy point, so investors should consider taking at least partial profits if they haven't already done so.

  

A few ethical drug makers got hit too. **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) fell 6.40 to 143.86, **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) 4.40 to 110.24 and **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) 4.85 to 135.55.

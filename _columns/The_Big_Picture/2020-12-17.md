The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 set record highs Thursday, as the stock market continued to power higher. Leading stocks continued to act well, as **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) broke out above a new buy point, while [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **EXP World** ([EXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPI)) triggered a hold rule.




The Nasdaq rose 0.8% to slightly outperform the other major stock indexes. The S&P 500 rallied 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.5%.


The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.3%, while leading growth stocks also outperformed. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.4% on Thursday, climbing to a record high. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is tracing a new flat base with a 587.76 buy point. For now, shares remain stuck under their 50-day moving average line. Nvidia was featured as [Thursday's IBD 50 Stocks to Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/nvidia-stock-ibd-50-builds-base-new-buy-point/).


Volume was squarely higher compared with Wednesday's session on the Nasdaq. Preliminary data showed slightly higher NYSE volume.


Nasdaq, S&P 500 Hit Record High
-------------------------------


![MP121720](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP121720-253x300.jpg)The Nasdaq hit a record high Thursday, extending a win streak to four sessions. The tech-heavy composite is on pace for a solid week, up over 3% through Thursday.


With just two days of institutional selling on the Nasdaq, investor sentiment remains positive. Positive sentiment indicates the major stock indexes are better able to shrug off negative news, like rising jobless claims.


The S&P 500 received a dose of good news, losing a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) as the count went from five to four. When an index moves up 5% from the distribution day's closing price, the distribution day is considered no longer relevant to the current trend and is removed. Thus, the Nov. 12 distribution was removed. The S&P 500 also made a new high Thursday.


The presence of powerful new breakouts — like those of **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) — is a positive sign for the current uptrend.


Next, investors should watching the aftermath of those breakouts. Are they being sold into strength by institutions, or do the stocks continue to power higher? For most leading stocks, the post-breakout behavior has been bullish.

Recent Breakouts
----------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock EXP World triggered the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stock-trading-rules-the-eight-week-hold-rule-and-its-wrinkles/) Thursday when it gained 20% in less than three weeks. The stock rallied 5.6% Thursday. Shares broke out above a 62.60 entry last Friday. EXP World [shows a 98](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-exp-world-holdings-inc-expi.aspx) out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), according to the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)


**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) hit more highs Thursday with a 2.3% advance. The stock ended Thursday more than 9% above a [cup base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) 215.93 buy point.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) set record highs Thursday amid a 5.3% rally. The electric-auto giant is 40% from a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) 466 entry. Tesla stock broke out on Nov. 18.


**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) reached more all-time highs Thursday. Both staged [breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) on Dec. 3. They were recently highlighted in the [IPO Leaders column.](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-3/)


**Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) ended Thursday nearly 10% from a 333.72 buy point following a Dec. 10 breakout.


As these recent breakouts flourish, investors should feel confident in the health of the current uptrend. But selling happens fast, so be mindful of potential round-trip sell signals if this strength fades in the near future.


New Breakouts: Lululemon
------------------------


On Thursday, Lululemon broke out above a cup with handle's 383.64 buy point Thursday, advancing more than 6%. Volume more than doubled vs. average, a sign of big institutional demand.


A flaw is the stock's lagging relative strength line. The [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) remains far from its old highs. Ideally, the RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day to confirm the breakout's strength.

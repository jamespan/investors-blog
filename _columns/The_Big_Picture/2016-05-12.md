Bears, Bulls Find Little To Cheer; Brazil Stocks Climb
=======================================================

Stock indexes limped to a lackluster finish Thursday, denying hope to the bulls but teasing the bears with cloudy data.


The Nasdaq dropped 0.5%, and remained stuck under its 50-day moving average line. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were down and up fractionally. The IBD 50 inched up 0.1%.

Volume crept higher on the Nasdaq and slipped lower on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq suffered a distribution day, but the count stayed the same. The Nasdaq shed its April 7 distribution day because of time. The S&P 500 stood pat with its number of distribution days.


Catalysts were scarce in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), and U.S. and world news was hard to gauge.


In the U.S., first-time jobless claims delivered an ugly number -- 294,000 which was 10% higher than expected. This should’ve pleased the bears, but the spike wasn’t a clean read. The Verizon strike in New York accounted for most of the increase, some market watchers said.


And so the stock market meandered to an inconclusive outcome Thursday.


In Brazil, the Senate voted to suspend President Dilma Rousseff and proceed with an impeachment trial. While this might seem irrelevant to Americans, Brazil is the eighth-largest economy in the world and the largest in Latin America.


Brazil’s economy is in recession and heavily protectionist. Any move away from protectionism and toward a free-market economy could eventually embolden investors.


Among Brazilian stocks trading on U.S. markets, many have been beaten down to single-digit prices.


**Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)) leapt 11% in above-average volume after reporting a profit after five consecutive quarterly losses. The stock is low-priced, thinly traded and without fund support. Gol was once a growth-stock darling but hasn’t been of interest to growth investors for years.


**Banco Bradesco** ([BBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBD)) is another Brazilian stock that is far from its glory days. The low-priced issue rose about 2% Thursday. The bank has stayed profitable even as earnings have declined.


Brazil's Bovespa index rose 0.9% Thursday.


Meanwhile, among U.S. stocks, only a few top-rated stocks moved in strong volume.


**Blue Buffalo Pet Products** ([BUFF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BUFF)) and video game software designer **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)) both showed strong follow-up action to recent quarterly reports. Both beat estimates after Tuesday's close and have posted gains since. Electronic Arts gained 14% and 2% in the past two sessions. Blue Buffalo rose 8% and 3%.


Restaurant-equipment supplier **Middleby** ([MIDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIDD)) reported quarterly results a half-hour after Thursday's open. The company beat on earnings and matched the consensus view on revenue. Middleby broke out in heavy volume, clearing a 113.23 handle buy point in a sloppy consolidation.


On Friday, retail sales for April are expected to roll in at 0.9%. The range of estimates runs from 0.4% to 1.2%. Business inventories for March are pegged at 0.2%. The range is from 0.1% to 0.3%. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey for May is pegged at 89.7. The estimates range from 88 to 92.


**J.C. Penney** ([JCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCP)) will report Q1 results before the open Friday. Analysts expect a loss of 38 cents a share on a 2% revenue pop to $2.92 billion. The department store group dropped in five of the previous seven weeks, lopping off 27%. Penney's fell in each of the previous seven weeks, severing about 33% and appears headed toward it eighth weekly loss in a row.

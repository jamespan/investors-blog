Neither bears nor bulls found much to cheer about Friday, as the indexes were mixed in quiet volume.




The Nasdaq was virtually flat Friday as it pegged a 0.2% loss for the week. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% Friday and fell 0.2% for the week. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average declined 0.2% Friday and 0.5% for the week.


Volume fell across the board.


During the past week, news developments cut both ways — some bullish, some bearish.


On Nov. 6, two potential chip deals were announced. **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) confirmed a plan to buy **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), while **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) and **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) reported that they were in buyout talks.

Long term, the move toward self-driving cars and the internet of things are expected to provide big business for semiconductors.


On Tuesday, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index for November hit an eight-month high, confirming the American consumer's optimism.


On Wednesday, Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears gauge raised concerns. Bullishness among market advisors reached 64.4%, an unusually high level that is considered a "danger zone."


On Thursday, a tax plan from Senate Republicans would [delay a cut in corporate taxes to 20% until 2019](https://www.investors.com/news/senate-gop-tax-bill-may-be-bad-news-for-investors-sp-500-slips/). A plan by House Republicans took aim at accumulated earnings held overseas.


Friday was fairly quiet. The only economic news was the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge. The reading was 97.8 for November, below views for 100.


In the days ahead, earnings reports will be less of a factor in the stock market. As of Friday, 91% of the companies in the S&P 500 had reported Q3 results, according to FactSet.


Still, some big names will be reporting in the coming week.


They include **TJX Companies** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)).



Breakouts Friday included Wall Street Journal parent **News Corp.** ([NWS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NWS)); single family home REIT **Invitation Homes** ([INVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVH)); and data analytics software provider **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)). News Corp. and Alteryx reported earnings late Thursday.

 Major stock indexes strengthened into the close Wednesday as Wall Street digested the content of the minutes from the May 2-3 Fed meeting.


The S&P 500 marked an all-time closing high, rising 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite picked up 0.4% each. Volume on the NYSE climbed in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), while Nasdaq volume fell a bit.


The April 19 stalling session fell off the Nasdaq's distribution-day count due to time, but the count stays the same. A May 2 stalling session is still in play, as well as two distribution days: One on May 3, the other on May 17.

The market is widely expecting a rate hike at the June 13-14 meeting. According to the CME Group FedWatch tool, the market sees an 83% chance of a rate hike, up from 65% a week ago.


The Fed also appears to be in agreement on how it plans to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion portfolio, made up mostly of government debt, although it doesn't appear in a rush to do so. That appeared to give stock investors a sense of relief.


The greenback ended lower on the news. Its current downtrend started at the beginning of the year. The 10-year Treasury yield eased 3 basis points to 2.25%.


Meanwhile, the latest Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers showed a big drop in the bulls to 51.9% from 58.1% the prior week, The bears rose to 18.3% from 17.1%, while those expecting a near-term correction rose to 29.8% from 24.8%. Market bulls liked the data because newsletter writer sentiment has often worked well as a contrarian indicator.


Restaurant stocks turned in solid showings with the group up more than 1%. **Restaurant Brands** ([QSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QSR)), which owns the Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeye's brands, rose 1.5% to 60.53. It's near the top of a buy range from a 58.08 buy point. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), meanwhile, rose 0.8%. A turnaround appears intact for Chipotle as the stock looks poised for a first test of the 10-week moving average after a breakout in late March.


Other solid gainers in the group included **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), up 3% each.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) underperformed, falling 0.1%. The index was hurt by a terrible showing for **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)), which slumped nearly 18% on weak guidance. Bright spots included **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)). Shares jumped nearly 5% in strong volume as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base. Meanwhile, China-based **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) added 2% to 56.82. It's still in buy range from a 56.31 buy point.


So at this stage of the game, does it make sense to give serious attention to names like Stamps.com and YY that are breakout candidates or in the early stages of breaking out? Or is better to look at stocks that have already broken out and are testing support at the 10-week moving average for the first time?


When looking at breakout candidates, make sure the relative strength line is at or near new high ground. Outperformance is what can give a breakout added lift. Stamps.com's RS line is in pretty good shape, but YY's is lagging.


**Western Digital** ([WDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC)), meanwhile is testing support at the 10-week line after a breakout in late March. Shares outperformed Wednesday, rising nearly 2% after published reports said the company offered to buy Toshiba's chip unit for $17.8 billion.


Benchmark crude oil for July delivery settled at $51.36 a barrel, down 0.2%, despite data from the Energy Information Administration that showed the seventh straight weekly drop in U.S. crude supplies. That news was offset by a recommendation from a joint OPEC and non-OPEC committee to extend output cuts agreed upon in December by another nine months. OPEC meets Thursday.


Chip designer **Marvell Technology Group** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) reports earnings Thursday after the close. It's gunning for a breakout from a cup-shaped base with a 16.82 buy point. Software name **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) also reports Thursday after the close. It's just below a 66.56 entry.

  Stocks Edge Higher; What The IBD 50 Says About Market Leadership

The stock market closed modestly higher Tuesday as the major indexes try again to make themselves comfortable near record highs.


The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.2% increase. Dow component **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) jumped 2.2% after [Goldman Sachs gave a bullish outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-lifts-dow-with-push-from-goldman-trump-readies-infrastructure-bill/) on the stock. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 added less than 0.1%. Both had been lower for much of the session, until a rally in the final half-hour ensured a tiny win.


But small caps continued to lag. The Russell 2000 dropped 0.1% and remains below the 50-day moving average. That sets it on a weaker course than the main indexes, which have held above the 50-day averages and don't look as droopy as the Russell 2000. For the bull market to remain healthy, it surely will need the small-cap index — a gauge of speculative fervor — to rally.

The Feb. 28 distribution day reached its expiration date, which left the S&P 500 with five distribution days. The Nasdaq now has only three because the deduction also means that only one of its two stalling days in March is still counted for now. It's a complex set of rules, but the bottom line is that there's no excessive institutional-sized selling over the past several weeks.


After the fright on March 21, market has been doing reasonably well. However, with the Nasdaq turning back mildly after hitting a new high Monday, there's still reason to be guarded. Seems like the Nasdaq is content to stay put rather than challenge new highs. Thus, IBD's market outlook remains with the uptrend under pressure.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 found support when they pulled back to the 50-day moving average March 27. That bounce effectively ended a short-term decline. But now the Nasdaq has been meeting resistance around 5900 since the start of March.


The S&P 500 this week is again testing the 50-day moving average. The index has made lower highs since the Feb. 28 peak at 2400, and must at least get above the March 15 high to break that downward trend.


On a day of few big headlines, stock movements were limited.


Airlines were one of the weakest industry groups after **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) trimmed its first-quarter unit-revenue forecast. The carrier said a rebound in U.S. fares for shorter-term bookings was softer than expected. Delta's warning followed muted outlooks from **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) and **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)).


Fiber optics, hospitals, apparel and auto parts stocks were some other notably weaker groups. Department stores continued their meltdown. The group fell about 4% Tuesday. **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **Sears Holdings** ([SHLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHLD)) and other big chains have set plans to close stores. **Staples** ([SPLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLS)) is looking for a buyer, the Wall Street Journal reported.


Financials, one of the pillars of the postelection rally, have surrendered their market leadership. Internet retailers and some technology stocks have surfaced as new leaders. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) added 1.7% Tuesday as it stretched a rally from support at the 50-day moving average last week.


On the IBD 50, the tech-sector strength is evident: Half the stocks are chip, software, computer and other technology leaders. **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) are forming bases and deserve some research.


But **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), a former tech darling, gapped down 7% in double its usual volume. A Pacific Crest analyst cut the stock to underweight from sector weight on concerns about market saturation and a possible pause in data-center chip sales.


A few weeks ago, it was banks and financials that claimed about half the IBD 50. Today, most of the remaining financials in the screen are below the 50-day line.

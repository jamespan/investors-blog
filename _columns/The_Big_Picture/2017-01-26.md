U.S. stock indexes barely stirred Thursday, as the market sat on two days of sizable gains.


The Nasdaq was flat, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.


While a pause after two days of solid gains appeared natural, another factor may have been behind Thursday's neutral action.


![mp012617](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP012617-203x300.png)The first take on Q4 GDP growth will be released before the market's open Friday, and this time considerable uncertainty surrounds the estimates.


The consensus view is for a gain of 2.2%, which would be down from Q3's 3.5% pace. However, the range of estimates for Q4 is all over the place. The pessimists expect 1.8% while the optimists see 3.3%.


Compare that situation to just before the Q3 release. The range of estimates was so tight — 3.2% to 3.4% — that the difference between the bears and the bulls was irrelevant. And the slight beat was meaningless.


Friday's situation is radically different. Q4 could conceivably deliver a big beat or a big miss, giving the market something to calibrate down or up.


Breakouts were scarce Thursday, but there was follow-up action to watch.


About [a dozen breakouts](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stocks-peg-new-highs-building-sector-rises/) were mentioned in Wednesday's afternoon market update. How did those stocks do Thursday?


Only three rose: data storage provider **Seagate Technology** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)), up 2.9%; contract manufacturer **Flex** ([FLEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLEX)), up 1%; and insurer **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)), up 1.4%.


Two stocks gave up ground: **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), down 1% and back under the buy point; and **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), down 1.8% and back under the entry.


The other stocks were neither up nor down significantly.


In economic news, there were two bad misses. Initial jobless claims were 5% higher than expected, and new home sales for December were about 10% fewer than estimated.


Homebuilding stocks have surprised on the upside so far this year.


**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) are each up 15% year to date. **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) is up 14%, and three in the building group are up 12% — **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)) and **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)).


Horton, Pulte and NVR recently reported quarterly results, each beating the Street's consensus view by 14% to 15%.


The homebuilder group is up 13% year to date, which makes it No. 5 in percentage gain among 197 industry groups.


The four groups that have delivered bigger percentage gains than the homebuilders so far this year are metal ore miners, oil and gas royalties, automakers and specialty steel.


On the upside, the Chicago Fed's activity index turned modestly positive in December after a negative reading in November.


The Kansas City Fed's manufacturing gauge for January was unchanged from December.

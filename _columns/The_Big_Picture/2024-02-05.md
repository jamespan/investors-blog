The stock market pared losses Monday to close with only minor declines, even as Treasury yields continued to surge. Major indexes remained upright, although some internals showed weakness.




The Nasdaq composite, down as much as 1%, closed with a loss of 0.2%. The S&P 500 reduced its loss to 0.3% and remained near its all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, resulting in new [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. For the S&P, the total has grown back to an uncomfortable seven [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/).


Small caps also pared losses, but lagged the rest of the stock market. The Russell 2000 fell 1.3%, closing just below the 50-day moving average for the first time since November. Its 55-day streak above the 50-day line was the longest since a 96-day streak ending in March 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The IBD 50 impressed with a positive reversal in which it closed nearly 0.6% higher.


Stock Market Holds Up, But Shows Weak Spots
-------------------------------------------


Despite scattered distribution in the major indexes, the stock market remains structurally sound. The number of new 52-week highs continues to trend well above 52-week lows. To wit, IBD's recommended exposure is holding at 80%-100%.

While bulls could take some comfort from the index action, breadth was bearish. Declining stocks far outweighed advancers. The ratio was 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq and more than 4-to-1 on the NYSE. The advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE dipped over the past week, breaking short rising trends.


Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight — which gives a picture of the stock market without the influence of its biggest stocks — fell 0.9% Monday.


[IBD MarketSmith](https://get.investors.com/marketsmith/) shows the stream of breakouts among MarketSmith 250 stocks continue, with more than a dozen over the past week or so. Some, however, are faltering or not following through, including **Bancorp** ([TBBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBBK)) and **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)).


Surging Yields Hit Market
-------------------------


Stock market indexes opened lower as 10-year Treasury yields jumped above the 200-day average for the first time since Jan. 29. The benchmark yield rose 13 basis points to 4.16%. Combined with Friday's jump, the two-day rise is the largest since June 14, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The leap came after Sunday's broadcast of CBS's "60 Minutes," in which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is contemplating interest-rate cuts. But Powell also reinforced the message from Wednesday's press briefing: The economy is strong enough that [there's no need to rush into rate cuts](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/treasury-yields-are-jumping-blame-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell/).


"With the economy strong like that, we feel like we can approach the question of when to begin to reduce interest rates carefully," Powell said in the interview. Cutting too quickly, he added, might halt disinflationary progress, leaving the economy with "inflation settling out somewhere well above our 2% target."


On Monday, other Fed officials echoed Powell.


In comments published in the Minneapolis Fed's website, [Fed President Neel Kashkari](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-kashkari-no-need-to-quickly-cut-interest-rates-as-theyre-not-holding-down-growth-much-be084b8a?mod=home-page) said policymakers have "time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery."


In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee wouldn't commit to a timetable for rate cuts. While [economic data doesn't need to change to justify rate cuts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-goolsbee-nothing-needs-to-change-in-the-data-to-justify-rate-cuts-dbcbd988?mod=home-page), he still wants to see more mild numbers before making a decision.


[Based on bond trading data](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html), investors now don't expect a quarter-point rate cut until at least the May Fed meeting.


Regional Banks Among Stock Market Losers
----------------------------------------


Regional banks [continued to struggle](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/regional-bank-stocks-continue-to-slide-as-feds-powell-plays-down-chances-of-march-rate-cut-c8af35f8?mod=home-page) on worries that rate cuts will be put off longer.


SPRD S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) fell 1.7% and is down about 10% in the past four sessions.


**New York Community Bancorp** ([NYCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NYCB)) lost nearly 11% Monday, its share price cut about in half since Jan. 20. Last week, it reported a surprise quarterly loss, cut its dividend and increased its loan-loss provisions, rattling the industry.

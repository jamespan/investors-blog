The stock market on Monday showed signs that after a merry month of May, it could be feeling some fatigue.




The S&P 500 reversed mildly lower after climbing to its highest level since Aug. 17 in midday trading. It finished 0.2% lower. The Nasdaq composite, off 0.1%, made a mild reversal of its own after it rose to the highest level since April 2022.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a 0.6% decline. Longtime laggards **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) cost the Dow a combined 60 points, with each falling more than 4%.


For a while, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) gave the Dow and other indexes some lift. The stock climbed as much as 2.2% as the company [unveiled a mixed-reality headset](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-hits-record-high-before-mixed-reality-headset-debut/) at its developers' conference. But Apple shares reversed lower and closed right below 180.


That's a significant level because the stock met resistance near 180 in December 2021, January 2022 and in April of that same year.

A bellwether stock, Apple's price action could give clues about the general market. Other flagship stocks such as **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) have been on feverish runs for weeks and are tempting sellers.


Still, there is no imminent sign of danger for the stock market. The fact the Nasdaq topped its August 2022 high and the S&P 500 last week broke out above 4200 are bullish signs. After Friday's push above key levels, IBD raised its recommended exposure level from 40%-60% to 60%-80%.


Small Caps Lag
--------------


Small caps got the worst of the selling Monday. The Russell 2000 slid 1.3%, dipping below its 200-day moving average just one session after regaining that long-term price trend gauge.

On a day when growth stocks performed relatively better, the IBD 50 was firm, up 0.6%. The index is testing resistance around 320, which deserves to be watched.


Fleet management company **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), which was [Monday's IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ftnt-stock-after-peeling-back-this-top-stock-is-nearing-a-record-high/), **Fluence Energy** ([FLNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLNC)) and **Celsius Holdings** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) helped the IBD 50 with gains of 4% to 12%.


In May, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbed for a fourth consecutive month. Both closed near monthly highs during that streak, a bullish sign. Both main indexes are clearly in recovery trends despite a daunting set of risks.


Stock market breadth — the soft spot of 2023 — is slowly improving.


First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) ETF broke out of a trading range last week. That's a sign that participation in the tech rally is broadening.


IBD's tracking of 52-week highs vs. new lows is tilting more toward the bulls.


Stock Market Pause Ahead?
-------------------------


Yet, indexes could easily be ready for a pause. The Nasdaq in particular, which rallied 5.8% in May, seems extended after widening its performance gap over other major indexes the past few weeks.


Moreover, the stock market is entering a month that historically hasn't been kind to investors, especially techs.


The S&P 500 has averaged a 0.0% return in June since 1950, which makes it the fourth worst-performing month, according to research from LPL Financial Chief Technical Strategist Adam Turnquist.


The June seasonal trend for the technology sector is even worse. Since 1990, the tech sector has generated average and median returns in June of 0.0% and -1.7%, respectively. That makes it the second-worst month for average returns and the worst month based on median returns.


Turnquist adds that the tech sector has notched positive returns 42.4% of the time during June, the lowest positivity rate across the calendar.

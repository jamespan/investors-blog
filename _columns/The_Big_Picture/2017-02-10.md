U.S. stock indexes stayed on a course of mostly piecemeal gains Friday — a path the market has been on for the past 40 sessions.


The Nasdaq rose 0.3%, and the S&P 500 added 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average popped 0.5%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.7%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.

From Nov. 4 when the Nasdaq bottomed to the Dec. 13 close, the Nasdaq gained 8.3% over 26 sessions. Eight daily gains in that period were 0.7% or greater.


In the 40 sessions since, only four days involved similar-sized gains. The overall advance in that period was 5%.


Are the smaller gains something to worry about?


Perhaps, but a wall of worry can be helpful to bulls, keeping exuberance in check.


What are the charts saying?


The S&P 500 had been moving sideways since mid-December, finding resistance at 2,300.


But the S&P 500 punctured the 2,300 barrier Thursday. If that resistance area becomes support, additional gains are likely.


The blue chip Dow and the small-cap Russell 2000 also have shifted sideways. While the Dow chart resembles the S&P 500 breakout-like move, the Russell 2000 still looks like a flat base.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq has been advancing steadily since early January.


Overall, the charts look good.


Channel lines offer additional insight.


The Nasdaq is near the upper price-channel line, an area where the index has met resistance in previous instances. But the S&P 500 has room to move higher before hitting the upper part of its price channel. The Russell 2000 has not made a new high, but on Friday it climbed above a trend line that spans two months, a favorable sign.


What sort of catalyst could heat up this market?


Earnings season is looking less like a driver, mainly because little ammunition is left: About 72% of the stocks in the S&P 500 have already reported.


President Trump and Congress could generate some market momentum if they were to take action on their economic wish list. This would include items such as corporate and personal taxes, the budget, and repealing, or at least making less hostile to business, laws such as Dodd-Frank.


To say that these issues are baked into the market is a stretch. Trump isn't the usual, predictable Republican president. And that lack of predictability could work for or against the market in a sudden fashion.

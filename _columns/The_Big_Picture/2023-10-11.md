Dull gains in the stock market today? Compared with what happened last week, sure. But sometimes dull can be electrifying.




Of course, you wouldn't mind seeing sessions of big gains by the major indexes to quickly show up after last [Friday's follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-surge-despite-hot-jobs-report-triggers-this-fed-minutes-jerome-powell-inflation-data-looms/), the eighth session in a brand-new rally attempt. But you should not automatically expect them.


Like a round of golf or a duel on the billiards table, the sequence of events after stocks embark on a confirmed uptrend can be unique. Some uptrends start out red-hot, while others move slowly.


The fact that a tidal wave of third-quarter earnings is coming soon may be one reason why the stock market seems like it's rising cautiously. Uncertainty surrounding the next step in the latest war between Israel and the Pro-Palestine militant group Hamas acts as another damper.


So the Nasdaq's 0.7% advance on Wednesday might not seem like much. But the composite also scored its fourth straight gain. Since July 1, a four-day win streak has occurred only three other times.


Also, the index lifted back above its 50-day moving average and closed above the critical technical level for the first time in 18 trading sessions.



Meanwhile, the exchange traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), matched the Nasdaq's gain on Wednesday. It finished above the 50-day moving average for a second straight day. But the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged QQQ on Wednesday. They advanced 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively.


Volume in the stock marked ended mixed on Wednesday. Compared with Tuesday, it shrank 3% on the Nasdaq to 4.16 billion shares. On the New York Stock Exchange, turnover edged 2.2% higher.


Stock Market Today: Eyeing Inflation
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP101123-248x300.jpg)A report on September producer prices revealed a mixed picture on inflation at the wholesale level. The headline number, up 0.5% vs. August, beat economists' expectations for a 0.3% month-on-month increase. A 2.2% year-over-year jump reflected a recent upswing in crude oil prices.


However, core producer prices, which strip out food and energy, came in less than expected — 0.2% month on month, and 2.2% year over year. These data points seem to dovetail nicely with recent comments by a number of leading bankers inside the Federal Reserve that its 18 months of monetary tightening is wringing out excessive inflation from the U.S. economy.


Keep an eye on how Wall Street will open on Thursday after the September data on U.S. consumer prices. According to Econoday, the Consumer Price Index is expected to rise 0.3% vs. August levels, sharply down from a 0.6% hike in August.


Year over year, overall CPI is forecast to increase 3.6% in September, slightly down from 3.7% growth in August. Economists see core consumer prices up 4.1%, decelerating from a 4.3% jump in August.


Here's a [preview of the CPI report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-federal-reserve-rate-hike-odds-dive-ahead-of-cpi-inflation-data-10-year-treasury-yield/), which is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.


Fed Minutes, Bond Market Signal Dovish View
-------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, once the Fed released minutes from its September meeting at mid-afternoon on interest rates, most stock market indexes started to bottom out and return to positive territory. The Russell 2000 was the only major index that failed to finish higher, but it turned an intraday loss of roughly 0.8% into a decline of less than 0.2%.


Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said that based on the comments from the minutes, his bank will adjust its forecast on interest rates. He expects no change in the fed funds rate at the Nov. 1 meeting but sees one more quarter-point increase at the final Fed meeting of the year on Dec. 13. This move would push the fed funds rate to a 5.5% to 5.75% target range.


"This is in recognition of the upside risks to inflation from the Israel-Hamas war, the Russia-Ukraine war and the (United Auto Workers) strike, which could reduce auto inventories and push vehicle prices up if sustained," Adams told Investors' Business Daily in an email.


On Wednesday, some commodities continued to cool off. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures slid 3.1% to $83.29 a barrel. That marks a 12.3% correction since the Sept. 28 near-term high of $95.03.


Also, gasoline futures nose-dived 2.7% to $2.19 per gallon. But gold rose 0.7% and silver rallied 1.1%.

Five Reasons To Stay Bullish
----------------------------


As past follow-throughs in 2023 have shown, upside can always be limited. However, these factors may help equities maintain positive momentum for now.


One, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield continued to calm down. The yield fell 6 basis points to 4.59%, down hard from a recent peak at 4.88% on Oct. 6.


Two, breadth in the stock market continues to improve incrementally. For instance, the MarketSmith homepage showed 192 stocks rising in above-average volume while only 150 fell in heavy turnover. Yet, more significantly, MarketSmith screens also counted six stocks that staged breakouts — the most on a daily basis since Sept. 1.


Three, bullishness is still muted. The Investors Intelligence survey of market pundits still shows bullishness at 48.6%, below levels that indicate excessive optimism. When the bullish ratio is relatively low, it hints that market participants are still swimming in cash. They eventually could become stock buyers.


Four, leading stock market sectors lately have tended to come from growth industries, including enterprise software, semiconductors, ethical drugs and consumer goods. Take **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), a biotech giant, which led the stock market and the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a 4.6% gain to 283.60 in massive volume. Amgen has rallied nearly 6% from a breakout point of 268.24 in an 11-month cup with handle.


The Stock Market Kicker For Q4?
-------------------------------



And finally, five, the earnings season may lead to positive surprises. Analysts tend to trim their estimates during the months leading up to reports. Many of the strongest growth companies often give conservative outlooks, then produce earnings and sales that smash estimates.


Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the U.S. SPDR Sector ETF business at State Street, notes that Wall Street's profit expectations were "too low" during the first six months of 2023. But he thinks they "may be too high now."


"Third-quarter earnings growth is likely to be modestly positive, but analysts are forecasting that fourth-quarter year-over-year earnings growth will increase by a staggering 8.3%," Arone wrote in a recent note to clients.

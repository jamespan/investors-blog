Apple garnered most of the headlines Monday, but the major averages turned in a pretty good performance of their own, ending with decent gains and near session highs.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.8%, led by **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) and **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)). The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.3%. The IBD 50 performed mostly in line with the market, rising 0.3%.

  

Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Friday, a disappointing development for the bulls after Friday's distribution day.

  

As the debate carries on about underlying market health, this week marks the sixth anniversary of the bull market that started in March 2009. The S&P 500 soared 4.1% on March 12 on the fifth day of its rally attempt, confirming a new uptrend.

  

The bears say that the bull market has run its course. They're worried about the negative effects of a strong dollar on earnings as well as the likely start of rate hikes by the Fed this year. Deteriorating breadth in recent days is another concern, although winners topped losers Monday.

  

But the bull case has merit. The bulls are looking at an economy on the mend, mild distribution in the broad market and plenty of growth stocks holding near highs after recent price strength. Sell signals in leading growth stocks — and the major averages — are not in abundance.

  

Still, it remains a challenging environment for growth investors. Buy candidates aren't popping up as frequently as they used to. The ones that have are a mixed bag at best. Some are working; others aren't.

  

An example of a recent breakout that's working is **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). It's still holding nicely above a 119.85 buy point. Shares rose more than 2% early Monday, but the stock closed in the bottom half of its intraday range, up 0.4%. The tech bellwether announced pricing for the Apple Watch and an April 24 launch date.

**Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) followed through after Friday's breakout, rising nearly 3%. It's still in a buy range from the 59.29 buy point.

  

Other names holding up well after recent breakouts include **Verisk Analytics** ([VRSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRSK)), **Prestige Brands** ([PBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBH)), **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) and **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)).

  

Sellers were back in **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) Monday. Shares fell by close to 2% after the company announced job cuts in China. At one point, China was regarded as a growth market for Tesla, but it's been a challenging market for Tesla to penetrate so far.

  Bears Maul Dow Jones As Fear Gauge Spikes; Energy Plays, Tesla Among Worst Performers

The Dow Jones Industrial Average made headlines as bears mauled the stock market Friday. A key Wall Street fear gauge spiked, underlining the negative sentiment.




Blue chips are often seen as an area of safety during a tough market. But the Dow Jones fell more than 20% from prior highs (what's considered bear market territory) during the day before ultimately closing down 1.6%. It now sits at its lowest level so far in 2022. Oil major **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) were the worst Dow laggards.


But it was the Nasdaq composite that fell by the biggest percentage out of the major indexes, even though it also ended the day off lows. It plunged 1.8% for the day and surrendered 5.1% for the week. It has now fallen in five of the past six weeks and could soon test its lows for the year.


The S&P 500 did not fare much better as it ended with a loss of 1.7% for the day and 4.5% for the week. The broad index now sits just a hair above the lows it made back in June.


Volume was up on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, a signal that institutional investors were fleeing for the exits.

Bears Feast On Small Caps; Stock Market Fear Gauge Spikes
---------------------------------------------------------


The hungry bears were not content just to feast on the major indexes. The Russell 2000 ended the session down an eye-watering 2.5%.


Meanwhile, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) was hammered due to the amount of energy stocks in the index. It swan-dived 5.4%, undercutting its March 2020 low in the process.


Stocks in general have been hammered since the Fed raised its key rate by 75 basis points Wednesday and signaled another such hike for its November meeting.


The [VIX](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), often referred to as a Wall Street fear gauge, spiked Friday and ended up more than 8%.  Investors should strap in for more painful times ahead, according to Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya.


"Unsettling market volatility is going to be here for a while as Wall Street broadly downgrades their end of year S&P 500 targets," he said in a note to clients. "The bond market is telling us they firmly believe Fed Chair (Jerome) Powell has rolled up his sleeves and is ready for this fight with inflation to get ugly."


Nevertheless, it is important for investors to put this time to good use. Now is an ideal opportunity to study market bottoms and to build a robust watchlist of high quality stocks.

Energy, Tesla Stock Worst Performers
------------------------------------



The performance of the IBD industry groups was once again illuminating on Friday. Only 10 of the groups turned in a gain, with homebuilders faring best with a mere 0.8% rise.


The downside action was far more pronounced, with oil & gas plays, coal stocks and agricultural equities the worst performers. **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)), a popular former [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock, gapped down below its [200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) after falling 8.6% in high volume.


The auto manufacturers group, which is dominated by **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), was another noteworthy laggard. Tesla stock knifed under the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and lost ground on a 316.74 entry. Volume was lower, the only crumb of comfort.

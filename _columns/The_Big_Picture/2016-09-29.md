title: U.S. Stock Indexes Slide On European News; eBay Stays Positive

U.S. stock indexes had a listless reaction to economic data and then sold off hard on banking worries from Europe.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each dropped 0.9%, while the Dow Jones industrial average slouched 1.1%. The IBD 50 also lost 1.1%.


Volume was higher on both major exchanges.


The day's action resulted in a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), but the count remained unchanged. The Aug. 24 distribution day fell off because of time. After five weeks, distribution is no longer relevant to the current market. Distribution involves a significant loss in rising volume, which points to institutional selling.

The third reading on Q2 GDP topped the consensus view slightly and first-time jobless claims were fewer than expected. Pending home sales for August, though, were much worse than the Street's consensus view. The Street expected a 0.5% gain but got a 2.4% decline.

The market reacted little to the data. But news from Europe packed a wallop.


Fears surrounding the standoff between **Deutsche Bank** ([DB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DB)) and the U.S. Department of Justice fueled sharp selling in accelerating volume.


The trigger was a Bloomberg News report that about 10 of more than 200 derivatives-clearing clients have reduced exposure to Deutsche Bank.


This wasn't entirely fresh news.


On Sept. 15, Deutsche Bank confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice demanded it pay $14 billion to settle an investigation into the selling of mortgage-backed securities. U.S.-listed Deutsche Bank shares dropped 9% the next day.


U.S. indexes barely blinked on Sept. 16. Why the difference between then and now?


For individual investors, that's probably the wrong question to ask.


A better question might be: What does this say about the confidence level of the market?


A strong market will shrug off bad news. A weak market will hyperventilate. Yet, this market seems more confused than outright bullish or bearish.


In that atmosphere, exposure should be limited.


A look at the indexes' charts also provides reason for caution. Daily ranges (from intraday high to low) have widened on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in the past three weeks. Long, loose lines on the chart point to a market that is struggling to make up its mind.



On the technical side, the put/call volume ratio closed at 1.1 Thursday. It was the fourth reading around that level since Sept. 9. The put/call ratio is useful in identifying short-term lows.


Among top-rated stocks, steel processor **Worthington Industries** ([WOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOR)) posted a 0.7% gain in strong volume. The stock broke out Wednesday and is in the 5% buy zone. Big Cap 20 stock and online marketplace **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) gapped up 1.4% in heavy volume.


Both stocks bowed to the market's headwinds and reversed to close low in the day's range.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index was one of the few winners of the day. The SOX rose 1.25%.


Friday marks the end of the third quarter. Q3 reports won't start rolling in until early in the second week of October.

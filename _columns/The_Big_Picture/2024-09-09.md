  Blue Chips, Techs Lead Stock Market Rebound But Face These Tests; These Industries Mask Solid Leadership

The stock market was likely viewed as oversold after Friday's closing bell. So, Monday's gains likely surprised few. But while most of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) rebounded, tech stocks certainly did not rally alone.




In fact, Monday's action seemed to underline the ongoing process of money shifting more into industries and sectors that showed weak action vs. megacap techs in 2022 and 2023.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday finished 1.2% higher, barely half a step ahead of the Nasdaq composite's rounded-up 1.2% rise. The latter slid nearly 6% last week.


The S&P 500 matched the Nasdaq's rise, up 1.16%. Large caps outpaced gains by the Russell 2000, up less than 0.3%, and the S&P MidCap 400, which moved less than 0.5% higher.


With the exception of the Dow Jones, all of the above indexes are trading below their respective [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). That's not a healthy sign for the stock market today. You want to see the indexes hold above their 50-day lines and lead them higher.


Volume fell modestly on the Nasdaq vs. Friday and was virtually unchanged on the NYSE.

Stock Market Today
------------------



As a daily chart of the Nasdaq composite shows, Monday's rebound was a classic inside day. That is, the session's high and low were both within Friday's high and low. So while Monday's gain was decent, it does not at all cover over the ugliness of the index's sharp slide since its failed attempt to recover the 18,000 level amid the August rally.


The 50-day moving average of the Nasdaq is also in its third week of a gentle decline. The longer-term 200-day line continues to rise. For chartists, an index trading in between the two moving averages arguably makes the near-term price trend opaque.


A look at the [top industry groups on Monday](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) finds a few technology groups among the 17 that rose 2% or more. Computer hardware, media software, fabless semiconductors and computer networking stocks rallied well. But so did dairy, steel alloy, drugstore, nonalcoholic beverage, superregional bank and shoe stocks. The [Monday episode of "IBD Live"](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) offered a detailed look at industry group and sector action over the past week.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP090924-240x300.jpg)Look again at the points-based Dow industrials, and the top four advancers all came from the finance sector. Among these four, **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) has the best combination of Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength ratings (93 and 90, respectively). AmEx has made only a little progress since its latest breakout. However, the credit and charge card services titan has rolled 43% higher since it surpassed a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and its 175.31 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in December.


Chip stocks had been an important part of the stock market strength during the last two months of 2023 and the first half 2024. Today, many are struggling to bottom out after deep declines in July and August.


Van Eck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) represents the latest fortunes of many in the chip sector. The ETF rallied 2.3%, much higher than the indexes' rebound on Monday. However, the fund had tumbled 12% over the prior four sessions. The ETF failed to climb back above its own 50-day moving average in the middle of August, a negative sign. Today, it's still trying to bottom out. VanEck Semiconductor's current test of the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) is critical.


That said, despite the big summer slide, VanEck Semiconductor still boasts a stout 25.7% gain year to date, vs. an 8.3% advance by the Dow Jones industrials.

Are These Stocks And Industry Groups The New Leaders?
-----------------------------------------------------


But nontech sectors are catching up with techs in the stock market. The Dow Jones utility average, a 1.1% gainer on Monday, extended its year-to-date advance to 17.9%. In 2023, the Dow utilities fell 8.9%, excluding dividends.


**American Electric Power** ([AEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEP)) rose 1.6% and served as a showcase in one of [IBD's daily newsletters](https://www.investors.com/).


The restaurant group has seen its year-to-date gain shrink to under 15% in recent days. Hence, headed into Monday's action, the group (symbol G5812 in [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF)) ranked a lowly [144th among 197 industries for six-month relative performance](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-sep-06-2024/).Â However, the restaurant group also disguises the fact that **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) represents the group as a [true stock market leader](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) and among [newer issues in the stock market](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).



Cava has gained 45% since it burst above both the 50-day moving average and 10-week line on Aug. 9, delivering an [aggressive follow-on entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Ten sessions later, shares soared 19% on a solid Q2 report that saw earnings nearly treble to 17 cents a share, up 183% vs. a year earlier. Sales ramped up 35% to $234 million, the second-highest amount of quarterly sales in company history.


Watch to see if the stock makes a test of the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). For active traders, a bullish bounce off the 21-day line could provide a secondary entry.


As a weekly chart shows, Cava has nearly tripled since it crossed a nearly six-month trendline near 44 during the week ended Jan. 19.


Looking more broadly at retail, Placer.ai notes in its latest August report on back-to-school spending among the nation's top indoor malls, open-air shopping centers (OASCs) and outlet malls that foot traffic stepped higher. At indoor malls, foot traffic grew a healthy 7.3% vs. August 2023. Outlet malls saw visits rise 6.1%, while OASCs experienced a 5.8% increase. Strong foot traffic could help boost sales at adjacent eateries.

New Issues Watch
----------------


Among other new issues, keep an eye on **Lineage** ([LINE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LINE)). The expert in cold storage is trading at the low end of its trading range, but remains above its IPO pricing at $78 a share. Also, the new issue is part of a property REIT group that ranks much more highly than restaurants and many technology industries. It stands at No. 33 among 197 industry groups, according to MarketSurge.


In the same group, **American Healthcare** ([AHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AHR)) has been on a big spurt since it rallied off its 10-week line at 14.52 in early July. Shares have gotten way extended. The owner and operator of an array of health care facilities shows an annualized dividend yield of 4.5%. The company went public in February at $12 a share.


Outside the stock market, the yield on the 10-year benchmark U.S. government note edged down 1 basis point to 3.69%.

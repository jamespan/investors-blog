Stock Market Powers Higher In First Rally Of 2023; These Groups Fare Best
==========================================================================

The stock market bulls flexed their muscles for the first time in earnest this year as indexes closed with mighty gains Friday.




The S&P 500 ended the trading day with a stout gain of 2.3%. The benchmark index is now within striking distance of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Retaking the key benchmark would add credibility to the rally.


The Nasdaq composite fared even better as it vaulted 2.6%. The tech-heavy index has much work to do following its painful losses of 2022. It sits 2.8% below its 50-day line and 9.8% below the 200-day moving average. [Overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) could be an issue here.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to look the strongest of the major stock market indexes. It closed the day up about 700 points, or 2.1%. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were among the best performers.


Small caps also managed to shine, with the Russell 2000 rising 2.3%. But the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lagged even as it rose 1.4%.


Market Outlook Changes Amid Economic Data
-----------------------------------------


Volume was up on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. Thursday. Advancers also vastly outnumbered decliners on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP010623_1-300x269.jpg)The positive action in high volume has caused the IBD market outlook to switch to "market in confirmed uptrend." Nevertheless, it is still an uncertain environment, and exposure should be increased in a measured fashion. Investors should stick to 20% to 40% exposure for now.


Stocks were aided by a one-two punch of economic data. First, while nonfarm payrolls rose by 223,000 in December, above estimates for 200,000, wage gains were lighter than expected. Average hourly earnings rose 4.6% vs. a year ago, while analysts had expected a 5% pop.


In addition, the Institute of Supply Management's services index flashed a contractionary reading below 50 for the first time since May 2020. This surprisingly weak result increased the odds of a smaller-than-expected rate hike at the Feb. 1 Fed meeting.


The 10-year Treasury yield fell 15 basis points to 3.57%.


Several stocks topped buy points, including **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)), **Aflac** ([AFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFL)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)). But all lacked strong volume, introducing doubts for the stocks that could lead the new market uptrend.

These Groups Shine As Stock Market Flexes Muscles
-------------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors all ended the session in positive territory. Materials and technology were the best areas while health made the slimmest gains.


Performance of the IBD industry groups added further context.


Beaten down fabless and equipment chip stocks were two of the brightest performers. Coal plays and major discount chains also performed well. The latter group was bolstered by a strong sales report from **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)).


Only three groups ended the day in negative territory, such was the strength of the rally. Transportation equipment manufacturers, medical research equipment and services plays, and computer game stocks fell.

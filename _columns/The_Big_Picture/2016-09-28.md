A big, hearty cup of Texas tea, anyone? Or, perhaps you prefer it Tehran or Riyadh style?


Either way, Wednesday's trading session proved that yes, in fact, OPEC still does matter.


Oil-related stocks of virtually all stripes, colors and sizes rallied hard on reports that the bigwigs of the decades-old [Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have agreed on a modest cut in production](https://www.investors.com/news/no-cut-seen-in-algiers-but-saudi-arabia-ok-with-conditions-for-iran/) -- around 700,000 barrels per day -- to boost the price of crude oil. It's set to be the first such agreement since 2008, according to Reuters.


West Texas Intermediate crude oil, a closely followed benchmark of the so-called "black gold," gushed more than 5% higher and past $47 a barrel for the first time since Sept. 8. While that price is still a mere fraction of the incredible peak of around $147 back in June 2008, current prices reflect a gain of about 6% over the past 12 months.


![mp092816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MP092816-185x300.jpg)IBD's Oil & Gas-Drilling industry group soared more than 8%; exploration and production companies from the U.S., Canada and abroad all surged more than 6% as a group.


The major indexes could not keep up. The S&P 500 rose 0.5%, better than the Nasdaq composite's 0.2% gain.


Volume rose on both main exchanges, influenced in large part by a rush of institutional buying, perhaps mixed in with some healthy short covering, in the energy patch.


Take **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), a former superstar during the 2003-07 bull run. The Oklahoma City firm raced more than 8% higher to 48.13 in volume that expanded 125% above its 50-day average of 2.8 million shares. The stock rebounded back above its 50-day moving average, a positive sign that institutional buying is still healthy, even if the stock has not made a successful breakout yet this year.


Continental has roughly 23 million of its shares shorted as of Sept. 15, a whopping 27% of the stock's 86-million-share float.


The Dow Jones industrials gained 0.6%, helped not only by its two energy components but also gains of 1 point or more by five other stocks, including **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) (up 3.71 to 86.59), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)).


Small caps, however, fared even better. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.9%. It continues to beat the S&P 500 in year-to-date performance (up 12.9% vs. up 6.2%, respectively, excluding dividends).


The strength across the oil and gas complex certainly boosted the technical picture of the market. On the NYSE, home of most oil companies, winners trounced losers by a 3-to-1 margin -- better than the nearly 3-to-2 ratio on the Nasdaq.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 climbed slightly back above its rising 50-day moving average (marked as a dotted line in the charts page as found in the link at the bottom of this article), which is what the bulls would like to see.


Watch the large-cap index's Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which through Tuesday's session was still slightly negative at C-. It's preferable for this rating to be a C+ or higher, which would indicate that large money managers are net buyers of stock over the past 13 weeks. The same principle applies to individual stocks. The Nasdaq's rating on Tuesday was at B-.


Is sector rotation going to intensify?


It seemed to look that way Wednesday. One reason why the Nasdaq could muster only a lowly gain could be found in the fact that restaurant, discount retail, apparel retail and retail auto parts chain stocks got roasted. Many of these groups now rank in the bottom quartile of IBD's daily rankings of 197 industry groups. A great stock relies a lot on the strength of its group and sector.


Indeed, the IBD 50 is not showing many stellar names in retail right now. Credit the gigantic influence that **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has had on consumer behavior for one. But both the top and bottom lines of many retailers have been quite dull, stemming from an economy stuck in small-growth mode and higher costs in the form of state-mandated minimum wage hikes. However, the IBD 50 does showcase a number of fast-growing consumer-oriented plays, including **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Activision-Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), China's **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and mortgage financing and refinancing play **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)).


At the same time, the IBD 50 isn't exactly chock-full of oil plays. But **Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)) may be in the midst of forming a new base. **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) made a normal pullback to both the 50-day moving average and its recent buy point of 171.98.


In the markets, as in life, sometimes you do get a second chance to buy right.

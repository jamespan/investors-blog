The stock market closed at record levels Friday after the latest jobs report boosted hopes of interest rate cuts. Now a congressional appearance by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the start of a new earnings season loom in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite rose 0.9% to notch a closing all-time high. It sits clear of short-term moving averages and is more than 8% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The index turned in its fifth weekly gain in a row with a 3.5% lift. Further, the tech-heavy composite is now up 22.3% for the year so far.


The S&P 500 also sits at new highs after climbing 0.5% Friday. The benchmark index has risen four out of the past five weeks after turning in a weekly rise of 2%. It has climbed nearly 5% above its 50-day line and holds a gain of nearly 17% so far in 2024.


Decliners ended with a slender edge on advancers on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Friday. Volume was higher on both.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other two major indexes, though it did manage to squeeze out a 0.2% gain. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were two of the strongest components while **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) had the toughest session amid energy weakness.


Small caps closed off session lows, but the Russell 2000 still fell 0.5%. Growth stocks fared better on the stock market, with the Innovator IBD 50 exchange traded fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 0.5%.


Jobs Report Boosts Rate Hopes
-----------------------------


The latest jobs report bolstered hopes of a Fed interest rate cut. The U.S. economy added 206,000 jobs in June, which topped economists' 189,000 forecast, according to Econoday. But the unemployment rate surprised by rising to 4.1% in June from 4.0%, thus tying for the highest level since October of 2021.

This uptick technically triggered the Sahm Rule, as the moving average of the unemployment rate over the last three months rose 50 basis points above the July 2023 trough of 3.5%. This is a gauge developed by former Fed economist Claudia Sahm which uses increases in the unemployment rate to predict a recession. However, its reliability could be blunted by the current unusual economic environment.


There were also some revisions to prior reports worth noting. Job gains in May were lowered to 218,000 from an original 272,000 and April's gain was reduced to 108,000 from 165,000.


Treasury yields responded to the report, with the 10-year Treasury note falling seven basis points to 4.28% and the two-year slipping nine basis points to 4.6%.


What's Next: Powell And Inflation Data
--------------------------------------


Economic events are certainly not taking a summer vacation, with a number of noteworthy events coming for the stock market in the week ahead.


Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is to appear before Congress Tuesday and Wednesday. He will first answer questions at a U.S. Senate session before he visits the Republican-controlled House the following day.


The biggest economic data of the week comes Thursday, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics delivers the latest Consumer Price Index report. Economists see headline CPI slowing to 3% year-over-year growth. Core CPI, in contrast, is expected to hold steady at annualized growth of 3.4%. Producer price index data is due Friday.


Meanwhile, [a new earnings season is set to get underway](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-jpmorgan-shoots-higher-q2-earnings-report/) with a slew of big bank earnings reports. Major lenders **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) are all due to deliver quarterly results Friday.

Smell Of Success For This Stock Market Group
--------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) in mostly positive territory. Communication services and consumer staples were the strongest areas while energy and industrials struggled most.



As ever, the performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups offered a more nuanced insight into the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Consumer electronics products firms, major discount chains, gold stocks and diversified medical plays were outstanding. Internet content plays were also strong, with exposure to **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) being [raised on IBD Leaderboard Friday](/?src=aurljhh#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as it reclaimed a prior 514.01 entry with conviction.


In contrast, metal products distributors, coal stocks, airlines and solar plays were among the stock market laggards.

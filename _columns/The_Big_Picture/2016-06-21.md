Large-Cap Issues Lead Mild Up Day As Stock Bulls Chew On Yellen Talk
=====================================================================

While the gap was rather subtle, large caps beat small caps Tuesday.


Overall, the stock market trudged higher in lower volume, unfazed by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that reaffirmed investors' belief that she no longer sees an urgent move on raising the cost of money.


Stocks fell last week after the Fed decided to stay put on current interest-rate levels, expressing serious concerns about international developments, weakening growth in the labor market and subpar inflation numbers.


The slower turnover also reflected portfolio managers' desire to wait for one of the biggest political events of the year: whether the British on Thursday will vote themselves in or out of the EU.


![MP062116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP062116-177x300.jpg)The S&P 500 added to Monday's 0.6% advance with a 0.3% gain. But the small-cap S&P 600 lost more than 0.2%.


The Nasdaq composite rose slightly more than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq 100 -- tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange -- added 0.3%. Yet breadth was negative, as losing stocks beat winners on the Nasdaq by a nearly 3-2 ratio.


A broad rally in the energy sector, save coal miners, helped the NYSE composite rise 0.4%. At 10490, the index holds a 3.4% year-to-date gain.


The Nasdaq is down almost 3.3% since Jan. 1. The S&P 500 is up 2.2%.


Technically speaking, the Nasdaq seems to want to rally. Yet the index finished Tuesday's session lodged within a narrow space between its 50-day moving average, which has flattened out, and its longer-term 200-day moving average (slightly tilting higher). (You can see both moving averages of the Nasdaq on an IBD [daily chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) by going to the Research tab on the Investors.com home page. The 50-day line is painted in red, the 200-day line black.)


In a healthy bull market, you tend to see a key index rise smoothly up in price, well ahead of its 50-day moving average, which in turn is above the slower-moving 200-day line. The last time that happened? Go to the IBD's big daily chart (see the link below) and you'll see it was roughly the eight months of time that followed a pivotal follow-through rally that took place on Oct. 21, 2014.


On that session, the Nasdaq composite roared 2.4% ahead in higher volume vs. the prior day. That one session told disciplined chart readers that a big rally was possibly underway. While the rally featured some pullbacks, the action in the Nasdaq was smooth. It found buying support along the 50-day line. Former market leaders such as **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) and **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) spurted to new highs.


Since June of last year, however, the market action has been bumpy. The swings lower reflect the turmoil in the crude oil markets, a slowing Chinese economy and threats of a global deflationary spiral. On Wednesday, the drop in crude oil futures did not deter buying in oil drilling, exploration, pipeline and refining stocks. No doubt, crude oil remains in a budding uptrend since its February lows.


Some defensive sectors also paced Tuesday's upside, including wireless telecom service, meat and packaged-food stocks.

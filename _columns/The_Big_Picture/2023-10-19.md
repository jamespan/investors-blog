The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended sharply lower Thursday, as Wall Street digested Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's midday comments. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a new 16-year high.




[Powell delivered remarks](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-chair-powell-strikes-a-balance-as-10-year-treasury-yield-faces-these-risks/) at the Economic Club of New York at noon ET. Powell said more tightening could be warranted if the recent run of strong economic data continues, but also noted that "financial conditions have tightened significantly" with the rise of long-term bond yields.


Powell committed to "proceeding carefully," signaling no rush to hike again. In the discussion that followed his opening remarks, Powell discussed the unexpected degree of economic strength. "It may just be that rates haven't been high enough for long enough."

Economic Data, Earnings Reports
-------------------------------


Ahead of Thursday's stock market open, the Labor Department said that jobless claims last week fell by 13,000 to 198,000. That was [below economist expectations of 211,000](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=556164&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) and reflected a job market that has yet to cool off significantly.


The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond settled at 4.98% Thursday, setting a fresh long-term high and extending this week's already-hefty gains.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP101923-229x300.jpg)On the earnings front, **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)), **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), along with **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), were key movers Thursday.


Alcoa declined 8.6%, while AT&T shares jumped 6.6%. And Lam shares tumbled more than 6%.


Netflix surged 16% after the [streaming giant](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-jumps-on-q3-subscriber-beat/) late Wednesday smashed expectations for new subscribers in the third quarter. NFLX stock closed right at its 50-day line.


Tesla stock dived 9.3% after the [EV leader reported](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-earnings-slide-37-cybertruck-coming-margins-bottomed/) worse-than-expected earnings and revenue late Wednesday. It also said Cybertruck deliveries will begin next month. However, CEO Elon Musk warned, "We dug our own grave with Cybertruck," saying that "there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive."


Musk continued, "I want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It's a great product, but financially it'll be 12 to 18 months to be a significant positive cash flow contributor."


TSLA stock is trying to find support around its long-term 200-day line, but a cup-with-handle base it was forming is now wrecked.

Dow Jones Today
---------------


On Thursday, indexes closed near session lows, finishing solidly in the red after a day of unusually high volatility.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 0.8%, while the S&P 500 lost close to 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1.5%, making its lowest close in more than a year.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That's another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for both the Nasdaq and S&P 500. So, that's four on the Nasdaq and two on the S&P 500.


In the Dow Jones Industrial Average, **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) was the best performer Thursday, rising 1.7% in sympathy with rival telecom AT&T. Still, Verizon shares remain around 30% off their 52-week high.


On the downside, Dow Jones insurer **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) sold off 2.5%, falling sharply for a second session. The firm reported earnings Wednesday.


Top growth stocks followed the market trend lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 2.3%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) inched higher, moving closer to a cup-with-handle's 90.73 buy point. The handle, however, is deeper than normal.


What To Do Now: Play Defense
----------------------------


Amid the recent weakness, IBD investors should remain very cautious about taking on new positions, with a recommended stock market exposure at a 0%-20% level.


In the meantime, look for new stock market leadership to emerge over the coming weeks if the Dow Jones and other indexes can stabilize. Watch for stocks holding up better than the broader market.


One way to do this is by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Keep an eye on stock charts in which the line is trending upward, which means the stock is outperforming the S&P.


The RS line is in all IBD charts and [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). In addition, the [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/) includes a list of top-rated stocks with lines at new highs. MarketSmith also has the ["RS Blue Line Dot" list](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/), which screens for RS lines at new highs.


A [MarketSmith list](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) to find stocks during market downturns is "Near Pivot." It shows stocks nearing buy points in bases.

Stock Market Leaders: Adobe, Meta, Palo Alto
--------------------------------------------



Some stocks are approaching new buy points during the weak stock market and should be followed closely.


[Adobe shares](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/adbe-stock-nears-buy-point-on-adobe-ai-news/) have formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 570.24, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. In a positive sign, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for ADBE stock is rising as it outperforms the S&P 500 index.


Meta stock is clinging to an early entry at 312.87 after Thursday's 1.3% drop. Shares are struggling to decisively move past a cup base's [standard buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 326.20.


Cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks gave up its 254.23 handle buy point during Thursday's 3.1% decline. The stock's RS line hit a new high this week.

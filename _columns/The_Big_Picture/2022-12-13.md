  Stock Market Soars, Then Fades, Despite Tame CPI; Attention Turns To Federal Reserve Meeting

The stock market got a hint that inflation was cooling when the producer price index was released late last week. Wall Street got more good news on the inflation front early Tuesday with the release of the consumer price index. But a bullish open for the major stock indexes closed with a whimper ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve announcement.




Consumer prices cooled in November but still rose 7.1%, vs. 7.7% in October. Core prices, which exclude food and energy costs, increased 6%, down slightly from October's 6.3% gain.


Investors flocked to bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 18 points to 3.43% early in the session. Just after 1 p.m. PT, the yield was well off lows, down 10 basis points to 3.51%.


When yields started soaring in August, the bond market was pricing in aggressive interest-rate hikes to combat inflation. But after four straight 75-basis-point hikes, the pace of rate hikes is expected to slow.


The Fed is widely expected to raise the federal funds rates by 50 basis points Wednesday to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Looking forward to the February meeting, the chances of a quarter-point hike increased to 53.3%, up from 35.1% Monday.


But the stock market flashed a clear message Tuesday: It's still worried about a recession next year. Inflation is still way too high for the Fed, which is still dealing with an extremely tight labor market and low unemployment. The Fed wants to see some softness in the labor market to help it fight inflation.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP121322-240x300.jpg)Tuesday's weak action was another reminder for investors to keep exposure limited at this point. You'll know when the stock market is acting healthier when growth screens start yielding more prospects. Even when the indexes were near highs early in the session, the crop of buy candidates was still on the light side.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.1% early, helped by a strong gain for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). But the blue-chip index faded off highs, closing with a gain of just 0.3%.


BA stock jumped 2.6% after **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) placed an order for at least 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. But Boeing ended with gain of just 0.5%, while UAL stock reversed sharply lower. IBD's airline group was one of the day's worst performers, down 3%.


The S&P 500 soared above its 200-day moving average and tried to move above its Dec. 1 high, rising 2.8% early. But sellers knocked the index off highs. The S&P 500 added 0.7%, closing below its 200-day line.


Winners beat losers on the NYSE by just over 2-to-1.

The Russell 2000 small-cap index also got turned away at its 200-day line in the stock market today. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) gave back a good chunk of a 3.3% early gain, closing up 0.4%.


The Nasdaq composite also tried to move above its Dec. 1 high, but a 3.8% gain faded to 1% by the close. Advancing stocks topped decliners by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq. Two [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the Nasdaq's count because the index rallied more than 5% from each distribution day (Dec. 6 and 9).


Oil and gas stocks outperformed as oil prices jumped. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas intermediate crude futures settled at $75.39 a barrel, up 3%. Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) was the second best gainer, up 1.9%. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) took the top spot, up 2.2%.


But if you're looking for actionable stocks in the energy patch, they're not easy to find. Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) and **SLB** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) jumped above their 50-day moving averages, rising 7.9% and 4%, respectively.


But after a higher-volume decline Friday, SLB has been rallying back in light volume. Halliburton's weekly chart shows a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) base with a 40.09 buy point, but the handle is flawed because of the stock's wild price action last week that saw shares crash 15%.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


Diabetes stock **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) outperformed in the MarketSmith Growth 250, rising 4%. The weekly chart shows a well-formed [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 320.10 entry.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)) outperformed after finding support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) Monday. But the 50-day line is below the stock's last buy point of 34.19. The 50-day line is normally a good place to add to a winning position, as long as the 50-day average is above the buy point.

**ChampionX** ([CHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHX)) is also bouncing off its 50-day line, but like Tenaris, the 50-day is below the last buy point.


A large number of top-rated stocks fell sharply and suffered violent outside days in heavy volume, including **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)), **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)), **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) and **Elevance Health** ([ELV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELV)).


And a few breakout attempts from the likes of **Calix** ([CALX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALX)), **Illinois Toolworks** ([ITW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITW)) and **Amdocs** ([DOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOX)) didn't look so great by the close.

  Blue Chips, Small Caps Lead Another Stock Market Rally, But New Buys Tougher To Find

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 small-cap index soared on the stock market Tuesday as Wall Street weighed better-than-expected retail sales in June and an upward revision to May data. Breadth was decidedly positive again, even though gains were much smaller for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite.




**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) were the standout performers on the Dow, helping lift the blue-chip index to a gain of 1.85% and another all-time closing high.


UnitedHealth marked its seventh straight gain after reporting [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-election-odds-health-care-stocks-unh-hca-cnc-unitedhealth-earnings/) before the open. Caterpillar extended its winning streak to five sessions as the stock approaches a 364.63 double-bottom entry.


Meanwhile, Boeing rallied nearly 4%, but it's still about 30% off its 52-week high. Shares are stuck on a downtrend and below their 200-day moving average.


Stock Market Today: Russell Surges Again
----------------------------------------


The Russell 2000 jumped another 3.5%, bringing its five-session gain to around 11.5%. According to Dow Jones data, it's the best five-session percentage gain for the small-cap index since April 29, 2020.

Before the open, June retail sales came in stronger than expected, while May data was revised higher. Investors bought bonds again, sending the 10-year Treasury lower by seven basis points to near 4.16% near 2 p.m. ET.


The Federal Reserve's next meeting is scheduled for July 30-31. The Fed is widely expected to leave the federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25% to 5.50%.


But [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) has pretty much baked in a quarter-point rate cut at the September meeting. After that, fed funds futures traders expect either one or two more cuts before the end of the year.


The Nasdaq composite edged higher by 0.2% on the stock market, and the S&P 500 rallied 0.6%. Volume was slightly higher on both exchanges.


Not So Magnificent
------------------


The Nasdaq performed well even though most [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) stocks closed lower. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was one of the rare bright spots, up 1.6%.


But names like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) closed with losses of 1% to 1.6%. Of the four, Meta is the laggard as it struggles for support at the 50-day line.


Tesla stock is in a new accumulation phase, refusing to give up much ground after soaring above its 200-day moving average earlier in the month. Tesla started showing the [Ants Indicator](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ants-indicator/) last week, helped by several above-average volume price gains.


Stock market breadth was about 3.5-to-1 positive on the Nasdaq and just over 4-to-1 positive on the New York Stock Exchange.


More Breakouts; Homebuilders Rally
----------------------------------


The session served up several more technical breakouts inside the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com). After a setup day Monday, barge operator **Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)) cleared a flat base with a 124.92 entry. The stock closed near its high, up nearly 5% in strong volume. It was a straightforward add to the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio in the morning, but several other breakouts weren't so clear-cut.


Homebuilders and building-related groups continued their powerful rally. IBD's homebuilder group jumped nearly 6% after surging nearly 10% last week.

After gapping above its 50-day line last week, **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) is still in buy range from a conventional entry of 122.72. But keep in mind that PulteGroup is up 16.2% over the past four sessions. **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) also gapped above its 50-day line last week, but after seven straight gains, the stock could use a breather as well.


In the construction products group, **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) extended gains and moved above a conventional entry of 452.87. But TopBuild also looks stretched after five straight gains and the stock now more than 15% above its 50-day line.


Stock Market: Avoid Runups
--------------------------


As always, investors should avoid chasing stocks that have run up quickly. There's a lot of them out there at this point. Out of the 16 stocks that appeared in the MarketSurge Growth 250 "Breaking Out Today" screen, very few names looked actionable because of strong moves before the actual breakout.


**Miller Industries** ([MLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLR)), up nearly 18% in the past five stock market sessions, topped a 61.87 entry. But it already looks extended.


Same with **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)), which also broke out Tuesday after five big gains in a row. United Rentals is up more than 18% over the past five trading sessions.


With the confirmed uptrend still intact, it makes sense to look for new stocks to buy. But it doesn't make sense targeting stocks that have run up a lot already.



In the Aerospace/Defense group, **Curtiss-Wright** ([CW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CW)) doesn't look extended. It's near the top of a flat base with a 286.65 entry.

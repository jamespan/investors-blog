U.S. stock indexes ignored a better-than-expected Q4 GDP figure Thursday, as stocks continued a baby-steps trend.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP033017.png)The Nasdaq edged up 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average echoed the gain. Volume rose slightly on both major exchanges.


The Feb. 23 distribution day fell off the Nasdaq's count. After 25 sessions, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current market conditions.


While the indexes have mostly been making small daily moves up or down this month, some areas of the market are showing strength.


The restaurant group pegged its 10th gain in 12 sessions, bringing the group's gain over that period to 5%.


Restaurants improved their standing among 197 industry groups from No. 100 six weeks ago to the high 50s intraday Thursday.


Ideally, it's best to buy stocks in the top 40 groups, but eateries may be worth watching.

Another angle related to restaurant stocks is the wider meaning. Gains among restaurants can point to an improving economy. On Thursday, the GDP report showed that consumer spending rose 3.5% in Q4, revised upward from 3%.


The overall number on fourth-quarter GDP was revised up from 1.9% to 2.1%. This was the last number on Q4 GDP until annual revisions are made in July.


Meanwhile, banks may have turned a corner on their recent pullback. The PowerShares KBW Bank ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)) exchange-traded fund popped 1.8% Thursday, on track to end a three-week losing streak.


Earlier in March, there were a handful of bank stocks in the Big Cap 20, including **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)). Recently there have been none.


But money center Morgan Stanley closed high in the day's range Monday and then added gains of 2.2%, 0.7% and 1.5%.


Superregional bank KeyCorp showed similar action, closing high in Monday's range and then rising 1.8%, 0.1% and 2.7%.


Five of the top six groups Thursday were either banks or financials. Outside the top six, the investment bank, life insurance, commercial loan and Northeast bank industry groups also rallied more than 1% for the day.


Homebuilders, which moved from No. 92 six weeks ago to No. 19 going into Thursday's session, gained 1% Thursday.


Many homebuilders are too extended to buy now. Only a few are still in or approaching buy ranges. They include **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), less than a buck under a 34.15 buy point; **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)), which is in the 5% buy zone from a 21.14 buy point; and **William Lyon Homes** ([WLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLH)), a thin stock that completed a cup-with-handle pattern.


When many stocks in a group are extended, one way to gain exposure is through exchange traded funds. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ([XHB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XHB)) cleared a handle at 34.75 in December, and then formed a shallow, three-month consolidation. The ETF stands 3.5% above the high of that consolidation.


An individual investor who missed the best breakouts in the homebuilder group might use the ETF as a halfway house. When the stock of choice forms a new entry, the ETF money can be transferred to something more aggressive.


The problem now is that the market itself is acting more passive than aggressive.


Earnings season, which will get underway in early-to-mid-April, could be the catalyst. Some market watchers have been lowering their expectations for Q1 earnings. If earnings are stronger than expected, this could set up more beats. But if the lowered expectations prove either correct or worse than correct, then the market could be in for trouble.

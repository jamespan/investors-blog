title: These Two Signs Made For A Bearish Day For Stocks

Amid a disappointing reversal, perhaps the most significant thing the stock market did Tuesday was what it didn't do.




The S&P 500 climbed to a new high past 2,477 at midday as it tried to clear a nearly two-week span of dull, horizontal price movements. But moments later, the index slid right back into its flat trend, forsaking the chance to hold at new highs.


The S&P 500 closed with a loss of 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite also made a bearish reversal. The Nasdaq, which had been up 0.6%, fell 0.2% as well.


Losses were minor, but the way in which they surrendered gains was disheartening. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. That's a sign of institutional-sized selling. In fact, the day's results left the Nasdaq and S&P with a new [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), a second bad sign.


That's a total of five distribution days for the Nasdaq — a bit much, especially for a market stuck in a rut. However, among those five instances of heavy professional selling, the worst decline was the 0.6% drop on July 27.


The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1%. The blue chip index marked the 10th straight day of posting a new high, a period in which the industrials have separated themselves from the slumbering Nasdaq and S&P. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.3%.

The most recent was July 27, when the composite slid 0.6% in another bearish reversal. The Nasdaq started rebounding quickly from earlier sell-offs, but this time the index has lagged. It is basically at the 6,382 level where it closed on July 27.


Most leading stocks are not under duress, so investors don't have to run for the cover of cash. But caution is wise.


There have been some earnings-related plunges that left several leaders badly damaged, such as **Applied Optoelectronics** ([AAOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAOI)), **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and **Idexx Labs** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)).


North Korea's nuclear missile program seemed to strike fear into Wall Street on Tuesday. The afternoon selling came as President Trump sternly warned Pyongyang. "North Korea had best not make any more threats to the United States," Trump said. "They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."


While Tuesday's reversal left a bad mark on charts, the indexes remain unusually calm on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis.


"The VIX, which measures the expected volatility in S&P 500 options over the next 30 days, has averaged just 11.3 so far this year — down 28% from last year and 65% lower than in 2008," David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds, wrote in a report Monday. The low VIX reflects a quiet market. "So far this year, the average daily move in the S&P 500 up or down has been just 0.3% compared to 0.58% last year and a peak of 1.74% in 2008."


Low volatility is a sign of dangerous market complacency. But Kelley added that a stable macro economy and low interest-rate volatility have supported low stock market volatility.



Food, energy and some retail industry groups were among a varied list of worst-performing groups. Automakers were up more than 3%, but **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) influenced the price-weighted group as shares of the electric car maker rose 2.8% to 365.27. Tesla is forming the right side of a base.


**Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) broke out of a cup-without-handle base. Shares topped the 39.88 buy point in heavy volume.


**KLX** ([KLXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLXI)) broke out of a flat base after company executives gave a presentation to investors at a Jefferies conference this morning. Shares surged past the 53.23 buy point in heavy volume for the provider of oil products and services, and aerospace hardware and consumables. KLX, based in Wellington, Fla., trades just 384,000 shares on average. The typical dollar volume of $20 million is more encouraging.

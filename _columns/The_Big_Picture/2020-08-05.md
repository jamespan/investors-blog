The stock market rally continued Wednesday, with small caps leading the charge, and the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 marking fresh highs. The composite briefly topped the 11,000 level, while the Nasdaq 100 closed above 11,000 for the third straight session.




The Russell 2000 small-cap index fared the best, up 1.9%. But the Dow Jones industrials also performed well, up 1.4%. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) led the blue-chip index. Disney gapped bullishly above its 200-day moving average after the company reported earnings and announced some unexpected [streaming news](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-breaks-out-mulan-premieres-disneyplus-star-launch/). Nike jumped above its 50-day line, but it still has work to do to get to a 104.79 entry.


The S&P 500 rallied 0.6% and the Nasdaq composite added 0.5%. Nasdaq volume rose, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly higher than Tuesday.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose for the sixth straight session, up 0.7%. It's closing in quickly on its all-time high of 38.79 set in October 2018.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP080520-198x300.jpg)Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) is consolidating nicely above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/). **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) is also making a solid test of its 10-week line after a few tests already. Small-cap **Focus Financial Partners** ([FOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOCS)) is in position for a breakout from a [shelf-type structure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-shelf-pattern-and-why-it-is-perfect-pyramiding-tool-in-growth-stocks/) with a 39.43 entry. Shares closed at 39.17, up nearly 6%. Focus Financial reports earnings Thursday morning.


The stock market shrugged off a weak ADP employment report that showed private payrolls up just 167,000 in July. That was well below the consensus estimate of 1.89 million, but the consensus range was very wide, ranging from 750,000 to 3.3 million. A bright spot in the report was that payroll growth in June was revised sharply higher to 4.3 million from 2.37 million.


Friday's jobs report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up 2 million in July after the economy created 4.8 million jobs in June. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.5% from 11.1%.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


Despite some yellow flags, the confirmed uptrend still looks good, especially since a few [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) fell off the count Wednesday. The S&P 500 lost two distribution days (July 9 and July 13) because the index rallied 5% from the closing prices on both of those days. The July 23 distribution day count fell of the Nasdaq for the same reason.


The Nasdaq composite needs to get up to around 11,200 to get to the top of its upper channel line. Since the Nasdaq's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on April 6, the index has pulled back several times when it got near or above its channel line. The Nasdaq soared above its upper channel line on July 13 before reversing sharply lower in higher volume.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones and Russell 2000 could be ready to join the breakout party soon. SPDR Dow Jones ETF ([DIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIA)) broke out over a trend line Wednesday and now has its sights set on its June 6 high of 276.38. And don't forget about the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), which topped a 153.49 buy point Wednesday.



With the stock market still in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), it still makes sense to look for new buys. But rather than limit your search to stocks building bases, also look for big leaders pulling back to their 10-week lines for the first time after a breakout. A bounce for **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) off the 10-week line, for example, would put the stock in an alternate buy zone.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) had a hard time getting going after a July 20 breakout over a 324.86 buy point, but the stock strengthened Wednesday, rising nearly 4% to 340.42.

Stock Market Movers
-------------------


A big merger made early headline when **Teladoc Health** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) announced plans to buy **Livongo Health** ([LVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVGO)) for $18.5 billion. But [Wall Street gave the deal a thumbs-down](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/telemedicine-teladoc-livongo-merge-tdoc-stock-lvgo-stock-record-highs/), sending Teladoc shares lower by 19%. Livongo slumped 11%.

**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) reclaimed a 316.16 buy point with conviction, soaring 4% to 328. It closed near the top of the 5% buy zone. Mastercard is tracked in IBD's credit card and payment processors industry group, which rallied 3%. **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) was another strong gainer in the group, up 7%, on strong Q2 results.


Two stocks followed through bullishly after strong breakouts Tuesday. **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)) jumped nearly 8% after soaring past a 43.45 buy point Tuesday, and **Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) extended gains after a breakout from a cup with handle base Tuesday. It cleared another buy point on its weekly chart at 70.46. IBD 50 stock **Berry Global** ([BERY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BERY)) rose for the fourth straight session and is extended from a breakout Friday.

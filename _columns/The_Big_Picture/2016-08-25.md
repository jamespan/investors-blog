Stock Indexes Ease; Will Yellen And GDP Move Market?

U.S. stock indexes Thursday did nothing to ease the previous session's pain, but hesitation was understandable considering Friday's news and data lineup.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 sanded off 0.1%, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.2%. The IBD 50 slipped 0.1%. Volume fell across the board.


The drop marked the first time the Nasdaq fell two days in a row since the Brexit-vote fallout in late June.


The July 21 **[distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764)** fell off the count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 because of time. Once a distribution day is more than five weeks old, it is irrelevant to current conditions.


![MP082516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP082516-193x300.jpg)Volume this week has been below average, perhaps because of Friday's calendar.


Before Friday's open, the second take on second-quarter GDP will be released. The Street expects a downward revision from 1.2% to 1.1%. This would be a break from the recent trend. In each of the previous four quarters, the second reading was higher than the initial number.


Uncertainty surrounds the GDP report because it isn't clear what the Street wants. A strong number could revive fears of an interest-rate hike. A weak number could either be reassuring from the interest-rate angle or be worrisome regarding the economy's health.


The economic summit in Jackson Hole, Wyo., could provide clarity. **[Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen will start her speech](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/will-yellen-upset-bond-markets-new-jedi-like-fed-calm/)** a half-hour after Friday's open.


Data reported Thursday were encouraging. **[Durable-goods orders for July](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/july-durable-goods-orders-jump-4-4-business-investment-steps-up/)** jumped 4.4%, easily topping the Street's consensus target of 3.7%. First-time jobless claims were fewer than expected.


But the bigger news is on Friday's plate.


If GDP growth is dramatically stronger than expected or the Fed hints at a rate hike, which stocks would likely benefit from higher rates and which would likely struggle?


Banks are the most likely sector to benefit, since higher rates could improve net margins.


Utilities would be expected to struggle, since the group's dividend yields might look less juicy compared with Treasuries. Also, in a risk-on environment, some utility money might be redeployed into more aggressive vehicles. Utilities must compete with overall expected returns, not just other dividend or interest-paying vehicles.


Some rotation is already happening. The bank sector led the new highs list in 13 of the 14 sessions through Wednesday.


The utility sector hasn't led the new high list since June 27, when the market pegged a short-term bottom and began rising.


For growth investors, this is a welcome development. There aren't too many vigorous uptrends led by utilities. Likewise, there aren't too many vigorous uptrends that lack bank participation.


At this juncture, most bank stocks lack the proper mix of strong fundamentals and attractive chart action. A watch list might be more useful than forcing a buy to gain exposure to banks.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq's streak of eight up weeks in a row appears in jeopardy. Can anything be made of this?


In the past 40 years, the Nasdaq has strung together weekly win streaks of eight weeks or more 18 times. Eight times the streak ended at eight. Ten times the streak continued to nine, 10 or 11 weeks.


What happened after the streak ended?


A reasonable guess might be that a well-overdue pullback was in order, but generally that hasn't been the case. Here's what history shows:


* 50% of the time, a brief and shallow pullback gave way to additional bullish gains that investors would not have wanted to miss.
* 33% of the time, choppy sideways action followed the end of the win streak.
* 17% of the time, an ugly losing streak followed.


Given that mixed history, individual investors should avoid the temptation to guess. Watch the price and volume action of the indexes closely and stay flexible.


After the close, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) topped the Street's views on earnings and revenue. Earnings popped 24%, while revenue grew 22%. **[Guidance for Q3 was on the light side](https://www.investors.com/news/ulta-beauty-reports-earnings/)**. In after-hours trade, the stock dipped about 5% but then cut the loss to 2%.

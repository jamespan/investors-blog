Market indexes caught a tailwind Friday, retaking their 50-day moving averages a day after losing the lines.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 added 1% and 0.9% respectively, while the IBD 50 rose 0.9%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

Buying intensified in the afternoon without any clear news or catalyst. While bulls welcomed the price gains, the market's condition didn't change.

  

The uptrend is under pressure, and caution is in order.

  

Given the lack of clarity, this is a good time to check the gauges on IBD's instrument panel.

  

The Market Pulse at right is the main gauge, and the yellow caution light is on with the uptrend under pressure. Secondary gauges are mixed:

  

• **New highs and lows**: The new lows are in triple digits (see Page B7) and are dominating the new highs tally, not a good sign.

  

• **Sector Leaders**: This is IBD's most demanding screen. Fourteen stocks made the screen (see B7), which is encouraging.

  

• **NYSE advance-decline line**: This one has been fading for about four weeks. This year, the line's downtrends have lasted no more than five weeks (see B9).

  

• **IBD Mutual Fund Index**: This one has also been retreating for about four weeks (see B9), which is close to its prior 2014 declines.

  

• **Industry groups**: Fast risers include consumer products, biomeds, security software, steel, apparel makers and retail apparel (see B9), a good mix.

  

• **The 200-day gauge**: The percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day lines (see B14) dropped to 43% in Friday's IBD. That's a low level for this year but still well above the 13% at the bottom of the 2011 correction.

  

• **Bulls vs. bears**: The percentage of bullish advisers fell from 52.5% to 48% (see B17), an improvement. The level of bears is at 15.3%, an extremely low level. You prefer to see less extreme bullish sentiment .

  

• **NYSE short interest ratio**: It hit a five-year high of 5.51 on Sept. 18. It since has eased, but the reading remains high (see B17). This contradicts the bulls vs. bears message. It suggests that the wall of worry is high, which is healthy.

  

• **Put-call ratio**: The gauge closed at 1.11 Thursday and 1.02 Friday (see B9), levels often seen near short-term bottoms.

  

• **Buy triggers**: The pace has slowed, but on Friday **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and **Polaris Industries** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) broke out and **Under Armour**'s ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) strong bounce off its 50-day line set a buy zone.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq lost 1.5%. The IBD 50 and the S&P 500 fell 1.4%.

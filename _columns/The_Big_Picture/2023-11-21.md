  Stock Market Falls As Indexes Reach This Curious Signal; Nvidia Offers No Help

Stock market bulls relented a little Tuesday, as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell for only the third time in the past 17 sessions. By one measure, however, the market is overextended.




Index losses were moderate, and nothing to really shake the stock market from its powerful uptrend.


The Nasdaq cut its loss by about half, closing 0.6% lower. The S&P 500 lost 0.2% after being down as much as 0.5%. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) — a big component of both indexes and flag-bearer of the AI movement — fell 1% after hours following the company's earnings report.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% also and held above the 35,000 level.


But small caps got hurt the most. The Russell 2000 slid 1.3%. While other indexes trimmed losses into the close, the Russell only grew worse and closed at the day's lows. Indeed, the small-cap benchmark has looked shaky after it hit resistance at the 200-day moving average Nov. 15.


Stock Market Need More Rest?
----------------------------


The IBD 50 fell 0.4%. In the index, **Miniso Group** ([MNSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNSO)) fell nearly 10% and **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) nearly 5%.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP-112123-222x300.jpg)Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq, so institutions appeared restrained in their selling. Decliners beat advancers by roughly a 2-1 ratio on the NYSE and Nasdaq.


While the stock market is in a bullish phase, a proper rest seems almost necessary. The S&P 500 is 4.5% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/), the largest gap since the index made a closing peak July 31. The Nasdaq also is at the widest gap above its 50-day average since the late-July top.


The CBOE Market Volatility Index, or VIX, is near the lows of the year, which could signal a market turn. Three times this year, the VIX has closed below 13. When it happened in June, the stock market started climbing. But in late July and mid-September, it marked a market top. The index closed at 13.35 Tuesday.


Stock Market Parses Fed Minutes
-------------------------------


Minutes of the Fed's Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting demonstrated [continued support for keeping interest rates high](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-meeting-minutes-release-today-5c8a7acf?mod=hp_LEAD_4). Policymakers saw no conclusive sign that inflation is heading to the Fed's 2% target. Yet, they also acknowledged that the lagging effect of higher rates poses a risk to the economy.


The 10-year Treasury yield came off its session high after the minutes were released. Its benchmark yield was nearly unchanged from Monday at 4.417% late Tuesday.


Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, said in an analysis that the Fed's messaging runs counter to a stock market that seems convinced that the central bank is done raising rates.


"The disconnect perhaps between a market that has made up its mind that Fed implicitly — if not explicitly — declared a 'dovish pivot' at its last meeting, and that a more distinct slowdown in economic growth would demand interest rate cuts by the summer of 2024," she said. "Still, the market believes that the Fed is finished and that the economy will require help with rate cuts in 2024, regardless of the Fed's messaging."


Retail Reports Shake Investors
------------------------------


A batch of retail earnings reports left a lukewarm outlook on U.S. consumers.


**Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) missed sales expectations for its October-ended quarter and [gave a disappointing outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/bby-stock-best-buy-gives-cautious-outlook/) for the holiday quarter. **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) dropped after [same-stores decreased more than expected](https://www.investors.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-leads-retail-earnings-rally-lowes-takes-a-dive-ahead-of-holiday-shopping-season/).


**Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) reversed higher after reporting earnings. But **American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)) gapped below its 50-day moving average in heavy trading. The 15.8% drop wiped out all gains from a 16.25 handle buy point. Those are [sell signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), even if the apparel chain beat quarterly expectations and gave positive guidance.


**Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) and **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) fell less than 2% after they also announced results.


**Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) and **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) climbed after both reporting better-than-expected Q3 earnings and gave optimistic views on the holiday season. Burlington's 20.7% surge was the largest one-day gain in the retailer's history, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


**SPDR S&P Retail ETF** ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) pared losses and closed 0.3% lower but still above its 200-day moving average.

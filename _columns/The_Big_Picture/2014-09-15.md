The broad S&P 500 and NYSE composite traded quietly and in a tight range Monday, but it was a completely different story on the Nasdaq as profit-taking hit several leading growth stocks.

  

The tech-heavy index fell 1.1% in higher volume, registering its third distribution day in five days and fourth since its Aug. 13 follow-through. The rapid rise in distribution and selling in leading stocks means the market uptrend is now under pressure.

  

Cold comfort was that selling was muted in the rest of the market. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% and the NYSE composite eased a fraction. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3% as the market turned its attention to more-defensive names. NYSE volume fell from Friday's level.

  

The Nasdaq 100 gave up 1%, but it could've been a lot worse if not for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Its shares rose 1% early, but the stock ended mostly unchanged after the company said first-day preorders for the iPhone 6 topped 4 million, about double the number for the iPhone 5 in 2012.

  

Some of the Nasdaq 100's biggest percentage decliners included **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)).

  

Tesla crashed 9% in heavy volume. Before the open, Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating but removed its 320 price target. Tesla closed just above its 50-day moving average.

  

Sellers were in the biotech group again. **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) slumped 2% in higher volume. It closed just below its 50-day moving average. Leading growth stocks aren't rolling over left and right, but they are showing signs of wear and tear. The IBD 50 lost 1.5% Monday on the heels of Friday's 1.2% decline.

  

Meanwhile, fear is still not rampant in the market. The put/call volume ratio came in at 0.88 â€” nowhere near the readings that would indicate excessive fear and that have been seen at market bottoms in the past. The ratio was 0.78 when the Nasdaq marked its most recent distribution day on Sept. 9.

  

Volume was expected to come back into the market after Labor Day. It has, but those looking for fresh signs of institutional buying have been left largely disappointed. Chart breakdowns in leading stocks aren't widespread, but the market has given individual investors plenty of reason to be defensive with current holdings at this point.

  

It's not prudent at this point to be patient with new buys that aren't working. Take some modest gains, if you have them.

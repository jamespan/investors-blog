Stock Indexes Take Small Steps But Restaurant Issues Heat Up

Stock indexes took small steps Thursday, but the technical drag on the market lightened.


The Nasdaq added 0.4%, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.1%. The IBD 50 tacked on 0.3%.


Volume fell across the board.


Time and the day's action improved the market's distribution-day count. The S&P 500 lost its Jan. 13 distribution day because of time. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer part of current conditions.


The Nasdaq lost two distribution days — Jan. 28 and Jan. 30 — because of price gains. IBD research shows that price gains can erase the effects of distribution.


Distribution is a significant loss in a major index in rising volume. It points to institutional selling.


The lighter distribution count creates the potential for a better investing climate.


Why only potential?


In past uptrends, new distribution sometimes was added soon after old distribution expired. For example, on Dec. 10 and Dec. 30, distribution was added the same day an old day expired.


Individual investors should watch the market carefully for any sign of fresh distribution. Such action suggests funds are selling regularly.


Thursday's stock market action, though, was encouraging from one angle.


Strength appeared in many sectors, including auto, retail, software and leisure. [This is bullish](http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-market-today/021915-739976-how-are-stocks-doing.htm). Narrow leadership is vulnerable to bad news. But broadly based leadership can more easily handle a hit.


Recently, [the restaurant group has been heating up](http://news.investors.com/investing-new-highs/021815-739829-which-restaurant-stock-to-buy.htm). The group was No. 3 of 197 in Thursday's IBD. Breakouts in the past two days include **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)), **BJ's Restaurants** ([BJRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJRI)) and **Fiesta Restaurant** ([FRGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRGI)).


Recent new highs include **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Jack in the Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)) and **Brinker International** ([EAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EAT)).


Stocks near a new high include **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)).


News was mostly static Thursday. Fighting flared in Ukraine despite the recent cease-fire agreement. Germany rejected Greece's request for a six-month loan extension. The nine-month-old West Coast port standoff continued. Oil sagged on news of firm supplies. U.S. economic news was mixed — jobless data better than expected and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook worse than expected.


The market took it all in and shrugged.

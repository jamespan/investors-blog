U.S. stocks sagged Thursday, as the Nasdaq notched its first down day of 2017.


The Nasdaq lost 0.3% after being down as much as 1.2%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.


Volume declined on both major exchanges. The market will be closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and that's likely to dampen trade further Friday.


![mp011217](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP011217-216x300.png)Bears throttled the small caps, sending the market-leading S&P 600 down as much as 2.2% before it settled on a 1.2% loss.


The S&P 600 gained as much as 18% from Election Day to early December, but the gain is now 14% since the Nov. 8 close.


From a technical viewpoint, Thursday's stock-market action was constructive for three reasons.


First, the major indexes closed high in the day's range, staging a positive reversal that rubbed out most of the morning's losses.


Second, volume declined, suggesting institutional selling was not a serious part of the mix.


Third, the Nasdaq held above 5500, a previous level of resistance that now seems to offer support.

After seven straight up days for the Nasdaq, some kind of pullback had to be expected. Thursday's pullback was close to ideal. At its nadir for the day, the Nasdaq wiped out more than a third of the index's gain over the first seven sessions. But a loss that could've been disturbing shrank to the level of a mere nuisance.


Breakouts dwindled. **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) broke out, but that's a conservative play, not a growth stock.


New highs also were scarce. Chip designer **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) rose 3%, scoring a 52-week high. **WGL Holdings** ([WGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGL)), which is the holding company for gas utilities serving the Washington, D.C., area, thrust 6% in heavy volume.


WGL is reportedly in merger talks with Canada's AltaGas.


While the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, there are plenty of reasons to be cautious.


Secondary indicators, such as the bulls vs. bears ratio and the flattening line for the small-cap growth funds vs. large-cap growth funds, are tinting the tone gray.


But so far the indexes haven't paid those warning signs much heed.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims came in 3% lower than expected, near the low end of the range of estimates.


**Coming up Friday:** Before the open, economic-data releases will include retail sales for December. The Street expects a 0.7% month-to-month increase. The range of estimate runs from 0.4% to 0.9%.


Business inventories for November will be released a half-hour after the open. Analysts expect a 0.6% increase. The range of estimates is from 0.1% to 0.7%.


The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for January also will be released a half-hour after the open. The consensus estimate calls for a reading of 98.6. Estimates range from 95.5 to 100.

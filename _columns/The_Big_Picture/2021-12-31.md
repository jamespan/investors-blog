The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared better than other indexes Friday, but it was the S&P 500 that closed 2021 as the top major stock market index. History suggests 2022 could be another strong year for investors.




While it ended the day with a minor loss of 0.3%, the S&P 500 closed the year up just shy of 27%.


Investors should show prudence going into the new year, but there is reason for optimism. History shows that when the S&P 500 gains 20% or more in a calendar year it averages a gain of 7.7% the next, according to Dow Jones market data. In addition, the median return in the following year is a gain of 10.2%.


The Nasdaq also had a bumper year. While it closed down 0.6% for the day, it notched a 12-month gain of over 21%. Investors will want to see the tech-heavy index continue to muscle higher, with the likes of **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) heavy-hitters that could pull the index higher again.


The Dow Jones was hit the least Friday, dropping 0.2% But its yearly gain of under 19% means it lagged its broader rivals.

The fact volume was lower than the previous day means the [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remains unchanged.


Mixed Blessings For Growth Stock Investors
------------------------------------------


While the major indexes struggled, growth stocks stood out by moving higher.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund, a bellwether for growth stocks, rose 0.3%.


But a closer examination of its performance shows it lagged the major indexes for the year, even the Dow Jones. It closed the year with a gain just shy of 12%.


Fabless semiconductor stock**Himax Technologies** ([HIMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMX)) was the top performer on the IBD 50 index, rising more than 5% Friday.

These Industry Groups Excel
---------------------------


It is important to keep abreast of the best performing industry groups on a given day.


On Friday, diversified media, cable and satellite, telecom and transportation shipping led. On the downside, dairy products, department stores and consumer electronics retailers fared worst.


The S&P sectors closed mixed. Consumer staples, materials and industrials made the best gains. Technology, a key growth area, and communication services were the weakest.


IPO Stock Makes Bullish Move
----------------------------


**Olaplex** ([OLPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLPX)) stood out as the lone [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://bit.ly/3Er7kfm) index stock to attempt a breakout.


The IPO leader managed to pass a 30.23 entry before giving up ground in afternoon trading. But the stock remains actionable above a recent trendline breakout.

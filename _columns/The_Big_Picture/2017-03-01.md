Another day, another solid gain in the President Trump bull market.


Stock bulls ran over the bears on Wednesday, nary a day after the former businessman and media star got high marks for his first formal address to Congress.


As expected by the pundits, Trump did not show any wavering in his pledge to cut taxes in order to boost the U.S. economy, defeat radical Islamic terrorist groups, and to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.


Meanwhile, financial stocks got a major boost as it appears that more governors of the Federal Reserve are showing signs that March would be a good time to raise the cost of money and reduce the heavy level of asset buying by the U.S. central bank. As of Wednesday evening at 6:45 p.m. ET, the fed funds futures market, as tracked by CME Group, now shows a 66% probability that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points at the end of its March 14-15 meeting.


The current rate on overnight loans to large lenders is at a target range of 0.5%-0.75%. That's still really low compared with the 5.25% rate seen during the first half of 2007.


Yet these days, stronger data on payrolls, wages, consumer level prices and manufacturing all seem to be making the case that the economy can handle higher rates sooner than later.  On Wednesday, the closely watched ISM manufacturing index hit 57.7 in February, marking the [highest level since August 2014](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/factories-hummed-in-february-ism-surges-to-57-7/). It sailed past Econoday's consensus estimate of 56.4 and up from a 54.0 reading in January. An index reading above 50 signals expanding activity at the nation's factories.


Higher interest rates typically lead to thicker profit margins in banks' interest-rate-related products.


![MP030117](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP030117-119x300.png)Institutional investors fled bonds. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond jumped to 2.45%. That's up from as low as 1.37% seen in the summer of 2016.


In a broad market rally, the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrials all scored gains of 1.3% to 1.5% on Wednesday. Eighteen of the 30 names in the Dow industrials rose 1 point or more.


Small caps, which tend to respond more strongly to money managers' appetite for risk, powered even higher. The Russell 2000 and the S&P SmallCap 600 both rallied 1.9%.


Dozens of industry groups beat the major indexes with price-weighted gains of 2% or more. They ranged from wood products and metal ores to steel, super-regional banks, tires, heavy construction, plastics, farm machinery and oil drilling.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.


 Not that many brand-new breakouts are out there, but **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) have cleared fresh cup-with-handle buy points at 22.08 and 47.69, respectively.
**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) may join them; the Ft. Worth, Texas-based builder is quickly etching the right side of a potential cup pattern. For now, Horton's buy point is at 34.66.


In the metal ores sector, new spinoff **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)), taking the old name of the former Dow 30 component and focused on mining for bauxite and alumina, is rebounding nicely off its 50-day moving average near 34. Alcoa has also rallied 17% past a 32.45 IPO base buy point following a Jan. 12 breakout.


Sure, Alcoa's parent company, the newly named **Arconic** ([ARNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARNC)), is no spring chicken. The expert in raw and engineered aluminum products has been around since 1888. However, rising commodity prices help meet the N ("New") in IBD's [CAN SLIM system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) for choosing new stocks.


The newer, smaller, leaner Alcoa debuted on the Big Board on Nov. 1 last year and closed the session at 23. A 59 EPS Rating underscores net losses each year from 2012 to 2016. But the Street is thinking turnaround with earnings expected to rebound to $1.89 a share in 2017. Alcoa also has a young new CEO, 42-year-old Roy Harvey, according to the William O'Neil + Co. database.


As to be expected by a market that has stayed in a confirmed uptrend since June 30, without a correction, equities look healthy on a number of technical front. The NYSE advance-decline line continues to reach new high ground. (See it in the S&P 500 daily chart via the link at the bottom of this article.)


On Wednesday, winners pounded losers on the Nasdaq by a 3-1 margin. IBD's screened list of new highs is likely to show hundreds of names, which greatly increases the chance that more breakouts are taking place and follow-on buy points are getting triggered.


Without doubt, the rally is still long in the tooth, both in near term (since the Nov. 8 elections) and the long term. Investors still need to be disciplined in their buys, and be willing to sell and take gains on the way up.


In recent months on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/), the action among most Leaders List names has been generally positive. Yet some stocks such as former IBD 50 name **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)), which fell 4% in heavy volume Wednesday and is testing support at the 50-day moving average, illustrate the need to remain vigilant.


No doubt, volatility is still high right after a growth company posts earnings. It's unlikely that the elimination of Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure), which is commonly recognized as creating a market environment in which reaction to pivotal events such as quarterly results is extra volatile, is on the top of Trump's to-do list.


Former big market winner and IBD Leaderboard member **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), plus **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), underscore this new law of the stock market.


Are the bulls too bullish? Some measures of investor psychology hint as such. Investors Intelligence, in its latest weekly survey, notes that the spread between bullish pundits and bearish ones has now hit 46.6 percentage points, the largest in the current market cycle. This week, the poll noted a bullishness ratio of 63.1% vs. 16.5% for the bears.


In contrast, the [put-call volume ratio](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) is still in normal range at 0.86 as of Wednesday, which means that options traders bought and sold 86 bearish puts for every 100 bullish calls. (This reading may get updated later on Wednesday evening.)


Meanwhile, the CBOE Market Volatility Index is still near the low end of a three-month range that saw the VIX spike to 23.01 just ahead of Trump's stunning Nov. 8 election win. Yet the VIX hasn't undercut its 5-year low of 8.4 (see page B6 in the latest edition of IBD Weekly).


And as of December, growth in margin debt is still tame. In other words, 2017 still isn't the late 1920s or the end of 1999.


Excessive optimism can be ultimately kill a bull run. But until the market reveals serious institutional selling, it's best not to fight the market trend.

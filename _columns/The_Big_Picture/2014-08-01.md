Stocks lost more ground Friday, but the retreat was more contained and the volume lighter than in Thursday's drop.


The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.4% Friday. The S&P 500 cut 0.3%. All three indexes trimmed losses.


The IBD 50 was virtually flat.


Volume fell across the board. Both major indexes are now under their 50-day moving average lines.


The uptrend remains under pressure, and the market mood appears nervous at best. While this is not the best time to buy stocks, it is a good time to study the market. Individual investors might consider widening the lens to gain a sense of proportion.


Here are three things worth knowing about this market.


• **No. 1: The put-call ratio**, which closed at 1.04 Thursday and 1.19 Friday, has had a hot hand. So far this year, readings of 1.0 or greater in the put-call ratio have come just before short-term market bottoms.


Check the Nasdaq daily chart on May 15, April 25, April 11 and Jan. 24. In three instances, the Nasdaq's low came within two sessions of the put-call reaching 1.0. In the January case, the low came eight sessions later.


If the put-call signal Thursday proves right again, then that means the market is close to at least a short-term low. Friday's put-call close at 1.19 struck the highest level since June 20, 2013.


• **No. 2: August has a reputation** as a lackluster month, but that's only from market watchers who are looking through a conventional lens.


IBD focuses more on follow-through days, which confirm new market uptrends. Since 2000, August is high on the list for follow-through days that led to big gains. (Only March can rival its historical record.)


So, even if the market goes into a deeper decline, this is not the time to tune out stocks.


• **No. 3: Relative strength** is always worth watching, but especially when the market is struggling.


A look through a preliminary list of the IBD 50 found about a dozen stocks with rising RS lines that are at or near highs. The relative strength line measures a stock against the S&P 500.


Stocks with strong-looking RS lines include **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)).


For the week, the IBD 50 and the S&P 500 dropped 2.7% each. The Nasdaq fell 2.2%.


Upscale apparel and accessories marketer **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) on Monday is one of the companies kicking off the week's earnings reports.

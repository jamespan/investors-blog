Major Indexes, Top Stocks Take A Mild Break
============================================

Was Wednesday's market action the pause that refreshes? Or a sign of another rally doomed to stall and die? Looking at the way the major indexes and leading stocks traded, it appeared more of the former and less of the latter.

  

The Nasdaq gave back a measly 0.1% to halt a brisk four-day advance. Volume was flat.

  

On the S&P 500, the loss was even smaller. Although volume on the NYSE rose, the decline was not big enough to conclude that it was a day of distribution.

  

A [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764&nav=IBDUCourse3) is noted when institutional investors sell stocks heartily and en masse â€” that is, when volume climbs vs. the prior session as indexes fall.

  

Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are holding nicely above the key 50-day moving average. Small stocks had a rougher day. The S&P SmallCap 600 lost 0.8%. The index, up 3.9% since Jan. 1, still beats the S&P 500's 2.4% gain.

  

The IBD 50, which features numerous names with market values of less than $5 billion (think **Vasco Data Security International** ([VDSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDSI)), **Gray TV** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)), **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) fell just 0.1%.

  

The IBD 50 is up 13.9% year-to-date. That beats many of the leading market indexes as seen in the table on Page B11. Through Tuesday's action, IBD's New America Index was up 11.4% and the New Issues Index up 9.7%.

  

Despite the piecemeal decline, this market remains hypersensitive to the headlines coming out of Greece and China. Greek leaders were to decide on whether to accept a budget, tax and privatization reform plan to get fresh loans from the eurozone.

  

With the market still in a pressured uptrend, it's obviously less comfortable for stock buyers. The bull market is still long in the tooth. Some sectors, such as the airlines, have sold off hard in recent weeks.

  

Yet it's hard to dispute the fact that a decent number of breakouts are working.

  

Buying a stock at the right time and seeing it rise 20% to 25% from the proper buy point not only gives you a chance to sell and reap the gains. It gives you the confidence and courage to buy new breakouts.

  

The Nasdaq might get a nice pop early on Thursday. After Wednesday's market close, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and market laggard **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) (ninth largest on the Nasdaq) scored good Q2 profit beats. Netflix has leapt 47% since the video streaming and content firm gapped up April 16 on positive Q1 results. Earnings have fallen for three quarters in a row due to heavy investments. Yet Netflix grew Q2 revenue 23% to $1.64 billion, marking the ninth quarter in a row of 20%-plus top-line gains.

Stocks Stand Pat On Recent Gains, Keep New Uptrend Intact
==========================================================

Stocks were virtually flat Friday, avoiding trouble but adding nothing to the new uptrend.


The Nasdaq backed off less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1% each.


The IBD 50 was flat.


Volume fell on both major exchanges. Friday was an options expirations day, which usually lifts volume.


With the market turning to confirmed uptrend Thursday, individual investors should be on the lookout for quality breakouts. Tracking the indexes closely also is advisable.


The first land mine to sidestep is an early distribution day. In that sense, Friday's stand-pat action was acceptable. At least there was no distribution, which can be deadly early in an uptrend.


On Friday, the market not only had to digest the Nasdaq's biggest percentage gain since January, but it also had to swallow negative economic news.


Industrial production, consumer sentiment and the Empire State manufacturing survey each missed the Street's estimates.


Yet the new uptrend kept its nonchalant stride.


Transports and utilities provided some of the best gains of the day. Most of those stocks, though, carry mediocre ratings.


**United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) gapped up about 1.5% in volume 63% above average. Goldman Sachs upgraded it from neutral to buy. Analysts said that UPS is improving its cash flow and that its risk-reward ratio is attractive. It carries an IBD Composite Rating of 58, which means that it trails nearly half the market in fundamentals and technicals.


Utilities also rose. **Southern Company** ([SO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SO)), the electric utility with the biggest average daily dollar volume, popped 1.25% in roughly average volume. The stock carries a miserable Composite Rating of 19.


New leadership is unlikely to emerge from beaten-down utilities and transport groups.


Where is the leadership likely to come from?


The best way to know is to look for breakouts. Given that the follow-through came on Day 6 of the attempted rally, individual investors might want to look at the breakouts since May 7.


Stocks that crossed buy points include **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Intercontinental Exchange** ([ICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICE)), **Cheetah Mobile** ([CMCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCM)), **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)), **McKesson** ([MCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCK)) and **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)).


Paycom, though, thundered lower Friday on news of a secondary offering. Investors should also scour IBD screens for stocks basing, such as **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)) and **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)).


For the week, the IBD 50 rose 1%, the Nasdaq 0.9% and the S&P 500 0.3%.

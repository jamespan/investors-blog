Stocks coasted to the finish line of a shortened week Thursday, as the pros showed few signs of aggressive buying or selling.


The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was fractionally lower. Indexes pared losses of 0.7%, a positive move that was masked by the flat close. The IBD 50 fell 0.3%.


Volume was lower on both major exchanges in the run-up to the Good Friday observance.


While quiet action before a market holiday is natural, funds had a tactical reason to back away.


![MP032416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP032416.jpg)The Bureau of Economic Analysis was due to release the final reading on fourth-quarter GDP Friday. The first take in January was an 0.7% increase, which was revised to a gain of 1% in February. The Street's consensus estimate calls for the figure to remain at 1%. However, the range of estimates varies from a low of 0.7% to a high of 1.3%.


Monetarists expect faster economic growth to kick in eventually because the broadest gauge of money supply growth — Divisia M4 — has averaged 4% growth over the past eight months.


Yet how the stock market would react to a big miss on GDP or even a blowout beat isn't clear with three days until trading resumes.


Some regard weakness as good because it presumably would delay a second rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Others prefer strength because it would reassure those fearing a recession in 2016.


On Monday, the market will let everybody know how it regards growth or the lack of it.


Top-rated stocks weren't offering many clues Thursday.


Firearm stocks and IBD 50 components **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) and **Sturm Ruger** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)) each dived about 9% after signs of weakness in gun sales. The catalyst appeared to be the earnings call of **Sportsman's Warehouse** ([SPWH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWH)) late Wednesday.


The company said that the recent surge in firearms sales appears to be tied to current firearms owners stepping up buys rather than new entrants making first-time buys. It means that the sales surge is likely to be shorter in duration, CEO John Schaefer said.


Leaders posting gains Thursday included steady dividend-paying stocks such as **Graco** ([GGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GGG)) and real estate investment trust **Sun Communities** ([SUI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUI)).


The strength in conservative stocks hasn't yet played out in this cautious uptrend.


For the week, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.


In the coming week, companies reporting quarterly results include **Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)) on Monday; **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **Sonic** ([SONC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SONC)) on Tuesday; and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) on Wednesday.

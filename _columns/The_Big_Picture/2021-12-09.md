The stock market ended lower Thursday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq sold off sharply, a setback for the market's attempt to end its current correction.




Still, four top growth stocks — **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Driven Brands** ([DRVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRVN)), **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) and **Louisiana-Pacific** ([LPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPX)) — are holding up well amid the current market volatility.


Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended slightly lower, while the S&P 500 lost 0.7%. The Nasdaq sold off 1.7%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 tumbled 2.3%.


Leading growth stocks also fell sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 2.6%, snapping a two-day win streak and dropping back below the 200-day moving average. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)) advanced 5.4%, extending its win streak to four sessions. Lovesac reported strong results ahead of Wednesday's market open.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.

What To Do Now
--------------


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off Thursday, leading the broad market lower. Still, Thursday marked Day 4 of [new rally attempts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on the Nasdaq and S&P 500, and Day 6 for the Dow Jones industrials.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP120921-289x300.jpg)While indexes are still on track with a rally attempt, the market correction isn't over yet — several days don't make a trend. Starting on Day 4, you are looking for a major index to rise sharply in higher volume than the prior day. That would indicate a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), and signal the start of a potential uptrend.


Until such a signal appears, the [market outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) remains a market in correction. Investors should be avoiding new purchases and maintaining watchlists of top growth stocks. Be sure to keep a close eye on your portfolio to make sure you're protecting your gains and cutting losses quickly.


Now, while the market is still correcting, it's a good time to search for stocks that could become the next uptrend's leaders. One tool helpful in such a search is the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, then the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, then the line will point lower.


Recent breakouts from top growth stocks **Endeavor Group** ([EDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDR)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Zim Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) exemplify the danger of buying breakouts during market corrections. Endeavor triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) Thursday following Tuesday's short-lived breakout past a 31.80 entry.


The NXP breakout looked to be back on track after Tuesday's 6.5% gain. But shares tumbled 4.5% Wednesday to fall back below the 227.60 buy point, where they are currently trading.


Zim Integrated shares broke out Wednesday past a cup with handle's 60.19 buy point, but they staged a nasty reversal that same day. Then, they triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) Thursday.


Elsewhere, market leaders **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) were pressured Thursday. AMD dropped 4.9%. Nvidia fell 4.2%. And Tesla skidded 6.1%. All three remain above their 50-day moving averages.

Stocks To Watch: Arista, Driven, Epam, Louisiana-Pacific
--------------------------------------------------------


During the current stock market weakness, top growth stocks Arista Networks, Driven Brands, Endeavor Group, Epam Systems and Louisiana-Pacific are among those holding up the best. They are in or near new buy zones.


[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock Arista Networks is close to completing a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a 134.24 buy point. Shares rallied 2.5% Thursday, closing about 4% from new highs. [ANET stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-arista-networks-inc-anet.aspx) shows a solid 95 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/), according to the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)


[IPO Leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stock-of-the-week/) Driven Brand shares are building a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a 33.47 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), or 10 cents above the stock's high on Nov. 1, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares are about 3% away from the entry following a solid advance during the week.


[IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) Epam Systems snapped back this week after the S&P Dow Jones Indices announced the stock will join the S&P 500 Tuesday before the open. The current formation is too short to be a cup base (only five weeks long) and too deep (nearly 22%) to be a flat base, so there is no correct buy point. But the stock's relative strength line is hard to dismiss; it is just off new highs. Ideally, EPAM will take a breather and add a handle, which would offer a proper entry.


Louisiana-Pacific — [Tuesday's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-construction-leader-lpx-stock-is-breaking-out-today-past-new-buy-point/) pick — is in buy range past a 73.76 buy point in a cup with handle amid Thursday's 0.3% gain. Shares are in the 5% buy zone that tops out at 77.45.

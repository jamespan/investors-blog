Stock Market Fades In Suspicious Action; Four Trends To Watch In New Uptrend
=============================================================================

The stock market struggled to extended its new year advance, as indexes pared gains or reversed lower. It was the type of action more commonly seen in bear markets than in bull phases, which raises questions about last week's rally.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed lower to close with a 0.3% loss. The S&P 500, which had been up 1.4%, also reversed and closed 0.1% lower. The Nasdaq composite's nearly 2.3% rally thinned out to just a 0.6% gain.


Friday's follow-through in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite marked a bullish shift in market direction. Investors should read it as a signal to increase exposure.


But, as Monday's fadeaway showed, it remains a time to remain cautious. Certainly, it wasn't the way a new bull phase should act.


Stock Market Risks This Week
----------------------------


At least the market avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). And while NYSE volume rose, the S&P 500's loss was too light to be considered distribution. Volume fell on the Nasdaq.


For now, it is prudent to raise stock exposure to 20%-40% of your portfolio. The market still faces uncertainty to be risking any more than that.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP010923-206x300.jpg)This week begins fourth-quarter earnings season. Early Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivers a speech in Sweden, although he is not scheduled to speak directly about monetary policy. [Thursday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) figures to be a tense morning, when the December consumer price index (CPI) comes out.


If this stock market uptrend is for real, investing opportunities will appear for weeks or months. Thus, there's no need to rush. With any buys, start with half your intended investment. If the stock continues rising, add more while trying to complete your buys before shares are more than 5% above the buy point.


Four Signs To Watch For Stock Market
------------------------------------


Four indicators can help investors determine if the current uptrend has stamina.


First, watch how the major indexes act at the main moving averages. All should be above the 50-day lines.


The S&P 500 climbed above its 50-day moving average, but receded below the line by the close in a bearish sign. The Dow closed above its 50-day line for a second straight session, despite the downward reversal.


Except for the Dow, indexes remain below the long-term 200-day moving average.


Second, the S&P 500 has met resistance at a trendline that expands the bear market peaks. In the most recent test of this line, the S&P climbed to 4100 and rolled over.


The next test could come around the 4000 level. If the index can surpass the trend line, consider it a good omen.


Third, the VIX is nearing a level where it marked market tops last year. Going back to at least April of 2022, the stock market rolled over every time the [CBOE Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) fell to around 20. It is currently at 21.75 and hitting resistance at its 10-day moving average.


Many New Breakouts Disappoint
-----------------------------


Fourth, and perhaps most important, study the latest stock breakouts. While there's been an ample number of stocks topping buy points since last week, the quality of those breakouts is mostly poor.


**Lincoln Electric** ([LECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LECO)), **Buckle** ([BKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKE)), **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)), **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)), **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **Aflac** ([AFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFL)) and **Sterling Infrastructure** ([STRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRL)) have retreated below their buy points.


Even **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), which broke out Friday on a 135% jump in volume, slid back below the buy point Monday, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) pattern recognition.



Among Monday's breakouts, **Modine** ([MOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOD)) held up well and volume was 68% above average. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) is at new highs, too.


Chip equipment maker **Amkor** ([AMKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMKR)) closed at session highs on 61% higher volume. Heavy equipment company **MasTec** ([MTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTZ)) held in its buy zone and volume was 42% above average.


But **AerCap Holdings** ([AER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AER)), **ATI** ([ATI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATI)), **Ametek** ([AME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AME)) and **SLB** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) all sank below their buy points, saw weak volume or both.


A handful of breakouts are acting well, though.


**Iridium** ([IRDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRDM)), despite weak earnings growth, is working out better, more than 10% above its 53.71 buy point. **US Foods** ([USFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USFD)) also looks good so far. **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) has climbed 10% from its entry, while **Evercore**'s ([EVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVR)) breakout is occurring amid a four-day streak of above-average volume.


Health Care Stocks Tumble
-------------------------


Monday was a bad day for biotech and other health care stocks.


Health Care Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) tumbled 1.7%. It was the worst-performing S&P sector ETF. It sank further below the 50-day line after meeting resistance there for a few weeks.


Several biotechs got hit hard.


**Harmony Biosciences** ([HRMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRMY)) sold off 16% in big volume on news that CEO John Jacobs is leaving to become chief executive of vaccine maker **Novavax** ([NVAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVAX)).


**Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)) slid 12% after news of a collaboration with **Voyager Therapeutics** ([VYGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VYGR)).


Diabetes treatment firm **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) fell 5% in heavy volume after releasing preliminary results.


The IBD 50 index fell less than 0.1%. Amkor aided the IBD 50's cause with a nearly 8% surge. And building products holding company **Griffon** ([GFF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFF)) cleared a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) in heavy volume. Griffon announced an agreement with Voss Capital as it continues a strategic review.

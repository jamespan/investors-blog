Is it "Buy the rumor, hold the news"?


Judging by the way the major indexes finished on Wednesday, a day after both the House of Representatives (while fouling on certain parliamentary procedures) and the Senate passed a landmark piece of legislation to revamp the U.S. tax code, one might think, well, yes.




 "Buy the rumor, sell the news" happens a lot. Have you seen a highly rated stock climb nicely in the weeks ahead of quarterly results, then get slammed after the actual report? Such action, whether in a bull market or a bear, reaffirms that old Wall Street saw.


So, given the somewhat pessimistic tone raised by some equity strategists ahead of the historic decision by Congress, a flat finish on Wednesday by the major indexes seems to suggest that the uptrend is still confirmed, ever since a rare Day 3 [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) took place on June 30 of last year.


The Nasdaq composite closed less than 2 points lower Wednesday. At 6961, the tech-weighted index still is clinging to a minor weekly gain after advancing 1.4% last week. The Nasdaq is also up a stout 7.2% for the quarter with just six trading sessions left in 2017.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MP122017-230x300.png)The S&P 500, also off less than 0.1%, is not backing off much after striking a fresh all-time high on Monday. At 2679, the large-cap benchmark is up nearly 6.4% since Oct. 1. Breadth was nominally positive on both exchanges, with winners beating losers by around 100 to 200 names on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), an ETF managed by [Innovator Capital Management](http://www.innovatoretfs.com/etf/?ticker=ffty), was off just 0.2% to 33.56. The exchange traded fund of 50 top performing growth stocks is up 39% year to date, slamming gains of 22.8% by the Dow industrials and 19.7% for the S&P 500.


As tracked by the [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count in IBD's Market Pulse, pronounced profit taking by large funds has been light. The Nov. 14 distribution day expired on time for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500; the latter index now has zero distribution days over the past 25 sessions.


Wednesday was not a dull day at all, though, for commodity stocks and transportation issues.


Among the top 10 performing industry groups, eight of the top 10 came from the oil and gas, steel and mining sectors. Specialty consumer products and office supply were the two other industry groups that also rallied 2% or more. A solid rally in both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil prices, plus expectations that the historic Trump-led tax reform could boost infrastructure and construction spending, certainly provided a backbone for the rebound in these beaten down areas of the market.


Now, if you've been tracking IBD's screened new high list closely, you've largely noticed the conspicuous absence of commodity-oriented stocks reaching 52-week or all-time highs. Lately, it's been a show of strength for the Banks, Finance and Retail sectors. Take Tuesday's session. While 305 Nasdaq and NYSE-listed names hit highs, vs. 65 new lows, Banks came in first in the IBD New High list at 19 stocks, followed by Retail (at 18), Finance (13) and Business Services (9).


While everyone even remotely interested in the stock market knows that equities have had a good year while bond prices have generally declined, active investors must certainly be wondering: Can 2018 be a repeat of 2017?


In 2009, after a massive bear market, the Nasdaq finished the year up a remarkable 43.9%. It followed that huge rebound of a year with a 16.9% advance in 2010.


On the small-cap side of the market, the S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 23.8% in 2009, then added 25% in 2010. The next year was virtually flat, but the S&P 600 then followed with gains of 14.8% in 2012 and 39.7% in 2013.


Of course, no one has a crystal ball. Some pundits may be right on big turning points once in a while, but no one is right every single time. That's why simply following the market on a day-to-day basis and the progress of the stocks in your portfolio is the best strategy. Also watch how leading stocks in premier growth screens including Sector Leaders, Big Cap 20, IPO Leaders and IBD 50 are doing.


Can small caps do better in 2018 after lagging the big caps this year? Some strategists say yes, because large multinationals have the benefit of already doing business in countries with lower tax rates.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), for instance, has shown a total tax rate of 25%-26% the past three years, far lower than the 39% marginal rate for corporations in the U.S.


With the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond continuing to rise, it's perhaps no surprise that utility stocks have been suffering lately. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones utility average dropped 0.7%, following a 1% slide on Monday and a 1.6% drubbing on Tuesday. The sector index now faces a test of support at the long-term 200-day moving average.



The Dow transports raced nearly 0.9% higher, thanks in part to some peppy moves by airlines. **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), a recent member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/Leaderboard/Leaders/default.aspx/Leaderboard/Leaders/default.aspx), gained for a fifth straight day and is now extended from a 59.99 buy point in a decent cup with handle. The RS line is rising sharply.


Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect Southwest's earnings to rise 11% to 83 cents in the fourth quarter, which would be the best performance in six quarters. Full-year profit is expected to accelerate 26% higher to $4.49 a share in 2018.



The lesson by Southwest now and Apple (up 48% since a January breakout past 118.12) this year? Don't ignore the turnaround artists.

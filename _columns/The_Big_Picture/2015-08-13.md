Stock indexes sagged to small losses Thursday after spending much of the session above the break-even line. The Nasdaq lost 0.2% after being up 0.5%. The S&P 500 trimmed 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the IBD 50 closed barely higher.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

Losing issues led winners by a 3-to-2 ratio on the NYSE and by 9 to 7 on the Nasdaq.

  

Recent action in the market has done nothing to suggest that investors are seeing anything other than more of the same: Rolling action with pint-sized moves.

  

Breakouts were scarce Thursday, as they have been for the past week or so. However, some stocks popped above buy points.

  

**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) rose 1.33 to 119.02, clearing a 118.09 entry in a shallow base about five months long. Home Depot reports quarterly results Tuesday morning.

  

The base is second-stage, which is more likely to work than a later-stage base. Home Depot's first-stage breakout a year ago delivered a 41% gain before the current consolidation began.

  

Off-price clothing and household goods retailer **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) popped above a 71.13 buy point but closed under the entry.

  

The company will report Q2 results Tuesday before the market's open. The Street expects 3% EPS growth.

  

Top-rated stocks that did well Thursday included homebuilders **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), which cleared its 5% buy zone from a July 30 breakout, and **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), which hit a new high.

  

In the past 11 weeks, these two homebuilders rose the most in the group â€” LGI Homes up 35% and D.R. Horton up 17%. LGI serves the entry-level portion of the housing market, and D.R. Horton launched an entry-level Express line about 15 months ago.

  

Some market watchers say the entry-level emphasis is aimed at the millennial generation.

  

Economic news was generally favorable. While first-time jobless claims were 1.5% more than expected, July retail sales topped expectations, rising 0.6% vs. the consensus estimate of 0.5%.

  

Perhaps the best news came in the business inventories data for June.

  

Businesses increased inventories 0.8%, trouncing views for a 0.3% pop. The gain was the biggest in about two-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, the ratio of inventories to sales hit 1.37, the highest level since June 2009, when the recession ended.

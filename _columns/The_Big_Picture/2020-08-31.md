August was, well, august.




At least that was certainly the case for the Nasdaq composite. A 0.7% rise on Monday capped off a heroic month, less than six months after the coronavirus blew the U.S. economic recession wide open. Today, Covid-19 still threatens so many service-oriented small businesses and workers in the leisure and brick-and-mortar retail industries, plus some factories.


At 11,775, the Nasdaq finished the month with a 9.7% advance. That gain has more than doubled since the tech-centered index peaked at 5132 during the top of the dot-com bubble in March 2000.


During the last legs of that incredible, over-exuberant bull run, the Nasdaq actually scored even bigger monthly gains than what transpired this past month. In November 1999, the composite gained 12.5%, then followed that with a 22% surge the next month. A vertical-like 19.2% rise in February 2000 helped set up dozens more stocks going into [climax runs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/) and the ultimate peak of that 17-month bull market since the market bottom of October 1998.


The Nasdaq Today
----------------


The Nasdaq has spurted more than 77% since hitting bottom on March 23 at 6631 and rallied 90% since the low of 6190 achieved during a brief bear market in the fourth quarter of 2018.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP_1x2_083120-184x300.jpg)Volume jumped on the Nasdaq Monday. The market saw a dumping of megacap techs in the final two minutes of trading. Go to a one-minute chart of the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF, and that big selling certainly looks premeditated. Was it related to end-of-month portfolio dressing? One cannot rule it out.


The same could possibly be said for action on the NYSE, too.


The S&P 500 edged down 0.2% as volume on the Big Board rose nearly 11% to 3.89 billion shares. The NYSE composite snapped a spirited five-session win streak, falling nearly 1%.


In contrast, the Nasdaq 100 — tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange — gained 0.9% and still finished nicely in the upper half of the day's range despite that last-minute sell-off.


The Market Pulse table, meanwhile, illustrates how much both the economy and innovation have changed the investing landscape for growth stocks.


Seek New Leaders
----------------


You're not seeing old masters of the market's tech renaissance years of the 1990s, such as **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) or **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), leading the way. **Dell Technologies** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) have shown a little mojo lately. But their mature fundamentals tell a story quite different from the big years of earnings and sales growth they posted during the internet revolution.


No doubt, Covid-19 has changed the way we work, live and play. New cases still rise at frightening levels in many places around the globe. In the U.S. alone, more than 183,000 lives have been lost, according to data from the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University.


Yet companies such as **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)), **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and scores of other newer, fast-growing companies are selling products and services to help society cope with and ultimately tame this once-in-a-century health menace.



Zoom, which soared more than 8% on Monday, padded those gains after hours on a massive beat on both the top and bottom lines for the July-ended second quarter.


Shares have bounced more than 29% since retaking the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) less than three weeks ago near 251. The stock is now sharply extended from this [secondary buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


5 Factors To Watch For In September
-----------------------------------


This column has noted that the run has gotten so strong that some sort of technical pullback is due. But in the summer months, equity trading desks seem to have been relatively quiet overall. On the Nasdaq, you'd have to go all the way back to July 21 to find a session in which turnover rose above the index's 50-day moving average.


The IBD system, in determining the general market direction, takes in the action one day at a time. But important news will at some point change the market tone. Look for these possible clues.


1. Leaders fall en masse beneath their 50-day or 10-week moving averages.
2. Investors get way too complacent. The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) does not reflect this lately. The VIX rose 15% to 26.41, hitting its highest close since July 16, but is well below extreme-fear levels.
3. Sector leadership swings in favor of defensive industries. Headed into Monday, Auto, Alcohol, Software, Retail, Chips and Mining took the top six rungs within IBD's [33-sector stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-aug-28-2020/). Leading stocks tend to come from the top-ranking sectors, not the bottom ones. The average year-to-date gain among these six, on a price-weighted basis, is 44.8% through Friday.
4. The Federal Reserve makes a sudden about-face in its stance on monetary policy. Ultralow interest rates have, for months, motivated institutional investors to buy equities. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 2 basis points to 0.72% on Monday. That's up from 0.56% on Aug. 3. But it's still too early to determine that the trend has changed.
5. Large [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) hit the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.

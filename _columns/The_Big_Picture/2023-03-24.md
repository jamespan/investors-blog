Stock Market Gains But Consider These Warning Signs; Microsoft-Activision Boost This Group
===========================================================================================

The stock market shrugged off the latest Fed meeting and banking fears Friday, ending the week higher. Nevertheless, the popularity of defensive trades underlines broad-based uncertainty.




The Nasdaq composite reversed higher, booking a 0.3% daily gain while adding to a solid 1.7% weekly lift. Big Tech led with unusual strength as the index found support at the 10-week line, an encouraging sign. The Nasdaq is now up almost 14% in 2023.


The blue chip S&P 500 squeezed out a 0.6% gain, rising about 1.5% for the week. It remains slightly negative this month but has still gained almost 4% for the year. It also managed to end the week back above the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


Gainers outnumbered decliners by just under 2-to-1 on the NYSE, with the margin even smaller on the Nasdaq.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a modest 0.4% gain. It rose for the week but remains down nearly 3% for the year. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) was the top performer in the venerable index.


Small caps fared best on the stock market Friday, with the Russell 2000 lifting an impressive 0.9%. However, growth stocks suffered a nasty bear bite, dropping Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) 1.2%.


Flight To Safety Undermines Stock Market Gains
----------------------------------------------


The stock market ended the week positive but there are plenty of reasons to be cautious. First, the IBD outlook remains "market in correction." Investors should keep plenty of powder dry, with exposure limited to 0-20%.

In addition, there has been a flight to safety amid rising recession fears. Both the 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes ended the week lower while the yield curve remains inverted. Ongoing banking worries may have a deep impact on economic activity due to tougher lending conditions.


It also is worth considering the relative performance of the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq-100 index. and the Direxion NASDAQ-100 Equal-Weighted ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) fund. While QQQ is bullishly above all its moving averages, QQQE is just a hair above its 50-day moving average.


Similarly, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) is below all of its moving averages. The strength of Big Tech stocks appears to be masking the struggles of less vaunted companies with weaker balance sheets. This is also evident in the small-cap Russell 2000's poor first quarter performance.

Microsoft-Activision Aids This Group
------------------------------------


Nearly all S&P 500 sectors ended the day positive. The defensive utilities sector fared best while consumer discretionary and financials were the only laggards.


Once again, the performance of IBD industry groups gave a deeper insight into the day's stock market action.



Movie stocks, confectioners and a variety of utility groups all had strong sessions, a distinctly defensive picture.


But it was video game stocks that booked the strongest performance amid news the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority backed off from concerns over the proposed **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) acquisition of **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)). MSFT rose 1.1% while ATVI popped 5.9%.


Publishers, a variety of oil and gas groups, investment bankers and metal product distributors all struggled.

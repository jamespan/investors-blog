The stock market climbed unevenly Monday, with small caps and a few industry sectors doing much better than the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500.




Indexes had a hard time finding direction for much of the day. The stock market picked up steam shortly before 3 p.m. ET, when news broke that Joe Biden had picked former Fed chief Janet Yellen to be Treasury secretary. Yellen, who was Federal Reserve chair in 2014-18, is someone that most of Wall Street seems comfortable with.


The Nasdaq closed 0.2% higher, but erased an early 0.5% loss. The S&P 500 added 0.6% and the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](http://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis) tacked on 1.1%. The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.9% burst that left the small-cap benchmark at a record high.


Among other sector that outperformed, the Philadelphia semiconductor index and the Dow transports both climbed 1.6%.


Volume inched higher on the Nasdaq vs. Friday and was indicated higher on the NYSE. It was the sixth straight day of above-average volume on the Nasdaq.

In that time, the stock market has been directionless, as it grapples with two prevailing themes on the coronavirus: While it applauds the fast development of Covid-19 vaccines, the market also fears the re-energized coronavirus will lead to another economic slowdown.


Authorities in some states are reinstating social distancing measures. At the same time, **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) filed Friday for emergency authorization for their vaccine. On Monday, **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)) said a [vaccine it is developing with the University of Oxford was 70% effective,](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/azn-stock-dips-coronavirus-vaccine-70-effective-average/) on average. AstraZeneca's U.S. shares fell 1.1%, as investors saw that its success rate lags the 90%-plus of the Pfizer vaccine.


After climbing as much as 11% from its Oct. 30 closing price, the Nasdaq has been largely flat the past two weeks. Most of the S&P 500's 9.4% increase so far this month came in the first two weeks.


The Stock Market's Areas Of Strength
------------------------------------


But while the major indexes feel their way around, some areas of the stock market are performing quite well. One of those is small caps. The Russell 2000 is up about 18% for November, and has doubled the Nasdaq's 8.9% gain for the month.


Electric-vehicle stocks **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)), **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) and **Xpeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) are racing to new highs, dwarfing Tesla's 35% November run.


Airline and travel booking groups are up about 25% in November, while the retail sector has rallied some 20%. IBD's wholesale food industry group has jumped 35%. Payment stocks have climbed more than 20%. Auto dealers are up almost as much. IBD's solar energy group has more than doubled in four weeks.


Some of the November winners are in the IBD 50. These include **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), which is up 15% since it rose to new highs on Nov. 5; **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), which has rallied 17% from a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) at 382.06; and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)), up 16% since its Nov. 4 breakout.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) has climbed about 14% from a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 260.25. **Futu Holdings** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) surged as much as 25% from a 41.09 buy point in little more than a week.


IBD 50 Underperforming Stock Market
-----------------------------------


However, the index as a whole has not outperformed. It is up less than 4% for the month and nearly horizontal since Nov. 11. That's because quite a few IBD 50 stocks are in sideways patterns, and many are still licking their wounds from the Nov. 9 market sell-off.


Nearly 20 of the 50 stocks can be [considered to be in bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), and if the market can snap out of its funk, watch for those stocks to break out past buy points. They represent the next batch of buy opportunities.


Breakouts Monday were mostly unimpressive.


**Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) topped the 288.66 buy point of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), but volume was below average. **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) also saw light volume on its breakout past 24.56. **Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)) volume was 44% above average, but the stock, while up 2.5% for the day, fell short of closing above the 242.25 buy point.

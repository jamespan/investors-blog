title: Nasdaq Bucks Mild Losses; Will Value Stocks Catch Up With Growth Stocks?

The unusual concentration of technology in the market-cap-weighted Nasdaq composite made Tuesday's session kind of an outlier.




The major equity indexes fell mildly after the three-day Presidents Day weekend. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) [sounded a revenue warning](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-sinks-on-china-coronavirus-concerns/) for the current fiscal second quarter ending in March. Apple, which by itself makes up 8% of the Nasdaq's total market value, dropped 1.8%. The megacap tech had fallen more in a single session just two times so far in 2020.


Numerous semiconductor firms fell in sympathy as investors decided to lighten up on the company's component suppliers. The S&P 500 gave up 0.3% but bounced bullishly off its morning lows. The S&P SmallCap 600 lost nearly 0.6% and stumbled back below its 50-day moving average.

Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq refused to enter Tuesday's losers column. It inched nearly 2 points higher (less than 0.1%) as four of the five stocks that make up the FAANG acronym actually rose. And as the Market Pulse table illustrates, a band of CAN SLIM-quality stocks in fields such as e-commerce, semiconductors, diabetes care and enterprise software highlighted a still-good appetite for growth.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP_2x5_021820-198x300.jpg)The Nasdaq 100 gained less than 0.1%. But across the entire Nasdaq market, falling issues outmatched rising ones by a 6-5 margin, an unusual divergence. On the NYSE, losers edged winners by a 7-5 margin.


Volume rose on both main exchanges, up just 1% on the Nasdaq and more than 11% on the NYSE. So, that boosted the distribution-day count on the S&P 500 to five.


Yet pronounced institutional selling remains controlled, if the Nasdaq's [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) offers any guide. Plus, the count on the S&P 500 includes a Feb. 11 stalling day. Bull markets die of heavy declines in big volume, and over the past 25 sessions, the S&P 500 has seen just two such sell-offs exceeding 1% (-1.6% on Jan. 27, -1.8% on Jan. 31).


Still A Leader On The Nasdaq: Apple Stock Chart
-----------------------------------------------


Apple shaved some of its early drop and even finished in the upper half of the day's trading range. Such action indicates institutions are in no way throwing in the towel. Apple also still holds a big cushion above its 50-day moving average. Thus, no sell rules have been triggered, other than the [25% profit-taking sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).



Coronavirus cases keep climbing, albeit at a slower rate. That's the good news. The bad news? Chinese consumers have mostly stayed away from stores and public places. Factory closures and delays in the reopening of facilities across the Middle Kingdom are pinching the global supply chain of big American companies, including the maker of the iPhone, Macbook and Apple Watch.


Bond investors loaded up on long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds in response to the growing caution on the China economy. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond plunged 4 basis points to 1.55%. That flattens the yield curve; the curve between three-month T-bills and two-year notes continues to stay inverted, which is generally bearish for banks. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) all undercut their 50-day moving averages on Tuesday.


[The Friday Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-today-hold-bullish-bent-5-reasons-why-the-nasdaq-may-hit-10000/) notes five factors that could help eventually boost the Nasdaq to 10,000. Meanwhile, some Wall Street professionals think that amid generously low interest rates courtesy of the Fed, continued heavy stock buybacks by corporations, and a decent-looking earnings picture, other indexes also may have more room to run.


"We think the S&P 500 is relatively undervalued still. And we made a call for 4000 in December," Robert Maltbie, president of Los Angeles-based micro-cap and small-cap research firm SingularResearch.com, told IBD in a phone interview. Maltbie's Argonaut 2000 fund rose 36% in 2019.


Maltbie is using $177 as an earnings target for the S&P 500 in 2020. With the large-cap index finishing the day at 3370, the projected earnings yield of 5.2% Tuesday still compares favorably with an average bond yield of 3.8% for the lowest rung of investment-grade bonds ranking at BBB by Standard & Poor's.


He also expects some money flowing back to smaller companies that trade at lower valuations, since the iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF ([IWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWO)) has outperformed peer iShares Russell 2000 Value ([IWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWN)) by nearly 12 percentage points since February of last year.


"I think there's a new brigade of leaders taking over from the FANGs," Maltbie added.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.3% after rising at the open. It holds a 5.2% year-to-date advance after gaining 25.7% in 2019.

Bulls trampled the bears for a second straight session Thursday, as the market made a bullish signal.

  

The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each rolled 1.8% higher. The IBD 50 added 1.6%. Volume rose on both major exchanges.

  

Thursday's action on the Nasdaq constituted a follow-through, which means the market is in a confirmed uptrend.

  

Technically, the index had been making an attempted rally since Dec. 17, the day after the Nasdaq marked a short-term low that was never undercut. The follow-through, then, comes on the 15th day of that attempted rally.

  

The IBD Market Pulse had carried either a correction or under-pressure label since Dec. 10. So, the market had not been especially friendly to buyers for more than four weeks.

  

One benefit of the four weeks of sluggish action is that some top-rated stocks have had time to sketch new patterns.

  

For example, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) had continued a consolidation that began in August. The stock cleared a 675.34 entry Dec. 29 in volume 20% above average. The volume wasn't sufficient to be a valid breakout, but a recrossing of the buy point Wednesday came in twice its usual volume. On Thursday, Chipotle added almost 4% in huge volume.

  

Because the stock broke out with the market in correction and is now 7% past the buy point, buying on Chipotle's breakout was particularly risky.

  

This is typical of new uptrends. Often a strong stock will break out before the confirmation. Perfection isn't one of the options in investing.

  

Other stocks, however, could be setting up or already are in buy zones.

  

**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) has broken out above a 196.10 buy point and closed less than 1% above the ideal entry. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has formed a flat base with a potential 119.85 buy point, but it could offer an early entry at 114.87. 

  

**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) might be working on a double-bottom base with an 111.30 entry.

  

Other breakouts are still in the 5% buy zone, including **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)).

  

Scan the IBD 50, Your Weekly Review and Big Cap 20 and you will find other potential buy candidates.

  

One thing that could create additional breakouts and strong follow-up action is earnings season. Reports for the fourth quarter will begin to arrive in the weeks to come.

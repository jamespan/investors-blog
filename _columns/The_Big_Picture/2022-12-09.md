The stock market bulls were overwhelmed late as the stock market closed lower following disappointing inflation data. The indexes suffered a painful week ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting and another inflation report.




The S&P 500 ended Friday at session lows as it tumbled 0.7%. It also suffered a weekly loss of more than 3%, losing the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) in the process. The fact it failed to hold this key benchmark after finally moving above it the previous week is a big disappointment.


The Nasdaq composite also closed at lows as it skidded 0.7%. The weekly loss was even worse here, at 4%. A crumb of comfort is that it is holding above the 50-day moving average for now. It added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) Friday though, bringing the current total to three.


Blue chips were given a harsher spanking. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day down 0.9% as it suffered its worst week since September. It has now undercut its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) fared best while **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) was the worst Dow laggard.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index was smacked 1.2% lower, while the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dived nearly 2%.


Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by more than 2-1 and by just shy of 2-1 on the Nasdaq.


PPI Data Disappoints As Fed Meeting Looms
-----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP120922-272x300.jpg)One issue hitting the stock market was wholesale prices, which came in hotter than expected in November.


Year over year, prices were up 7.4%, below October's reading of 8% but above the 7.2% expected by economists. Core prices rose 6.2% year over year, also below October's reading of 6.7% but above the 5.9% consensus estimate.


The report came ahead of a pivotal week for the stock market, which has seen its current uptrend come under attack.


First, the latest consumer price index is due to be released on Tuesday. This will give another reading on whether inflation is easing enough to lessen central bankers' worries.


In addition, the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee takes place on Tuesday and Wednesday. With a heavily telegraphed 50-basis-point hike on the cards, investors will be looking for further guidance on the Fed's plans. While a pivot from aggressive tightening looks unlikely, some respite from punishing rate hikes would be welcome.

Lululemon Hurts Retail
----------------------


The late negative action meant most S&P 500 sectors closed in the red. Only communication services moved higher, while health and energy led the downside.



Food wholesalers, the **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX))-dominated movies industry, nonalcoholic beverage plays, cable stocks and life insurance companies all excelled on a relative basis.


On the other side of the coin, department stores, book stocks and consumer electronics retailers all struggled. Oil & gas field service companies and drillers also lagged.


But it was the apparel retail group that took the hardest hit. That was led by **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), which was hammered 12.8% lower following its [latest quarterly report](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/lululemon-falls-on-high-luxury-fitness-apparel-inventory-for-holidays/).

Sellers hit leading semiconductor stocks and small-cap stocks in the stock market Monday. The Russell 2000 small-cap index fell below its 50-day moving average, but the Nasdaq composite managed to hold near its short-term 10-day moving average.




Sentiment was negative in the chip sector after the U.K. opened an investigation into **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) planned $40 billion merger with ARM Holdings, saying it could have national security implications. After a heavy-volume breakout last week over a 615 buy point, Nvidia closed below the buy point Monday, falling 3.5% to 614.47.


The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) fell 2.5% in higher volume. It was in a nice chart setup headed into Monday, drifting lower in light volume near the 250 level. Now the exchange traded fund looks poised for a test of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) around 242. IBD's chip-equipment group was one of the day's worst performers, down nearly 3%. Solar and software stocks also lagged badly.


Stock Market Today
------------------


At the close, the Russell 2000 and Nasdaq composite fared the worst, down 1.4% and 1%, respectively. The Nasdaq's 21-day exponential moving average around 13,662 is a logical support level to watch because it's close to the Nasdaq's March high of 13,620.71.


![MP041921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP041921-255x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.4%, hurt by another weak showing from **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), which fell 1.6%. Boeing made a sell signal by erasing a double-digit percentage gain from the 244.18 buy point. The S&P 500 gave back 0.5% but continues to hold above its 10-day line.


Nasdaq volume eased. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in lower than on Friday. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by around 3-to-1.


Even with the stock market still in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) and a light [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) count, the market environment is getting more challenging. The Nasdaq has been wedging higher in light volume since its March 25 low. The S&P 500 has also been hitting new highs in light turnover.

Buying stock breakouts has been a mixed bag at best. Recent base breakouts for **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) look fine. But other breakouts from the likes of **Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)), **Artisan Partners** ([APAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APAM)), **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)), **IAC** ([IAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAC)) and **Kulicke & Soffa** ([KLIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLIC)) are struggling.


Making new buys is still a good strategy, but keep positions small to start and don't be afraid to cut losses quickly if a trade doesn't go your way.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks had a tough day, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) down 2.2%. Inside the IBD 50, chip-equipment firm **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) slumped more than 3% and flashed a sell signal by erasing a double-digit gain from the 114.10 buy point. The chart may also be interpreted as a double bottom with a 110.47 entry, and Entegris nearly sank to that level Monday.


But the news wasn't all bad in the IBD 50. **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)) is trading tightly near its 10-week moving average as it forms a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). Atkore was picked for [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch Monday](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-after-outpacing-market-atkore-completes-base-ahead-of-q2-earnings/). **Futu Holdings** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)), which operates an online brokerage platform in China, jumped past a 164.60 buy point, soaring 16% to 177.91.


A couple of earnings reports from two leading chip-equipment firms are due this week. **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) reports early Wednesday. [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) reports Wednesday after the close.


ASML slumped 2.5% but it's still holding above its 21-day line. Selling was more intense in Lam Research. Shares fell more than 3% to 621.73, and the stock is close to erasing a double-digit gain from the 603.70 buy point.

IBD's steel producer group reversed lower for a loss of 0.5% after rising 2.5%. Several top-rated steel producers continue to hold near highs, including **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), which completed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) last week. But the stock flashed a bearish outside day Monday, falling 0.6% in higher volume. Shares were down 1% in extended trading despite better than expected Q1 earnings and sales.


Group peer **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) showed better price action Monday. It's been trading tightly near highs after a bullish breakout around the 60 level in February. Results are due early Thursday.


Rio Tinto: Stock Of The Day
---------------------------


In the mining sector, **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) held up well, rising nearly 2%, despite a 1.2% decline for the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF ([XME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XME)). Rio Tinto, Monday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mining-stocks-boom-rio-tinto-stock-sets-up/), is back near highs as it forms the right side of a cup base.



Monday's session yielded a couple of breakouts from **HarborOne Bancorp** ([HONE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HONE)) and recent IPO **Cricut** ([CRCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRCT)).


Massachusetts-based HarborOne is a member of IBD's exclusive [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) screen. It's a small-cap stock and thinly traded with an average daily dollar volume of $3.8 million. Nonetheless, the stock gapped out of a flat base with a 14.42 buy point and closed strongly.


Cricut broke out powerfully from an IPO base, helped by several positive analyst comments. Cricut makes smart machines that allow its community of 3.7 million user to make personalized crafts. Goldman Sachs brought Cricut public last month at 20 a share. It was an inauspicious debut, though, because the stock opened at 15.80 and closed at 17.80 on its first day of trading.

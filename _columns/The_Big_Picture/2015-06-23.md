======================================

The stock market inched higher Tuesday as the rally from last week's lows starts to moderate. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed 0.1% higher. Small caps did a little better, with the Russell 2000 adding 0.3%. It was an unremarkable day, and not just because of the indexes' meager movements.

  

Volume eased on the Nasdaq but rose slightly on the NYSE. Friday's quadruple witching skewed volume comparisons for that day and for Monday, so Tuesday's volume was a more-normalized measure.

  

Breadth was positive but unimpressive. Winners topped losers by 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq and by 7-to-5 on the NYSE.

  

The Nasdaq made another record high. But now comes the hard part â€” making the new gains stick.

  

Indexes have made it a habit this year of making new highs and falling back into their long price channels. That rhythmic trend is reason alone to be cautious and be watching for a pullback.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have a little air left before they hit the ceiling of their price channels.

  

A half-dozen distribution days are a reminder that institutional investors have taken profits lately.

  

Some other indications, though, bode well at least for the short term.

  

Since touching lows a couple of weeks ago, the broad indexes have tended to close near session highs. Chart readers consider that a bullish sign.

  

Perhaps most important, many leading stocks are building on breakouts after weeks of lackluster trading.

  

In the IBD 50, **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)), **Outerwall** ([OUTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OUTR)) and **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) are some of the awakening leaders. Ultimately, it's how much a stock rises from its buy point that matters, much more so than the quality of its breakout.

  

Some fresh breakouts are spicing up the leaders, too.

  

On Tuesday, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) roared out of a flat base in more than double its average volume. **Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)) cleared the 54.70 buy point of a flat base but volume was only about average.

  

Retail, energy, metal, automaker and consumer electronics were among the best-performing stocks.

  

The leading sectors, as shown in the IBD NYSE and Nasdaq tables, reflect growing confidence among consumers and businesses. Apparel, semiconductors, software and consumer sectors are in the top several sectors.

  

The medical sector is near the top, too. In that area, providers of research equipment and services are an emerging group.

  

**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Parexel International** ([PRXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRXL)) have broken out of bases. **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) (discussed [here](http://news.investors.com/investing-international-leaders/062315-758613-icon-tinkers-with-share-buybacks.htm)) is forming a base. The group is in the top 25 of 197 industry groups and climbing.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 also is at a new high, as are the S&P retail, software and banking indexes.

  

Among a mixed batch of economic reports, new home sales came in at a seven-year high, breezing past forecasts. Homebuilder stocks were little changed.

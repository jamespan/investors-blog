The stock market rallied out of the red to end the session higher following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's long-awaited Jackson Hole speech. Now more key inflation data lies ahead.




The Nasdaq composite managed to reverse higher to end the session up 0.9%. It also netted a weekly gain of more than 2%. Nevertheless, it remains below [the key 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). The tech-heavy index is now up almost 31% so far in 2023.


The S&P 500 also battled its way out of negative territory as it turned in a gain of 0.7%. A weekly lift of less than 1% saw it edge closer to its 50-day line. The benchmark index is up more than 15% for the year.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, climbing 0.7%. It looks to be finding support at 34,000, a significant level over the past year. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) were the top performers here.


Small caps managed to end in the green, with the Russell 2000 lifting 0.4%. Growth stocks also gained, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) up 0.7%.


Nevertheless, the stock market remains in a correction. IBD continues to recommending an exposure range of 0%-20%.


Stock Market Shrugs Off Powell Speech
-------------------------------------


Stocks whipsawed following the much-awaited Economic Symposium speech from Fed Chair Powell, where he once again said inflation is "too high."


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP082523-300x284.jpg)He said central bankers are "prepared to raise rates further if appropriate" and he also reiterated their determination to hold monetary policy at a "restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective."


But stocks ultimately shook off an initial negative reaction to turn higher by the end of the session.


"The market may have been comforted by Powell acknowledging that recent inflationary data has been encouraging and thus, interest rates are unlikely to move much higher from here," Commonwealth Financial Network head of investment management Brian Price said in a note to clients. "At this point the market appears to believe that one more interest rate hike is likely before the Fed hits pause."


The odds for a quarter-point hike or more in November have now risen, according to CME FedWatch.


Investors will now turn their attention to a swathe of new economic data dropping next week, including the latest PCE index numbers on Thursday. This is the important as it is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.


Additionally, the ADP employment report drops Wednesday while the U.S. nonfarm payroll numbers are out Friday. With the jobs market continuing to run hot, these will be keenly watched.


And while earnings season has started to wind down, the likes of **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) are all set to report.

Automakers Boost Stock Market
-----------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors all finished in the green, with consumer discretionary and energy the top performers. Communication services and materials made the slimmest gains.


The performance of the IBD industry groups offered further insight into the stock market action.


Telecom infrastructure stocks, dairy products plays and toy companies were among the best performers. Automakers also shined, with a 3.7% gain for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) doing the heavy lifting.


On the flip side, computer hardware stocks, specialty retailers, home furnishings plays and foreign banks lagged.

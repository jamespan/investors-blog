Nasdaq Has Best Day Since Election; Apple Breaks Out
=====================================================

U.S. stocks rumbled higher Friday, as the Nasdaq posted its biggest percentage gain since Nov. 7, the session before President Trump's election victory.




The Nasdaq lunged 2.2% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 0.8%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.7%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. The Sept. 25 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) was removed because the Nasdaq has climbed more than 5% since then.


Friday's story belonged to the megacaps, which with market capitalizations above $100 billion are the biggest of the big caps. Gainers among megacaps included:


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rose 3.6% as it cleared a 160.97 entry in cup-with-handle base. The breakout is second stage, which is still fairly young in a stock's long-term advance. Volume was 64% above average, validating the breakout.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP102717-177x300.png)Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) shot up nearly 8% in volume 305% above average. Intel broke out Oct. 2, clearing a nine-month consolidation. Intel reported earnings that topped the consensus view by 26%.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) moved up 6.4% Friday. The stock broke out in late August, but then moved around hesitantly for about four weeks The stock's Q3 earnings beat the Street estimate by 17%.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) jumped 4.3% in volume 233% above average. The stock broke out of a consolidation that dated to early June. Earnings exceeded the average estimate by 15%.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) hurdled more than 4% higher in more than twice its usual volume. The stock climbed back above a 175.59 buy point and remains in the 5% buy zone.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) swung 13.2% higher in volume 426% faster than usual. The base, though, was late stage, which raises the risk of failure. Earnings trounced views.


Economic data gave President Trump something to brag about, especially vs. the experts. GDP was stronger than expected, an impressive accomplishment considering the battering the U.S. economy took from hurricanes. The first take on Q3 GDP came in at 3%, slightly below Q2's 3.1% reading.


In July, Fed Chair Janet Yellen told Congress that achieving 3% growth in the economy would be "challenging."


Trump is expected to name his choice to head the Federal Reserve before he leaves on Nov. 3 for a 12-day trip to Asia.


Distribution Day Erased
-----------------------


A distribution day fell off the Nasdaq because of a 5% intraday gain from the Sept. 25 close. The count is now at four in the Nasdaq. A distribution day involves a sizable loss in a major index. Such action points to institutional selling.

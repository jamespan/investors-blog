The major stock indexes closed lower Thursday, as the stock market dealt with the fallout of President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs. Up next, Wall Street is braced for Friday's critical inflation data.


Blue chips on the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5%, holding just above its long-term 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.4%.




Volume eased on the Nasdaq, but rose on the New York Stock Exchange compared with Wednesday's session. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors moved lower, with energy and communication services pacing the losers. The consumer staples sector was the clear winner of the session.


Late Wednesday, [President Trump announced 25% tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/tariffs-auto-stocks-getting-hit-in-the-stock-market/) on "all cars that are not made in the United States." The tariffs, effective April 2, will be in addition to any duties already in place. The new Trump tariffs apparently will cover finished autos, not auto parts. The goal is for automakers to set up more assembly plants in the U.S., especially from Canada and Mexico.


"Our automobile business will flourish like it's never flourished before," Trump said, but the tariffs could cause industry disruptions and spur significantly higher auto prices for U.S. drivers. Word of the auto tariffs surfaced before Wednesday's close.


In response, **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) tumbled more than 7% and nearly 4%, respectively. Among foreign automakers, **Stellantis** ([STLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLA)) was down more than 1%. **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)) fell nearly 3% while **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) reversed up more than 3%.


The Commerce Department Friday morning is set to release its February personal income and outlays report. Included in the report is the core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Federal Reserve's favored inflation indicator. The core PCE price index is expected to rise 0.3% on the month, with an annual increase of 2.7%, according to Econoday estimates.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MP032725.jpg)


In the wake of Wednesday's tech-fueled sell-off, IBD downgraded the recommended exposure level to 0%-20% from 20%-40%. That's a clear sign that caution continues to be the prudent choice, which is a key element of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/).


The recent failed follow-through day underscores the importance of wading into and out of the market. Not all follow-through days succeed, but no market uptrend has started without one.


Investors should be on the lookout for another [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), which could happen anytime now, before putting more capital to work.


Instead of buying stocks, [investors should be creating new watchlists](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) with stocks that are holding up best in the current stock market correction. These could be some of the next uptrend's market leaders. And many previous leaders are moving up the right sides of new bases, [like](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-spotify-stocks-seen-as-safe-harbor/) **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). These stocks could reemerge as market leaders if the market confirms a new uptrend.


An easy way to identify market leaders is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) to gauge an individual stock's relative performance. A rising relative strength line shows a stock is outperforming the S&P 500, while a downtrending line shows the reverse.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured one new stock Thursday, which makes sense given the heavy losses on the major stock indexes Wednesday. But the Near Pivot list has grown to 20 ideas, a sign that an expanding number are poised for a potential move higher.

Stocks Market Leaders To Watch: DoorDash, Life Time, Spotify
------------------------------------------------------------


Amid the ongoing stock market volatility, now is not the time to be raising exposure in growth stocks. Doing so would be fighting the current stock market trend. Instead, keep an eye on market leaders holding up and approaching new buy points, including **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)), **Life Time** ([LTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTH)) and **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)).



[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) DoorDash is building a short cup base that offers a 215.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [IBD MarketSurge chart analysis](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). An early entry is in play at 201.03, the high price on March 25. The RS line is close to hitting a new high, a bullish indicator of market leadership.


Fitness leader Life Time is building a six-week cup base that offers a 33.64 entry. An early entry at 32.85, this week's high price, is also an option. Its RS line hit a new high this week.



Finally, [Spotify](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-spotify-stocks-seen-as-safe-harbor/) is tracing a cup that has a 652.63 buy point. An alternate buy trigger at 621.20 can also be seen.

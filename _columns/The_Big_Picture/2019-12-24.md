  Growth Stocks Shine On Quiet Christmas Eve; What The Economy Needs In 2020

Most growth stocks showed small changes on the Christmas holiday-shortened session on Tuesday, but the general market kept its mood of giving. Small caps showed a touch of outperformance, in line with what's been witnessed throughout the fourth quarter.




While the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell less than 0.1%, the Nasdaq composite gained almost 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 rose 0.2% to mark a new 52-week closing high. Volume shrank vs. Monday's full session; Wall Street closed at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday.


[Looking at the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), virtually all of the components moved fractionally in quiet-as-a-mouse turnover. And trading just might stay that way on Thursday and Friday. But the Santa Claus rally remains fully intact after U.S. and Chinese negotiators finally hammered out a phase-one agreement on trade and related economic issues during the first week of December.


Among ETFs, iShares China Large Cap ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) has rallied 6.8% since its Dec. 3 low. Earlier this week, China announced it would cut import taxes on 859 items starting Jan. 1.

Take the [new highs list delivered by Wall Street on Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-dec-23-2019/). IBD counted as many as 382 companies marking a new 52-week or all-time peak on either the Nasdaq or NYSE. (Go to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to track these stats each day. Click on "New Highs" and you'll see the leading sectors of stocks rushing into new high ground.)

Beyond Growth Stocks: How Much Money Will Flow Back Into This Sector?
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Look at the Reuters/Jefferies CRB commodity index, a broad basket of "hard" and "soft" commodity products, and you'll see that headed into this week, it's up almost 9% year to date, according to the latest IBD Weekly. That's trifling compared with the nearly 29% rocket boost by the S&P 500 since Jan. 1, excluding dividends. The Nasdaq, ending Tuesday at 8952 and delivering new highs, is up 35% year to date.


Yet gold and solar stocks, as noted in [today's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live), have certainly made some noise lately.



**Franco Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)) is trying to break out again and clear stubborn resistance near 100. Small cap **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)), a leader in micro inverters and rival to the stock showcased in [today's Stock Spotlight](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/solar-stocks-why-stock-spotlight-shines-on-this-industry-leading-solar-company/), is carving the right side of a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) that has a 27.71 early [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Even Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which tends not to have as many cyclical stocks due to their wildly swinging profits, holds a 26.4% advance year to date. In 2018, the ETF fell 16.8% after galloping 34% ahead the prior year.


Among the [top 40 industry groups ranked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-23-2019/) for six-month performance, gold and silver miners, wood products, paints, alternative energy, and ship transport represent the commodity contingent.

The Economy In 2020
-------------------


The market, always sensitive to changes in perception of the economy, could see more volatility in 2020 as the U.S. presidential election approaches.


Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, standing pat on the cost of money this month after cutting short-term interest rates in July, September and October, really doesn't have as much rope this time around to slash interest rates further to prevent or halt a future economic contraction.


With the Fed funds rate already down to a 1.5%-1.75% target rate, some would like to see a much bigger rebound in capital expenditures by corporations to help keep the moderate GDP growth rate, currently at 2%, from slowing.


"We saw a lot of preordering (by businesses) ahead of the tariffs in 2018. Then, orders essentially stopped," George Mateyo, chief investment officer at Cleveland-based Key Private Bank, told IBD in a phone interview. Mateyo added that companies needed to replenish inventories in 2019, helping boost capex a bit. But more business spending would help.


Mateyo notes that increased demand for 5G wireless networks, business-related software, a return to growth in the manufacturing sectors and further rebound in the housing market would support equities next year. Another positive? Inflation remains tame, as the PCE (personal consumption expenditure deflator) index, watched closely by the U.S. central bank, hit the Fed's 2% target just one month in all of 2019.Â The PCE index surpassed the 2% target more than half the time last year.


Thus, when it comes to long-term Treasury bonds, "I think it's fairly valued," Mateyo said. On Tuesday, the benchmark 10-year U.S. government bond yielded 1.90% vs. 1.62% for two-year notes and 1.58% for 3-month T-bills. Low interest rates benefit growth stocks, for sure.

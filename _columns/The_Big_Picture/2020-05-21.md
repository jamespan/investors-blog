The stock market ended near the day's lows after the major stock indexes reversed lower following mild gains just after the open. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the major indexes lower, closing with a nearly 1% decline in a volatile session.




Large-cap technology stocks underperformed, with the Nasdaq 100 falling more than 1.1%. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved down a milder 0.4%, buoyed by a 4% advance in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) after an analyst upgrade. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a slight gain.


Leading growth stocks also lagged; [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) slid 1%. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and was indicated lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Avoids Distribution Day
------------------------------------


The Nasdaq reversed lower Thursday, but the lighter volume indicated that major institutional selling was absent. With still only one day of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq (May 12), the uptrend remains in a bullish mode. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 still only has a couple of distribution days, indicating positive sentiment still outweighs the negative.


On a bearish note, leading tech stocks did show more weakness than usual. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) slid 2.55%. **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) dropped 2.1%. **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) lost 3.3%. And **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) fell 3.1%. Dow Jones chip giant **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) gave up Wednesday's 62.23 buy point with a 1.8% retreat. On the upside, **Facebook**  ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) climbed 0.6%, extending gains above a buy point, but gave up a large portion of the day's early advance.



Breakout Stocks To Watch: Alphabet, ASML, Trade Desk
----------------------------------------------------


Top stocks near buy points in the current stock market rally include FANG stock **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), chip leader **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and IBD 50 stock **Trade** **Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)).


Alphabet nudged over a 1,415.63 buy point in a cup with handle — according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) — before closing below the entry. During a stock's breakout day, the stock should leave no question of its strength. Be on the lookout for a stronger move in heavy volume to indicate the stock is ready to overcome resistance.

Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Alphabet stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-alphabet-inc-cl-a-googl.aspx) has a 97 out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), ASML, fell slightly below its 319.32 buy point after a 2% drop Thursday. The latest entry comes on the heels of a breakout above a 306 buy point in a cup with handle on May 8.


According to [IBD commentary](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/asml-stock-gaps-up-above-buy-point/), "ASML stock is extended from that alternate entry point so taking a small position is more prudent than a full position, according to [IBD trading guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/)."


Thursday's [IBD 50 Stock To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/growth-stocks-to-watch-ibd-50-leader-trade-desk-nears-potential-breakout/) pick, Trade Desk, is adding a handle to cup base, moving the correct buy point to 327.45. A May 7 breakout above a 323.88 buy point in a cup base failed, bringing the new entry into play.


After Thursday's 2.6% gain, Trade Desk is about 7% away from the new buy point.

Earnings To Watch: Alibaba, Nvidia, Pinduoduo, Splunk
-----------------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, earnings continue to be a driving force behind big stock moves. After the stock market close Thursday, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock idea **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and software leader **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) reported their quarterly results. Chinese e-commerce giants **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) [will report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-stock-pinduoduo-first-quarter-earnings/) ahead of the stock market open Friday.


Late Thursday, Nvidia reported strong quarterly results, beating top- and bottom-line estimates. The company's Q2 revenue forecast also topped estimates. Nvidia stock swung between modest gains and losses after the close.


According to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) commentary, "Nvidia is extended from a 275.50 cup-with-handle buy point as well as an alternate handle entry of 299.10. It's a three-quarter position on Leaderboard."


Data pioneer Splunk reported [weaker-than-expected sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/splunk-first-quarter-results-mixed-outlook-falls-short/) and forecast disappointing revenue growth for the current quarter. Splunk turned sharp losses into a modest gain in the after-hours session. Splunk stock ended Thursday in the 5% buy zone above a cup-with-handle's 161.90 buy point. The buy area runs up to 170.


Wall Street expects Alibaba to report adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share, down 34% from the year-ago period, on revenue of $15.1 billion. Alibaba stock slid below a 216.20 buy point in a cup with handle Thursday with a 2.1% decline after a breakout on May 19.


Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Pinduoduo to report an adjusted loss of 32 cents a share, vs. an 18-cent loss in the year-ago period. Pinduoduo has yet to show a profit. Analysts expect revenue of $741 million, up 9.5%. Pinduoduo stock is pulling back from its highs after rising as much as 53% from a 45.35 buy point.

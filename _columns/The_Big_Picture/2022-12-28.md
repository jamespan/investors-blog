Coal Stocks Burned, Bear Market Rally Loses More Traction; Outlook Gets This Downgrade
=======================================================================================

Rather than chalk up another Santa Claus rally this year, the bear market on Wednesday gave investors another lump of coal.




Plus, sellers gave coal stocks a lump of their own.


Small caps led the widespread decline. While the Russell 2000 sank almost 1.6%, the Nasdaq composite slipped almost 1.4%. That marked the tech-centered index's third decline in four days and melted away 4.6% more of the Nasdaq's market value. The S&P 500 dropped 1.2%, the Dow 1.1%.


Long-dated U.S. government bonds also sold off, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up 2 basis points to 3.88%.


Volume edged up on the Nasdaq vs. Tuesday's post-Christmas holiday session and appeared mildly lower on the NYSE in early data.

The Nasdaq went into the session carrying five days of intense professional selling, and six for the S&P 500. The Nasdaq marked its lowest close since July 2, 2020.


Perhaps more importantly, amid generally quiet trading expected for the remainder of the year, price matters more lately. And the size of the price declines continued to stay weighty. Moreover, the loss of most gains by key equity indexes since an [Oct. 21 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-roars-back-to-life-amid-new-fed-hopes-these-stocks-shine-brightest/) means that it's still very hard to make money going long.


That Oct. 21 session delivered the latest attempt to put a lid on the bear market. But after Wednesday's close, the lagging Nasdaq, at 10,213, has now fallen 6% below the close of that [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/). The bear market has also squeezed the S&P 500's gain over the same period to less than 1%.


Hence, Wednesday marks a new downgrade in the current outlook for stocks to market in correction.


This means cash is the best position for now. Keep exposure in stocks limited to the 0%-20% range. Short sales may also get serious consideration.


The last time IBD put the outlook at the worst possible state was Sept. 16.

Coal's Lump
-----------


At the start of Wednesday's session, futures pointed toward a mild open among the benchmarks. Yet that certainly wasn't the case for natural gas. Futures in natural gas dropped throughout the session and closed 7.3% lower. At one point, gas hit a new multi-month low of $4.46 per million BTUs.


Even worse than the bear market decline in stocks, natural gas has now collapsed 55% from its year-to-date peak of $10.02.


Is this bear market in natural gas signaling a message about the economy in 2023? Or, have European nations secured enough supplies to get through the winter amid tight sanctions toward Russian energy commodities? Whatever the reason, the tremendous slide delivered a serious punch Wednesday to at least one top industry group of 2022: coal stocks.



**Consol Energy** ([CEIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEIX)) dove 11% to 63.74. It undercut the 50-day moving average for the first time in more than a month. Volume raced 143% higher than its average over the past 50 sessions.


The small cap still has an excellent gain for the year, up more than 180%. Yet the latest breakout attempt past a 74.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a base that has the elements of a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) didn't bear much fruit. In fact, since the Nov. 29 rally attempt, CEIX has now fallen more than 17% from the 74.09 entry. That justifies new buyers in the stock to employ the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Has Consol etched a bearish double top? Hard to know right now. Many market observers still hold a bullish view toward commodities given the havoc that Russia has wreaked upon global energy markets. But it's worth watching closely.


The 98 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) surely looks grand. But keep in mind, that incorporates 12 months' worth of action. The RS Rating is not designed for timing one's sells. Even the three-month RS Rating, found in [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), was still pretty good at 82 headed into Wednesday's sell-off.


IBD's coal group has just 12 names. But the sell-off pushed not just Consol Energy but also **Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) and **Peabody Energy** ([BTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BTU)) below their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). **Alpha Metallurgical Resources** ([AMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMR)), **Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)) and **Alliance Resource Partners** ([ARLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARLP)) all took out their [long-term 200-day lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/), another bearish sign for the energy market in general.


Light sweet crude oil futures fell 0.9% to $78.79 a barrel. The popular grade of oil peaked in early March at $130.50.

Bear Market Internals
---------------------


Meanwhile, breadth continues to wither. The latest bear market rally, for a while, helped give the NYSE's advance-decline line a positive slope. But on Wednesday, early data from ThinkOrSwim revealed losing stocks drowning out winners by a more than 4-1 ratio on the NYSE.


On the Nasdaq, decliners outmatched gainers 2-to-1.

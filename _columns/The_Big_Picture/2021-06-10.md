  S&P 500 Hits Record High As Inflation Heats Up; Tech Giant Alphabet Breaks Out

The stock market ended higher Thursday, as the S&P 500 set a record high in the wake of a [hotter-than-expected inflation report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/core-inflation-29-year-high-dow-jones-treasury-yields-rise-on-hot-cpi-report/). Internet giant **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) broke out past a new buy point.




Ahead of the stock market open, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose 5% from a year ago, the fastest pace since August 2008. Consumer inflation was expected to climb to 4.6%, up from April's 4.2% year-over-year gain. The consumer price index represents prices for a basket of goods including food, energy, groceries, housing costs and sales. Elevated inflation signs have caused some stock sell-offs. But this time, the market shrugged off the latest price alarm.


The 10-year Treasury yield briefly climbed above 1.53% early Thursday before reversing sharply lower. The 10-year Treasury yield traded just below 1.46% late Thursday.


The Nasdaq handily outperformed, rising 0.8% and ending near session highs. The S&P 500 rallied 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrials slashed gains to just 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.7%.

No. 46 [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Avantor** ([AVTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVTR)) advanced 5%, moving closer to a 34.09 buy point in a [flat base.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) Avantor was [Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/avantor-stock-eyes-breakout-as-shares-break-through-short-term-resistance/).


Volume appeared to fall on the Nasdaq and the NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The health of the market trend continues to improve following [last week's market upgrade](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-on-lukewarm-jobs-data-falling-rates-docusign-soars-on-earnings/). After being under pressure, the market shifted back into a confirmed uptrend as IBD changed its market outlook June 4. On Wednesday, the distribution-day count improved, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both lost a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), moving their respective counts to two and five.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq is challenging potential resistance around the 14,000 level. If the tech-heavy composite is able to decisively break through this level, then new highs could be on the near horizon.


With the [stock market health](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) more positive, investors should continue to raise their market exposure. Focus on stocks that are breaking out in heavy volume with strong [IBD Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) and [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).

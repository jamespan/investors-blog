Small Caps Lead Stock Market; Debt Ceiling Talks Stall, Adding Risk
====================================================================

With a boost from small caps, stock market indexes closed higher Monday but broad averages are still trying to settle on a clear direction.




Equal-weight indexes outperformed the main gauges. It was a rare triumph for the average stock in a market where megacaps have dominated gains.


Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) rose 0.6%, doubling the S&P 500's 0.3% increase. Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) also outperformed, up 1% vs. a 0.5% gain for the Nasdaq 100 and a 0.7% rise in the Nasdaq composite.


Breadth improved Monday. Nasdaq advancers beat decliners by a 9-5 ratio. Yet, Nasdaq volume was the lowest this year, according to Dow Jones Market Data. NYSE winners topped losers by 2-to-1. NYSE trading edged higher.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed only 0.1% as consumer components **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) lagged.


But small caps led, with the Russell 2000 jumping 1.2%. A bounce in regional banks — SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) rallied 1.2% — appeared to help the Russell.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP051523-213x300.jpg)The Nasdaq is on a moderate uptrend and at the highest levels since last August. But take away Big Tech, and the Nasdaq looks more like the S&P 500 — an index still searching for direction.


Since a rally ended in February, the S&P 500 is basically at the same level it was at the start of February. Most of the S&P's 7.7% year-to-date gain occurred in January. Since then, the stock market has remained adrift.


Market Facing Multiple Risks
----------------------------


The stock market's murky direction comes amid a series of risks that are difficult to measure. The market needs some clarity to be able to break out of its funk.


So far, there's no progress on negotiations over the federal debt ceiling, with only weeks to go before the government runs out of funds to pay its obligations. Republican and Democratic leaders [cannot even agree on the focus of talks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/late-start-for-debt-limit-talks-amps-up-pressure-on-congress-149fdf61?mod=hp_lead_pos6).


Rate policy is another risk. The Fed has signaled it is pausing its tightening moves, but it has also said it is not done dousing inflation.


Investors also are wondering if and when a rate cut may happen. Just one out of four traders is [betting on a rate hike](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) at the June Fed meeting, while about the same number expects a rate cut at the July meeting.


The threat of recession is another retardant on the stock market. Part of this is related to the liquidity woes of many regional banks. The crisis is unfolding piecemeal: One day a bank goes to its knees, then days go by without another flare up. Investors are left wondering when the next shoe will drop.


On Monday, the May [Empire State Manufacturing Index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) tumbled to a negative 31.8 reading, far worse than the -2.0 economists expected. It was also a sharp drop from March's 10.8 reading.


Stock Market Watching Retail Sector
-----------------------------------


Major retailers report quarterly results this week, starting with **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) Tuesday morning. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), the nation's largest retailer, and **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) also will report.



Also Tuesday morning, the U.S. Census Bureau will announce April [retail sales](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559417&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top). Economists polled by Econoday expect a 0.7% increase from the previous month, or 0.4% without autos. The sales data covers durables and nondurables portions of consumer spending, which is the lion's share of GDP.


Combined with retailer earnings, investors should get a good look at the American consumer at a time when [foot traffic at stores is slowing](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/walmart-stock-big-week-for-retail-earnings-as-it-rides-bullish-chart/).


Also on the economic front, [Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm) alongside former chair Ben Bernanke in Washington, D.C., on Friday.


The IBD 50 rose nearly 0.5% Monday. **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and **Technoglass** ([TGLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGLS)) hit 52-week or multimonth highs.


Some of the best action came outside the IBD 50.


 **Onto Innovation** ([ONTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONTO)) jumped past the 89.85 buy point of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in heavy trade. **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) broke out of a flat base and is in buy range of a 177.65 buy point. The aviation components maker acquired privately held Wencor Group for about $2 billion.


These are bullish moves but investors have to hope major benchmarks can continue their advance. Many breakouts this year have made just modest progress from their buy points.

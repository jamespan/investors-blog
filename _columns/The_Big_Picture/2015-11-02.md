Stocks kicked off the week on solid ground, scoring big gains on a busy day of merger news. Small caps outperformed, and the Nasdaq 100 hit a 15-year high.

  

The Russell 2000 small-cap index jumped 2.1%, the Nasdaq added 1.5%, the S&P 500 rose 1.2%, and the Dow picked up 0.9%. Volume fell from Friday's levels.

  

Breadth was solid, with advancing stocks beating decliners on the NYSE by more than 4 to 1. The ratio was slightly lower on the Nasdaq.

  

Shares of **Dyax** ([DYAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DYAX)) soared 28% after Ireland-based **Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)) agreed to buy the orphan-drug specialist for $5.9 billion.

  

Meanwhile, **MedAssets** ([MDAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDAS)) surged 31% after it agreed to be taken private by a private-equity firm for $2.7 billion in cash.

  

The Nasdaq 100 gained 1.2%. **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) were among the best percentage gainers, rising nearly 4% each, ahead of earnings later this week. Regeneron reports Wednesday before the open; Celgene reports Thursday before the open.

  

The biotech industry group did well overall, rising more than 5%. Steel and oil drilling stocks also outperformed, but they've been lagging the market for some time now, ranking near the bottom of IBD's 197 industry group rankings based on six-month price performance.

  

In terms of the broad market, it was another impressive performance for the major averages amid a fairly high distribution-day count for the S&P 500. The good news is that several times this year, the market showed that it could rally, even with an elevated count.

  

Five distribution days might seem like more than normal , but the average price decline on those five days was 0.5%, with the worst being 0.7%. That's hardly indicative of harsh institutional selling.

  

All in all, the market uptrend remains intact, which means investors shouldn't be shy about putting money to work. But many stocks have moved a lot since the S&P 500's follow-through on Oct. 2, so be careful not to buy extended stocks. Continue to scan growth screens like the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Stocks On The Move, seeking those in bullish chart setups.

  

IBD 50 name **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) is working on a later-stage flat base with an 80.95 buy point.

  

The IBD 50 itself turned in another so-so performance, rising 1.1%. Since the S&P 500's follow-through day on Oct. 2, the index is up close to 6%, underperforming the S&P 500's gain of nearly 8%.

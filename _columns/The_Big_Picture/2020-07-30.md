The stock market pulled back sharply early Thursday after Q2 GDP crashed, but the major stock indexes rebounded the remainder of the trading session, ending near the day's highs. The Nasdaq composite reversed to a solid gain after falling as much as 1.2%.




The Nasdaq closed 0.4% higher, while the S&P 500 fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9%, or 225 points. Dow Jones leader **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) soared after reporting earnings after the close. Fellow tech giants **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) also reported late Thursday and their shares rose.


Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.4%. Leading growth stocks ended higher, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied 0.1%,


Nasdaq Stages Bullish Upside Reversal
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP_5x3_080320-236x300.jpg)At the stock market open, the Nasdaq fell as much as 1.2% after the Commerce Department said [Q2 GDP crashed 32.9%](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/unemployment-benefit-claims-economy-stalling-gdp-plunge-dow-jones/), a record-setting plunge, due to the coronavirus-driven lockdowns. Economists expected a 34.7% dive. The Nasdaq reversed higher midday and closed near the day's highs.


Despite an elevated count of [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) on the S&P 500, the Nasdaq still has a relatively light distribution-day count at three, so investors should still be in a mostly bullish mindset.


The S&P 500 avoided a distribution day Thursday when NYSE volume fell from Wednesday. Nasdaq volume rose.


Meanwhile, top growth stocks continue to act well. New breakouts occur seemingly every day. On Thursday, **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) and **Skyworks** **Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) broke out past new buy points.

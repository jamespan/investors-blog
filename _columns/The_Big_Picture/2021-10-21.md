The major stock indexes finished mostly higher Thursday, as the S&P 500 hit a record high. Amid the strengthening stock market rally, IPO stocks **Argo Blockchain** ([ARBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARBK)), **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) and **Olaplex** ([OLPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLPX)) are trying to break out past new buy points.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The stock market opened lower Thursday, as the 10-year Treasury yield rallied to just under 1.68%, rising for a fifth straight session. The 10-year Treasury yield is at its highest level since May 19.


But the Nasdaq quickly righted itself, reversing 0.6% higher, while the S&P 500 eventually rallied 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched lower, weighed down by a 9.6% plunge in shares of **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)). IBM [missed sales targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-stock-drops-on-quarterly-earnings-report/) late Wednesday. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.3% after an erratic session.


Leading growth stocks sharply climbed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 1.2%. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Upwork** ([UPWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPWK)) rallied 4.1%. It is tracing a cup base with a 64.59 buy point. Be on the lookout for a potential handle to offer a lower entry.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP102121-300x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and appeared to inch higher on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers.


What To Do Now
--------------


The stock market rally put in a solid performance Thursday, as the S&P 500 hit a record high and marked its seventh straight gain. The Nasdaq easily recovered from Wednesday's small loss and made its highest close since Sept. 9.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which reached new highs Wednesday, erased most of its earlier losses.


Investors should be adding exposure to new breakouts in top growth stocks. But stay disciplined and be sure to cut losses quickly if breakouts start to fade. Keep in mind that Q3 earnings season is in full swing. Strong earnings can fuel top stocks to previously untouched levels, so be on the lookout for [breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/).


On the downside, disappointing announcements can send shares tumbling. For example, **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) crashed as much as 30% in extended trade Thursday after the [company missed revenue estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-how-will-it-react-to-earnings/). Snap shares are now plunging below the 50-day moving average.

Stocks To Watch: Argo Blockchain, Dutch Bros, Olaplex
-----------------------------------------------------


A number of IPO stocks continued to outperform. Argo Blockchain, Dutch Bros and Olaplex finished in or near new buy areas, additional signs of a strengthening stock market uptrend.


Argo Blockchain stock is trying to break out past its first buy point — a 19.43 entry in an IPO base — according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The stock pared gains to 4% Thursday and closed below the entry. Argo is part of IBD's [IPO Leaders screen](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/cryptocurrency-leader-argo-blockchain-eyes-is-breaking-out-today-as-bitcoin-hits-record-highs/).


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows [Argo Blockchain shares](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-argo-blockchain-plc-ads-arbk.aspx) with a good but not great 87 [IBD Composite Rating.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) A loss in 2019 appears to hurt that rating, although analysts expect $1.09 in 2021 earnings from 4 cents in 2020.


Dutch Bros closed further below a 62.10 buy point in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) following Tuesday's breakout move. Shares are about 2% below the buy point after two straight days of losses. Dutch Bros stock fell 1.4% Thursday.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Olaplex cleared an IPO base entry at 27.84 Thursday, advancing 7.8% to close in the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/). The buy area tops out at 29.23. Per Leaderboard analysis, it also cleared an aggressive trend-line entry near 27.


All three IPO stock leaders have [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) at new highs, confirming their roles as stock market leaders.

title: Nasdaq Leads Stock Gains, But Is The Market's Climb Already Fading?

The Nasdaq composite climbed to a record high and small caps led Tuesday, although the weeklong market advance showed signs of moderating.




The Nasdaq added 0.4% and topped the previous summit it reached on March 13. The composite's gain for 2018 is now 10.6%, which easily beats the S&P 500's 2.8% increase and the Dow Jones industrial average's meager 0.3% gain.


On Tuesday, the S&P 500 inched up 0.1% as S&P-leaning sectors such as energy, utilities and financials lagged. The Dow eased 0.1%. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) lost 0.9% and met resistance at the 50-day moving average — the fourth time in the past five weeks. Still, there weren't many big losers among the Dow components. Volume rose on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MP060518-221x300.jpg)Uptrends in price this year have had shorter duration lately, and the indexes slowed their advance Tuesday. The Nasdaq's gain was smaller than the 1.5% and 0.7% increases of the previous two days.


The S&P 500, up 1.1% and 0.5% Friday and Monday, was barely higher Tuesday. Is the market's advance of the past five days already running out of steam?


A pullback may not be surprising, but the market is not necessarily looking tired. Besides the Nasdaq's new high, it is significant that the S&P 500 has cleared last month's resistance around 2740.


Curiously, the Nasdaq composite made a new high even while technology stocks didn't lead so much. The SPDR S&P Software & Services ([XSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XSW)) ETF rose 0.8% to a new high, but SPDR S&P Semiconductor ([XSD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XSD)) and SPDR Technology ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) rose only 0.3%. IShares Nasdaq Biotech ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) was flat.


Instead, the Nasdaq got some of its strength from a few major components such as **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), up 1.8% to a new high. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rose 1.5%, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) 1.1% and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) 0.5%.


That's not to say the composite's advance lacks breadth: The advance-decline line made a new high this week and about 275 Nasdaq-listed stocks hit new highs Tuesday.


The S&P 500's April 30 distribution day became too old to count any longer, leaving the index with six [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). That's still more than usual, but one of those was a stalling session with a modest gain. In fact, the S&P 500 is now higher than the closing price of any of its six distribution days. In other words, a continued advance could extinguish some of these distribution days by virtue of price progress rather than by time.


Small Caps Outperform
---------------------


Small caps also deserved credit for Tuesday's gains. The Russell 2000 rose 0.7% to a new high. The index's relative strength line has been trending higher since March, illustrating the power of small caps compared with the S&P 500.


Retail, mining, materials, consumer discretionary and telecom were the leading sectors. Strength continued in apparel, where a few breakout appeared.



**Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)) climbed back above the 26.30 [buy point of a cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy volume. **Tilly's** ([TLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLYS)) broke out of a lopsided base, clearing a 15.55 buy point.


**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). The stock, which is being added to the S&P 500 Thursday, is in buy range from its 78.38 buy point. The discount retailer was added to [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as an option play ahead of the earnings report Wednesday evening.


Leading stocks outperformed much of the market. The IBD 50 rose 0.6%.


But solar stocks dimmed as the industry group continued to come under pressure. **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) fell sharply for a second straight day after Bank of America downgraded the stock to neutral from buy. It also made a steep cut in the price target to 63 from 83. **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) fell further below the 50-day line.


The industry and Chinese solar stocks in particular have tumbled after China decided to suspend construction of new solar farms and slash subsidies. That move could result in an oversupply in China's solar market spilling over to the U.S. market, according to a BofA analyst quoted in [Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/18/06/11830286/bank-of-america-cites-chinese-policy-decision-in-first-).

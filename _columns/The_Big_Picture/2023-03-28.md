Stock Market Climbs Off Lows Despite Tech Selling; Nasdaq, S&P 500 Battle Near Key Levels
==========================================================================================

Several leading technology stocks succumbed to some profit-taking in the stock market Tuesday in a low-volume session. Semiconductor stocks lagged in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), with top stocks like **Aehr Test Systems** ([AEHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEHR)), **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)) and **Axcelis Technologies** ([ACLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACLS)) ending with losses of at least 3.5%.




Aehr's price action is another reminder that it's a challenging environment for new buys with the stock market in a correction. The chip equipment leader broke out on March 21 and scored an all-time high two days later. But shares are down 7% so far this week ahead of Thursday's earnings report.


After getting turned away at the 12,000 mark last week, the Nasdaq composite pared losses into the close, ending with a loss of just over 0.4%. The index closed above its 50-day moving average on the 12th day of its rally attempt. The Nasdaq has been consolidating in constructive fashion, pulling back in light volume.


The door is still open for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), although the longer the Nasdaq continues its rally attempt without one, the less likely it is that a follow-through day will have legs. The most powerful follow-through days have generally occurred in a four-to-seven-session window after the first day of the rally attempt.


The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) fought back for a loss of 0.5% after falling 1.3% intraday. The Nasdaq 100 is still holding above the 300 level and its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Stock Market Today
------------------


Declining stocks on the Nasdaq outnumbered advancers but only by a small margin. The ratio was less than 2-to-1.

Stock market leaders like **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) and **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) also fell sharply, but both stocks closed above their 21-day lines.


There were some bright spots in the MarketSmith Growth 250. After a bullish move off lows in strong volume, **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) jumped 4.7%. It's near the top of an eight-week-old consolidation that shows a 160.98 buy point.


**Skyline Champion** ([SKY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKY)), a maker of factory-built homes and member of the [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com), soared 3.6% and broke out over a trendline. SKY's weekly chart shows a big [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) with a 73.50 entry.


With the stock market in a correction, Leaderboard is conservatively invested at just over 40%. If the Nasdaq and S&P 500 confirm a new uptrend with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/), it could give an opportunity to increase exposure. For now, growth investors should favor a healthy cash position.


S&P 500 Rallies Off Lows
------------------------


After getting turned away at its 50-day moving average last week, the S&P 500 eased less than 0.2%. The benchmark index is still holding above its 200-day moving average, a key support level to watch. But overhead supply is still an issue for the S&P 500, with the index below its 50-day line and the 4,000 level.


Beaten-down oil and gas stocks outperformed in the S&P 500, helped by rising oil prices, but actionable charts in the sector are in short supply. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled at $73.20 a barrel, up 0.5%.


Winners beat losers on the NYSE by less than 2-to-1.

Inside the S&P 500, oil refiner **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)) jumped 3%, helped by positive comments from JPMorgan, which maintained an overweight rating and lifted VLO's price target to 172.


While several oil and gas stocks are on downtrends, VLO stock is only 10% off its high as it tries to move above its 50-day line and break out of a downtrend.


After rising above its 200-day line Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1% and is testing the line again. When  compared with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes, the Dow is one of the weaker indexes at this point, along with the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which fell mostly in line with blue chips Tuesday.


Interest Rate Outlook
---------------------


After jumping 15 basis points Monday to around 3.53%, the 10-year Treasury yield added an additional 4 basis points to 3.57%. Last week, the Federal Reserve hiked its key lending rate by another 25 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%. But the path of interest rates is still uncertain as the Fed continues to fight inflation while monitoring the recent sell-off in banking stocks.


The CME FedWatch tool showed a 57% chance that rates will stay right where they are at the May meeting, with a 43% chance that the Fed will again raise rates by another 25 basis points to 5% to 5.25%.


For the June meeting, futures traders see a 62% chance that the federal funds rate will be at 4.75% to 5%. By the end of the year, traders are expecting rate cuts to bring the fed funds rate down to 4.25% to 4.50%, amid persistent concerns about a sharp slowdown for the U.S. economy.

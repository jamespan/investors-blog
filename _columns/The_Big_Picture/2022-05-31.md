title: Nasdaq Stops Win Streak But Shows This Improvement Vs. April Debacle

The Nasdaq halted a three-day winning streak as the specter of inflation reared its ugly head again. Yet investors didn't seem to get spooked as much this time around.




Before the market's open, equity trading desks braced for what another sharp increase in crude oil prices might do to the fledgling uptrend. United States Oil Fund ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)), an ETF that tracks spot prices in the crude oil market, gapped up sharply at the open. As one can see in an intraday chart, during the first 15 minutes of trading the ETF reached a high of 88.32, up 3.3%.


And that turned out to be the peak.


By day's end, U.S. Oil Fund squandered that strong advance. A penny gain still preserved the exchange traded fund's win streak and now runs eight straight days. Yet it seemed that traders wanted to capture profits on the final day in May.


Look at the action in related companies such as **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) and **Shell** ([SHEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHEL)).



They too reversed off session highs to finish lower. Some did so in heavy volume, such as Devon (93% above its 50-day average). Shell, down 1.3% on Tuesday, closed just 7 pennies above its session low.


The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond jumped 10 basis points to 2.84%.


Beyond The Nasdaq
-----------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP-053122-230x300.jpg)Profit-taking also appeared in the coal space.


**Alpha Metallurgical** ([AMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMR)) dropped 9.8%. Volume ran 78% hotter than usual. Tuesday's slide marked AMR's biggest since a 16% drop on May 9. Yet in both instances, the small cap found buyers at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


**Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) slumped 9% but respected its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


The S&P 500 fell 0.6%. That's not a terrible way to end May, given that the large-cap index propelled 0.9%, 2% and 2.5% in the prior three up sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average backtracked 0.7%, snapping a six-session win streak.


Tuesday also showcased extreme inflation on the housing front. The Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 major cities noted a 2.4% adjusted rise in March vs. the prior month. The 20-city unadjusted index bolted 21.2%, surpassing a 20.5% forecast on [Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


IBD's residential building industry group slipped 0.4%. (Type in G1520 in [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) to see a price-weighted chart of the group.)


Volume surged vs. Friday on both main exchanges following the three-day Memorial Day weekend. End-of-month portfolio window dressing, in addition to profit-taking in the energy sphere, likely drove the heavy turnover. Nonetheless, the action still represents the [first distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), or bout of heavy professional selling, since the Nasdaq staged a follow-through on Thursday.


At the day's high of 4168, the S&P 500 has gained as much as 9.4% from its May 20 low of 3810. Some readers may in fact find it a little strange that this index has gained this much, and it has yet to mark a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) of its own. Keep in mind, however, that IBD research finds that only one key index needs to follow through in order for a tradable rally to get in play.


Will More Bullish Breakouts Follow?
-----------------------------------


What makes the action especially unusual? On Friday, the Nasdaq met the criteria for a follow-through for a second straight session.


Indeed, that's more favorable than seeing the market run into a wall of sellers so soon after the confirmation that, at the minimum, a short-term trading opportunity has popped. And given the extensive damage seen among former leaders in tech, retail, medical tech and other sectors, it surely may take a long while before investors see fistfuls of strong breakout opportunities among stocks that carry most if not all of the [CAN SLIM characteristics](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Indeed, the new-highs list still looks scrawny. Yet on Friday, [85 stocks listed on the NYSE](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-may-27-2022/) did make 52-week or all-time highs while only 12 fell to new lows. On the Nasdaq, an equal number of stocks, 47, registered new highs and new lows.


However, the advance-decline lines of both the Nasdaq and the NYSE are showing meaningful improvement. They have broken short-term downtrends. [David Ryan](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/), three-time U.S. Investing Championships winner, noted during [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) how the A-D lines in both main exchanges exhibited similar behavior right after the [follow-through on the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-as-fed-chair-powell-grasps-this-challenge-these-areas-shine-brightest/) on March 16.


On Tuesday, small caps performed worse. But like large caps, they surrendered just a fraction of their recent strong gains.


The Russell 2000 fell 1.3%. That followed a three-day, 7% blast higher in the prior three sessions.

May Vs. April: Less Bearish
---------------------------



April was gut-wrenching for stocks. Please go to a monthly chart of the Nasdaq.


April saw the Nasdaq composite fall 13% and undercut lows seen in the prior two months. Notice how the index also finished the month just a touch above its lows.


May's action certainly appeared less negative.


Down nearly 2.1% for the month, the Nasdaq actually ended in the upper half of the month's range. [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) highlights a 54% closing range for the month.


Among the FAANG stocks, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) surely looks broken. Yet shares rallied more than 3% for the month and halted a six-month shellacking. A couple other megacap techs also nearly finished up in May.


In the cybersecurity space, [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) also ended May higher in massive monthly turnover.

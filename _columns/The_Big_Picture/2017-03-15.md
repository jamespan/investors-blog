Thanks again, Janet.


It came as no surprise for the U.S. central bank to push interest rates up a tad. The real surprise came in the language that wrapped the announcement.


In its press release following a nearly unanimous decision to increase the fed funds rate by a quarter-point to a 0.75%-1% target range, the Janet Yellen-led Federal Reserve noted that household spending "continued to rise moderately" while fixed business investment "appears to have firmed somewhat." But the Fed also emphasized a take-it-slow approach toward sending the cost of money back to historically normal levels.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP031517-168x300.png)"The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run," the Fed said in the statement. "However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data."


Translation: Yes, we intend to keep raising rates, but as the Goldilocks fairy tale suggests, we want to avoid the economy from getting too hot but also not too cold.


Investors applauded the Fed's stance as equities rose broadly, the U.S. dollar fell, oil and metals futures rebounded, and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond ironically cooled.


Small-cap stocks spearheaded the gains on Wall Street, with the Russell 2000 up 1.5%. At 1382, the index is now back firmly in positive territory for the year, up 1.8% since Jan. 1.


The Nasdaq composite jumped 0.7% while the S&P 500 rallied 0.8%. Volume rose across the board. (The Feb. 7 stalling day expired due to time, reducing the count of distribution days by one.)
The Dow Jones industrial average lagged a touch, up 0.5%, as **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) fell 0.4% and fellow Wall Street firms also soured on the Fed news. As seen in the Market Pulse, superregional **SunTrust Banks** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)) also declined. The reason? Perhaps investors were betting on an acceleration in the path of rising interest rates, not a warming down.


Indeed, some members of the FOMC committee are serious about not getting hot on the trail of removing cheap money from the financial system; Minneapolis Federal Reserve chief Neel Kashkari, a Goldman alum, voted against the quarter-point jump.


The cost of overnight loans from the Federal Reserve is still ridiculously low. Go back to June 29, 2006 and the fed funds rate was at 5.25%. That marked the end of a two-year campaign by the central bank to raise rates by a total 425 basis points, up from a low of 1%. Still, a rapid increase from the longtime recent low of zero to 0.25% would indeed make an impact on debt costs, especially those companies that are highly levered.


However, for now, utilities and other rate-sensitive firms fared well. In today's [Income Investor column](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/these-2-leading-utility-stocks-shrug-off-talk-of-higher-interest-rates/), California energy giants **Edison International** ([EIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EIX)) and **PG&E** ([PCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCG)) both rallied 1.8%.


The Dow Jones utility average spiked 1.6% higher.
The NYSE advance-decline line has been falling for about two weeks, likely due to the heavy selling in energy names. A continued drop in the A-D line (track it via the S&P 500 chart, viewed through the link at the bottom of this article), and that would be a serious concern. A market that rises amid dwindling breadth is a negative divergence. On Wednesday, winners thrashed losers on the NYSE by a nearly 7-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, winning issues led 9-to-4.


Bullishness among newsletter editors polled by Investors Intelligence dived to 53.4%, the lowest level since mid-November. Pessimism is good for bull markets, because it implies that some investors have sold out of the market and are convinced that cash is the right place to be. But if they turn out to be wrong, they have the potential to become new buyers of stocks.

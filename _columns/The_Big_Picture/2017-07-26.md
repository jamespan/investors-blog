It's not that often when you see gold miners, chip-equipment firms, TV and radio companies, and meat suppliers all together lead the market's upside. But that was sort of the session for stocks Wednesday.




 Gains of more than 1.5% for each of the above industry groups offset sharp selling in select health care, education, transportation equipment, hospital and steel companies, leaving the major indexes with tiny gains by day's end. Crude oil and gold prices advanced as the U.S. dollar languished.


The Dow Jones industrial average saw four of its 30 components fall 1 point or more, yet still rallied nearly 0.5% on the wings of a [10% surge in shares of the U.S.'s premier civil and military aviation company](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-boosts-profit-view-after-beating-q2-forecasts/) following better-than-expected Q2 results.


The S&P 500 edged up less than 1 point but posted an all-time new high for a second straight session. The Nasdaq composite gained less than 0.2%.


Small caps, however, did not join the rally. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell nearly 0.7% while the Russell 2000 lost almost 0.6%.

Stalling is a rare form of distribution, or unusually thick institutional selling.


Stalling sessions alone, based on IBD research, won't tear a bull market apart. But they still need to be watched, especially when they occur amid a flurry of genuine distribution days.


IBD's definition of distribution remains this: Either the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 must fall a minimum 0.2%, and volume must rise vs. the prior session. For the S&P 500, IBD uses NYSE turnover. (NYSE volume fell sharply Wednesday.)


What about the level of institutional selling right now? One can safely say that it's now moderate, not quite at extreme levels.


The Nasdaq added a distribution day with Wednesday's stalling session, but lost the June 20 distribution on time. So as seen in the accompanying Market Pulse table, the tech-rich composite's distribution count remains the same at three.


The S&P 500 also lost its June 20 distribution session because Wednesday marked the 25th trading session since that sharp sell-off. (The S&P 500 lost 0.7% on June 20.) So its count falls from four to three.


Meanwhile, market technicals remain generally favorable. While winners nearly matched losers on both main exchanges, the general direction of the advance-decline line for both the Nasdaq and the NYSE is up, with the Nasdaq's line trying to move above a five-month sideways range. In a healthy market, more stocks rise than fall.


The [new-highs list](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) remains robust, and many companies reporting solid results or favorable news are rising past new buy points.


The market did not react that much to the Federal Reserve's widely expected decision to sit on interest rates. The fed funds rate, or what Wall Street banks are charged for overnight cash infusions, remains at a target range of 1%-1.25%.


However, some Wall Street veterans noted that a slight change in the language of its statement following the end of a two-day monetary policy meeting signaled that the U.S. central bank is getting ready to begin removing part of its multi-trillion-dollar stake in Treasury and mortgage-backed government securities off its balance sheet.


"The Federal Reserve has embarked on an interest normalization process," Jim Sarni and Jeffrey Cleveland, managing principal and chief economist, respectively, at the Los Angeles-based bond fund management giant Payden & Rygel, wrote in a new midyear outlook for debt securities. "We think they'll start unwinding the balance sheet some time after September and anticipate another interest rate hike in December. The Trump agenda will take much longer than expected, which could be good omens for the bond market."


"With higher rates in the U.S., money will likely keep flowing into the U.S. and the economy will grow. Continued inflows should keep a lid on long-term interest rate rises," they added.


Some observers believe the Fed will, even after reversing course from three rounds of "quantitative easing," continue to keep Treasuries and mortgage-backed federal agency securities on the books for a very long time.


The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond cooled to 2.29%, but the overall yield curve steepened, which is good for lenders, the economy, and equities. The gap between the 3-month Treasury yield and the 10-year yield widened to 117 basis points.


The recent jump in the euro vs. the U.S. dollar (hitting as high as $1.17 per euro, up from as low as $1.04 per euro back in December) may not be of pertinent interest to investors amid the tsunami of quarterly results coming in each day this week, but it's still worth keeping your eyes on some of the latest movements in other important asset classes and financial markets.



Confidence in Europe's finances and Greece's comeback from its debt debacle, along with a weaker dollar, can have significant impact on the future sales and earnings of, say, America's key multinational companies. Indeed, Dow 30 component **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)), both up well into the double digits since Jan. 1, may benefit from both a weaker dollar and stability in other major economic regions around the world.


In the week ended July 15, 2016, Cat jumped out of a first-stage cup with handle at 78.80. Now at 113.52, shares are now up 44% from that proper entry. In other words, the construction and mining play is essentially enjoying its most bullish price run since the second half of 2010.


Deere, which cleared a [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/) of its own at 89.44 in mid-November last year, has pranced 44% higher.


Can you remember the last time this farm and landscaping machinery giant sported a 91 RS Rating? As seen in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-deere-and-co-de.aspx), Deere also shows a B+ Accumulation/Distribution and a very strong 1.5 up/down volume ratio.


A 1.5 up/down essentially means that total volume on the stock's up days in price over the past 50 sessions is 50% greater than total downside turnover.


The recent jump in West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures is noteworthy, but right now you are not seeing many energy-related companies breaking out of solid bases. Sure, a handful of solar stocks have popped higher. But they are clearly in the minority.


Ditto for gold miners. However, a few are trying to break out of their long-term downtrends. **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) staged a second day in a row of strong gains in heavy turnover, rebounding sharply above the 50- and 200-day moving averages. The stock is perhaps forming a long second-stage base.



Newmont, which is the largest company in IBD's Mining-Gold/Silver industry group in terms of market cap at $19 billion, cleared a first-stage bottoming-base pattern near 28 in the spring of 2016. Shares rallied as much as 64% before cooling off.


The gold mining group is currently ranked a lowly 141st out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative performance; see the [entire daily rankings here](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-jul-26-2017/), or by going to [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) inside the Stock Lists section at Investors.com.


Keep in mind that it will take a lot more inflation before institutional investors deploy more capital in the commodity-related sectors of the equity markets. In one sense, both oil and other commodities are still digesting the enormous run-ups witnessed from 2002 to 2007 and in the early part of the 2010s.

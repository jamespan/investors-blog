  After 5-Week Nasdaq Run, Stock Market Pauses; This Is Next Potential Hurdle

After a five-week rally, the Nasdaq composite and other stock market indexes are doing what should be expected: taking a break.




The January rally took many by surprise as the Nasdaq and other indexes smashed resistance levels. The cost of the rapid advance is a normal pullback, which appears to be occurring now. But as long as indexes and leading stocks don't go below support levels, investors will pay just a small price for the pullback.


Until Friday's stumble, the Nasdaq had climbed nearly 17% over the previous five weeks. That's the strongest five-week gain since May 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It was also the longest win streak since November 2021, when the index also rose for five straight weeks.


The Nasdaq has emerged as the early leader in 2023, up nearly 14% year to date, about double the S&P 500's 7.1 % gain. Moreover, the Nasdaq has seen almost no [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) since the Jan. 6 [follow-through day.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/)


Nasdaq, S&P 500 Flip This Year
------------------------------


Last year, the Nasdaq lagged with a 33.1% swoon while the S&P fell 19.4%. This year, those indexes have flipped as beaten-up growth and tech stocks gain favor.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.2% this year. Small caps have also come on strong, with the Russell 2000 up more than 11%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MP020623-252x300.jpg)On Monday, the Nasdaq fell 1%. The loss showed the 12,000 level is proving to be slippery. Yet, the index is holding comfortably above the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


Its 50-day line is getting closer to moving above the 200-day. Many chart readers look at this "golden cross" as a bullish indicator, although it usually happens after there's been a follow-through signal.

Small Caps Fall More Than 1%
----------------------------


Small caps underperformed Monday. The Russell 2000 fell 1.4%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 1.2%.


China e-commerce company **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) was among the weaker IBD 50 stocks, off 1.9%. Shares fell below the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) for the first time since late December. Also in the IBD 50, bearings and alloy-products maker **Timken** ([TKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TKR)) sold off after earnings but found support at the 21-day line.



The S&P 500 lost 0.6% as it tries to hold the 4100 level. The Dow fell 0.1%, staying in a horizontal range after meeting resistance around 34,000. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) is flagging.


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq, preventing a distribution day. It also extended a favorable trend of declines in lower volume and gains in higher volume.


Chinese stocks trading in the U.S. stock market were broadly lower after [the U.S. shot down a Chinese high-altitude balloon](https://www.investors.com/news/china-stocks-extend-losses-spy-balloon-shooting-punctures-sentiment/) over the Atlantic Ocean. U.S. officials believe it was a spy balloon; Beijing denies it.


While some of Monday's stock market weakness could be blamed on the U.S.-China rift, global and emerging markets generally underperformed. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ([EEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEM)) fell 1.5%.

Major global indexes lagged the S&P 500. London and German indexes fell 0.8% while the Paris CAC 40 lost 1.3%. The Tokyo Nikkei rose 0.7%, but the Hong Kong Hang Seng sold off 2%.


Fed's Powell Could Move Stock Market Tuesday
--------------------------------------------


The economic calendar is light this week. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a speech Tuesday at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., starting at 12:40 p.m. ET. As with any other Powell appearance, it comes with the potential risk his comments could negatively affect markets.


The 10-year Treasury yield rose 10 basis points to 3.63%. Its two-day gain is the largest since late September, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The uptick in yields follows Friday's blowout jobs report, which raised the odds of further Fed tightening. Found in Investors.com and [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) under the symbol 0TNX, the benchmark yield is rising from support at its 200-day moving average.


The stock market and the 10-year yield have often moved in roughly opposite directions.

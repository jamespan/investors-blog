U.S. stock indexes chugged ahead Friday, firming up the case against the bears.


The Nasdaq led with a 0.7% thrust, while the S&P 500 rose 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%.




Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq ended the week above its 50-day moving average and at a new high, both bullish signs. The S&P 500 did the same.


The technical picture improved as the Aug. 24 distribution day on the S&P 500 expired because of time.


Small caps, which tacked on 0.2% Friday, have led the rally in recent weeks.

But in September, the S&P 600 rolled 8% higher, while the S&P 500 and the Dow added about 2% each. The Nasdaq's gain for the month was 1%.


How should the individual investor play this changed environment?


First, an investor might scan the IBD 50 for small caps.


Going into Friday's session, small caps in the screen included electronics parts maker **Kemet** ([KEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEM)), connected-home software provider **Control4** ([CTRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRL)), cycle suspension maker **Fox Factory** ([FOXF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXF)), Argentine bank **Grupo Supervielle** ([SUPV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPV)), motor home maker **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)), diet products firm **Nutrisystem** ([NTRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRI)), TV station owner **Gray Television** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)) and chip equipment maker **Ichor Holdings** ([ICHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICHR)).


Additional good places to look for quality small caps is IBD's [initial public offering screen](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) and the [Stock Spotlight screen](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/).



Sector leadership is another thing to watch.


According to preliminary data, some sectors moved up Friday, but here's what didn't change: The leadership is the same. The electronic and chip sectors held the top two spots throughout September.


Sectors moving up include banks and machinery. Three weeks ago, the bank sector was No. 31, now it is No. 20. Machinery was No. 23 but is now No. 9.


But laggard sectors rising in the ranks come with no guarantee that they will make it to the top.

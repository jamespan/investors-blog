  Stock Indexes Fail First Test At All-Time Highs

U.S. stock indexes grabbed their five minutes of fame Friday, but then pulled back as if to offer an apology to the bears.


The Nasdaq pegged a new, all-time high in the first five minutes of trade, but then retreated to finish off 0.2% and low in the day's range. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average, which first notched its new high two days after the presidential election, eased less than 0.2% Friday. The S&P 500 mimicked the action — down 0.2% — but hasn't yet crossed above its mid-August high.


Volume was sharply lower on the Nasdaq and barely lower on the NYSE.

Is this the way bull markets act — timid and oh so sorry for not respecting old highs? If so, the bears have little to worry about and much to laugh over. The chart action Friday was weak from a bull's perspective.


The market will get a fresh test in the coming week, but the early grade is D. The only thing that spared the Nasdaq from an F was that it didn't flee the all-time high area in a panic.


Courage in this uptrend appears to be found largely in the so-called Trump rally. The rally has spread its cheer among all but a dozen or so of IBD's 197 industry groups, but the top performers are clearly outshining the also-rans.


The best performer since the Election Day close is the steel maker group, up 21%. Close behind with gains of 15% to 19% are office supplies, banks, department stores, consumer loans, specialty steel alloys and consumer electronics.


On the downside, gold miners, solar, food and dairy and electric utility groups have lost 5% to 10%. (Silver reached bear-market status Friday as its price pullback from a summer peak reached 20%, the traditional definition of a bear market.)


If an individual investor looks at the winners and losers, the lineups are encouraging. The weak players are conservative vehicles. The stronger players are a decent mix.


The big question is how long the Trump rally can last.


One thing that became clear was that the play on firearm stocks might be ready to return to more normal action. From just before President Obama's election in 2008 to the end of October, **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) and **Sturm Ruger** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)) advanced 1,050% and 832%. During that same Obama era, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 202% and 119%, respectively.


Trump is more friendly to gun rights, which could take away the fear-based purchases of firearms. During the eight sessions after Trump's election, Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger dropped 15% and 18%, respectively.

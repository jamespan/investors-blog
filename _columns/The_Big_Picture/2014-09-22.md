Small Caps Take Another Beating As Market Hiccups Again
========================================================

A wave of selling hit growth stocks Monday, putting the market uptrend back under pressure.


The Nasdaq slumped 1.1%, recovering slightly from a 1.5% intraday loss. The S&P 500 gave up 0.8% while the Dow slumped 0.6%. The session had the feel of distribution even though volume came in much lower than Friday. Volume was unusually high Friday due to options expirations.


A new high for the S&P 500 last week put the market back in an uptrend â€” but not for long.


The market's defensive nature was on full display Monday as soft drink and tobacco stocks outperformed.


Aggressive investors might still be interested in nibbling at a name or two, but risk-averse investors would be well served to play it safe, take some money off the table and generally watch from the sidelines for now. Not much is working at the moment, even though sell signals haven't been abundant among leaders.


Wall Street frowned on another round of disappointing housing data. Meanwhile, comments from China's finance minister dashed hopes for more stimuli in China.


Small caps took another hit as the Russell 2000 lost 1.5%. There's been a lot of bearish talk about its chart in recent days. Its 50-day moving average is moving below its 200-day moving average, indicating a weakening trend.


The IBD 50 lost 1.7% as China stocks led the downside. **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) fared the worst, falling nearly 8% each. Autohome closed below its 50-day moving average, but BitAuto closed slightly above the support level.


**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) slumped 4.5% and closed right at its 50-day moving average. The China-based search engine recently set up in a constructive base, but a breakout over 222.23 never got going.


On the NYSE, declining stocks trounced advancers by nearly 5-to-1. The margin was 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


The put-call ratio hit 1.0 Monday, indicating heightened fear in the market. Excessive fear is often seen at market bottoms, but the reading isn't high enough yet to be much optimistic about the prospects for a near-term bottom.


There are bright spots in the market, including steel and railroad stocks. **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), a leader in IBD's steel producers industry group, is well extended after a bullish breakout in July. Railroad operator **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)) is also acting well after reclaiming a 117.35 cup-with-handle buy point last week.

Stocks Extend Rebound As Energy, Biotechs Lead
===============================================

Stocks climbed Tuesday to extend a weeklong rebound and remove some more gloom from the market. The Nasdaq led with a 0.7% advance. Biotechs were a source of strength on the composite index for a third straight day.

  

The S&P 500 climbed 0.4%, aided largely by an energy sector that rallied despite an international agreement that eventually lets Iran put more crude oil in the global market. But transportation stocks suffered.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.6%.

  

Indexes rallied into the close for the third day in a row. It's encouraging when sellers can be kept at bay all the way into the closing bell.

  

Volume fell, although market breadth was good. Winning stocks led losers by about 9-to-5 on the NYSE and by 12-to-7 on the Nasdaq. Those totals gave another boost to the NYSE and Nasdaq advance-decline lines, which went through a few weeks of rapid deterioration but now are hooking higher.

  

Retail sales fell in June, making the sector one of Tuesday's weakest. Consumer electronics, discounters, restaurants, apparel and other retail industry groups slid 0.4% to more than 1%.

  

Since last week's lows, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have jumped as much as 4.4% and 3.3%, respectively.

  

More importantly, lots of highly rated stocks have broken out of bases in that period, and from a variety of sectors.

  

**Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)), **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **Tesoro** ([TSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSO)) are among the new opportunities for growth investors.

  

Leaders generally are holding above buy points and adding some breathing room from their entries.

  

But anyone who's been watching the market this year has to wonder if the gains in the major indexes and leading stocks have any staying power.

  

Taking away a solid month of February, this year has been characterized by advances of short duration. Without sizable gains, it's hard to justify the risk of owning shares.

  

The indexes remain in a short-term pattern of lower lows, and they'll have to make new highs to end that trend.

  

In a market that shifts personality from week to week, the best option at the moment is to remain skeptical and only partially invested in shares. Wall Street's next mood shift could occur with the next big headline out of Greece or from the Federal Reserve. This is a market needing constant parental supervision.

  

Besides biotechs, many other medical stocks performed well. A couple more in the sector broke out. Molecular diagnostic company **Cepheid** ([CPHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPHD)) cleared a flat base with a 62.10 buy point in volume more than twice its average.

  

Financials are another sector firming up. Earnings reports Tuesday from **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) only helped the cause. They rose 1%.

  

Aircraft leasing firm and new IPO **Avolon Holdings** ([AVOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVOL)) gapped to a new high and broke out of a base-on-base pattern in heavy trading. Bohai Leasing, the Chinese leasing and financial services affiliate of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, agreed to acquire a 20% stake in Avolon for $26 a share.

Stock Market Remains Dull As Growth Slips, But This Sector Wins The Day
========================================================================

The stock market reversed mildly lower Tuesday as a trend of lackluster and diverging performances continued. Yes, the stock market is still figuring itself out.




A split market characterized the session, even as the major indexes were nearly flat. Growth stocks were out of favor, which hurt technology and some health care and consumer shares. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) fell 0.5%.


But the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), another gauge of growth stocks, rose 1.7%. New issues **Cricut** ([CRCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRCT)) and **Global-E Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) rallied to new closing highs while **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) soared 20%.


The day belonged to small caps and core materials such as oil and metal stocks. The Russell 2000 jumped 1.1% and is near its April 29 high. Energy and other cyclical small caps gave the Russell 2000 much of its strength.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP060121-190x300.jpg)After a fast start, the major stock market indexes walked back gains. It seemed the stock market came back from the Memorial Day weekend with little desire to move either way.


The Nasdaq composite closed 0.1% lower, making it five straight sessions of dull price performance. On the plus side, the Nasdaq is holding above its 50-day moving average and has some room before it hits a potential resistance level at 14,000.


The S&P 500 edged down a fraction, failing to get much help from its natural resources components. Nearly 15% of the S&P 500 is in energy, industrial and materials companies, which is where many of Tuesday's winners in higher volume could be found. The S&P 500 also has been lazy the past five sessions, moving no more than 0.2% in either direction.


Dow Up Despite J&J Decline
--------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1% despite taking a hit from **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)). The pharmaceutical giant slid 2.2% after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to take up the company's appeal of a $2.1 billion judgment in favor of 20 women who blamed baby powder for ovarian cancer. Dozens of more baby-powder case are pending, leaving a heavy legal burden on J&J. The stock landed at its 50-day line.


Nasdaq volume fell from Friday, and NYSE volume appeared to be higher. Breadth was better than it might have seemed, with advancers over decliners by 13-to-5 on the NYSE and 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


Oil, metals, mining and plastics industry groups finished in the top 25 of 197 groups. As the stock market has seen this year, whenever growth stocks are out of favor, it's those economically sensitive stocks that usually get bought up.


The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) had its best day since Feb. 8, up 3.9%. It's now near new highs.


The price of U.S. crude oil rose 2.5% to $67.94 a barrel late Tuesday. OPEC and other major oil producers such as Russia [backed a plan to gradually boost output](https://www.investors.com/news/opec-meeting-june-2021-iran-nuclear-talks-oil-prices/), while the return of Iranian crude to the market appeared further away. That strengthened oil stocks, with several more breaking out of bases Tuesday. **APA Corp.** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)), also known as Apache, topped the 22.58 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a cup-with-handle base in heavy volume.


**Ovintiv** ([OVV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OVV)) broke out of another [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), this one with a 27.63 buy point. Volume was nearly double its average. Pipeline operator **DCP Midstream** ([DCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DCP)), **Magnolia Oil & Gas** ([MGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGY)) and **Talos Energy** ([TALO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TALO)) also broke out of bases. **Core Laboratories** ([CLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLB)), which provides services to oil companies, rose past a 42.08 buy point but reversed lower.


Energy Sector A Positive Side Of Stock Market
---------------------------------------------


Clearly, energy is emerging as a leading sector, and investors need to put some time into researching opportunities in it. The companies with better fundamentals should be your focus, and quite a few in the sector are still recovering.


"The recent high level of discipline among the oil producer group is one reason we see a positive outlook for oil prices in the coming year, and we see Brent reaching ($75 a barrel)," Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of global wealth management at UBS, said in a note Tuesday. "With less drilling from non-OPEC+ producers, it has been easier to ensure that production cuts support prices — rather than handing market share to rivals. The group has also introduced a 'cut, comply, and compensate' system, that requires member states to make up for prior overproduction."


The rollout of Covid vaccines and pressure on oil producers for environmental reasons also support oil, Haefele added. Also, UBS expects U.S. shale drillers to use more cash to raise dividends and repay debt, while showing some restraint on drilling.

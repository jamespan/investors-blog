Stocks Settle For Small Gains; Volume Continues Bearish Pattern
================================================================

Stocks gripped solid gains through most of Thursday's session, but then gave back most of the advance in the last hour. The Nasdaq posted a 0.4% pop after being up 1.1%. The S&P 500 turned a 1% gain into 0.2%.


The IBD 50 also rose 0.2%.


Volume fell sharply on both major exchanges.


The negative reversal was another mark against this uptrend, and it wasn't the only bad sign.


The indexes continued a bearish pattern — up days mainly in slower trade, down days in faster trade.


The Nasdaq hasn't scored a sizable up day in rising trade since Nov. 18, and the S&P 500's only up day in rising volume in that period was a stalling day, a sign of distribution.

Since Nov. 18's big gains, what else has been happening?


•The distribution count rose by a net three days.


•Prices fell 1.5% on the S&P 500 and 0.6% on the Nasdaq.


•Few breakouts have made significant headway. Among quality stocks, only two have scored double-digit gains from breakouts.


China Internet and gaming company **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) retook a buy point Nov. 19 and now is 14% above the 154.98 entry. The company has 50 new mobile titles.


**Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) broke out Dec. 7 and is now 20% above a 19.07 buy point. Firearm stocks have rallied on fears of stricter gun controls. But Smith & Wesson also has some solid fundamentals.


Gross margin rose to 39% in the quarter, up from 32% a year ago. Increased production, which spreads fixed costs over a bigger pie, and the acquisition of shooting accessories provider Battenfeld Technologies drove the margin gain.


Smith & Wesson's accessories division, which is new, contributed $18.4 million in revenue, thanks to the acquisition, vs. nothing last year.


On the downside, **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) failed after a gap up Dec. 1. The stock made a new high but the pattern was too short to be a proper base. LGI then slid as much as 23% under the entry.


Sometimes it seems that IBD's rule on waiting for a base of proper length — six weeks for a cup without handle — is jerking the leash for no good purpose. But the rule is based on research.


The investor who follows research-based rules will make the right decision more often than not. In this case, the rule protected investors from a loss.

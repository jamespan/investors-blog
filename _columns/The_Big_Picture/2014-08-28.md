Stocks Handle Ukraine News Well, Keeping Losses Small
======================================================

Stocks spent the entire day in the red Thursday, but low volume communicated indifference.


The Nasdaq lost 0.3%, while the S&P 500 shaved 0.2%.


Volume fell across the board.


Although the second read on Q2 GDP was stronger than expected and jobless claims lower than estimates, the market ignored the good news.


The focus shifted to the international situation after reports that Russian troops entered Ukraine.


However, the bears weren't able to make much of it. Volume might well be fading because of the looming three-day holiday weekend, but that wouldn't stop a truly bearish mood.


The selling was mostly selective. Several top-rated stocks came in for a whipping.


Home-furnishings retailer **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) gapped down 12% in huge volume. The company offered weaker-than-expected guidance. **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) fell 3.5% in apparent sympathy but trimmed what had been a 7% loss.


China-based auto website operator **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) seems to have packed several months' worth of action into the past four sessions. The stock broke out Monday, reached an 11% profit Tuesday, plunged 11% Wednesday and skidded 7% Thursday as it triggered the 8% sell rule. Each day featured heavy volume.


On the upside, two fairly recent new issues posted gains.


**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) rose 3% in volume 30% above average. The company has lost money the past four years, but the Street expects a profit of 10 cents a share this year and 36 cents a share in 2015.


Mountable camera maker **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) thrust 7% higher. Volume is hard to read on GoPro because the stock doesn't yet have a 50-day average. Also, the 50-day average — which will emerge at the end of next week — will be skewed by extreme volume from its first two weeks on the Nasdaq.


Overall, though, action in the major indexes has been mostly quiet. The Nasdaq appears to be headed for its fourth straight week of declining weekly volume.


One secondary gauge that has stood out in recent days is the NYSE short-interest ratio.


The ratio points to how many days of average volume it would take to cover the entire short position on the NYSE.


On Tuesday, the ratio began hitting new five-year highs.


Short sellers are sometimes right, but many market watchers see the ratio as a contrarian indicator. When the ratio began hitting fresh five-year highs in June, the Nasdaq continued to rise for about four weeks.

Stock indexes staged positive reversals Thursday, erasing their sharp morning losses.

  

The Nasdaq added 0.2% after being down 1.2%. The S&P 500 was flat. For the first time in three weeks, small caps outperformed: The S&P 600 gained 0.9%.

  

The IBD 50 rose 0.2%.

  

Volume was lower on both major exchanges vs. Wednesday's torrid pace.

  

With the market in correction, IBD-style investors should avoid buying stocks. The chances of picking the lone-wolf stock that will rise consistently in a tough market are not good.

  

Wait for a follow-through day to confirm that a new uptrend is underway.

  

A few facts might be worth pondering at this juncture.

  

•The put-call ratio closed at 1.07, its sixth close in a row over 1.0. Readings over 1.0 are often seen near short-term market bottoms. The secondary gauge has a good record so far this year.

  

•Declines in the indexes over the past 18 months have been brief. Pullbacks have been in the range of two to five weeks.

  

•Historically, stocks have performed well in the fourth quarter. If bear markets are stripped out, the Nasdaq rose in nine of the 10 bull market Q4s going back to 2002. The average gain in the nine up quarters was 9.8%.

  

•The November election will start to affect stocks. Look for the market to begin pricing in the likely outcome of the U.S. midterm elections sometime this month. In 1994, when the Republicans took control of both chambers of Congress with a Democrat in the White House, the advance began with a positive reversal in early October and led to a 5.5% pop in the indexes in four weeks.

  

Foreign elections also could have some impact on markets. The first round of Brazil's election is set for Sunday.

  

•The market has signaled that it doesn't like the idea of higher interest rates. Nervousness continues over when the Federal Reserve will start raising rates.

  

•Some say share buybacks are fueling the bull. In the first half of this year, buybacks among S&P 500 stocks rose to $275.5 billion vs. $218.1 billion in the same period in 2013.

  

Economic reports were mixed Thursday. First-time jobless claims were fewer than expected. Factory orders for August, however, missed estimates.

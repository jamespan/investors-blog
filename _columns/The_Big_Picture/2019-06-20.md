S&P 500 Hits Record High, Led By These 2 Commodities
=====================================================

The stock market advanced higher at the open, but second thoughts pulled the indexes back before they bounced in afternoon trading. Oil stocks and gold miners operated in a separate universe, outperforming the indexes.




The Nasdaq gripped a 0.8% advance after being up 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each rose 0.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.5%. The S&P 500 closed near session highs.


Oil and gold stocks provided most of the day's bullish action. Iran shot down a U.S. drone, which was the chief catalyst for oil's surge. President Trump called the action "a very big mistake" but didn't make clear what if anything he would do. Military action would likely interrupt oil shipments, boosting prices. A secondary factor for oil prices Thursday was a drop in U.S. crude inventories.


Oil Stocks
----------


The Dow Jones' two oil stocks — **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) — posted 1.7% and 1.1% gains, respectively.

Oil stocks, though, are far below their highs for the most part.


Gold At High
------------


Bullion rode higher Thursday, lifting the iShares Gold Trust ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)) to its highest level in more than five years.


Gold mining stocks breaking out of consolidations Thursday included **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) and **Newmont Goldcorp** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)).


The two, though, are a bit late to the party. Several gold-mining stocks are padding gains after recent breakouts. They are too extended to buy. The extended camp includes **Royal Gold** ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD)), **Franco Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)), **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) and **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)).


Why the gains in gold and gold miners?


Gold bulls offer several explanations. Falling Treasury yields make gold look more attractive by comparison. Gold also is a traditional haven against geopolitical turmoil and the perceived risk for economic chaos.


No one has spent much time worrying about economic chaos since 2008, but the U.S. national debt clock continues to tick. The current reading is more than $22 trillion.


Stress Tests For Banks
----------------------


Results of the stress tests for the largest banks will be revealed Friday after the market's close. Income investors will be looking at the data to determine which major banks might raise their dividend payouts. The Street is expecting some solid increases.


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 216,000 — below the consensus estimate of 220,000.


The Philadelphia Fed's business survey sank from 16.6 in May to 0.3 in June. A reading above zero points to growth. The June reading for regional manufacturing is close to contraction.


Marking Highs
-------------


While the gold ETFs reached five year highs Thursday, the S&P 500 did even better. The large cap index reached an all-time high. On Thursday, the oil stocks in the index no doubt helped the S&P 500.


The Nasdaq notched an all time high in late April but now is trading about 1% off that high.

Stock Market Rallies Broadly Ahead Of Fed Talk; How Leaders Are Acting Now
===========================================================================

Hmm. Did Tuesday just offer, borrowing that new version of India Pale Ale from the Lagunitas brewery, a "Little Sumpin' " for every kind of investor?




Well, let's see. Meme stocks such as **[AMC Entertainment](https://www.investors.com/research/amc-entertainment-stock-buy-now/)** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)), **[BlackBerry](https://www.investors.com/research/blackberry-bb-stock-buy-now/)** ([BB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BB)) and **[GameStop](https://www.investors.com/research/gamestop-gme-stock-buy-now/)** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) roared like ravished lions, gaining 10% to 27% each. Wall Street banks such as [Leaderboard play](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)) thrived after the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond jumped 4 basis points to 1.29%.


Elsewhere, small- and midcap stocks — generally thought to be more economically sensitive — paced the overall advance. The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund gained nearly 1% to get within 2% of its all-time high. The Russell 2000 matched that advance.


Advancing stocks led decliners by more than a 2-1 ratio on both the NYSE (1,746 stocks up, 707 stocks down) and Nasdaq (2,224 vs 1,094).


You can see the NYSE and Nasdaq's advance vs. decline lines on the big daily charts of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, respectively, via the General Market Indicators PDF link at the bottom of this article.


Meanwhile, headed into Wednesday, a majority of [stocks in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) currently hold a weekly gain of 2% or more, 19 of which have scored gains of at least 3%. And don't forget [breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) that have held up well.



On Tuesday, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) surged 18% in easily the heaviest volume in more than a year, following impressive fiscal fourth-quarter results and a bullish outlook.


Palo Alto Networks, a superb stock from August 2014 to June 2015, blasted past resistance near 400 and a prior [cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) at 394.77.


Stock Market Today: A Touch Of Profit-Taking?
---------------------------------------------


You might not capture that sense of a risk-on attitude simply by ogling what the major equity indexes did.


The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high again on Tuesday. But following a nearly 0.9% lift Monday, the large-cap benchmark rose less than 0.2%. The S&P 500 seems, for now, a bit coy in kissing the 4500 mark.


NYSE volume rose. Given that the S&P 500 backed off the day's high and traded slightly in the lower half of the day's range, the price-and-volume action gets tagged as [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), a rare type of [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). However, the distribution-day count has fallen sharply over the past two weeks, a bullish sign.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also retreated from its session high of 35,445, ending just 0.1% ahead.


The Nasdaq composite, on the other hand, reached the 15,000 milestone for the first time, gaining 0.5%. A test of the 50-day moving average just four days ago proved critical. And so far the action, at least pricewise, indicates that institutional investors on the whole remain net accumulators. Volume cooled 2% vs. Monday.

Fed Watch 2021
--------------


With the major indexes making new highs, many IBD readers should rightfully stay concerned about a potential pullback. After all, it's been eight months since the S&P 500 fell 5% or more from a 52-week or all-time peak.


The Federal Reserve could move the stock market this week. While the annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., got ditched for a second straight year due to Covid-19, the U.S. central bank and top bankers from around the world are still participating in an online event. A speech by Fed chief Jerome Powell slated for Friday headlines the meeting.


Last week, financial markets wrestled with the clear message from the minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting: We won't be seeing the bank buy $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-back debt each month in the not-too-distant future. Ultimately, though, the equity indexes limited losses. Last week, the Nasdaq 100 found support at the key 10-week moving average. It's wiped away that week's 0.3% loss and more.


Bond markets are clearly anticipating this tapering. The 10-year bond yield has risen 9 basis points from 1.2% on Aug. 2; the 30-year bond yield has lifted 5 basis points to 1.91% over the same time frame.


"Inflation will likely moderate ahead such that on short term measures, like the six-month annualized rate, it appears under control, which will aid the tapering effort," John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, told IBD via email. "So, with less central bank buying, bond yields will likely rise globally, but not too much. However, this will likely be a reason for cyclical and financial stocks to perform well even though the global economy may decelerate more than expected to a more average rate going forward."


Vail added that it's "very likely" the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will have to taper their asset purchases too.


Stock Leadership: Still Balanced
--------------------------------


[IBD's stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-aug-23-2021/), headed into Tuesday's trading, showed leadership from consumer spending, tech and financial sectors. A balance of leadership could in fact help the bull market keep fresh legs.

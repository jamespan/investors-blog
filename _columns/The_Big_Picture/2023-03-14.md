Stock Market Surges Late, Cheered By In-Line Inflation Data; Meta Platforms, AMD Approach New Entries
======================================================================================================

The stock market turned in a bullish performance Tuesday after the latest report on inflation didn't reveal any big surprises. Sellers knocked the major indexes well off session highs in afternoon trading, but a burst of buying during the final hour of trading resulted in a solid close.




The [consumer price index for February](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-still-pretty-hot-but-fed-may-pause-sp-500-futures-rise/) came in mostly in line with expectations, and that brought buyers in from the sidelines.


The Nasdaq jumped 2.5% in the morning and tried to clear all of its moving averages in one fell swoop. It pared the gain to less than 1%, before closing with a gain of 2.1%. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) nearly matched the Nasdaq with a gain of nearly 1.9%.

IBD's semiconductor equipment group was one of the day's top performers, up nearly 4%. Stocks to watch in the group include **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), which has its sights set on a 125.02 entry. **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) is also forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) as it holds support at its 50-day moving average.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, but it was a tough comparison to Monday because volume was so heavy to start the week. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Money flowed out of bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 15 basis points to 3.67% just after the stock market close.


U.S. crude oil futures settled at $71.33 a barrel, down 4.6% amid concerns about slowing demand.


Federal funds futures traders are still confident about another quarter-point hike by the Federal Reserve at next week's meeting. That meeting comes amid a lot of carnage in the financial sector brought about by the collapse of **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) and **Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)). But another rate hike at the May meeting is far from a sure thing. And there's an increasing chance the Fed could pivot before the end of the year and start lowering rates.


Breadth might've been disappointing on the Nasdaq, but the session served up plenty of strong movers.

**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) was one of the top performers in the Nasdaq 100, helped by news of more [job cuts](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-jumps-as-it-plans-more-job-cuts/). Meta showed bullish technical action by gapping up. It's still forming a flat base with a 197.26 entry.


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) also outperformed on a strong day overall for large-cap technology stocks. After three straight declines, AMD stock jumped nearly 7% to 87.45. It closed just below an 89.04 flat-base entry.


The S&P 500 popped 1.7% and closed just below its 200-day moving average. **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)), **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) and **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) outperformed in the benchmark index but closed well off session highs as they try to rebound from sell-offs.


Winners beat losers on the NYSE by 3-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average stopped a five-session losing streak in style, rising 1%. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) outperformed in the blue-chip index and reclaimed a 178.94 buy point, rising just over 4% to 182.89.



Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), Leaderboard stock **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) halted a four-session slide after coming close to its 50-day line. The Latin American e-commerce and payments firm is close to reclaiming a 1,250.58 entry.


Besides Meta, top gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) included chip-equipment firm **Onto Innovation** ([ONTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONTO)). Shares jumped 6% in strong volume, closing just below an 88.59 buy point.


What To Do Now
--------------


With the stock market in a correction, now is not the time to be buying stocks. Exposure should be kept between 0%-20% until the Nasdaq and S&P 500 confirm new uptrends.


There's still plenty of uncertainty out there about the path of interest rates, as well as the underlying health of financial stocks and the overall economy.


Tuesday marked the second day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq composite and the first day of a rally attempt for the S&P 500. Even though the price action in individual growth stocks looks a lot better, the market still needs to prove itself.

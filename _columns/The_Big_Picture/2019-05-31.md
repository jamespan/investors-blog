Trump Fires At Mexico, Hits Stock Market
=========================================

Stocks learned a lesson Friday, namely that they are not operating in a bull market or a bear market but in a Trump market, which in some ways is the worst scenario for Wall Street.




The Nasdaq dropped 1.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively.


Volume rose across the board.


The catalyst behind Friday's sell-off was President Donald Trump's threat to [impose tariffs on Mexican imports](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-mexico-tariffs-are-crushing-dow-jones/) unless that country stops illegal immigration.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP_053119-233x300.jpg)The move came only two weeks after the U.S. reached a trade agreement with Mexico. Trump now apparently wants to use the pact as a bargaining chip in his border war.


The Street didn't see it coming and that's almost always a recipe for a sell-off.


Who Can Predict Trump?
----------------------


Regime uncertainty can unsettle the stock market like nothing else.


The difficulty with regime uncertainty — not knowing what a leader will do from one day to the next — is that corporations have difficulty committing to long-term projects.


Money stays on the sidelines, and eventually that inaction affects both earnings and the stock market. A number of [U.S. industries are expected to suffer](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-mexico-tariffs-autos-beer-avocados-oil/) if tariffs are imposed on Mexican imports, including autos, [health care products](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-technology-companies-slammed-trump-tariffs-mexican-imports/) and beverages.


So, where does the stock market go from here?


Nothing Good For Growth Investors
---------------------------------


If Friday is any indication, the answer is nowhere good. On Friday, [gold miners were the top performing stock group](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/gold-prices-jump-as-trump-tweet-torpedoes-stock-market/), according to preliminary data. For the week, it also was gold miners. The past four weeks? Again, gold miners.


Another winner in this uncertain atmosphere is the Dow dividend yield. Going into Friday's session, the yield on the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.46%, about 25 basis points above the 10-year Treasury.


An advantage of at least 25 basis points last occurred Sept. 7 and 8, 2017. An 18% rally in the Nasdaq, over 20 weeks, followed.


Have Patience
-------------


The picture these details are painting is not robust.


IBD's standard advice is to wait until a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) confirms a new uptrend is underway. And that's good advice.


Patience, though, is the key word.


Chart Notes
-----------


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 posted their fourth consecutive down week. The Dow Jones marked its sixth week down in a row.


Both major indexes closed under the 200-day moving average Friday. For the Dow Jones, the puncture of the 200-day line came Tuesday. For now at least, that ends the chance of a rebound at those key levels.

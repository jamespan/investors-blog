  Small-Cap Stocks Cool Off, But These Hot Sectors Refuse To Rest

Key indexes closed Monday mostly lower. But in reality the careful market observer could call it quite mixed.




A 0.9% decline by the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday did little to dent a new [confirmed market uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) after more than two months' worth of sideways, choppy action. Plus, at 29,638, the 30-stock blue chip index still holds a pleasant gain of nearly 6.5% since it posted a [follow-through day on Nov. 4](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/).


![MP113020](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP113020-185x300.jpg)Reports that President Donald Trump is threatening to impose more restrictions on U.S. companies doing business with China's largest technology firms, such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), appeared to dampen investor sentiment early.


Among key equity indexes, only small cap and midcap ones did worse.


Both the SPDR S&P 500 Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) and iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) dropped around 1.7%.


But the Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic Nasdaq exchange, hustled its way from an early drop of 1.4% to a fractional gain and claimed its fourth straight up session.


A Distribution Day For S&P 500
------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite edged just 7 points lower, or less than 0.1%.


While volume grew substantially on Monday vs. the prior session, keep in mind that Friday's post-Thanksgiving holiday session closed early, at 1 p.m. ET.


So, technically speaking, the S&P 500 added a fresh distribution day to its count over the past 25 trading sessions. Yet it's far more meaningful to compare Monday's turnover with other full-day trading sessions in recent days.


The Nasdaq's feather-weight fall did not meet IBD's definition of a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), which requires at least a 0.2% decline.


In November, the Dow scored one of its biggest monthly advances in history, up more than 12%. The S&P 500 landed a 10.7% gain, while the Nasdaq jumped nearly 11.8%.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ramped up 18.4% for the month â€” a clear month of outperformance by small cap stocks.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) also joined the above indexes in reaching all-time highs during the month; it rose 9.9% in November.


The Negatives
-------------


Monday's stock market internals suggested fund managers sought to lock in end-of-month profits, even as hundreds of companies hit 52-week or all-time highs. As seen in [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), a [total 316 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE did so](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-nov-30-2020/), while just five made new lows.


Software, chip and retail sectors dominated the new highs list on Monday; IBD counted 17 stocks in the software field, 16 for chip and six for retail.


Breadth showed weakness on Monday, though. On the NYSE, falling issues led rising ones by a nearly 3-1 margin. Meanwhile, the General Market Indicators chart page (see the PDF via the link at the end of this story) reported 2,059 stocks down and 1,140 up on the Nasdaq; yet, the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been traversing bullishly higher since the start of November.


On the positive side, top industry groups for the day seemed to suggest that the coming distribution of vaccines to combat Covid-19 will get America and the rest of the world back to work and out shopping again in 2021.


Database software led the upside, up more than 6%. Gaming software, movie and internet networking stocks also rallied nicely in the 1% to 2% range. But advertising, medical and research equipment and services, medical services, semiconductor manufacturing, enterprise software and paint groups also performed well.

VIX Reversal
------------


In options trading, volatility surged in the early going Monday, then faded as stocks set a bottom for the day early and whittled away the losses.


Please see the Cboe Market Volatility Index, part of the [IBD Psychological Market Indicators section](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/). After falling to a nine-month low on Friday, the VIX actually reversed lower.

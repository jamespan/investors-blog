A strong rally lost steam and threatened markets with a loss at one point, but the major indexes ultimately landed in positive territory by the time the stock market closed Monday. After trading more than 1% higher intraday, followed by a brief encounter in the red, all three indexes finished with gains of less than 1%.


And so the rally attempt remained alive.


Monday's stock action mirrored developments regarding President Donald Trump's tariffs. It was reported early on there would be exemptions to some tech imports such as smartphones, integrated circuits and servers. The immediate beneficiaries were Dow Jones leaders **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).




But those gains were muted once Trump declared there would be no exceptions to trade levies. Apple jumped initially but trimmed its gains to roughly 2% by the closing bell while Nvidia ended up slightly in the red. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) virtually wiped out its winnings, and finished nearly flat. Both Nvidia and Tesla tested the [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Monday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8% in Monday's stock market. The S&P 500 inched closer to the psychologically important level of 5,500, rising 0.8%. The benchmark index undercut that level in early April amid tariff announcements.


The Nasdaq rose 0.6%. Notably, the tech-dominated index finished just below the [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and below Wednesday's highs. But on [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge), the 50-day moving average has undercut the 200-day moving average in a bearish signal. Moreover, uncertainty over tariffs and the earnings season that is underway can move stocks.


Transportation Index Rises, These Groups Jump 2%
------------------------------------------------


One notable gainer: the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which climbed 1.2% on Monday. Outperformance could also be seen at the industry level.


Among Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups, 30 of them surged 2% or more. Industries with hefty gains were wide-ranging, from metals and mining to insurance, biotech and investment brokers.

Meanwhile, volume was lower on the New York Stock Exchange and higher on the Nasdaq. Breadth was positive with advancers outnumbering decliners nearly 4-to-1 on the NYSE and 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Small caps rose 1.1%, outperforming the major indexes. Growth stocks in the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund made a solid showing, rising 2% in the stock market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MP041425-242x300.jpg)Yields fell, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note showing a fall of 12 basis points in yields, thus tumbling to 4.36%. That was reassuring, following the sharp spike in yields on Friday.


Trump Pauses Tariffs
--------------------


It was reported that President Trump cut the average levy on [electronic imports to 5% from 45%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/trump-exempts-apple-iphone-nvidia-super-micro-tech-gear-tariffs/?refcode=afl-%7BSITENETWORK%7D) as a result of his most recent exemptions. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick noted on Sunday that sector tariffs on semiconductors and related devices will be imposed in around a month. Trump also took to social media and posted that nobody "gets off the hook."


Elsewhere, Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller noted that if the economic slowdown is significant, he might support earlier rate cuts. If tariffs remain steep, their effect on inflation would be temporary. But if the average tariff is closer to 10%, [the Fed can wait and watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-waller-supports-interest-rate-cuts-soon-if-large-trump-tariffs-remain-in-place-407b25ed?mod=home_ln).


But carmakers got some relief on [news](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/ford-gm-trump-tariffs-stock-90a58d36?mod=home_ln) that Trump may be considering a pause on auto tariffs. **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) rose shortly after noon and retook its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) with a 4% gain on Monday. **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) also climbed more than 3% but remained below its key moving averages.


Elsewhere, China's export curbs on rare earth materials moved some mining stocks after news that Trump [may be considering an executive order](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-critical-metals-stockpile-order-mp-materials-stock-soars/) to stockpile rare minerals from the Pacific Ocean. Rare minerals and metals are used in several industries, ranging from electric vehicles to smartphones and other gadgets.



As a result, **MP Materials** ([MP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MP)) shot up 22% from its 50-day moving average in heavy volume.


Stock Market: Earnings And Breakouts
------------------------------------


Looking ahead, retail sales for March are due on Wednesday. Economists expect the Census Bureau to report an increase of 1.4% after a 0.2% increase in February.


Earnings moved Dow Jones leader **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)). The bank comfortably beat views with earnings of $14.12 per share on $15.06 billion in sales. Analysts estimates stood at $12.33 per share on $14.77 billion in sales. Shares held the 10-day moving average after a 2% gain on Monday.


**UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) fell in a long cup base with a buy point of 630.73 ahead of its earnings report on Thursday.


Breakouts on Monday were few. **Casella Waste Systems** ([CWST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CWST)) cleared a buy point of 116.31. But **Ani Pharmaceuticals** ([ANIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIP)) pulled back slightly after getting past a buy point of 69.45.

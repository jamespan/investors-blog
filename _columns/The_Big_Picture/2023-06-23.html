<p>While that remains to be seen, action remains orderly for now. The Nasdaq composite ended the day down a painful 1%, but its weekly decline of 1.4% underlines the relatively tight action. Nevertheless, the tech-heavy index snapped its eight-week winning run. With a substantial gain of almost 30% so far this year, it retains a comfortable cushion above its 21-day exponential moving average and sits on its 10-day line.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 ended the day down 0.8% but remains clear of the 21-day exponential moving average. Its weekly dip came in at 1.4%, snapping its five-week win streak. But it remains up almost 14% in 2023.</p>
<p>Decliners outnumbered advancers by just over 2-to-1 on the NYSE and by about 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Russell reconstitution helped push volume higher, adding a distribution day to both the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 in the process.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared better with a 0.7 % dip, but test of the 50-day moving average looks imminent given it came close to touching the line. <strong>Intel</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC" target="_blank">INTC</a>) led the index while <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO" target="_blank">CSCO</a>) lagged.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>
<p>Notably, small caps were pounded by the bears, with the Russell 2000 diving 1.4%. Growth stocks were given an even harsher spanking, with Innovator IBD 50 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY" target="_blank">FFTY</a>) losing 1.7%.</p>
<p>While the market is pulling back, action remains constructive. Taking a breather now means the indexes can gather strength for further advances. Due to this, IBD continues to recommend 60% to 80% exposure. But this is a good opportunity to look over your portfolio and perhaps lock-in some profits in your big winners.</p>

<h2>Bull Market Remains Young As Fed Inflation Gauge Awaits</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8484971 size-medium" src="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062323-272x300.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="300" srcset="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062323-272x300.jpg 272w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062323-768x848.jpg 768w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062323.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" uia-uid="0|1">The baby bull market, with its historical definition of 20% up from the bottom, is still in the process of taking its first steps. It remains to be seen if it can fend off the bears going forward.</p>
<p>LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Krosby believes there are valid reasons to question if it will strengthen into a legitimate bull market.</p>
<p>"Typically, bull markets emerge as a recession has taken hold and the Fed has completed it rate hiking campaign, setting the stage for an economic expansion," he said in a note to clients. "The economy is currently not in a recession, not even a 'technical' recession with two consecutive quarters of negative growth."</p>
<p>There are some key earnings reports that should offer further insights into the economy next week. First of all <strong>Carnival</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL" target="_blank">CCL</a>) reports Monday and should give further clues about the post-Covid travel boom. And Dow Jones giant <strong>Nike</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE" target="_blank">NKE</a>) reports Thursday, which could have a knock-on effect on growth stocks such as <strong>Lululemon Athletica</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU" target="_blank">LULU</a>) and <strong>On Holding</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON" target="_blank">ONON</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PCE index, including the key core measurement, is due Friday. This is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge and could give further credence to or undercut Fed Chair Jerome Powell's recent hawkish tone.</p>

<h2>These Retail Stock Market Groups Shine</h2>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 sectors ended the session in the red. Utilities and consumer discretionary suffered most while communication services and health gave up the least ground.</p>
<p>The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a deeper insight into Friday's stock market action.</p>
<p>A number of retailing groups were strong, with office supply retailers, supermarkets and department stores shining. Health insurers and food wholesalers also did well.</p>
<p>Computer hardware stocks, mail order plays, coal companies and automakers were among the worst performers.</p>

title: Stock Market Thrashed Again After Fed Rate Cut; 10-Year Yield Plunges Below 1%

There have been plenty of cases in the past where the stock market has cheered interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but that wasn't the case Tuesday. Far from it, in fact.




After decidedly bullish gains for the stock market Monday, another wave of selling hit stocks Tuesday.


In response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Federal Reserve cut its key lending rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1% to 1.25%. It was the Fed's first inter-meeting cut since the financial crisis of 2008.


Gains topped 1% for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite just after the Fed decision, but enthusiasm faded by the close. After falling nearly 1,000 points, or 3.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Tuesday with a loss of 2.9%. The S&P 500 gave back 2.8% and the Nasdaq composite fell 3%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index lost 2.1%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP_030320-274x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell slightly on the NYSE from Monday's levels.


For the stock market, it appeared to be a case of "sell the news." Before the Fed announcement, the market had already priced in a 50-basis cut on or before the March 17-18 Federal Reserve meeting. And more rate cuts are expected before the end of the year.


The 10-year Treasury yield broke below the 1% level and went all the way down to 0.9%. As of 2 p.m. ET, it was back around 1%, down 16 basis points. The 10-year yield has been hitting record lows after taking out the 1.33% level last week.


The put-call volume ratio hit 1.26 Friday, indicating excessive fear in the stock market. But it wasn't a fearful market Tuesday as evidenced by a put-call ratio of 0.92. Excessive fear has been seen at several market bottoms in the past.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gave back 1.9%, buoyed by strong performances from **SiteOne Landscape** ([SITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SITE)), **Palomar** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)) and **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)).


Stock Market Winners
--------------------


As bond yields crashed, the price of gold surged. Gold for April delivery settled at $1,644.40 an ounce, up 3.1%.


That fueled big moves for two gold stocks in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). **Newmont** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) and **Franco-Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)) surged 6% and 4%, respectively. Both stocks were volatile last week but are finding support at their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/).



Gold was a safe haven Tuesday, along with [homebuilders](http://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/), which tend to do well in a low-interest environment. Financial stocks lagged, with Financial Select Selector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) down nearly 4% in heavy volume.


So what's the stock market worried about? First and foremost, it's worried about a global slowdown and possible recession for the U.S. economy. It's also worried about a material slowdown in corporate earnings this year.

Earnings Warnings
-----------------


Chip stocks **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) and **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) were the latest technology companies to issue profit warnings as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Other warnings have come from the likes of **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)), **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Look For Relative Strength
--------------------------


Despite Tuesday's losses, a rally attempt for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is still intact. As long as the Feb. 28 lows hold, the rally is still in force. Tuesday marked Day 3 of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


[Follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) can happen when they're least expected, so it's important to keep paying attention.

Keep your powder dry for now but stay engaged by keeping track of stocks with strong [relative strength (RS) lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) near highs. Bullish charts aren't easy to find now, but there's still a good crop of stocks with RS lines near highs.

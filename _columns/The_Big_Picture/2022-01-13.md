The stock market ended sharply lower Thursday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off 2.5%, marking a setback in this week's index rebound.




Despite the weak action, **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) and **Taiwan** **Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) finished in or near new buy areas.


And just as selling returns, earnings season will heat up Friday, as financial giants **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan** **Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells** **Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) report their quarterly results.


Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP011322_4-229x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.5% and the S&P 500 dropped 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.8%. All four major stock indexes closed at sessions lows.


Midday Thursday, Federal Reserve governor [Lael Brainard told Congress](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-brainard-to-tell-congress-that-reducing-inflation-is-top-priority-11642069803) in her confirmation hearing that the central bank's "most important task" is to reduce inflation. Brainard is the White House's nominee for second-in-command at the Fed.


The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.71%, dropping for a third straight session since topping out above 1.8% on Monday.


Leading growth stocks finished with sharp losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) declined 1.3%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Lam Research** ([LRXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRXC)) erased most gains to close only 0.1% higher. It is in buy range past a 673.90 buy point, but the reversal could mean more losses ahead.


Volume fell mildly on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.

What To Do Now
--------------


The Nasdaq's rebound ran into severe trouble Thursday, as the tech-heavy composite snapped a three-day win streak. The Nasdaq more than erased the entirety of the last two days of gains and is back near the 200-day moving average.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gave up its 50-day line, another sign that further weakness could lie ahead.


After Thursday's disappointing action, the [market outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) remains in an "uptrend under pressure." Lower volume prevented a [new distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq and NYSE.


With the uptrend still under pressure, growth investors should remain defensive. While energy and financial stocks — and now some chip names — are making some progress from their recent buy points, technology stocks continue to swing wildly.


So, aggressively raising exposure doesn't make sense. Continue to to focus on the stocks that are performing well during choppy markets. Use the relative strength line to easily find stocks that are shrugging off the market volatility.


Don't entirely give up on the market rally yet. The Nasdaq found support at its long-term 200-day line earlier this week. That could still provide a launch pad for a new sustained rally, although that's less likely right now. If the Nasdaq further weakens and takes out its 200-day line, then more downside is likely. As usual, don't predict the market's direction; be flexible and let the market decide your best course of action.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Applied Materials, TSM
-----------------------------------------------


During Thursday's stock market action, Applied Materials, Mosaic and Taiwan Semiconductor finished in or near new buy zones, although Applied Materials and Mosaic acted poorly. Keep in mind the current stock market health isn't exactly conducive to new purchases.

Positively, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is just shy of new highs.


Mosaic gave up a portion of Wednesday's breakout move, falling 0.7% Thursday. Shares closed in buy range above a cup with handle's 41.25 entry. [MOS stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-mosaic-company-mos.aspx) boasts a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) per the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)

The [5% buy area](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) tops out at 142.38.



Stock Market Earnings: Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo
-------------------------------------------------------


Earnings season will heat up Friday with quarterly reports from financial giants Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.


Citigroup ended Thursday about 15% off its 52-week high. Shares are back above their 50-day line, but still below their 200-day line.


JPMorgan is approaching a 173.06 entry in a flat base. Shares are about 3% away from the new buy point.


Wells Fargo snapped a five-day win streak Thursday. The stock is still extended past a 52.67 buy point in a flat base following a Jan. 4 breakout.

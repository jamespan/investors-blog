The stock market had a good start to the month as investors brushed aside ostensibly hawkish commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell Friday. All eyes will now turn to the forthcoming jobs report.




The Nasdaq composite squeezed out a solid 0.6% gain Friday, which was better than its modest weekly lift of 0.4%. It is trading in a range but is still above its 50-day line and its short-term moving averages. The tech-heavy index is now up nearly 37% so far in 2023.


The S&P 500 rose to a new 2023 high and moved further above its own [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) as it gained 0.6%. The index finished the week up 0.8% and is now up about 20% for the year. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have now risen for five weeks in a row.

The broader participation is a good sign for the stock market as it looks to continue its advance into the festive season.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average actually outperformed the other major indexes with a 0.8% Friday lift. While it was aided by another strong session from **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), it was **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) that turned in the best gain, up more than 4%.


Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 smashing through its 200-day moving thanks to a nearly 3% gain. Growth stocks also surged, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) clambered above its 200-day line after a 1.9% lift.


Indexes Shake Off Powell, Jobs Report Next
------------------------------------------


With a slew of dovish Fedspeak during the week, all eyes were on Powell Friday.


While he said it is "premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance" and did not rule out further interest rate hikes, investors seemed to believe the end of the tunnel is approaching.


Crucially, he did not aggressively push back on comments from the previously hawkish Fed Gov. Christopher Waller, who earlier in the week suggested the Fed could decide to cut its benchmark interest rate as early as spring if inflation continues to decline.


Treasury yields tumbled across the board. The 10-year yield dived 12 basis points to 4.22% while the 2-year yield slumped 16 basis points to 4.55%.


"The current 'higher for longer' mantra has been countered by the markets' profound conviction that the Fed delivered a 'dovish' pivot at its Nov. 1 meeting, and that it will initiate a rate cutting cycle by mid-2024, if not sooner," LPL Financial Chief Global Strategist Quincy Krosby said in a note to clients.


Indeed, futures suggest rate cuts totaling 1.25 percentage points will occur by the end of 2024, which would be quite the pivot.


Investors will be seeing labor-market news in the coming week. The ADP employment is due Wednesday while the U.S. employment report for November is due Friday. Economists expect payrolls to increase by 190,000 in the latter case, compared to the previous month's rise by 150,000.


On the earnings front, IBD 50 stock **Braze** ([BRZE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRZE)), **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) are on deck in the coming week.

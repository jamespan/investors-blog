IBD 50, Nasdaq Outperform In A Mixed Market
============================================

Major indexes showed bullish action again Wednesday, even if the S&P 500 posted a slight loss.


Leaders traded in quiet fashion. Given the market's strong gains in recent weeks, quiet is good.


The IBD 50 outperformed with a gain of 0.4%. Within the list of premier growth stocks, only six of the 50 saw heavy trading.


The Nasdaq composite erased a soft morning loss to end 0.3% higher. At 4675, the tech-rich index chiseled a little more of the deficit from a March 2000 all-time high of 5132.


The S&P 500 halted a five-day winning streak with a loss of less than 0.1%. That decline hardly put a dent in the index's 1.3% rally since Nov. 5.


Volume grew vs. the prior session, which was extremely quiet due to the Veterans Day holiday.


While the S&P 500 did drop in higher volume, the minuscule size of the day's loss does not qualify as an authentic day of distribution.


With just one distribution day tagged for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, fund managers appear reluctant to sell holdings heavily and take profits.


Indeed, equities generally remain in favor this year. The Nasdaq has now stretched its year-to-date gain to nearly 12%, despite some decent-size pullbacks earlier in the year.


Commodities are lagging. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index was down 3.6% for the year as of Wednesday's IBD. Gold, silver and oil futures are depressed.


With lower gasoline prices and a strengthening jobs market, it may come as no surprise to see more leadership emerge within the retail and consumer sectors. The industry groups table near the bottom of Page B2 shows at least six retail subgroups ranked in the top 40. Medical, tech and some cyclical groups are also market leaders.


IBD's Value Funds Vs. Growth Funds chart, today on Page A7, continues to show a market bias toward growth stocks. Since the market's bottom in mid-October, the line on this chart has been falling.


It's been 14-1/2 years since the Nasdaq's peak in March 2000 led to the demise of many dot-com companies with no earnings. So, where are the Pets.com and CMGI's of the market today?


They don't seem to exist. The IPO market has leaned toward delivering new companies that sell innovative products and in fact make money.


The tech and biotech revolution continues to be pivotal in the market's recovery. And tech products may flow more freely across the world now that President Obama and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have agreed to lift some tariffs.

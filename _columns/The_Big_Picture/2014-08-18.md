Daunting headlines were hard to find Monday, paving the way for buyers to push the Nasdaq to a fresh high and the S&P 500 back above its 50-day moving average.


The Dow Jones industrial average led the way, rising 1.1%; the Nasdaq gained 1% and the S&P 500 rallied 0.9%. Airline, building, steel and retail stocks led the upside.


The Nasdaq is at its highest level since early 2000, right around the time the tech bubble burst.


Volume fell from Friday's levels, but it was a difficult comparison due to options expiration. Advancing stocks topped decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3 to 1. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by nearly 4 to 1. Improving breadth is reflected in a rising advance-decline line plotted on the S&P 500 chart on B2.


The IBD 50 continued its string of recent outperformance, rising 1.3%. It was the IBD 50's third 1%+ gain in the past six trading sessions. Eighteen names on the list rose 2% or more.


The bull camp has reason to be optimistic after last week's subtle follow-through day by the Nasdaq as well as the overall solid action in leading growth stocks. Several names are setting up in constructive bases, and several recent breakouts are still in buying range. Meanwhile, stocks that have already broken out are holding gains bullishly.


**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) cleared a flat base Monday, rising nearly 2%. Volume was heavy early but faded into the close. Celgene closed less than 1% above a buy point of 90.60.


Low-volume breakouts aren't ideal, but they can work. **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) recently broke out over a buy point of 83.80 sluggishly, but the breakout has worked out nicely.


Headlines will most likely run the gamut in coming weeks with some good and some bad. Focusing too much on negative headlines causes some investors to sit on the sidelines and miss out on profit opportunities when they arise. A negative headline matters only when a distribution day is the outcome. There are no signs of one now.


The market will have some Fed-related headlines to deal with later in the week. The minutes from the July 30 Fed meeting will be out Wednesday. Meanwhile, central bankers from around the world are meeting Thursday in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for their annual summit.


On Friday, Fed Chief Janet Yellen gives the keynote.


Retail reports will also be in the spotlight this week. On Tuesday, for example, watch for reports from **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)).

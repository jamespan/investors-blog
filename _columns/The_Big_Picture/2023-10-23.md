Although it made the first step in a rally attempt, the stock market Monday also left question marks about its outlook just as a week of multiple market-moving headlines began.




A promising rebound faded Monday afternoon. The Nasdaq composite erased an early 1% loss and it rallied as much as 1.2%. But it closed only 0.3% higher. The index climbed back above the 13,000 level, where there was support in August and September.


The S&P 500 closed 0.2% lower. It momentarily regained its 200-day moving average but closed below it. The index's five-day losing streak is the longest since last December. The S&P made its lowest close since May 31.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was never in the game. It spent most of the session in the red and closed at session lows, down 0.6%.


Small caps also faded, as the Russell 2000 fell 0.9% and made another 12-month low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat after erasing losses. Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq and fell on the New York Stock Exchange from Friday's totals.


Market Tracks Yields
--------------------


Major indexes seemed to follow the 10-year Treasury yield. Premarket futures slid as the benchmark yield [climbed as high as 5.017%](https://www.marketwatch.com/market-data/rates?mod=market-data-center) early Monday. But the yield started coming down, and the stock market rallied. Then, stocks cooled off in afternoon trading as the yield's decline plateaued. Late Monday afternoon, the yield was down 9 basis points to 4.83%.

IBD cut its market outlook to "correction." At the same time, [The Big Picture cautioned](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-falls-again-triggers-this-switch-inflation-data-big-tech-earnings-loom-microsoft-earnings-google-earnings-meta-earnings-tesla-stock/) that indexes seemed ready for an oversold bounce.


By some measures, the stock market had become oversold, and bargain hunters came out for a while Monday. But they didn't have the nerve to sit tight ahead of some major earnings, an explosive crisis in the Middle East, inflation and other economic data.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are some of the most notable earnings reports coming up.


On Friday, the personal consumption expenditure price index is the next significant inflation gauge and one the Fed trusts more than the consumer price index. Consumer confidence, GDP, plus housing and manufacturing reports also are [due this week](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Fed Chair Jerome Powell will make opening remarks Wednesday at a lecture in Washington, D.C., so he may not discuss fiscal policy.


Stock Market Starts Rally Attempt
---------------------------------


Risks aside, the Nasdaq's advance Monday counted as the first day of a rally attempt that could eventually lead to a new confirmed uptrend.



The [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, jumped more than 20% above its 10-day moving average Monday. That's at least a short-term bottoming signal, even if the VIX reversed lower later in the session. A similar signal appeared Sept. 26, near the S&P 500's low in early October. But the indexes weren't able to sustain that uptrend.


For a longer-term perspective, the VIX's move above 20 historically is a bullish sign for stocks, noted Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.


"We'd like nothing more than to say that Friday's +20 VIX reading marks a bulletproof tradeable or investable low, but we've been writing investment research since the very beginning of that VIX chart, and this experience makes us a bit cautious," he added. "We would prefer to see the VIX get to a range of 28 to the low-to-mid 30s. Those levels feel much more consistent with the new geopolitical tensions roiling markets."


Breadth Remains Problem For Stock Market
----------------------------------------


Breadth deteriorated in afternoon trading. Decliners topped advancers by a 2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Since early September, stocks making 52-week lows have trended above those making 52-week highs. On Friday, the ratio hit extreme levels with more than 300 new lows in both the NYSE and Nasdaq. New highs were in the single digits.


Much of the day's strength was in megacaps, which makes the Nasdaq's gain suspicious.


MicroSectors FANG+ ETN ([FNGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNGS)) climbed 1.1%. By comparison, Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) fell 0.6% and First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) lost 0.2%.


Some of the Magnificent Seven stocks saw positive chart action Monday on the stock market.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) found support at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) and was up 0.1%.Â Facebook parent Meta Platforms jumped 1.7% and is near new highs. Microsoft tacked on 0.8% and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) advanced nearly 4%, finding support around its August and September lows.

  Small Caps Lead Stock Market Gains; Apple Climbs On Earnings

The stock market closed higher Thursday, with small caps leading the way, despite giving up some gains late after President Donald Trump said he would go ahead with tariffs on Canada and Mexico. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) [climbed on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-fiscal-q1-2025-earnings/) after the close Thursday, as Wall Street shifts its attention to Friday's inflation report.


The Dow Jones index rose 0.4%, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed nearly 0.3%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 index gained 1.1%, again testing resistance at the 50-day moving average line.




Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors climbed, with utilities and real estate pacing the gainers. The technology sector was the sole loser on the day.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. Advancing stocks topped decliners by an 11-3 ratio on the NYSE and by 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.


In the final half-hour of trading, stocks suddenly came off their highs after [Trump said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/trump-says-he-ll-hit-canada-mexico-with-25-tariffs-on-saturday) he would impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Saturday, due to the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits. But indexes did rebound into the close to erase some of those rapid losses.


Due out Friday morning is the Commerce Department's personal income and outlays report. Included in the report is the Federal Reserve's favored inflation indicator, the core PCE price index. It is expected to rise 0.2% on the month for December, with an annual increase of 2.8%.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) were among the top performers Thursday, with gains of 13% and 2.1%, respectively. [IBM reported strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-stock-ibm-earnings-news-q42024/) late Wednesday and gapped out of a cup base. Visa rallied in sympathy with **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), which reported earnings. After the close Thursday, Visa shares climbed following the [company's own earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-earnings-q1-2025-mastercard-q4-2024-v-stock-elon-musk-x/).


On the downside, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) tumbled 6.2% and 4.6%, respectively. [Both reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-ai-sales-limited-by-capacity-constraints/) earnings ahead of [Thursday's open](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-earnings-q4-cat-stock-united-rentals-2025-outlook/).


In the Nasdaq 100, **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), up 7.4%, and **Roper Technologies** ([ROP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROP)), up 5.1% to briefly top a 580.09 buy point, were among the best stocks of the day. Meanwhile, **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)), which announced results, and **Charter Communications** ([CHTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHTR)) tumbled 11% and 6.3%, respectively. Comcast fell to a November 2022 low despite a new $15 billion share buyback.


The [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended mostly higher, even as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) edged lower. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) continued to trade wildly, up 0.8%, in the wake of Monday's DeepSeek crash.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund climbed 2.8%. Investor's Business Daily's [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) had a number of solid winners on the session, including **Grail** ([GRAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRAL)) (up 18.2% to hit a new high), while **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)) surged 13.6% to decisively clear a 62.22 cup-base entry.

Stock Market Rally: What Investors Should Do Now
------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP013025-227x300.jpg)


[Following Monday's DeepSeek AI carnage](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/ai-companies-trampled-china-app-stock-market-investors-vistra-vaneck-semiconductor/) — which lowered IBD's recommended exposure level to 60%-80% from 80%-100% — the major indexes have been holding up relatively well. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to hold above their 50-day moving averages.


Investors should continue to utilize diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). It's important to monitor positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules, like a sharp break of the 10-week moving average.


Fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing, which can lead to big gap downs, so ensure you have a sufficient profit cushion to withstand those potential declines. For example, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) plunged 11%, triggering the 7% loss rule from a 1,157.90 buy point Thursday. With the stock closing below the entry just ahead of Wednesday's earnings report, investors should have been out of the stock from a risk perspective.


If the market is able to extend its rebound from Monday's losses, then be on the lookout for stocks breaking out past correct buy points. And more stocks are poised to move higher. About a dozen stocks topped buy points Thursday, some with stronger volume than others.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured 10 new stocks, notably **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), which topped a 420.21 flat-base buy point. And the Near Pivot list remains loaded with 28 ideas.

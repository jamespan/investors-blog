S&P 500 Tests Critical Level, But Jury Still Out; Jobs Report Awaited
======================================================================

U.S. stock indexes shadowboxed to little effect Thursday, as the S&P 500's test of its 10-week line remained unsettled.


The Nasdaq retreated less than 0.2% after being up no more than 0.4%. The S&P 500 ended essentially flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell slightly on the NYSE.


Small caps underperformed the other indexes, with the S&P 600 dropping 0.6%. The IBD 50, a collection of the stocks with some of the best fundamentals and price action, dipped 0.1%.


The distribution-day count improved a bit, as the S&P 500's March 31 distribution day fell off because of time. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer part of current conditions. Yet, both major indexes are still showing multiple signs of institutional selling, which is what distribution is.

The big-cap index is testing its 10-week line, but so far has signaled neither failure nor success. The index is also nearing the 50-day moving average.


Meanwhile, calling the market an uptrend of any sort is getting harder. The Nasdaq has fallen in 10 of the past 11 sessions. During that time, the Nasdaq's 200-day and 50-day lines have been lost.


Bulls aren't finding much reason for optimism. One bright spot is the dark spot on the contrarian put-call volume ratio. On Wednesday, the put-call closed at 1.11, and Thursday it closed at 1.05. These are fairly high levels of fear on the gauge. Often a rally will follow such pessimism.


Yet, the put-call ratio is a secondary gauge, which means it doesn't always work. Secondary gauges can go in and out of favor, depending on conditions. The put-call ratio has been fairly accurate in indicating market lows over the past couple of years or so.


Economic news was mostly negative Thursday. First-time jobless claims came in almost 5% higher than expected. However, claims hit a 42-year low about two weeks ago.


Challenger Gray & Christmas released its April data that said employers plan to lay off 65,141 workers, a 35% increase from March. CEO John A. Challenger said the energy, retail and consumer sectors were downsizing. Challenger noted that a company's retooling of its workforce isn't always a sign of weakness.


“We are at a stage in the recovery where it is not unusual to see hiring and firing occur simultaneously across the economy and often within a single company," Challenger said.


On Friday, the market could react sharply when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its nonfarm payroll figures for April and unemployment data. The Street's consensus number is 200,000 for nonfarm jobs, but the range swings from 175,000 to 245,000. The jobless rate is expected to edge down from 5% to 4.9%.


Big gainers Thursday in the S&P 100 included insurer **Allstate** ([ALL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALL)), up 4% in heavy volume; oil and gas explorer **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)), up 3% in fast trade; and **PayPal Holdings** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), up 2% in below-average volume. PayPal is trying to retake its 50-day moving average and remains below a 40.03 buy point.

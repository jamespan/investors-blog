title: Small Caps Up, But Apple's Stock Tumbles

Small caps confirmed their recent leadership role Friday, rising 0.7% as the major indexes went virtually nowhere.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each added less than 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was just below the break-even line.




Volume faded on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The small-cap S&P 600 popped 0.7%. In the past five weeks, the S&P 600 is up 7% vs. 3% each for the Dow, Nasdaq and large-cap S&P 500.


Technicals in the market improved. The indexes lost the Aug. 17 distribution day because of time. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions.

The count now is at one for the Nasdaq and two for the S&P 500. The improvement is impressive: On Sept. 7, the count was at seven days each.


Overall, the improvement points to institutional confidence.


So far this month, there has been only one distribution day and it came early in the month.


Part of the reason the Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average struggled Friday was **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). The megacap makes up 7.1% of the Nasdaq's weighting, and Apple carries the seventh highest price in the price-weighted Dow.


Apple dropped 1% Friday in heavy volume. The megacap stock lost 5% for the week â€” Apple's biggest weekly percentage loss in about five months.


Apple's chart has turned ugly. The stock peaked on Sept. 1 and then closed below its 10-day moving average Sept. 7. Apple was unable to retake the short-term line and broke under its 50-day line Wednesday in heavy volume. Friday's gap-down loss was the second in three sessions. The stock is 3% under its 156.75 buy point and not finding needed support.



Meanwhile, a secondary market gauge, new highs vs. new lows, is looking good. Highs have held the superior position for several weeks now. Medical stocks provided most of the new highs earlier this month. Beginning in midmonth, the machine, bank and chip sectors began to tally the most highs.


The new-highs list is a good place to look for sector rotation.


For the week, the small-cap S&P 600 advanced 1.6%; the Dow Jones industrial average, 0.4%; and the S&P 500, a little above flat. The Nasdaq lost 0.3%.


On Thursday before the open, the final number on second quarter GDP will be released. The first reading was 2.6% and the second was 3%.

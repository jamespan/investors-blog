Coronavirus Bear Market Claws Stocks Again; 5 Steps To Get Ready For A New Big Uptrend
=======================================================================================

The coronavirus-infected [stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) reaffirmed Thursday the value of holding cash amid a sea of uncertainty on how the biggest health crisis in a century will impact corporate earnings and economies across the globe.




The Nasdaq composite, a 35.2% winner in 2019, suffered a record point drop of 750 points, good for a 9.4% lashing. More beloved large-audience events got canceled and concern ballooned over whether U.S. hospitals can handle a potential surge in Covid-19 patients requiring care.


Thursday's low of 7199 marked the index's lowest levels since the week ended Feb. 1, 2019. That low also boosted the size of this new bear market-type decline to just shy of 27%.


The S&P 500, down 9.5% on Thursday, saw its correction from a Feb. 19 all-time peak of 3393 also thicken to nearly 27%. But small caps have really taken it on the chin. The S&P SmallCap 600 gapped down twice in the past four trading sessions. Thursday's 11.4% mauling took the S&P 600 down nearly 36% from its 52-week peak of 1046.

No Safe Haven Sector In The Stock Market Today
----------------------------------------------


Did so-called "defensive sectors" perform well? Nope.


Utilities get socked as well. The SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) ETF tanked more than 10% in volume that raced 87% above its 50-day moving average. The ETF is staying on course for its worst monthly performance since October 2008.


Not a single industry group ended the day up. In fact, the best among the 197 groups tracked each day by IBD were down 3% to 5%. (See the full list and daily performance at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF gapped lower at the start of a session that was halted for 15 minutes soon after the market open. It finished the day down 9.7% and losing 23% for the year so far. The S&P 500's 7% decline in early trading automatically set the 15-minute reprieve. It was the second time this week the circuit-breaker triggered.


Before The Stock Market Crash Ends: 5 Steps To Take Now
-------------------------------------------------------


The best time to have started raising cash in your portfolio was on Feb. 25, when [the Big Picture column that same day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) noted a key change in the outlook for stocks to "market in correction." A day earlier, IBD's outlook had already changed to "uptrend under pressure."


It's not too late to sell your weakest stocks, take at least some profits in your biggest winners, and ditch those shares that have flatlined since you bought them.


No one knows for sure how long this bear market will last. Will it be as short as three months like the one in 1998? Or as long as the two-year, seven-month slog after the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000? It's quite futile to guess. But you can boost your prospects of being ready to capitalize on future bullish opportunities created by the next bull run.


In addition to raising cash, consider these four steps:


* Look for stocks within IBD's key lists that somehow buck the decline. They either find support at their long-term 200-day moving average, or even the 10-week line on a weekly chart.
* Use the stock research tables to identify the strongest sectors. Big stock market winners typically belong to a leading sector or industry, not a lagging one. That's called covering [the L in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).
* Brush up your knowledge on the eight bullish chart patterns that most leaders form before breaking out to new highs. [Investor's Corner's running scroll of stories](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) will help greatly in this regard.
* Monitor the day-to-day action of both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite for a [new follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). Not all of them work out. Some are head-fakes. But no major market bottom since 1900 began without a follow-through rally confirmation.


Watch This IBD Rating
---------------------



Within the IBD 50, a minority of stocks show an Accumulation/Distribution of B- or higher. Headed into Thursday's sell-off, just three companies owned an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- or better: China's delivery firm **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)), online arts and crafts retailer **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), and **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), which is racing to produce a vaccine to battle the spread of Covid-19.

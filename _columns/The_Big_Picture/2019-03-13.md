The bull market gained more traction Wednesday as major stock indexes ended with solid gains. The Feb. 7 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) fell off the Nasdaq's count. It's no longer relevant due to a nice gain for the Nasdaq since that day.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 added 0.7%, and the Dow Jones industrials picked up 0.6%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added 0.4%. Nasdaq and NYSE volume rose from Tuesday's levels.


It was another topsy-turvy session for the Dow Jones Wednesday amid more volatility in shares of **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). The stock reversed higher even after President Donald Trump [ordered the grounding of 737 Max jetliners](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-rallies-vietjet-norwegian-lufthansa/) in the U.S.

Core orders, a key measure of business investment, rose 0.8%, the biggest increase since July. In other economic news, wholesale prices rose less than expected in February.


Bull Market Case
----------------


There's still a lot to like about the bull market that gained new life when the S&P 500 flashed a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) on Jan. 4. The Nasdaq roared above the 7500 level Monday, and the S&P 500 took out the 2800 level with relative ease Wednesday. Note that the S&P 500 is still trying to conquer its Nov. 7 high of 2815. Leading growth stocks across a variety of sectors are acting well. Meanwhile, an accommodative Federal Reserve has assured the stock market it's in no rush to raise interest rates.


The bears, meanwhile, have an elevated distribution-day count working in their favor as well as global growth concerns. The European Central Bank last week cut its eurozone growth forecast and also announced additional stimulus to spur more lending by banks. Meanwhile, a [sluggish jobs report Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/job-growth-disappoints-wage-growth-jumps/) fanned concerns about the health of the U.S. economy.


Bull Market Winners
-------------------


Wednesday's session yielded several solid movers, including IBD [Sector Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)). It cleared a deep cup-with-handle base, rising 2.6% to 292.51. The buy point was 289.87.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is working on a deep cup-with-handle base of its own with a 188.18 entry.


Among security software stocks, **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) and **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) are working on cup-with-handle bases, but several leaders have emerged in the group already, including [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)).


The risk with buying base breakouts now is that many industry leaders have already emerged. Enterprise software stock **Wex** ([WEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEX)) is another good example. It's also working on a cup-with-handle, but big leaders in group have already emerged, including **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), among others.


Marijuana Stocks
----------------


Marijuana stocks ended mostly lower Wednesday after solid gains early. **Aurora Cannabis** ([ACB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACB)) jumped 14% after the company hired [hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz](https://www.investors.com/news/marijuana-stocks-aurora-cannabis-stock-nelson-peltz/) as an advisor. Aurora is priced under 10 a share, but it's plenty liquid, with a market capitalization of around $8.5 billion and 50-day average volume of 28 million shares.


Among the marijuana stocks, **Cronos Group** ([CRON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRON)) and **Canopy Growth** ([CGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGC)) are showing the best relative strength. Price action has been a bit erratic in Cronos, but the stock is doing a good job holding above the 20 level. Canopy Growth is just below a 51.91 handle buy point, but a 57% pullback when the left side of the base formed makes the pattern flawed. A good cup-with-handle base generally shouldn't show a pullback of more than 30% to 35%.


Aurora Cannabis, Cronos Group and Canopy Growth are top holdings of the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF ([MJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MJ)), which is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 38.45 entry. **Tilray** ([TLRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLRY)) has been lagging badly ahead of its earnings report Monday after the close, although a strong report could fuel a new round of buying in pot stocks.


Upcoming Earnings
-----------------


A few high-profile earnings reports loom. **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) reports are due Thursday after the close. Adobe is a member of the Leaderboard watch list as it trades near a 263.46 handle buy point. Broadcom is getting support at the 50-day moving average, albeit in mediocre volume. And Ulta Beauty has a new handle in place with a 318.88 entry.

Stocks posted small gains Friday, staying calm despite blowout numbers on the employment front.


The Nasdaq added 0.2%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average popped 0.4%.


Small caps and midcaps did better, with the S&P 600 and S&P 400 rising 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. The IBD 50 edged up 0.2%.

Before the market's open, the Labor Department released the nonfarm payrolls data for February. The Street expected 190,000. The actual number was 242,000, which was 27% above the consensus target and almost 12% above the highest estimate in the range.


The numbers were stunningly good.


Wages, though, fell 0.1% in February after rising 0.5% in January. But the labor participation rate edged up to 62.9%.


The stock market had two ways to go on this data.


It could've dived, regarding the beat as ammunition for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Or it could've leaped ahead, convinced the supersized beat killed any chance of a recession this year.


The market found a third path: routine gains in mixed volume.


Restraint, though, could be seen as constructive for two reasons. First, the positive but measured response suggested that the market saw the news coming.


Second, excessive celebration almost always leads to a penalty. In the case of stocks, it's often a confidence-eroding pullback.


Individual investors should try to mirror the market's stance, which is avoiding excesses. There's no need to add exposure unless a recently purchased stock is working.


Confidence is growing, but by the spoon rather than the bucket.


Two sessions after the Feb. 17 follow-through day confirmed an uptrend was underway, the Big Picture offered [four clues](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/four-clues-to-tell-where-this-uptrend-will-go/) to gauge the uptrend.


No. 1: The uptrend must avoid selling pressure. So far, the uptrend has done that.


No. 2: New highs and new lows return to their usual balance. This is partly accomplished.


No. 3: Rotation from defensive plays to growth stocks. It's happening, though slowly.


(The Stock Spotlight screen had five defensive stocks when the indexes were bottoming in February. As of Friday's IBD, the screen had one. The IBD 50's defensive count fell from 14 to 10, going into Friday's market.)


No. 4: Quality breakouts. This too has been happening, though at a measured pace.


On Friday, chips stocks provided the breakouts.


**Macom Technology** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) served up convincing breakouts. **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) had already broken out past a 16.29 buy point and made a new high Friday before retreating.


In a Page 1 story in Friday's IBD, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said he expects Q1 to be the year's "trough."


The market appears to agree. [Chip stocks have done well](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/chip-stocks-are-showing-tenacity-which-are-the-best/) in this uptrend.


Meanwhile, **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) drew a bullish short stroke pattern, while **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) broke out of a cup base.


For the week, the midcap S&P 400 drove ahead 4.4% while the small-cap S&P 600 tailgated at 4.2%. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 2.8% and 2.7% respectively. The IBD 50 added 2.3%.

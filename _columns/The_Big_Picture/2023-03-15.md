Stock Market Off Lows Despite Contagion Fears; Gold Climbs While Crude Oil Plummets
====================================================================================

Stock market indexes headed sharply lower in the first half of Wednesday's session, sending bottom-fishers back to their caves after Tuesday's short-covering rally. Big Tech outperformed in a "not a bank" bid, leading a late afternoon recovery that lifted laggards off early lows.




Shock waves hit Europe overnight.


**Credit Suisse** ([CS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CS)) fell nearly 14% (trimming Wednesday's loss by about half) after the Swiss bank's biggest shareholder refused to add liquidity. European stock exchanges lost more than 3%, with selling pressure matching flights to safety on this side of the Atlantic.


Earlier Wednesday afternoon, a U.S. Treasury spokesman placed the odds for a Credit Suisse default at "greater than 50%." But a late report indicated the Swiss government would soon issue a "public statement of support." That added fuel to a surprising Nasdaq 100 bounce into the green.


The spreading crisis has stoked fears of a global financial shock wave, similar to 1997's "Asian Contagion."


The February producer price index, or PPI, posted a surprise decline while January was revised much lower. Together, they predict a rapid decline in wholesale prices. February retail sales also missed estimates.


The stock market would have rallied on these numbers just two weeks ago. But investors are now fixated on banking-system risk and rising odds for a recession that would lower S&P 500 profits.


Wednesday volume surged well above Tuesday levels, which fell sharply compared with Monday. This suggests that short-covering in an oversold market fueled yesterday's uptick, rather than legitimate buyers.


The 10-year Treasury yield reversed gears, dropping a shattering 23 basis points to 3.4% before bouncing to 3.49%. The note has been testing yield support around that low since early December.



Stock Market In Correction
--------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session with a 0.9% loss while the S&P 500 shed 0.7%. The Nasdaq composite closed nearly flat, underpinned by Big Tech strength. The Russell-2000 small-cap index brought up the rear, giving up 1.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rose 0.5%.


IBD lowered its outlook to "market in correction" last week, in recognition of weak stock market price action fueled by the banking crisis.


Now is the time to raise cash and avoid falling knives because prices could drop much lower. However, it also makes sense to build watchlists of the strongest performers because they could lead the upside when positive catalysts return.


Major benchmarks, except for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, have failed to mount their broken [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). The broad-based Nasdaq composite briefly mounted this resistance level Tuesday, but the rally got repelled. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average broke down earlier this month.


Finally, let's not forget the Russell 2000, which has traded poorly since the banking crisis began. The heavy weighting of regional banks is applying downward pressure, along with worries that small-business funding will dry up.


Gold Eyes $2,000; Crude Oil Hits 15-Month Low
---------------------------------------------


Gold futures took off once again this morning, rallying to a six-week high above $1,930, or about 180 on SPDR Gold Trust ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)).



The yellow metal has been testing resistance above $2,000 since a rally ended in August 2020. The 12-year pattern predicts that a breakout above this historic barrier could trigger a rapid advance above $3,000.


On the downside, U.S. crude oil futures cracked the $70 level hard after Tuesday's big sell-off, bring the three-day total loss to a stomach-churning 12%. Support lies around 62. This implosion signals [heightened fears about demand destruction](https://www.investors.com/news/chevron-exxon-mobil-falter-as-oil-prices-hit-15-month-lows/), consistent with a world economy spiraling toward recession.


Stock Market Movers & Shakers
-----------------------------


Money-center banks got sold heavily in broad-based declines.


Dow Jones component **JPMorgan Chas**e ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) fell 4.7%, while **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) dumped 5.4%. **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK))Â  lost 3.8%.

The SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) shed 2% and has relinquished 10% this week. The SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) eased a 1.6%, topping out a ferocious 23% decline in the last five trading days.

**Hyatt Hotels** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) fell 4.0% on economic contraction fears and also pierced the 50-day line. It has given up gains from a 108.20 buy point and rolled back toward a 103.60 handle entry. H stock closed 4% lower.

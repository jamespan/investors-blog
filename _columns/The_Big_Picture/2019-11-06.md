  Stock Market Resilient Again Amid China Trade Jitters; Qualcomm Jumps Late

The stock market turned in another resilient performance Wednesday despite some selling in the semiconductor sector and more China trade jitters.




The Nasdaq composite fell to session lows near midday, down nearly 0.7%, on reports a meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping to sign a preliminary trade deal could be delayed until December. Trump was targeting a meeting this month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile, but Chile canceled the summit due to unrest in the country.


By the close, though, it ended up being another good day for the bulls as major stock indexes closed near session highs. The Nasdaq composite eased 0.3%, the S&P 500 edged higher, and the Dow Jones ended mostly flat. The Russell 2000 got turned away at the 1600 level, falling 0.6%.


The Nasdaq marked a mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/), but it's clearly not a market under meaningful distribution at this point. Indeed, the stock market has recovered nicely after several distribution days hit the indexes in the second half of September. Still, after a torrid run for the indexes since early October, a pullback wouldn't be out of the ordinary. Stock market bulls want to see an orderly pullback in light volume, not one with heavy institutional selling.![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP4x3_110619-267x300.jpg)


Bond Yields Back Off
--------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield backed off 4 points to 1.82% after rising sharply for three straight sessions. Bonds rallied on news that productivity fell 0.3% in Q3, the first drop since 2015 and below the consensus estimate of 1% growth. Unit labor costs rose at a 3.6% clip, above the consensus estimate of 2.2%.


[Semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) were pressured after **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)), a top-rated chipmaker, reported disappointing sales and issued weak guidance. But Microchip is not the leader in the sector, because the real leaders in the sector like [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), and many others, broke out weeks ago. Microchip also has a weaker EPS Rating.


Defensive ETFs In Favor
-----------------------


Still, the stock market's tone turned defensive Wednesday as Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)), Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) outperformed, with gains of 0.3% to 0.4%.


In other stock market news, IBD's homebuilding group jumped more than 3%, but that was largely due to a 10% gain for **William Lyon Homes** ([WLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLH)). Early Wednesday, **Taylor Morrison** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) announced plans to buy the company for $2.4 billion. Taylor Morrison shares closed 5% lower.

Wednesday's after-hours session yielded some moves from top-rated growth stocks. **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) jumped 5% in late trading, but **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) crashed 14%. Investors also eyed reports from **Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)), **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), **Fiserv** ([FISV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FISV)) and **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)).


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Wednesday's session yielded another healthy dose of earnings winners.


**Bloomin' Brands** ([BLMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLMN)), the parent company of Outback Steakhouse, gapped up sharply at the open and held gains all day. Since it gapped up over a 21.16 entry, the stock's open price of 22.60 could've been used as an entry.


In the beaten-down software sector, **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)) gapped up close to a 65.55 buy point, but backed off highs, after the company delivered another quarter of strong sales growth. Q3 sales jumped 28% to $83.8 million, a slight acceleration from 27% growth in Q2 and Q1.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) regained its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 3%, as it works on a late-stage base.


**DaVita** ([DVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVA)), meanwhile, gapped out of a base with a 63.59 buy point. But a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 60 reflects a choppy record of earnings and sales.

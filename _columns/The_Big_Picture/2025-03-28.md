The stock market ended the day and week sharply lower after a hot inflation report and weak consumer sentiment spooked investors. Now, the so-called Trump tariff "Liberation Day" and the latest jobs report loom.


The Nasdaq composite was punched 2.2% lower on Friday, suffering a weekly decline of 2.6%, its fourth such drop in five weeks. It lost even more ground on its falling [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and the 200-day line. With just one trading day left in March, it is down 8.1% for the month and has recorded an eye-watering loss of 10.3% for 2025.




The S&P 500 skidded 2% Friday and slid 1.5% for the week. It ended the week back below its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) and has fallen in five of the past six weeks. The benchmark index is now down 5.1% for the year and more than 9% below February's all-time high of 6,147.43.


Decliners outnumbered advancers around 4-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was mixed, falling on the Nasdaq but rising on the NYSE.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 716 points, or 1.6%, Friday. While it fared best out of the major indexes it reversed below its 200-day line and ended the week down 1%. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) were among the worst performers here.


Small caps were mauled, with the Russell 2000 falling 2.1% Friday. Its 50-day line is bearishly trading below the 200-day moving average. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund was hammered 2.2% lower, though it remains well off recent lows.


Flight To Safety AsÂ Double Whammy Hits Stocks
---------------------------------------------


The fact the 10-year Treasury yield fell 11 basis points to 4.26% and that gold hit a record high underlined the flight to safety. Also, the Vix, Wall Street's fear gauge, soared 15.8%.


IBD's recommended market exposure sits at the 0%-20% level. At the moment it makes sense to mostly sit in cash and wait for a new follow-through day. Investors should use this as an opportunity to build up a watchlist of strong stocks for when the next uptrend emerges.


Indexes were hit with a double whammy of a hot inflation reading and a weak consumer sentiment report Friday. The latest personal consumption expenditures index showed prices up 2.8% year over year in February, slightly above the 2.7% estimate from economists. In addition, January's reading was revised slightly higher to 2.7%.

And the [University of Michigan's much-watched](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) monthly survey showed worsening consumer sentiment. The headline index reading was 57, the lowest since late 2022. Year-ahead inflation expectations jumped to 5% this month compared to 4.3% last month. This was above economist expectations. Also, two-thirds also see higher unemployment in the year ahead, the highest reading since 2009.


Trump Tariff Day, Jobs Report Due
---------------------------------


Meanwhile, the so-called Trump tariff "Liberation Day" comes Wednesday. This week's imposition of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could just be the prelude for more drastic measures. Crucially, the president may unveil a slate of reciprocal tariffs that could raise prices for consumers, at least in the short run.


Meanwhile, a slew of other economic data also is set to drop in the week ahead. The S&P final U.S. manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index reading as well as auto sales data for March drop Tuesday while the factory orders reading for February comes Wednesday. But labor data is the key theme of the week, with the ADP employment report due Wednesday before the all-important U.S. employment report Friday.


The current earnings season is virtually over, but there are still [a few noteworthy reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/jpmorgan-progressive-travelers-jpm-pgr-trv-stock-earnings-season/) on the way that are worth watching. Aircraft components play **Loar** ([LOAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOAR)), consumer staples stock **Conagra** ([CAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAG)) and home furnishings retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) are all set to report in the coming week.


Lululemon Hurts This Stock Market Group
---------------------------------------


Nearly all of [the S&P 500 sectors ended Friday lower](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Communication services, consumer discretionary and technology were hit the hardest while only utilities managed to squeeze out a gain.



A more specific overview of the damage [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) could be obtained by examining the performance of the 197 IBD industry groups.


Movie stocks, electronic consumer products firms, fabless chip stocks and educational software companies were among the worst laggards. The apparel group also underperformed after **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) plunged 14.2%. It was hammered despite an earnings beat, thanks to an underwhelming outlook from the company.


Utility stocks outperformed, with water, gas distribution and electronic power plays all doing relatively well. Heavy construction firms, solar plays and managed care companies were also among the better performers.


Finally, artificial intelligence infrastructure play **CoreWeave** ([CRWV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWV)) closed flat on its debut day. It comes after its initial public offering priced at 40 per share, below the expected range.

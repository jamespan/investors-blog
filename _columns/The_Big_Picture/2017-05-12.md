 U.S. stock indexes tilted opposite ways for the week, as the Nasdaq gained while the S&P 500 lost ground.


The Nasdaq's 0.3% weekly gain was its fourth advance in a row. The S&P 500 retreated 0.3%, ending a three week win streak.


Friday's daily action also had a split quality. The Nasdaq finished up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average and the small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively. The Russell 2000 keeps lagging, and all gains since it broke above a trend line in April are now gone.

Department stores had a horrific week, but it was mainly a case of piling onto previous pain. The group began the week down 12% for the year and ended the week off about 25% for 2017.


While this captured many of the headlines, individual investors are best off taking a contrarian stance vs. overblown news headlines. After all, what did all fuss over retail teach investors? Nothing. The troubles in retail were already well-known among investors who follow the market closely. IBD's [cover story on the pressured retail sector](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stores-still-have-hope-but-what-about-retail-stocks/) ran five weeks ago.


If the retail honk is worth ignoring, then where should investors be looking?


A good place to start is among industry groups that did well for the week. Consider:


The machinery and metal handling stocks surged almost 7% for the week. Inside the group, **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) soared 28%. **Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)) jumped 13%. **ExOne** ([XONE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XONE)) stormed 23.5% higher. Each of these stocks are in the 3D printing space, and the bases are early stage.


Software gaming stocks advanced 8%. **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)) blasted 14% higher for the week, while **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) rose 4%.


Gold-mining stocks jumped almost 7% for the week. **Royal Gold** ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD)), **Franco Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)) and **Randgold Resources** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) gained 10%, 6% and 5% respectively. All three are working on bases.


**Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), a September initial public offering, rocketed 30% Friday as it cleared a cup base. The microcap company reported that earnings rose 100% to 18 cents a share on a 76% pop in revenue. Trade Desk has an exceptional cash flow per share ($7.17 in 2016 vs. earnings of 86 cents a share).


**Coming up:** On Monday, Empire State manufacturing data for May will be reported before the market's open. A half-hour after the open, the National Association of Home Builders will release the reading on its housing market index.

After two straight days of bold gains, a volatile stock market appears to have found its footing.




One session after roaring 3.1%, the Nasdaq composite added 3.4%. The index closed back above the 14,000 level for the first time since Jan. 20.


The S&P 500 climbed 1.9% and — in its own positive step — went back above the 200-day moving average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2% and is now also past the 200-day line.


For both the Nasdaq and S&P 500, it's been the best two-day rally since April 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

That's a change in sentiment from the previous many days, when it was mostly losses and closes near session lows.


Stock Market Marks Follow-Through
---------------------------------


Most important, volume rose on the Nasdaq from Friday's level in a late burst, perhaps due to some end-of-month trading. Monday's increase in price and volume marked a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) rally confirmation, coming on the sixth day from the Jan. 24 lows. NYSE volume also rose, meaning the S&P 500 made its own follow-through.


With that, the stock market correction is over, and investors should be getting reinvested in stocks. But proceed with care, making sure indexes stay on an upward path and don't flip direction.


This follow-through is unusual in that the Nasdaq is still below its 200-day moving average. That's not exactly a deal-breaker, but a symptom of how much capital was chopped to bits in January.


January was the worst month for both indexes since March 2020, when the Covid-19 crisis was in full force. The S&P also just had its worst January since 2009, down 5.3%, and the Nasdaq's was the worst January since 2008.


Even if investors want to buy stocks, there's precious little to invest in. Screens such as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) don't offer much for growth investors.


Few Stocks Look Enticing
------------------------


Most top stocks are a ways from buy points, still forming the left side or bottom portion of new bases. IBD MarketSmith's list of stocks near buy points shows only a dozen companies, and a few of those are being acquired.



Most others are forming messy charts. **Packaging Corp. of America** ([PKG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKG)) is forming one of the better bases, a [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), and is 4% away from the 155.88 buy point.


Investors also could look into supply-chain stocks. **Global Ship Lease** ([GSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSL)) broke out of a cup base and is in buy range of its 26.61 buy point. **Matson** ([MATX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MATX)) is still in buy range, as is **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)).


The energy sector also has some stocks worth checking. **Williams Cos.** ([WMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMB)) is above the 29.94 buy point of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Steelmaker **Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)) is another intriguing option.


In a stock market lacking many opportunities, investors might find some unfamiliar names emerging as leaders. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and most major techs are still deep in consolidations.


As an alternative, investors can look to index ETFs to raise exposure.


Unfamiliar New Stock Market Leadership?
---------------------------------------


**Daseke** ([DSKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DSKE)) made a firm move above the 10.51 buy point of a double-bottom base, and the relative strength line made a new high. The stock is low priced but still has an adequate amount of average volume. Also, many top-rated mutual funds own shares of the logistics company.


Despite the market's positive signal Monday, investors should build up exposure carefully. The stock market faces uncertainties that could spark new selling with a single headline.


The stock market is concerned about the Fed's plans for interest rates. Inflation reports, once a routine event, can spark sell-offs these days. But these risks are actually easier to gauge than others.


The Russia-Ukraine crisis could deteriorate at any moment. Any dangerous turn in the pandemic could blindside the market. Earnings reports are always unpredictable. So get back into this new uptrend with the prerequisite caution.

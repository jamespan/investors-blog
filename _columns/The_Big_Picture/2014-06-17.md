The Nasdaq and S&P 500 extended their winning streaks to three sessions Tuesday. More breakouts emerged ahead of the Fed's monetary-policy decision due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.

  

Overall, it was a solid performance, considering the latest round of economic data left something to be desired.

  

The Nasdaq picked up 0.4% while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. The IBD 50 held its own, rising 0.6%. Small-cap stocks outperformed as the Russell 2000 rose 0.8%. Nasdaq volume rose 8% from Monday's level. NYSE volume rose 3%.

  

In economic news, consumer prices rose more than expected, which raised some interest-rate fears. May housing starts and building permits fell more than expected, but homebuilders generally took the news in stride. Many rallied back after early weakness.

  

Top-rated **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) rose 1.3% as it works on a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point of 42.38. Luxury builder **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), meanwhile, eased 0.4% but closed near its session high. It's also working on a cup-with-handle base. Note that the Relative Price Strength Ratings for each stock are weak.

  

A decision on interest rates and a policy statement from the Fed loom large. The Fed is widely expected to reduce monthly bond purchases by another $10 billion to $35 billion. At the March meeting, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen suggested the Fed's first rate hike could come sooner than expected. It rattled the market at the time, but the first rate hike still isn't expected until mid-2015.

  

It's hard to complain about the market's technical health and the action in leading growth stocks at this point. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to trade tightly and to hold near highs after the market confirmed a new uptrend on May 27. Rather than pay attention to scare headlines warning of a market pullback, listen to the market itself. The narrative is a bullish one.

  

More breakouts emerged Tuesday. **Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 123.72 in strong volume. Shares rose nearly 5%.

  

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) also cleared a cup-with-handle base, rising 3%. The buy point was 434.99. Morgan Stanley upgraded the video-streaming company, saying Netflix should be able to get to 110 million subscribers worldwide by 2020.

  

Big buyers were also in **Navigator Holdings** ([NVGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVGS)). Shares jumped 6% in strong turnover. The new issue reclaimed a 28.58 buy point.

  

**Micros Systems** ([MCRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCRS)) surged out of a 23-week consolidation, rising 15%, after Bloomberg reported that **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) is in talks to acquire the software maker for more than $5 billion.

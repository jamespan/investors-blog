U.S. stock market indexes barreled ahead Thursday on promising trade-war news from China.




The major indexes capitalized on the news, closing above the 50-day moving average for the first time in four weeks.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 advanced 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively. Blue chips in the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 popped 1.8%.


Volume increased on both major exchanges. In the process, the S&P 500's Aug. 14 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) was deleted because the index climbed more than 5% from that day's close.

Headline risk, though, remains because of the trade war with China and the ever-changing posturing from President Donald Trump and communist China's Xi Jinping.


Round 13 In The Trade War
-------------------------


Chinese and U.S. negotiators are [planning to meet in October](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-talks-boost-dow-jones-maybe-last-chance-for-deal/). Although there have been 12 rounds of high-level talks between the U.S. and China, a key source in China expects a breakthrough in round 13.


Hu Xijin, the editor of the communist People's Daily's tabloid Global Times, said he expects "substantial progress" in talks set for early October. The apparently well-connected Hu has been accurate in previous commentary on the trade war.


Both sides in the conflict face the same challenge: how to shape an agreement that doesn't involve losing face for the U.S. or China.


The Shanghai composite rose 1% Thursday, marking its fourth gain in a row. U.S. stocks showed broad strength Thursday, but top-rated issues were somewhat mixed. Losers in strong volume included textbook provider **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), down 6.6%; **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), off 5.4%; and **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)), down almost 5% on [news of a rival service](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/match-stock-facebook-dating-expansion-us/) from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


Chip Stocks Up On China News
----------------------------


[Semiconductor companies](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etf-leaders/semiconductor-stocks-rally-etfs-close-to-buy-points/), many of which have significant exposure to China, did fine. The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 3.1%.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, only a handful fell 1% or more — gold miners, homebuilders, soap and utilities.


On the upside, 54 groups jumped 3% or more, according to preliminary data. They included retail, machinery-metal handling, tires, data storage, apparel, electronics and super-regional banks.


[Industry groups](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) rising outnumbered those declining by an 8-to-1 ratio.


Factory Orders Better Than Expected
-----------------------------------


The market had more than China to celebrate. Factory orders for July grew 1.4%, topping the Street's consensus view for a 1% increase. Investors were sensitive to the report because of a bad miss Tuesday in the ISM manufacturing gauge.


The Automated Data Processing jobs report for August rolled in at 195,000, smashing the consensus view for 150,000.


Motor vehicle sales topped views narrowly, while first-time jobless claims were slightly worse than expected.


Breakouts Pick Up
-----------------


[Breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) Thursday picked up the pace, helped in many cases by earnings reports. Stocks breaking out included payment processor **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)), chip equipment maker **ASML Holding** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), vehicle auctioneer **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) and apparel retailer **Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)).


Stocks scoring 52-week highs included social media platform provider **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)), heavy construction play **MasTec** ([MTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTZ)), **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)), **Wendy's** ([WEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEN)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) (which topped a 184.17 buy point) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)).



On Friday before the market's open, the payrolls and employment data for August will be released. The Street expects nonfarm payrolls to come in at 160,000.


Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell will speak at 12:30 p.m. ET in Switzerland on the "Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy."


What To Do Now
--------------


With the pressure off the stock market, individual investors can get more aggressive, but selectively. The prudent approach is to buy one stock that is breaking out and see if it works. Gauge your exposure to the market based on how stocks are actually behaving.

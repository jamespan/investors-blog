Satisfied with dinner, stock market bulls stuck around for dessert Monday as the major indexes extended their uptrend and crossed significant chart levels.




The Nasdaq composite led with a 1.1% increase, and the S&P 500 added 0.7%. Both stretched their win streaks to five sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%.


In a notable bit of chart action, all three indexes climbed above last week's brief consolidation. It seemed like an act of defiance to those who believed the market was already too extended. The Dow topped the 35,000 level, while the S&P and Nasdaq closed above their Sept. 1 highs.


Volume was little changed from Friday's totals. Breadth was bullish, with advancers leading by an 8-5 ratio over decliners on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange.


The Nasdaq 100 rose 1.2%, making its highest close of the year and best since Jan. 4, 2022. The index outperformed in large part because large caps beat small caps and the stock market's so-called Magnificent Seven performed so well.


Magnificent Seven stock **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) jumped 2.1% to an all-time high in double its average volume. The company scored a coup in the artificial intelligence space by [hiring OpenAI co-founders](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-software-giant-hires-openai-executives/) Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. Altman was forced out of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, on Friday while Brockman quit in protest.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP112023-227x300.jpg)**Among other stocks in that group, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rose 0.9% and is close to recapturing a $3 trillion market cap. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is finding support at the 50-day moving average. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is near a 145.86 buy point. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) is near two-year highs.


Further, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) also is at record highs ahead of its earnings report Tuesday after the close.


The Vanguard MegaCap ETF ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)) rose 0.8%, beating the Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark's 0.5% increase.


Stock Market Opportunities Beyond Big Guns
------------------------------------------


After Monday's gain, the Nasdaq climbed more than 5% above the close of its Nov. 9 distribution day, which removes that day of heavy institutional selling. The S&P 500 still has one distribution day that has yet to be wiped away in the same manner.


Investors continue to find opportunities in the stock market's underbrush, where midcap and small-cap leaders continue to emerge.


Midcaps **InterDigital** ([IDCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDCC)) and **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)) broke out to new highs. **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), **MicroStrategy** ([MSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR)), **AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)), **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) and **Ensign Group** ([ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)) were earlier breakouts.


To be sure, quite a few stocks with market caps above $20 billion have been leading the uptrend, including **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).


With signs pointing north, IBD continues with a recommended exposure level of 80% to 100%. Many of the breakouts this month are extended, however, so investors need to be careful to buy near buy points.


Bonds, Economic Data, Thanksgiving
----------------------------------


The bond market had a measured response to the latest Treasury bond auctions. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 2 basis points to 4.42%.


In a quiet day for economic data, the index of leading economic indicators [fell 0.8% in October](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/economy-still-flashing-recession-signs-u-s-leading-index-finds-0be9cb20). It was the 19th consecutive decline and slightly worse than the consensus forecast from economists.


While the stock market is on cruise control, it would not be surprising to see indexes pull back this week. Last week's three-day pause seems insufficient in the context of the [greatest three-week rally](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/indexes-close-little-changed-is-stock-market-stalling-or-gearing-up-for-more-gains/) since the 2020 market low.


Thanksgiving week could slow the bulls. Trading tends to slow the one week a year where the stock market closes Thursday and is open only a half session Friday.


Historically, the S&P 500 has a positive Thanksgiving week. Since 1950, the index has climbed an average of 0.7%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. More than twice as many Thanksgiving weeks, 50, ended with gains than with losses, 23.

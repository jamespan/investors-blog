Sellers had the upper hand for the better part of Monday's session, but buyers came in during the last hour of trading, a nice change of pace from a rough prior week.


The Nasdaq recovered the bulk of a 1.5% intraday loss by the close, falling just 0.1%. The S&P 500 added 0.1% and the Dow outperformed, rising 0.3%. Small caps lagged again, with the Russell 2000 down 0.4%. Volume on both exchanges rose slightly from Friday's levels.


Despite a positive performance for the major averages, breadth was weak again, with NYSE declining stocks outnumbering advancers by close to 2-to-1. On the Nasdaq, losers topped winners by about 8-to-5.

After falling 10% last week, crude oil futures for February delivery shed $1.75, or 5.3%, to $31.41 a barrel, the lowest settlement since December 2003, according to FactSet. Earlier in the day, Morgan Stanley joined others in predicting $20 a barrel, citing the potential of continued strength in the U.S. dollar.


The reason behind oil's drop continues to be widely debated. A strong U.S. dollar isn't helping matters. A supply glut has also been well documented. Others say that oil's weakness could be flagging more economic softness ahead, not only abroad but in the U.S.


The price action in the broad market was positive, but growth stocks generally remain out of favor. The IBD 50 slumped 1.2% Monday.


Defensive names like **Tyson Foods** ([TSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSN)), **J.M. Smucker** ([SJM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SJM)) and **Dr. Pepper Snapple Group** ([DPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPS)) continue to show relative strength. High-yielding utilities and real estate investment trusts also have emerged as safe havens.


Several institutional-quality stocks throughout IBD growth screens are consolidating below their 50-day moving averages. Some will go on to form new bases, and new breakouts will be fueled by institutional buying. For others, it could just be a pause before more selling. That's why keeping your powder dry is the best strategy for now.


It's not known at this point which former leaders will be able to maintain their leadership down the line. New leaders will also emerge. For now, sellers are in control.


**Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) could be in the early stages of breaking down from a late-stage base. It's now 33% off its prior high.


On the other hand, names like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) could still offer leadership going forward. All three pullbacks have been well contained so far.

Nasdaq Up 6th Day In A Row As Leaders Stay Firm
================================================

Calm days in the market can be constructive, especially amid a barrage of headlines and wild predictions ($10 crude oil, anyone?). Wednesday was such a day.


The Nasdaq quietly posted its sixth straight up day, rising 0.1%, while the S&P 500 surrendered less than 1 point. Volume was down on the Nasdaq, up a tad on the NYSE.


Statistically speaking, veteran market watchers know to expect some sort of decline when a major index goes up that many days in a row, no matter how big or small those forward steps are.


Case in point: The Nasdaq went on a six-day, 4.4% advance from Jan. 16 to 26. It promptly gave back roughly two-thirds of that gain the next two sessions as the market's boxlike range continued to form.


But today, at least for now, the Nasdaq has escaped that box shortly after the IBD Market Pulse outlook changed to "Uptrend resumes" more than a week ago.


In turn, leading stocks with high-quality fundamentals have done their duty to carry the market higher.


The "Leaders up in volume" portion of today's Market Pulse table notes breakouts that are working.


**Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) rushed past a 59.54 cup entry and finished Wednesday at 62.47, up almost 5%. **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) burst through a 64.71 flat-base buy point. **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) and **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) reflect strength in software and chips respectively.


Even **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), which made the Leaders down in volume section of the Pulse, counts as a valid leader that's holding firmly above its recent breakout point at 272.85. The giant drug firm will change its name to Allergan, which it's acquiring.


The IBD 50 rose 0.3%.


Market technicals remain positive. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are positive. Winners edged losers by a fraction on both markets.


On Wednesday, stocks in the utility, generic drug, airline, restaurant and food sectors outperformed. Cellar-dwelling oil stocks fell on the heels of a plunge in U.S. wholesale prices.


Bullishness, at least as measured by Investors Intelligence, is getting hot again. (See the chart on B11.) At 56.6%, it's the highest level since mid-September. Yet, this secondary sentiment indicator is not that useful to spot major market tops. Watch the distribution-day count instead. The Jan. 12 distribution day is now off the count.

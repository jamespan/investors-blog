Nasdaq Leads Another Robust Stock Market Drop; Is The Rally In Tech Stocks Done For Now?
=========================================================================================

Is the 2023 rally in tech stocks over?




IBD readers might be very interested in knowing the answer to this simple yet complicated question. Of course, no one knows. But the use of time-proven sell signals that allow investors to preserve the bulk of their gains and avoid catastrophic losses may ultimately help give the best clues.


Over the past week, the sell-offs in a good chunk of leading tech stocks have provided all the encouragement needed to [lock in gains](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) or [cut losses](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


They include names like **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) (down 17% on Tuesday) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) (sinking 4% since sliding below its 50-day moving average five sessions ago).


Meanwhile, **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) has suffered an almost 24% shelling over a six-session decline.


**Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) dropped 23% on Wednesday even after posting [another quarter of healthy profit and sales growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/smci-stock-smci-earnings-q42023/) (up 34% each). Investors apparently sought a more bullish outlook for the September quarter.


Yet SMCI was already ripe for at least a short-term top. Why? On Monday, at one point shares rose more than 150% above their own 200-day moving average — a clue that a stock's move has gone parabolic in nature and cannot be sustained.

Another sell-off in leading tech stocks led to an almost 1.2% drop for the Nasdaq composite on Wednesday. Volume increased vs. the prior session. Thus, another distribution day, or bout of heavy professional selling, got added to IBD's Market Pulse tally.


For sure, Wednesday's drop in higher volume follows the bearish script of a stock market that displayed signs of an uptrend under notable pressure. This change in the current outlook for stocks took place exactly a week ago, on Aug. 2.


In an uptrend under pressure, investors should consider new buys with the utmost care. Raising cash by selling the weakest stocks in the portfolio and selling winners into strength also pads the account with cash to weather a potential new leg down.

Tech Stocks Affect Other Indexes
--------------------------------


Tech stocks with giant market valuations also continue to make their impact on the other indexes.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP080923_3-222x300.jpg)The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, slightly worse than the 0.5% drop by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


Volume stepped a tad lower on the NYSE vs. Tuesday, early data showed. Meanwhile, the July 5 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the S&P 500 due to the 25-session expiration rule. Higher volume gave the Nasdaq another distribution day Wednesday.


Technical View
--------------


The Nasdaq composite has basically led the rebound throughout the year. But Wednesday's sixth decline in seven sessions has placed the key benchmark for tech stocks at an important juncture. At 13,722, the Nasdaq closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since March 13.


As seen on a daily chart, the index closed just slightly below this technical level.


Deep drops through the 50-day line have tended to warn astute chart readers of a deeper decline ahead.


Over the past 18 months of market history, one only needs to review how the Nasdaq did after falling through its 50-day moving average in 2022 on April 8, Aug. 30 and Dec. 15.



Of course, all three of those dates took place in 2022, one of the worst bear markets in the new millennium.


So, how about the S&P 500? At 4467, the large-cap index remains less than 1% above its own rising 50-day line. Equal-weighted versions of the S&P 500 — such as the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund, as well as First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) — also currently tread on the north side of their 50-day moving averages.



On the other hand, popular ETFs that track certain types of tech stocks have made deeper undercuts of their 50-day lines. VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)), down 2% in accelerating turnover, and the iShares Expanded Tech Software ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)), offer two timely examples of the growing weakness in tech stocks.


IGV slumped almost 1.2% on Wednesday for its fifth decline in six sessions.

Outside The Tech Sector
-----------------------


Beyond tech stocks, other sector indexes failed to make any bullish noise on Wednesday. The Dow Jones transportation average lost 0.8% amid a sell-off in airline shares. Perhaps the ongoing third-quarter rally in crude oil futures is having an impact on the airlines industry group. Meanwhile, some travel bloggers have noted signs that flying demand may be showing signs of cooling in the fall.


Elsewhere, the Dow Jones utility average edged up less than 1 point. While the index rose for a third straight session, it remains deep underneath the 50- and 200-day moving averages. For sure, defensive sectors such as utilities have underperformed tech stocks this year.


After a deep sell-off in long-dated government bonds since late July, buyers have slowly returned to the trading pits. The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell for the third time in four sessions. On Wednesday, the yield eased 1 basis point to 4.01%.


Watch for more volatility early Thursday, ahead of fresh data on U.S. [consumer prices for July](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-rise-in-july-federal-reserve-policy/) scheduled before the market open. You can view the [Econoday estimates in our Economic Calendar](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


Strongest Industry Groups Year To Date
--------------------------------------


All in all, the past three weeks have served as a healthy pullback. The Nasdaq has fallen roughly 5% from its year-to-date peak of 14,446. Of course, a host of tech stocks that have gone up a ton have given back much more.


The S&P 500's decline from a 4607 peak on July 27 to Wednesday's session low of 4461? Also mild at just above 3%.


It may be worth watching how the very best performers within IBD's 197 industry groups perform during the typically weaker late-summer-to-early-fall period of August and September.


[According to MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?intcode=lgnv%7Clgnv%7CMarketSmith%7C2023%7C06%7Cmsp%7Cna%7C%7C725068&src=A00653), 14 of IBD's 197 industry groups hold a 40% gain since Jan. 1 through Wednesday. Note that the performance is price-weighted.

The stock market saw a hot winning streak finally come to an end Friday amid warm inflation data. Now the latest Fed minutes loom after the Presidents Day holiday break.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day down 0.8% and notched a weekly decline of 1.3%. Bulls will say such a decline is not unexpected given this was a first losing week in six. The tech-heavy index is now making a test of buying support at the 10-day line but remains above its other [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). It is still up nearly 7% so far in 2023.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP021624.jpg)The S&P 500 fell 0.5% on Friday and declined 0.3% for the week, bringing its own five-week winning streak to a close. Nevertheless, it retains a healthy gap above its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) as it tests the 10-day moving average. The benchmark index also holds a gain of more than 5% for the year so far.


Decliners outnumbered advancers by around 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 1.5-to-1 on the Nasdaq exchange. Volume was lower on both exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also stumbled, falling 0.4%. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) were the worst laggards while **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) performed best.


Small caps struggled the most on the stock market, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.4%. It remains above the 2,000 mark, however, and is up about 1% since the start of the year. Growth stocks also were mauled by the bears, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund tumbling 1.4%. FFTY still holds a stout gain of about 14% for the year.


Fed Minutes Await After Presidents Day
--------------------------------------


Stocks were forced lower after Labor Department data showed the producer price index rose 0.3% in January, above economists' consensus estimate for a 0.1% lift. Core PPI was even hotter, rising 0.5% compared to views for a 0.1% advance.


It comes on the back of hotter-than-expected consumer price index data earlier in the week. This poured some cold water on hopes for imminent rate cuts.


In the coming week, investors will be poring over the latest Fed minutes, due Wednesday, to gain insight into the future path of interest rates. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic spoke out Thursday to say he sees two rate cuts ahead in 2024, though he also said he will "adjust and adapt" if inflation falls faster than expected. Bostic is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee.


It could also be a crunch week for some of the year's major stock market winners. Artificial intelligence darling **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is the [biggest name posting earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-nvidia-stock/) but **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and Latin American e-commerce play **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) are other notable names that are reporting.

These Stock Market Areas Shine
------------------------------


A majority of the [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday lower](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Materials and health care were the best-performing areas while real estate and communication services fell the most.



As ever, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups offered a deeper insight into the action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Chip equipment plays, advertising stocks, discount retailers and diversified medical companies were among the biggest winners in Friday's action.


Conversely, health and accident insurance firms, desktop software companies, movie stocks and wireless telecom services plays all struggled.


Computer hardware stocks fell hard too amid climax top-like action from **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)). Volume was high as the AI play suffered a decline of 20%.


Despite the massive reversal it remains above its short-term moving averages and actually gained for the week.

The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended with modest gains Monday but closed off session highs as sellers came into the market during the final 15 minutes of trading. The North Korea-U.S. meeting and the upcoming two-day Federal Reserve were in the headlines, while the Nasdaq 100 yielded some big movers.




**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was a big gainer in the Nasdaq 100, rising 4.5%, while former [chip-equipment leaders](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) lagged on a weak session for chip-equipment makers.


The Dow ended higher by less than 0.1%, the S&P inched up 0.1% and the Nasdaq added 0.2%. The S&P 500 showed stalling-type action, closing in the bottom half of its intraday range after early strength. Preliminary data showed volumes on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly lower than Friday's levels.


North Korea Meeting
-------------------


The meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un comes after a contentious G-7 meeting over the weekend where Trump withdrew support for a joint G-7 statement that called for a reduction in tariffs.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MP061118.jpg)This week's Federal Reserve meeting gets underway Tuesday, with a decision on interest rates due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate by a quarter point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. According to the [CME Group FedWatch tool](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/), the chances for a rate hike are at 96%.


But the path of interest-rate hikes for the rest of the year is a little more uncertain. The market currently sees a 71% chance of a quarter-point at the Sept. 26 meeting.


Distribution Day Count
----------------------


Headed into Monday, the [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 was a bit high at five each. However, out of the Nasdaq's five higher-volume declines since May 15, the worst was an 0.8% decline on May 15. So it's not an index under meaningful distribution.


What trumps the distribution-day count at this point is the overall strong action in leading growth stocks. Breakouts have generally been acting well. [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) names **Tiffany** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), for example, are holding gains after bullish gaps up in price.


Oil And Gas Leaders
-------------------


Meanwhile, several top-rated [oil and gas stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) continue to show leadership. Headed into Monday, IBD's exploration and production group was ranked inside the top 10 out of 197 groups ranked by IBD based on six-month price performance.


**WildHorse Resource Development** ([WRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WRD)) is trading tightly above its 10-week moving average after a recent breakout. **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) is getting support so far at the 10-week moving average. It's the first test of the 10-week line after a breakout from a base in March.


Inside The IBD 50
-----------------


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) halted a three-session slide, rising 2.6%. It's still in buy range after a low-volume breakout from a double-bottom base with a 105.78 entry. Fast-growing retailer **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) also outperformed in the IBD 50. Shares rose 1.8% as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base.


IBD 50 component **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) added just over 1%, helped by an upgrade from Jefferies to buy from hold and a raised price target to 50 from 40. Shares of Match plunged 22% on May 1 after **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) unveiled a dating app.


RH Surges In Late Trading
-------------------------


**RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, gained nearly 5% in heavy volume before its earnings report after the close. In after-hours trading, shares of the upscale retailer surged 16% on [strong results](https://www.investors.com/news/rh-earnings-restoration-hardware-q1/).


It was featured as a possible call-option trade in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-options-restoration-hardware-bullish-chart/) column, but the premium for the 118 strike price (June 15 expiration) offered a pricey trade with elevated downside risk of nearly 7%.

  Stocks Remain In A Sideways Trend, But One With A Curious Characteristic

The stock market remained stuck in neutral Tuesday, a trendless pattern in the near term that so far shows no real signs of stress.




The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.2% as a few of its components made sizable gains. The S&P 500 added 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite was a fraction lower. The Russell 2000 fell 0.3%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell NYSE volume fell slightly. Breadth was more bearish than the indexes suggested: Decliners beat advancers by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq and by 9-to-7 on the NYSE.


Since Oct. 6, the Nasdaq's close has not moved more than 0.3% in a single session. The S&P 500 hasn't changed more than 0.2% from day to day. With such small movements, it's hard to notice the record highs that the major indexes have notched during that period, including a new high for the Dow Tuesday.


While indexes are flat, there are discernible trends in some sectors the past two weeks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP101717-191x300.png)The small-cap rally has stalled; the Russell 2000 is now trending a bit lower. Retail and telecom stocks have been falling the past two weeks. The top-ranked homebuilders are easing. The technology, materials and real estate sectors have been rising. Dividend and emerging market plays also have trended higher. In all, these trends are offsetting each other, resulting in a sideways market.


But the indexes that matter most — the Nasdaq and S&P — are holding up, refusing to surrender any ground from their highs.


Moreover, there's been no [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in more than three weeks and only one in the past month. That's a remarkably long period without any institutional selling, and the longest dry period this year. That alone should give investors reason to stay in stocks.


Wall Street is remarkably tranquil as earnings season begins. Political and geopolitical risks have not shaken investors. To be sure, many important earnings reports are still a week or more away, but so far the indexes have not displayed any fear.


Another trend in Tuesday's trading was the sudden weakening in some top Chinese stocks.


IBD 50 member **Jupai Holdings**'s ([JP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JP)) fell more than 4% after making new highs; more bearish reversals like the one Tuesday would raise a red flag for a stock that's nearly doubled in three weeks.


**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) is getting stuck under its 50-day moving average. **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) has dipped below the 177.10 buy point of its Sept. 13 breakout from an [ascending base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/). Other Chinese stocks were among the weakest in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50/) Tuesday.


Meanwhile, some stocks that had bounced off declines to the 200-day moving average made solid gains, including a smattering of restaurants. **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) hit a 52.01 buy point before paring gains. **Red Robin Gourmet Burger** ([RRGB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RRGB)) rose more than 3% as it forms the right side of a base.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Restaurant stocks have lagged lately. As of Monday's close, the group ranked [141st out of 197 industries](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-oct-16-2017/) for six-month relative performance.

There was some notable action in the prestige stocks. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) broke out past a 175.59 buy point. It wasn't a price surge that makes you think institutions were desperate to buy Facebook shares. Also, volume was modestly above average and the relative strength line did not make a new high. Then again, Facebook's January breakout also was quiet and the stock still made a superb advance.


Dow components **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) helped the Dow make a new high as both companies beat third-quarter expectations early Tuesday. J&J, which boosted its 2017 guidance, jumped 3.4% as it solidified a breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/).


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) was the poorest Dow component of the day, off 2.6% despite quarterly results that came in above consensus estimates.

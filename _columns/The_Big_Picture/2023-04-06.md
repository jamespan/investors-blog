Nasdaq, S&P 500 Rise To Close Out Week; Pivotal Jobs Report Up Next
====================================================================

The stock market rose modestly Thursday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the way ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls labor report for March. Adding a twist, the stock market is closed on Good Friday, so the impact of the jobs report won't be felt until Monday's session.




Amid the ongoing uptrend, there are a number of leading stocks that are setting up for higher prices, including [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watchlist stock **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and retail leader **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


Jobs Report, Jobless Claims
---------------------------


Early Friday, the [jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-is-rolling-over-is-it-fast-enough-for-the-federal-reserve/) is expected to show the U.S. economy added 240,000 new jobs in March, near a two-year low but still too strong for the Federal Reserve. The unemployment rate is expected to hold at 3.6%, while average hourly wage growth eases to 4.3% year over year.


Thursday's initial unemployment claims data jumped to 228,000 pink slips. Economists had expected a slight rise to 201,000, compared with 198,000 in the previous week.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher, taking its weekly gain to 0.6%. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4%, with the index down just 0.1% this week. Finally, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied 0.8% but shed 1.1% on the week, ending a recent leadership streak.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.6%, falling for a third straight session. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) dived nearly 7% after Wedbush downgraded the stock from neutral to underperform. Shares remain above a 95.32 buy point, but big gains are dwindling.


Despite this week's Nasdaq losses, the market outlook remains in a confirmed uptrend, which means investors continue to have the green light to buy breakout stocks. IBD's recommended exposure currently sits at 40% to 60%, but weakness in growth and other leading stocks in recent sessions is concerning.


And, of course, investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.

Stock Market Bounces After Fed Rate Hike; How Two Pros View The Future For Growth Stocks
=========================================================================================

The [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) was certainly due for a bounce. And the indexes' action Wednesday highlighted investors' shift in thinking about how the Federal Reserve thinks about raging inflation and the steps it will take to halt it.




For months, the Fed had signaled that raising the interest cost on overnight bank loans by half a percentage point would be effective in its quest to balance economic growth with rising prices. But last week's report on [bigger-than-expected gains in consumer prices in May](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) convinced the Fed that more aggressive action was needed.


So, as the CME Fed Watch analysis of futures traders predicted, the central bank pushed the fed funds rate by three quarters of a point to a target range of 1.5%-1.75%. That marked the first increase of this size since 1994.


[A news conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-preview-4-key-questions-will-shape-dow-jones-outlook/) also indicated that the bank would do the same during its next meeting on interest rate policy on July 26-27. This would mean short-term interest rates may hit as high as 2.5% by summer's end. That would reach the highest level since 3% in January 2008.


Stock Market Today: These Industries Pace Rebound

Given that some of the day's sharpest advances came from the software sector, no wonder the Nasdaq paced the market's rebound with a 2.5% gain. The composite index returned above 11,000, but still lies nearly 32% below an all-time peak of 16,212.


The S&P 500, up 1.5% to halt a five-day slide, saw its rebound impeded by sharp losses among oil stocks. While the Russell 2000 rose 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged a touch, up 1%. Volume rose on both main exchanges.

As President Joe Biden threatened to use his exclusive powers to force oil and gas firms to boost output, energy prices slumped. Oil and gas made up a majority of the day's worst five industry groups. West Texas Intermediate crude oil slid 3% to $115.30 a barrel.


The Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) ETF, a big winner since the start of 2022, fell 2.2% in above-average turnover. The exchange traded fund is making its third test of support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) in as many months. At 82.38, the ETF still harbors a 48% gain year to date.


Are Techs Bottoming?
--------------------


The 13 industry groups rising 3% or more on the day included database, education, enterprise and design software. Certainly, a modest uptick in quarterly sales growth by **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) announced earlier in the week helped the cause. But with IBD's enterprise software industry group still 57% off its November 2021 peak, the astute IBD reader would not be surprised to find few, if any, stocks in this and other key growth industries ready the bust the bears' chops with [powerful breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Rick Pitcairn, chief investment officer of Pitcairn, a multifamily wealth management office with $7.1 billion in assets under advisement, notes that if you bought bank and tech stocks at the bottom of the Great Financial Crisis bear market of 2008, you still would have had to wait a long time to see these investments pay off.


"I think we'll see a market that's more like the 1970s and 1980s," Pitcairn told IBD. "In the past, tech outperformed U.S. equities. U.S. equities outperformed international. International outperformed everything else. People yearn for this, but we don't think this will happen soon."


In other words, Pitcairn suggests keeping a sharp focus, for now, on sectors that have outperformed since the end of 2020 â€” namely value, cyclical and defensive shares.

Beyond The Stock Market: Options Traders Get Fearful
----------------------------------------------------


David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com, agrees.


"All the megacap names have been struggling and fallen below key support levels," said Keller, who has also spent time doing portfolio and risk management research at Fidelity Investments. "Newer investors haven't experienced this kind of drawdown. This has been more of a consistent downtrend that lasts for months and can be a morale buster."


Speaking of pessimism, that's definitely the case with options traders.


On Monday, amid the stock market's slide, the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) soared to 1.27. It means for every 100 bullish call options traded, 127 bearish put options exchanged hands. This extreme figure galloped well past the 1.15 threshold normally associated with market bottoms.


Pitcairn notes that among conversations he's had with high-net-worth clients, he's not seeing the same level of anxiety or fear that equates to a market bottom, such as in 2008.


"Back in 2008, I was on the phone every day. We're having fewer conversations this time," he said. Pitcairn adds that equity investors have benefited from a 12- to 13-year period of "suppressed interest rates, low volatility and reasonably strong dollar. I'm not sure if investors have fully embraced that this is over."


How Much Further Down?
----------------------


Always keep in mind that investor sentiment indicators never replace the primary indicator of major trends and shifts in that trend, which is the market itself.


[MarketSmith's homepage](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) notes 715 stocks rising in heavy volume while 139 fell in active trade Wednesday. But breakouts are rare nowadays. Over the past several weeks, the failure rate of breakout stocks seemed to hit 100%.


Keller points out that if you consider the advance that began in March 2020 and ended in January 2022, the S&P 500 has retraced 38.2% of that enormous gain by breaking the 3815 level. That percentage fits with the Fibonacci theory of mathematical retracements, which is popular among technical analysts.


What if economic, monetary and psychological conditions worsen? He suggests watching for the potential by the S&P 500 to reach the 50% retracement level at 3505 and the 61.8% retracement at 3200.


This would imply potential declines of 7.5% and 15.5% from Wednesday's close of 3789 on the S&P 500.

Call Monday's session the revenge of the blue chips.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood out, showing a scrappier side, as 11 of its 30 members pulled 1 point higher or more. Its gain of 29 points, or less than 0.1%, seems hardly worth trumpeting about. Yet that turned out to be the day's best performance among the major indexes.


The [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) and other large- and mega-cap components of the Nasdaq faced stiff selling, sending the composite index down 2.5%. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which follows the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, slumped 2.6%.


That marked QQQ's second-worst daily performance for the year so far.


Just four trading sessions ago, the market cap-weighted Nasdaq touched new all-time highs and closed above 14,000 for a third straight session. But a fourth decline in the past five sessions has now trimmed the index's year-to-date advance to 5%.


The share volume fell mildly on the Nasdaq vs. Friday's session. However, dollar-based turnover, according to IBD research, grew more than 7% to roughly $265 billion. That hints at some serious profit-taking.


This Dow Jones Stock Did Not Join The Dow's Gain
------------------------------------------------



Indeed, take a look at **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). The stock gapped lower at the open and finished at 234.51, near session lows. A 2.7% drop is not severe, but the cloud computing, enterprise software and gaming console titan erased nearly three weeks' worth of profits. The megacap stock also looks poised to test a 232.96 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a five-month [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).


Volume in Microsoft jumped 38% higher than Friday's session and came in 21% higher than the stock's average turnover over the past 50 sessions.


That is not your neighborhood walking buddy selling shares.


![MP022221](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP022221-186x300.jpg)Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped nearly 0.8% and registered a fifth straight drop. Small caps hardly did much better. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF lost nearly 0.7%. Volume rose on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


Therefore, the S&P 500 added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). But it also ditched the Jan. 14 distribution day due to time. A distribution day expires after 25 trading days following the institutional sell-off.


Now, the S&P 500 faces a key test of the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The Economy-Reopening Trade
---------------------------


Given how some leading stocks sold off hard — especially in tech fields including enterprise software, e-commerce and semiconductors — it's critical to be guarding your paper profits and not let these positions do a full round trip. Breakouts that are failing immediately are an [expectation breaker](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-expectation-breakers-what-to-do-when-stock-market-throws-you-curveball/); so, cutting losses short is a sound portfolio strategy.


The market, meanwhile, hinted that beaten down sectors of the economy, including hotels, airlines, metal ores, construction equipment and oil, may stage a solid comeback later this year. Strong action in these cyclical and consumer-oriented areas of Wall Street reaffirm a budding sector rotation in the market.


Will investors be looking to load up more on turnarounds this year?



Stocks such as **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) and **Hyatt Hotels** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) may offer some fresh answers. Caterpillar has been a champ since it cleared several buy points recently, including a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) pattern (at 200.27), and a couple of [rebounds off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-why-the-10-week-line-offers-follow-on-buy-points/).


United Airlines has fashioned an 11-week cup that's inside a much deeper pattern that has the look of a [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/google-stock-breakout-from-bottoming-base-in-2009-yielded-perfect-entry/).


Finally, Hyatt on Monday added gains after rising out of a [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) from a 76.73 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a 10-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).


Turnarounds tend to show yucky IBD ratings. Don't expect Hyatt's 19 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) (headed into Monday's trading) to improve sharply anytime soon. But its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) made new highs since it began forming the latest base.


Long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds sold off again, sending the benchmark 10-year note's yield up to 1.37%. That would mark the highest level since the week ended Feb. 28, 2020, when the coronavirus market crash got under way.


Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is slated to testify before Congress on the economy both Tuesday and Wednesday.

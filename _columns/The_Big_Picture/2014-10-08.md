Nasdaq, Small Caps Lead Strong Reversal In Faster Turnover
===========================================================

Major indexes had a bungee cordlike day as stocks erased moderate morning losses and ended sharply higher Wednesday.


Some leading stocks also showed excellent reversals. The IBD 50 gained nearly 2%.


The Nasdaq composite turned a 0.7% loss into a 1.9% gain, its biggest single-day advance so far this year.


The S&P 500 rose nearly 1.8% and the small-cap S&P 600 lifted 1.9%. Volume expanded sharply on both the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Top industries of the day spanned from defensive-oriented gold miners and utilities to more cyclical and growth-oriented ones, including chipmaking, shoes, trucking and managed care, all of which rose 2% or more.


The latest minutes from the Sept. 16-17 Federal Reserve meeting seemed to reiterate the central bank's view that a decision on when to raise short-term interest rates is more dependent on upcoming economic data than on a rigid time schedule.


Traders welcomed the news, because it implied no sudden hike in the cost of money that could threaten either the economic recovery or stock prices.


Keep in mind, however, that one large up day does not guarantee an uptrend.


IBD research has found that all of the major market bottoms featured a follow-through, which takes place at least four days into a rally attempt. That has yet to happen since IBD's current outlook was downgraded to "Market in correction" on Oct. 1.


Since the Nasdaq and the 500 both fell below the low of last Thursday's session, that decline in effect means that a new rally attempt began with Wednesday's positive reversal.


The third-quarter earnings season got into swing after the market close as **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)), which has rebranded itself the "light metals leader," blew away profit estimates for the third quarter. An 8% rise in sales was encouraging, given that it was the best top-line result in three years.


Transport stocks, which have been market leaders all year, gained less ground. The Dow transports rose almost 1%, but airlines got a kick in the teeth.


Deep-discount carrier **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)), which has formed no fewer than three bases since its breakout engine ignited in early March of 2013, suffered its second price gap down in six sessions. The stock fell more than 5% in huge volume and traded below its 200-day moving average for the first time in 20 months. Spirit cut its Q3 margin forecast due to underpayment of fuel excise taxes.

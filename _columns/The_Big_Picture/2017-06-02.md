Stock Indexes Finish Strongly, But Week Has Odd Tilt
=====================================================

 U.S. stock indexes kept to a bullish script Friday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 added a strong signature.


The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq stocks, led the indexes with a 1.1% gain. The broader Nasdaq composite was close behind at 0.9%. The S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 popped 0.7%, according to preliminary data.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow made new highs.

The week had an odd tilt. Small caps, which are often regarded as the more aggressive plays, led. Utilities also showed strength. The Dow Jones utility average rose 1.6%, a solid follow-up to the previous week's 2.4% gain.


Where does this leave the individual investor?


Step back for perspective, and a market watcher can see that the market uptrend has offered some fairly smooth but significant rotational shifts. The main shift was from Trump-related plays to economic innovators such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), the FANG stocks (**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))) and the economic-trend plays such as the chip stocks.


In November, banks, infrastructure stocks and private prisons (an immigration-crackdown play) owned the stock market.


But since March, money centers have corrected 10% and it isn't clear if they have bottomed. The cement group fell 15% before recently rebounding to 6% off its high.


Private prison companies, such as **CoreCivic** ([CXW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXW)) and **Geo Group** ([GEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEO)), after more than doubling from November to late February have corrected to 15% and 9% off their respective highs.


The rotation to the quality megacaps and chip stocks is now well-established.


If investors reacted quickly enough, they might be holding some big gains now.


But for those slow to adjust, this market might look tough.


For example, the top 10 industry groups have few quality stocks that aren't way extended.


Those still capable of offering buy points include: homebuilder **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), which could offer an entry at 53.10; wireless service provider **T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) and online marketer **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), which are in their 5% buy zones; and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), which has sketched a sideways channel for 13 months.


Baidu's action might not look like much of a base, but a similar sideways consolidation has led to recent breakouts for **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), although FedEx's pattern was much shallower.

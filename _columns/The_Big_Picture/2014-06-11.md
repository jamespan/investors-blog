Major Indexes Ease, But Airline Stocks Fall Sharply

The stock market cooled off a bit Wednesday, with key indexes taking a well-earned rest. But selling intensified in a few sector indexes.


News that the World Bank cut its full-year global growth forecast to 2.8% from 3.2% did little to thwart the bulls.


The Nasdaq composite slipped just 0.1% to end a five-day win streak. Intraday, the index was down no more than 0.5%. The S&P 500 fell nearly 0.4%. Volume on both major exchanges shrank.


The IBD 50 edged higher by less than 0.1%. Only a fraction of the stocks in the premier growth list traded in above-average turnover.


Wednesday's overall price-and-volume action indicated that investors largely remain comfortable with equities and that demand has returned. However, the stubborn lightness in market volume and the limited size of gains following breakouts should temper any investor's bullish enthusiasm.


One should remain disciplined in nailing down profits once they reach 20% to 25%, and to never let a decent gain wither into a loss.


Chip stocks continue to show exceptional strength. The granddads of the sector — including **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) — have done just as well as newer kids on the chip block.


Applied pulled back fast in April, but has rebounded nicely. The giant within the Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment group closed flat Wednesday at 21.89, up 20% from an 18.18 buy point from a double-bottom breakout Feb. 13. Micron, up 1.48 to 30.99 Wednesday, has also rumbled 20% past a 25.78 entry.


**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), which initially joined IBD [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) on May 6, is up for the week and has jumped 37% since staging a smart rebound off the 10-week moving average in mid-April. **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)), a 2007 IPO, is up 10% past a 47.57 entry.


The Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group is up nearly 18% since Jan. 1, smashing the Nasdaq's 4% return. Notice on the Nasdaq's daily chart how its Accumulation/Distribution Rating remains poor. In contrast, 13 stocks in the chipmaking group with a share price of at least 20 hold an Accumulation grade of A or B.


The Dow industrials, the most popular benchmark for megacap and "blue-chip" names, dropped 0.6%. Four stocks fell 1 point or more. The Dow utilities sank 1.2%.


Meanwhile, a profit warning from European airline giant Lufthansa triggered a pummeling of industry peers across the Atlantic. IBD's Transport-Airline industry group slid about 2% as nine of the group's 19 stocks lost 2% or more in active trading. Nine hold a Composite Rating of 90 or higher. The Dow transports fell 0.8%.


**Spirit Airlines'** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) attempt Monday to clear a late-stage base at 63.99 has quickly run out of gas.

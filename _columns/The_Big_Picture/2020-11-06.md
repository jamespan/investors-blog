Nasdaq Rises To A 1.5% Gain Away From All-Time Highs; Why Q4 Could Still Benefit Stock Pickers
===============================================================================================

Amid a historic week in U.S. politics and broad gains in the U.S. stock market over the past week, perhaps many IBD readers could view Friday's relatively staid action as beneficial.




A day after the Nasdaq composite issued its own [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) with a 2.6% jump in sharply higher volume on Thursday, the tech-centered index erased early losses of as much as 1.3% to finish the day up a few points, or less than 0.1%.


At 11,895, the Nasdaq is now back within an arm's grasp of posting a close above 12,000 — something it's done just once.


Beyond Nasdaq: Still Climbing A Wall of Worry
---------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 limited losses to about 1 point. After four days' worth of stout gains, Friday's close indicated satisfaction among equity traders over stock prices — even if [job growth in the U.S. has slowed](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-today-stocks-await-payrolls-data-home-depot-salesforce-com-new-buy-points/), the presidential election has not yet determined a winner, and coronavirus cases continue to climb at an alarming rate.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fell 0.8%, following rallies of 1.8%, 2.8%, 0.1% and 2.8% in the prior four sessions.


Nice moves from the likes of **Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)), **Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) and **Quidel** ([QDEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QDEL)) should give individual investors reason to actively form a [watchlist of good stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/), determine the [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in [well-formed bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), and buy leaders in top-performing sectors.


Axon, Quidel and many other companies got the spotlight during [Friday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), which marked its one-year anniversary.


[As noted in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), Quidel crossed an early buy point based on a trend line drawn within the [cup-with-handle structure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Headed into Friday's trading, the Auto, Software, Agriculture, Chips and Internet sectors held five of the top six rankings for midterm and long-term price performance. The best growth stocks tend to come from strong sectors and industries.


Don't Forget Sell Rules On Offense, Too
---------------------------------------


**Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)), ranked [No. 10 in the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10) headed into Friday's trade, has propelled more than 25% since it brushed against its 10-week moving average in September, the first pullback since a powerful breakout. [Taking gains frequently at 25% is savvy portfolio management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


For the week, the Nasdaq outpaced the major indexes with a 9% gain. That virtually matched its 9.1% gain during the week ended March 27, which ultimately became the bottom of the coronavirus crash. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) cruised 9.9% higher for the week.


Economists at the Los Angeles-based money management giant Payden & Rygel point out that the rebound in the U.S. economy today is running faster than the post-2008 recovery. Consumer spending on goods, for instance, has already topped pre-Covid-19 levels. After 2008, it took four years to do the same. "For investors, the Fed's monetary juice, currently tuned to prevent a repeat of 2008, presents a very bullish backdrop for asset prices: Easy monetary policy even as growth snaps back sharply," the Payden team wrote in a client note.

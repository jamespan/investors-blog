  Stock Market Falls Hard After Fed Rate Cut; Nasdaq, S&P 500 Hit By More Distribution

A solid earnings report from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) wasn't much help to the stock market Wednesday. Neither was the Federal Reserve policy statement at 2 p.m. ET.




Stocks were in a holding pattern ahead of the policy statement, but a wave of selling hit the stock market soon after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference got underway at 2:30 p.m ET. As expected, the Federal Reserve lowered its key lending rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2% to 2.25%.


The move was widely expected, but indexes turned sharply lower after [Powell called Wednesday's rate cut "a mid-cycle policy adjustment."](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-cut-disappointing-dow-jones-slips-powell/) The stock market took that to mean that more rate cuts before the end of the year are far from a sure thing.


The 10-year Treasury yield was down 3 basis points to 2.03% before the Fed decision. As of 5 p.m. ET, it was trading around 2.01%.


The Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended with losses of 1.1% to 1.2%. After rising 1.2% Tuesday, the Russell 2000 small-cap index was up 0.9% early but reversed lower for a loss of 0.7%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Tuesday's totals.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP083119.jpg)Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) led a rally in solar stocks, surging 30% on earnings. Department store operators and homebuilders also outperformed. Gold miners lagged, hurt by a 10% plunge in **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)). IBD's chip-equipment group also took a hit, down around 3%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index slumped 3.1%.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The S&P 500's June 25 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) fell off the count Wednesday due to time, but the Nasdaq and S&P 500 added a distribution day Wednesday. With the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite now firmly below short-term support levels like their 10-day and 21-day moving average lines, it doesn't make sense to be aggressive with new buys.


The market's tone has changed a bit this week as several top-rated growth stocks have come under selling pressure. Monday was a particularly rough session as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 1.2%, underperforming a 0.4% decline for the Nasdaq and 0.2% drop for the S&P 500. After rising 1% early Wednesday, the IBD 50 ETF reversed lower for a loss of 0.8%.


Strong earnings report from **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) buoyed the exchange traded fund. The enterprise software leader gapped up and rose 5%. Strong earnings from Paycom came on the heels of a robust earnings report from **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) late Monday. Software bears have been talking about high valuations in the sector, but the performance of both stocks shows that a seemingly high P-E ratio can be warranted amid booming growth.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Apple stock and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) went in opposite directions. Apple gapped up powerfully but closed off session highs after reporting [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-q3-2019-apple-stock/) late Tuesday. It closed just below a 215.41 entry. AMD shares crashed 10%, giving up support at the 50-day moving average, after the chipmaker reported [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-earnings-q2-2019-amd-stock/) and gave soft revenue guidance for the current quarter.



**L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) joined [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com) Wednesday after an earnings-inspired move over a 200.87 buy point. Group peer **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) also moved powerfully on earnings, rising 14% to 81.52. It closed just above a 79.93 entry.


**Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) was a solid gainer in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), up nearly 5% to 88.13. Akamai cleared a flat base with an 86.29 buy point.

Nasdaq Has Best Week Of 2017; What Does Market See?
====================================================

The Nasdaq posted its best weekly gain of 2017 and the S&P its sixth best, as the stock indexes Friday shielded recent gains.




Small caps led Friday's action as the Russell 2000 advanced 0.6%. The S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average followed with 0.2% gains. The Nasdaq inched up 0.1%.


Volume was down sharply on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


According to preliminary data, the Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) surged 4.1% for the week.


The Nasdaq rose 2.7%, the S&P 500 1.4%, the Dow Jones industrial average 0.8%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 2.6%.

Ideally, a strong stock market will siphon money out of utilities and other conservative investments and pour them into more aggressive vehicles.


One of those aggressive vehicles is the Innovator IBD 50 Fund, which is up 26% this year, leading the major indexes.


The market took a more aggressive tilt during the week. Breakouts, which recently have been sparse, picked up the pace.


Breakouts in the past few days included casino operator **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)), network security firm **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), biotech **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), retirement products provider **Athene** ([ATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATH)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)), dating service **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)), drone maker **AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)), gold miner **Randgold Resources** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) and RV company **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)).



Thor's breakout has since showed hesitation, but the verdict on the breakout isn't yet clear. After the storm Katrina in 2005, the Federal Emergency Management Agency spent $2.7 billion on 145,000 trailers and mobile homes, according to the Washington Post.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the week's biggest gainers included cement, biotech and truckers. Insurance stocks were weak.


The week's strength suggests the market is looking ahead and seeing something good.


It's hard to say what that good thing could be, given the inability of the 115th Congress to do anything for President Trump in its first eight months.


The possibilities include pro-business steps such as corporate tax cuts, individual tax cuts and infrastructure projects (juiced by Harvey). One big risk is the Sept. 29 deadline on raising the federal debt ceiling.

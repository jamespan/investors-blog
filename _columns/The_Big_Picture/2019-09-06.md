  The Big Picture: Calm Settles Over Stock Market, Buying Time For Bulls

Stock market indexes stayed calm Friday, a net positive after the previous session's big gains.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.3%, while the S&P 500 added 0.1%. The Nasdaq slipped less than 0.2%, and small-caps in the Russell 2000 slid 0.4%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


Two factors shaped the day's action: nonfarm payrolls, which came in 20% below expectations, and remarks from the Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell at forum in Switzerland.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP_090619-206x300.jpg)Powell said the Fed has "seen fit to lower the expected path of interest rates." He gave credit to the Fed, which "has supported the economy."


Powell added that trade uncertainty is hurting business investment and confidence. Yet, he expects the problems to be contained.


No Recession In Forecast
------------------------


"We're not forecasting or expecting a recession," Powell said.


Market watchers would be pressed to find an instance in which the Fed accurately predicted a recession. However, that may have more to do with the Fed's mission than a lack of savvy. The Fed's core mission is to "foster stability," a goal that central bank predictions would undermine.


So, all in all, Powell's remarks got the job done, if the target was to create a stable mood. Indexes reacted mildly to his comments.


Meanwhile, the [payroll numbers for August missed badly](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/economy-adds-130000-jobs-in-august-as-private-hiring-slows-dow-jones/). The Street expected 163,000 jobs added but the number came in at 130,000 — below the lowest estimate in the range. Bulls, though, might have welcomed the miss since it presumably makes an interest-rate cut more likely when the Fed meets later this month.


CME Group's FedWatch Tool sees a 91.2% chance that rates will be cut a quarter point. The 8.8% probability is for no change, leaving the odds of a half point reduction at zero.

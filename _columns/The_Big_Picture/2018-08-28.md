The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 made new highs Tuesday. For those who watched the session, it sure didn't feel that way.




The major indexes were flat and closed with minor gains. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 advanced less than 0.1% and were slightly negative for part of the day. The S&P 500's close in the lower half of the day's range was a negative trait.


The Nasdaq composite was nominally the leader, up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark was practically flat. All indexes traded in a small price range, with investors finding little to move the market either way. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


A few pockets of strength gave the market some seasoning on a bland serving of meat and potatoes.

Apparel chains led almost all 197 groups Tuesday, as **DSW** ([DSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DSW)) soared 20% to a new high following [superb quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/dsw-earnings-q2-shoe-carnival-earnings-stock-buy-range/). Thinly traded **Shoe Carnival** ([SCVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCVL)) also rallied after beating expectations.


The airline industry group rose 1.3%. Generic drugs were Tuesday's No. 1 group, although there were no standouts in the group's higher-liquidity stocks.


But electronics retail was weak after **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) gapped down 5%. The company beat expectations and raised full-year guidance but [warned of weaker Q3 adjusted operating income](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/best-buy-earningsfiscal-q2-earnings/). Best Buy fell to its 50-day moving average Tuesday, where it is now seeking support.


Homebuilders and building-related stocks fell after home-price data came in lower than expected. IBD's homebuilding industry group fell 1.1%, while building products and wood products dropped 0.8%. Those groups were among the bottom 25 industries.


The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index, which tracks prices in 20 metropolitan areas, inched up 0.1% in June from the previous month. On a year-ago basis, prices rose 6.3%, which missed forecasts and marked the third straight month of declining growth.

CLOSE




But the real estate sector in general performed well thanks to strength in real estate investment trusts. The SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF ([RWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RWR)) climbed 1.3% to its highest close since October 2016.


Despite the dull trading, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq made new highs. Listless trading made it hard to cheer the new records, but they were gains nonetheless. The market's rally from the lows of nearly two weeks ago may be moderating, so a pullback would not be surprising.


At the same time, it's hard to find defects with the general market. The market's advance has breadth. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is at new highs after lagging in the first half of August. The NYSE's A/D line looks even more impressive. The number of [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) is moderate.


Breakouts for leading stocks that are working easily outnumber the ones struggling, and that's perhaps the most important indicator for growth investors.


**Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), **SendGrid** ([SEND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEND)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)), **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)), **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) and **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) are some recent winning breakouts. Participation includes large caps, small caps, new issues, consumer, technology and other sectors.


Of course, there's a number of stocks whose breakouts are faltering or outright failing.


**Control4** ([CTRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRL)) erased gains from a breakout a week ago. **Nanometrics** ([NANO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NANO)) triggered the 7% to 8% sell rule. **Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) soared last Wednesday on earnings but erased most of the gain in just hours. **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) looked like a winner with Thursday's breakout, but it plunged Tuesday.

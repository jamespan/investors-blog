  Stock Market Mauled As Bears Pounce Amid These Fears; Retailers Get Savaged

Bears savaged the stock market as a cloud of negativity enveloped the indexes. Meanwhile, negative sentiment increased in a key contrarian gauge.




Indexes started the day in the red and only continued to fall deeper amid the blowback from a worrying earnings report from **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and other retailers. This, coupled with the market digesting the continued hawkish tone of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and a dip in mortgage application volume, proved to be a toxic brew.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day down an eye-watering 4.7%. The index failed to hold its 10-day moving average for even a single session and remains way adrift of its other moving averages.


The broader S&P 500 was also hammered, getting smacked 4% lower. It also retreated back below its short-term moving averages. The index is down 5% since the end of April, vs. 7.4% for the Nasdaq.


[The S&P sectors all closed negative.](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP051822_2-.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) Worries over retailers saw consumer discretionary and consumer staples turn in the worst sector performances of the day. The defensive utilities sector gave up the least ground.


The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fared better, but only slightly. It closed the day with a loss of 3.6%. **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) was the worst performer with a 8.4% loss while **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) lost 5.6%.


The sharp index reversals mean the current market uptrend, which only [began a day ago with a follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-this-positive-turn-5-keys-to-a-vigorous-rebound/), is already under pressure. The sharp steep reversal means the current rally attempt is almost certain to fail. Investors should be trading defensively.


Bears Dine On Small Caps
------------------------


Higher NYSE volume also gave the S&P 500 a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Smaller companies are not a wise area in which to seek safety amid recession fears. And small caps once again acted as a feasting place for the bears Wednesday, with the Russell 2000 ending the day down 3.6%.


The index is lagging both the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 so far in 2022, giving up about 22%.


Growth stocks served as a substantial desert for the hungry bears, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) giving up 3.8%. While it is off lows, it is still down nearly 34% for the year.


Target Earnings Complete Brutal One-Two
---------------------------------------


With prices spiraling across the board due to runaway inflation, the consumer is very much on the ropes.


And Target posted an earnings miss early Wednesday that acted as a hammer blow that landed flush on the chin of the stock market. The stock fell 24.9% in mammoth volume, its worst performance since Black Monday in 1987.



With the consumer a key driver for the U.S. economy, it is perhaps no surprise that indexes were sent crumpling to the canvas. If Americans decide to keep their wallets closed and only spend on essentials, then the effects will reverberate across the economy.


Target CEO Brian Cornell accepted responsibility for not factoring in spiraling costs quickly enough.


"Throughout the quarter, we faced unexpectedly high costs, driven by a number of factors, resulting in profitability that came in well below our expectations, and well below where we expect to operate over time," he said. While the firm reiterated its revenue forecast for mid single-digit growth, it did not provide earnings guidance.


This came hot on the heels of a dismal Tuesday report by retail behemoth **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), which had also flagged supply chain disruptions and rising costs.


Costco, Dollar Tree Among Retail Sell-Offs
------------------------------------------


**Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) plummeted 12.5% while **BJs Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) closed down 16%. Both moves came in high volume. **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) was jettisoned from the [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as it tumbled 14.4%. All these moves came in significant volume.


"Consumer discretionary got hit the hardest as investors are reassessing the timing of when inflation will ease," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya told IBD.  "It looks like the consumer has got a couple of rough quarters ahead and that will continue to drive economic growth concerns over the next few months. "


The relative performance of the industry groups is always a key area to watch for investors. And on Wednesday it certainly painted a weak consumer picture, with department stores, major discount chains and discount retailers the worst performers. Specialty, consumer electronics and home furnishings retailers all struggled.


The relative outperformers were marijuana stocks, blank check finance companies, computer gaming stocks, solar plays and utilities.

Bears Reign Supreme In Key Gauge
--------------------------------


The latest advisors sentiment weekly report from [Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) saw some subtle changes.


The bull-bear spread widened to -15.6% from -13.2% last week. Overall sentiment has now been negative for seven of the last 11 weeks, with the current spread the largest during that period.


The number of bears climbed to 43%, up from 40.8% at the last count. This was the highest percentage since October 2011. Meanwhile, the bulls stood their ground at 27.8%.


Fewer advisors are now projecting a correction, with the percentage slipping from 31.6% to 29.2%.


Remember, this is a contrarian indicator. But while sentiment so negative suggests a rally could take place, the current unusual market conditions make any gauges less reliable than usual.


This means it is more important than ever that investors use the daily action of the indexes and performance of the current stock market leaders as their main guide.

  Stock Market At 2023 Highs Amid Strong Weekly Gains; Inflation Data Looms

The stock market ended a powerful up week at highs for the year on Friday, even as indexes took a bit of a breather after muscular post-Fed gains. More inflation data and an updated GDP reading now loom.




The Nasdaq composite ended with a solid gain of 0.4% on Friday. It now sits at levels last seen in January 2022 after rising just shy of 3% for the week. This was its seventh straight week in the black as the tech-heavy index continues to surf above its short-term moving averages. The Nasdaq-100 fared even better, closing at record highs for the first time in two years after rising 0.5%.


The S&P 500 gave up slight ground, but closed essentially flat. It sits slightly more than 6% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). The index rose about 2% for the week, its seventh weekly gain in succession. The benchmark index is now up more than 23% so far this year.

Nevertheless, decliners managed to outnumber advancers on Friday by about 2-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by just under that level on the Nasdaq. Volume was higher than normal on the stock market due to quadruple-witching, which is when derivatives contracts tied to index options, index futures, stock options and single-stock futures expire on the same day.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched another record closing high on Friday thanks to a 0.2% gain. Aerospace big beast **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and semiconductor powerhouse **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) were the top performers.


Small caps lagged, as the Russell 2000 fell 0.8%. It may be meeting resistance at the 2000 level amid recent outperformance, which is underlined by its gain of almost 6% for the week. Growth stocks inched higher, though the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) closed essentially flat.


Inflation Data, These Earnings Loom
-----------------------------------


The stock market turned in bulky gains for the week following a dovish Federal Open Market Committee meeting where Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Co. indicated at least three rate cuts are possible in 2024. Stocks held on to those returns even after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said Friday that they are not "really talking about rate cuts right now."


As ever, central bankers have indicated they are data driven when it comes to cutting. This underlines the importance of the November PCE inflation report, which is due Friday.


Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is seen rising 3.4% year over year. This is a key reading to watch as it is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.


Other noteworthy economic releases in the coming week include housing starts and building permits data Tuesday, along with revised GDP data on Thursday.


Key earnings reports on deck in the coming week include **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)).

The stock market ended sharply higher Thursday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the way, closing with strong gains. Up next, investors will shift their attention to [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech.](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chair-powells-speech-the-two-words-that-could-upend-the-sp-500/)




Amid a stock market uptrend, these four stock market leaders — tech titan **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Axcelis Technologies** ([ACLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACLS)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)) — are in or near buy zones.


In a healthy market uptrend, investors should see more and more leading stocks show strong price-and-volume action — both as they develop new bases and when they [break out past buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Powell Speech
-------------


Powell will give a speech Friday morning on the central bank's economic outlook from Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Fed has raised interest rates this year in an attempt to bring down inflation but has sent increasingly mixed signals about coming increases.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP082522-238x300.jpg)Wall Street is having a case of nerves over Powell's speech. The stock market rally has pulled back alongside a shift in odds favoring another 75-basis-point rate hike on Sept. 21.


Markets place a [roughly 64% chance of a 75-basis-point rate hike](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) on Sept 21. One week ago, there was about a 40% chance.


Economic Data, Earnings Movers
------------------------------


Ahead of Thursday's open, the Department of Commerce released revised gross domestic product data. The second estimate of GDP showed a 0.6% drop, better than the expected 0.9% contraction.


Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims, which came out from the Labor Department, dropped to 243,000. That was lower than Econoday estimates, which expected a rise to 255,000.


Key earnings movers Thursday included **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). Also on the move were Dow Jones software stock **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)).


Discount retailer Dollar General ended a volatile session down just 0.6%, while [Dollar Tree plunged more than 10%](https://www.investors.com/news/dollar-tree-dollar-general-earnings-dltr-stock-dg-stock/). [NetApp shares rallied](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ntap-stock-jumps-on-quarterly-earnings/) nearly 8%. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares reversed from early losses to rise 4% despite a [weak outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-falls-as-chipmaker-guides-lower/). Salesforce skidded 3.4% after [slashing its revenue outlook.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-q22022/) And Snowflake stock surged 23% on [strong revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snow-stock-snowflake-stock-snowflake-earnings-q22022/).

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 1.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 1.5%. The stock market's two-day rebound recouped a small part of its recent skid.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch
-----------------------------



Amid a normal stock market pullback, these four leaders are among the stocks in or near buy zones — Dow Jones leader Apple, [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Axcelis Technologies, Chipotle Mexican Grill and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock GlobalFoundries.


Apple [added a handle to a cup base this week](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/), moving the buy point from 179.71 to 176.25. Shares finished Thursday about 5% away from the latest entry. Apple's RS line is holding tightly at new highs, a sign of big stock market outperformance. If the stock market rebound can continue, then a breakout would be a likely event.


Apple was [Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/apple-stock-gets-fresh-buy-point-ahead-of-iphone-14-reveal/). The company will unveil its iPhone 14 smartphones and other devices at a product launch next month.


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Axcelis broke out past a cup with handle's 79.93 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis, with a 12.9% surge. The 5% buy area goes up to 83.93. Shares also surged past a short trendline drawn within the handle itself.


Axcelis was featured in [this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-arista-axcelis-cadence-globalfoundries-eye-buy-points/) Axcelis specializes in ion implantation systems, which is one of the most critical steps in the process of manufacturing integrated circuits.


Chipmaker Retakes Entry, Eyes Another Buy Point
-----------------------------------------------



Burrito maker Chipotle Mexican Grill finished Thursday near its [double bottom's 1,645.10 buy point](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/chipotle-mexican-grill-cultivates-your-businesses-cmg-stock-samples-buy-zone/) amid this week's losses. [CMG stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg.aspx) shows a strong 96 out of 99 IBD Composite Rating, per the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) The [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has also perked up, building on the spark it got after Chipotle's strong Q2 report on July 26,


[New IBD SwingTrader stock](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) GlobalFoundries decisively reclaimed a [double bottom's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) 61.98 buy point Thursday, advancing 6.8% and closing in the buy area that tops out at 65.08. An alternative entry, from a handle, is in play at 66.06. A breakout past that entry would be a sign to accumulate more shares.


GlobalFoundries is the world's third-largest chip foundry by revenue behind **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and Samsung Electronics.

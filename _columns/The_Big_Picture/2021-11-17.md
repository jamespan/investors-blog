With stock market indexes near all-time highs despite a cloudy economic picture, it seems bears and bulls alike saw Wednesday as a time for a pause.




The major indexes all held reasonably steady amid declines. The Nasdaq composite closed with a loss of just over 0.3%, though lower volume means it was not a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The S&P 500 fell just under 0.3%, also in lower volume. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%.


Volume fell about 8% on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE. That gave the S&P 500 a new distribution day, it's third since the Oct. 14 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


The more notable action took place on the Russell 2000 and the IBD 50, the latter a bellwether for growth stock investors.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP111721_2-237x300.jpg)Bears got their pound of flesh after clawing at small caps once again, with the Russell 2000 ending the day down about 1.2%.


However, they saved their staunchest spanking for growth stock investors, with the IBD 50 closing down 1.3%. **Kornit Digital** ([KRNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRNT)) gapped below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume, triggering a sell signal. The textiles technology company announced an offering of more than 2 million shares. **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)), which already had erased a gain of more than 30%, is now more than 7% below its 62.10 buy point.


This Sector Lags Amid Biden Demand
----------------------------------


The energy sector lagged after President Biden asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether illegal conduct by oil companies is keeping the price of gasoline at elevated levels.



The [Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-asks-ftc-to-examine-whether-oil-gas-companies-are-illegally-keeping-gas-prices-high-11637164142?mod=hp_lead_pos1) that he told FTC Chair Lina Khan in a letter that there is "mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil-and-gas companies." The president claimed gas prices are going up despite the price of unfinished gasoline falling.


Energy performed worst out of all the S&P Sectors Wednesday, dropping by 1.7%. Among energy ETFS, the Vanguard Energy Index Fund ([VDE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDE)) dropped about 1.7% while the VanEck Oil Services ETF ([OIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OIH)) dropped 3.7%.


Among energy stocks, **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) fell 1.6%, **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) dipped 2% and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) fell 2.7%. The upward pace of these and other oil stocks has slowed.


Retail Stocks Mixed Despite Strong Earnings
-------------------------------------------


A slew of retailers reported earnings. Despite strong results, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) finished the session with a loss of 2.3%.


[Target topped analysts' third-quarter expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/target-stock-q3-2021-walmart-earnings/) after reporting a 9% rise in EPS to $3.03 and a 13% rise in sales to $25.65 billion. Comparable sales rose 12.7%.


Despite this, Target fell 4.7%, its worst day since March 2, when it fell 6.8%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Its decline was the third worst in the S&P 500. Target fell below its 262.61 buy point.


However, other big retailers climbed after their earnings reports.



**Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) [stock](https://www.investors.com/news/lowes-stock-buy-now/) rose to a new high, but saw early gains fade as it closed up 0.4%. It finished in its buy zone above the 239.37 buy point of a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). [Lowe's beat third-quarter expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/home-depot-stock-up-ahead-of-earnings-as-consumers-mull-rising-materials-costs-lowes-earnings-on-tap/) early Wednesday, indicating that a pandemic-era home-improvement boom is still underway, despite shortages of labor and some building materials.


**TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) finished the day with a more impressive gain of 5.8%. The apparel chain gapped above a 71.98 handle entry after [reporting an 18% increase in October-quarter earnings per share](https://www.investors.com/news/tjx-stock-breakout-q3-earnings-revenue-buyback-increase/). Sales climbed 24% as results topped views. The company also raised its stock buybacks for fiscal 2022 by $500 million, to $1.75 billion-$2 billion.


There is more to consider for investors than just strong recent earnings and data.


National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said that while the increased 1.7% value of overall retail purchases last month is encouraging, it remains to be seen how inflation will affect demand.


"U.S. prices are rising at the fastest pace in 30 years as businesses pass on growing labor and input costs to customers, but it's hard to tell just how much that's impacting demand since the figures aren't adjusted for inflation," he said in a note to clients. "Inflation-adjusted consumer spending data for October will be released next week."


Beyond The Stock Market
-----------------------


Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John Williams spoke out to say changes need to be made to the way Treasurys are traded and regulated.


"Severe disruptions to critical financial markets like we saw last spring should be rare," he said at the 2021 U.S. Treasury Market Conference. "But just as a town ravaged by flooding will seek to rebuild in ways that help it withstand the next big storm, so, too, must we think about how to shore up the Treasury market so it can better endure the next big shock."


There was a pause in the upward push in long-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields. The benchmark 10-year bond yield rising fell back from 1.63% on Tuesday to 1.59% Wednesday. Yield on the 30-year bond has slipped back by 4 basis points.

  Nasdaq Finds Support At 50-Day Line; Stocks Play Successful Defense

Stocks played successful defense combined with bargain-hunting Thursday, as the Nasdaq found support at its 50-day moving average.




The Nasdaq advanced 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trailed with gains of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 added 0.3%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The day's top groups included food, soft drinks, soap, tobacco and alcoholic beverages — hardly the kind of lineup that inspires the bulls. Software stocks also were up, perhaps showing bargain-hunting as they trimmed the week's losses.


Hard-hit stock groups included restaurants. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) gapped down 6% in heavy volume. Analysts said the company's guidance was vague.

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) spilled almost 3%, continuing an ugly trend. Sharp price losses began June 20 on sluggish guidance and the announcement that Starbucks would close about 150 stores next year.


Starbucks, though, isn't without a growth strategy.


In May, Starbucks announced it would add [600 stores in China](https://www.investors.com/news/starbucks-china-revenue-plans-stores-2022/) over the next five years.


Starbucks has traded in a sideways channel since late 2015, but the past two week's losses have taken shares below that channel.


Previous stalls have led to significant rallies in the past.


Both Starbucks and Chipotle face challenges. Investors might want to put both stocks on a long-term watch list.


Meanwhile, bank stocks were up in cautious volume as the market awaited details from the final round of stress tests. The results came after the close.

The Federal Reserve restricted the payout plans of **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and blocked the capital plan of a **Deutsche Bank** ([DB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DB)) subsidiary. But the Fed [largely cleared the big banks to deliver payouts](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stress-tests-dividends-buybacks/) to shareholders, and several announced dividend and buyback increases after hours.


In news, the third take on Q1 GDP and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's reported minor win vs. protectionists on China tugged the market in separate directions.


GDP came in at 2%, failing to meet the consensus estimate of 2.2%.


Mnuchin's minor win was related to emergency powers on trade. The former investment banker favors a less aggressive approach on China, and at least for a day prevailed.


Trump's Team Divided
--------------------


Trump's economic advisors are split between protectionists and free traders. Adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross lead the protectionist faction. Mnuchin and advisor Larry Kudlow are in the free-trade camp.


The ranks of the free-trade camp were thinned with the exit of Rex Tillerson in March and Gary Cohn, also in March.


If Trump were to reverse course and boot the protectionists, a stock market rally would be likely. While firing the protectionists seems unlikely now, Trump has fired more people than any president in the past 100 years, according to National Public Radio's count.


At the least, Trump faces a deadline for reaching a deal on trade with China and the rest of the world.


Trump probably would not want to see his party ripped in the midterm elections. Steps to fire up the stock market and create economic confidence must occur fairly soon if they are to change the November narrative.


Other Stocks
------------


Online retailer **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rose 2.5% on news that it was entering the medicine-dispensing business with the purchase of an online pharmacy. Drugstore stocks fell sharply on the news.


Leisure play **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) advanced more than 1% as it tried to regain its short-term, 10-day line.


Electric vehicle maker **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) padded its gain to almost 5% so far this week. Tesla has reported losses in each of the past three years.

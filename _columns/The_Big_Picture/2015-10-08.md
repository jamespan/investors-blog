Stocks sagged in the first half of the session Thursday but recovered after the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes from its September meeting.

  

The Nasdaq rubbed out a 1.1% loss and finished up 0.4%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial rose 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. Small caps outperformed as the S&P 600 sprinted ahead 1.2%.

  

The IBD 50 added 0.7%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

The market found traction after the Fed minutes were released. The minutes didn't reveal anything new, but apparently hearing things twice reassured the skeptics.

  

From a technical standpoint, the day was constructive. The S&P 500 closed above its 50-day line, a position it hasn't been in since mid-August.

  

The Nasdaq is only 1% below its 50-day line but it hasn't made a serious run at it yet.

  

Also, the 50-day lines for both are curving south and are below the 200-day lines, which isn't an ideal setup.

  

The number of breakouts has improved in October from September's sluggish pace. However, it's too early to judge the follow-up action.

  

Breakouts that stalled in the 5% buy zone were common not too long ago.

  

On Thursday, midcap payment processor **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) showed ideal follow-up action. After a breakout Wednesday that took it 11% higher, the stock added a 3% gain Thursday. Volume was heavy both days, and the closes were high in the range.

  

The stock is now 12% above a 118.13 buy point.

  

The credit card industry group has been doing well recently. The group has risen in seven of the past eight days, lifting the big players, too. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) rose 10% over the past eight sessions, placing it only 3% off its high.

  

Another stock showing solid follow-up action is homebuilder **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)). The small cap bounced off its 10-week line Friday, creating a secondary buy zone. The stock has risen 18% since Friday's close.

  

However, **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), the biggest player in the homebuilder group by sales, has been volatile around its 50-day line.

  

Individual investors should let the market define their next move. An investor who has a cushion can consider additional buys. Those who lack a cushion must play more defensively.

  

In economic news, first-time jobless claims were lower than the Street expected.

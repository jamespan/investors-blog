  Stock Market Slides Into The Close; Where The Next Danger Level Rests

The stock market's bounce from Tuesday's rout came up well short Wednesday after an encouraging rally fell apart in the final hour.




The late weakness was symptomatic of a troubled stock market. Sellers also swarmed into leading stocks. The IBD 50 fell 0.7%, underperforming the broad market.


The Nasdaq composite fought back from a midsession decline but ultimately closed 0.2% lower. Roughly half the index is made up of technology stocks, and the selling in those still appears intense.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.5% and is having its worst week since the end of January. The iShares Expanded-Tech Software ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)), a proxy for the software sector, reversed lower and fell 0.2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP092921_2-237x300.jpg)The S&P 500 kept less than 0.2% of what had been an almost 0.8% rebound intraday. The S&P 500 saw a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) deducted because the Aug. 24 [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) is now too far back in the calendar to matter.


Distribution For Nasdaq
-----------------------


At the same time, the Nasdaq added a distribution day Wednesday after its decline came in higher volume. That's the third straight day the Nasdaq fell in more volume than the prior day.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 0.3%.


Tallying up the damage, the S&P 500 now has five distribution days and the Nasdaq seven. It's a load that could justify lowering IBD's stock market outlook to a correction. For now, there is some hope for a bottom.


The S&P 500 held above Tuesday's lows. The Nasdaq undercut last week's low but the composite has found support around 14,500 since August. Leadership is emerging in energy and auto-related stocks. Some financials are holding up, too. By some measures, the market is getting oversold.


Stock Market's Next Line Of Defense â€” Or Danger
-----------------------------------------------


Overall, the stock market's arrow is pointing downward, and investors need to trade with extreme care.


With indexes already below their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), investors can look to the S&P 500's Sept. 20 low as the next line of defense. A break below that level would undoubtedly require investors to turn even more bearish.


As today's Market Pulse shows, there was unusually strong buying in selected auto and energy stocks. Those sectors are providing some of the few investing opportunities of late.


Watch Energy, Auto Stocks
-------------------------


**Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) topped the 38.15 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in heavy trading. Its U.S. oil & gas exploration and production industry group added 0.7%.



Used-car chain **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) hit a new high ahead of its [earnings report early Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/carmax-stock-carmax-earnings-q2-2022/). CarMax and peers **Penske Automotive Group** ([PAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAG)), **Group 1 Automotive** ([GPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPI)) and **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) have all broken out of [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/) and continue to climb.

Yields Rise Again, Hurt Stock Market
------------------------------------


The yield on the U.S. Treasury bond market's key 10-year note slowed its ascent, edging up to 1.54% after erasing early losses. The yield has climbed for seven straight sessions in the largest seven-day yield gain since February, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The matches a seven-day streak of gains for the benchmark yield going back to January.


September is historically a difficult month for the stock market, as [Tuesday's Big Picture noted](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-mixed-techs-falter-but-this-sector-keeps-burgeoning/). In fact, the third quarter tends to be the weakest. The S&P 500 rises an average 1.5% and the Nasdaq 0.6% in the third quarter, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Russell 2000 falls an average of 0.3%.


But cheer up, because the fourth quarter traditionally is the stock market's best quarter. The S&P 500's average gain is 2.6% and the Nasdaq's is 4.4%.

A stock market that can't make up its mind about its direction sent investors on another day of seesaw trading Tuesday. This time, the end result was positive.




The S&P 500 again fluctuated but rallied into the close and added 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite behaved similarly and rose 1.3%. Both closed near session highs.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.1%. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) led the Dow with a nearly 8% jump after the biotech beat profit estimates and announced $6 billion to $7 billion in share buybacks. And **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) climbed above a 189.13 buy point.


Small caps continued to outperform as the Russell 2000 advanced 1.6%.

Stock Market Settles In A Pattern
---------------------------------


Despite the uneven trading, the stock market indexes have settled into a pattern the past several days. The S&P 500 is holding above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/) but capping gains around 4500. The Nasdaq is largely trading above 14,000 and below 14,200.


The Dow is more safely above its 200-day line, while trading mainly below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


The take-away? The stock market's uptrend confirmed with the [Jan. 31 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-positive-move-as-nasdaq-again-rallies-more-than-3-percent/) is still intact, but bulls are hesitant to run. A series of uncertainties — from interest rates, to Covid sickouts to geopolitical tensions — combine for an uncertain outlook.


Earnings right now are generating a lot of headlines and some significant moves in the stock market. So far, S&P 500 earnings are tracking about as expected, although there's a soft spot in the data.


The number of companies beating profit estimates is equal to the five-year average, according to FactSet. But the amount by which they're beating views is slightly below the five-year average.


Earnings Growth, Views Cooling
------------------------------


During January, analysts decreased Q1 earnings estimates by an aggregate by 0.7%. That's a typical decline, and smaller than historical averages, FactSet says. However, this is the first time since the Covid-crisis Q2 of 2020 that analysts pared their profit estimates in the first month of the quarter.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 3 basis points to 1.95%, reaching the highest since July 2019. Yields have been rising in response to the Fed's anti-inflation crusade. The Federal Reserve also sees a tight job market as another reason to remove stimulus and tighten monetary policy.


Higher borrowing costs are a drag on most businesses and the stock market in general. But financials tend to benefit, and a few broke out past buy points Tuesday, besides American Express.



**Virtu Financial** ([VIRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIRT)) rallied past the 32.45 buy point of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in heavy volume and is now extended. The financial technology company reported fourth-quarter earnings this morning that beat estimates. **Stifel Financial** ([SF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SF)), which had already topped a 76.33 entry, rose to a new high. Stifel joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Tuesday.


One encouraging trend is that more stocks are topping buy points, and more are rounding out bases.


**Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) closed above the 388.20 buy point of a [cup with handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The stock appeared to move in sympathy with farm equipment maker **AGCO**'s ([AGCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGCO)) post-earnings rally.


Stock Market Breakouts For Textainer, Robert Half
-------------------------------------------------


**Textainer Group** ([TGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGH)) topped the 40.92 buy point of a cup with handle, although the handle is deeper than normal. The shipping container company reports earnings Thursday after the close.


**Robert Half International** ([RHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHI)) rose above the 120.93 buy point of a cup base. Volume was mediocre for a breakout. But the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is at new highs, as is also the case with Textainer.


Managed care provider **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) closed near the 85.54 buy point of a cup base. Shares jumped nearly 5% after Q4 earnings beat expectations. This is another breakout boasting an RS line at new highs. Volume was unimpressive, though.


The IBD 50 jumped 1.5% Tuesday. Stifel was one of its stars. Keep an eye on **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)), **Ryan Specialty Group** ([RYAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAN)), **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Skyline Champion** ([SKY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKY)), Monday's [IBD 50 Stock To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-the-sky-is-the-limit-for-this-top-housing-growth-stock/). All are in bases right now. Skyline is on the [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com).


Energy Select Sector SPDR was the worst S&P sector ETF, down more than 2%. U.S. crude fell more than 2% and a two-day drop exceeds 3%. Oil leaders such as **Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)), **Whiting Petroleum** ([WLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLL)) and **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) fell sharply.

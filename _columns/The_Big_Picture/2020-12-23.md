The major stock indexes ended mixed Wednesday, as late-day gains faded after President Donald Trump vetoed the $740 billion defense deal. The small-cap Russell 2000 held up better, easily outperforming the other stock indexes.




The Nasdaq reversed lower 0.3% after turning red late in the session to squarely underperform the other major stock indexes. The S&P 500 was left with only a 0.1% increase, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.4%.


[Tuesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-stocks-keep-bullish-character-is-this-index-going-to-make-it-8-straight-weeks-up/) discussed the significant rotation into small-cap stocks, and Wednesday's action continued that trend. The Russell 2000 advanced 0.9%, extending a win streak to three sessions and hitting an all-time high. Unlike other indexes, the small-cap benchmark closed near session highs.


Meanwhile, leading growth stocks sharply lagged, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 1.2% on Wednesday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) slid 2.2%, making it one of the worst performers. New-home sales in the U.S. hit a five-month low, causing a sell-off in homebuilders.


![MP122320](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP122320-254x300.jpg)Volume was sharply higher compared with Tuesday's session on the Nasdaq. Preliminary data showed slightly lower NYSE volume.


Nasdaq Adds Distribution Day
----------------------------


The Nasdaq's decline in higher volume added a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to the tech-heavy composite. It remains just off record highs. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 snapped a mild three-day losing streak.


The Nasdaq now holds three days of institutional selling[,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) still an acceptable amount. The S&P 500 has five distribution days. That's not quite enough to knock the stock market from its uptrend.


The major stock indexes held up well despite Trump's threat to veto the stimulus deal. But they succumbed to selling pressure in afternoon trade after Trump vetoed the $740 billion defense bill. Congress will need a two-thirds majority in each house to override the veto.


Despite today's weakness, investors should still feel confident buying new breakouts. But don't forget to lock in gains on the upside. Investors should take at least some profits when the stock rises 20%-25% from the buy point. However, if the stock rises 20% in three weeks or less, then you have the option to hold the stock for a full eight weeks. Such fast gains from breakouts indicate the stock could be a big winner.

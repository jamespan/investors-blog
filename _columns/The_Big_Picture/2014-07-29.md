=======================================

Stocks closed lower Tuesday, continuing a frustrating pattern of ambiguous market signals.


The Nasdaq lost just a fraction, cushioned by strength in biotechs, software, telecom, computer and other Nasdaq-leaning sectors.


But the S&P 500 fell 0.5%. Plastics, metals and transportation stocks in particular weighed on the index.


The IBD 50 fell 0.2%.


Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed near session lows. That marked a departure from recent sessions, when indexes — bullishly — had closed near intraday highs.


Small caps fared better: The Russell 2000 rose 0.2%.


Volume rose across the board, which resulted in a new distribution day for the S&P 500.


That made it six days of higher-volume losses in recent weeks for the index. In the past, the market often has topped with that many distribution days. But while the bulls find themselves fighting skirmishes, the market is far from all-out war against buyers. The indexes are rising in fits and starts, maintaining a moderate uptrend.


The advance-decline line of the Nasdaq is sloping lower, while the NYSE's has flattened. Yet, some high-rated stocks have broken out. The problem is that aside from earnings, there hasn't been much to propel stocks higher.


Leading stocks generally are doing fine.


China-based **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)) soared 8% in heavy trading after finding support at its 10-week line. Most education stocks rose after **Capella Education** ([CPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPLA)) rallied 14% on its profit report.


**FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) broke out of a base-on-base pattern in more than double its average volume. Reports said the payment systems company is looking to buy Comdata, which provides payment products for health care, construction and fleet companies.


At the same time, some leaders are acting sluggish. For example, **YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) tried for a third straight day to make a decisive breakout but closed slightly lower.


**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), **GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)) and **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) are examples of leaders rebounding from the 10-week line in lazy volume. A few breakouts have stalled while a few others have fallen apart altogether.


The market Tuesday seemed concerned about more sanctions against Russia. Meanwhile, earnings remain firmly in focus, and they are turning out rather well. Excluding the lagging financial sector, S&P 500 blended quarterly earnings growth is 8.5%, FactSet Insight reported. If that holds, it would be the best ex financials growth since Q3 of 2011.


**UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) missed earnings expectations and cut its full-year profit guidance. It cited costs to improve its operations. After the close, beaten-down **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) catapulted almost 30% after its Q2 results beat expectations.

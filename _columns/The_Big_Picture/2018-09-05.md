  Nasdaq Leads Drop, Small Caps Cut Losses; How To Handle The Stock Market Leaders Now

The bigger the recent gains by true market leaders, the harder they're inclined to fall. Wednesday's session delivered that reality for growth stocks and the current leading market index.




News that the U.S. trade deficit hit $50 billion in July certainly didn't help matters. Commodities were mixed, as crude oil prices fell hard for a second straight day. But the session mostly reflected strong profit-taking among leaders in dynamic sectors of the economy.


The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 1.2% after making a 1.8% tumble intraday. Software, computer, retailing, medical and consumer-spending-related firms, which had made strong advances in the past few months, sold off the hardest.


The S&P 500 took less of a hit, down 0.3%. The Russell 2000 gave up 0.3% after losing 1.1% early. But the Dow Jones industrial average edged up almost 0.1%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MP_5x5_090518-208x300.jpg)Wednesday's session also included a rally among stocks in lagging industry groups, including steel, gas utility distribution, soap, tobacco, and mining and construction machinery. They all jumped more than 1%. Ditto for the electric utility, truck, farm equipment and truck transport firms.


Dow Transports Outperform
-------------------------


Some encouraging comments from government negotiators that Wednesday's fresh round of trade talks between the U.S. and Canada may help break the logjam over Nafta seemed to help these cyclical areas of the market. The Dow Jones transportation average rallied 0.6%. At 11,386, the sector index holds a 7.3% year-to-date gain, a touch below an 8% advance for the S&P 500.


Yet make no mistake about Wednesday's session. For many portfolio managers, it was all about packing in some profits.


Nasdaq turnover rose nearly 17% vs. the prior session. The significant decline in higher volume was an unmistakable sign of pronounced institutional selling.


Volume rose on the NYSE too. This means the S&P 500 also registered a [fifth distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


None of the S&P 500's distribution days have exceeded 1%. The biggest drop? A 0.8% cooling on Aug. 15.


Such distribution days jumped to five within the past 25 trading sessions for both the Nasdaq and S&P 500. That's certainly an elevated level. But since the market's major bottom in 2009, the Nasdaq has been able to recover from that many distribution days, or even more, to move to new highs.


Wednesday's slide matches the 1.2% decline in higher volume that hit the Nasdaq composite on Aug. 15. The other three distribution days lacked teeth, though. They included drops of 0.7% on Aug. 10, 0.3% on Aug. 30, and 0.2% on Tuesday. Keep in mind, too, that Tuesday's decline actually showed the composite index bouncing sharply off session lows and ending high in the intraday range. Nasdaq volume in the prior session was very superdry.


What To Do With Market Leaders Now
----------------------------------


The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and S&P SmallCap 600 all continue to trade near new highs. All three tread on the north side of their 50-day moving averages. The market uptrend is still intact. Still, a general pullback at this point is not surprising.


The 5.7% gain by the Nasdaq in August reflected some willingness among portfolio managers to chase growth stocks. Professionals are not immune to herdlike mentality. With just four months left in the year, some managers may feel a need to buy the biggest gainers to match or exceed their performance benchmarks.


Yet the savvy individual investor knows that [chasing stocks well beyond the proper buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) can quickly lead to stinging losses and an unnecessary surrender of hard-earned gains. Also, staying on the sidelines when a stock is trying to soar above the buy point in a [fourth- or fifth-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/) can be a show of excellent trading discipline.



When the market waters get choppy, waiting for [base-on-base patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) to form can be a good strategy. As luxury furniture retailer and showroom cafe operator **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) showed on Wednesday, waiting for a stock to actually break out is smart portfolio management.


Perhaps a stock will break out, run up 10% or more, but then backtrack all the way back to the proper breakout point. It's important to accept a small gain, raise some cash, then get ready to buy back when conditions improve. A great example today: business software leader and recent Leaderboard play **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), which sold off following good quarterly results late Tuesday.


Too Many Bulls?
---------------


Bullish newsletter writers polled each week by Investors Intelligence hit 60.1%, marking the first time the ratio eclipsed the 60% level since February. Keep in mind that when bullishness spiked to 66% in January, it reflected over-exuberance within the professional crowd. As if to temper that sentiment, the Nasdaq promptly fell nearly 12% from a Jan. 26 peak of 7505.


RW Baird equity strategists Bruce Bittles and William Delwiche track eight separate measures of investor sentiment across equities and options. They interpret four of sentiment surveys as "neutral" (including a pair of Cboe put vs. call ratios and the CME Volatility index) and four more as "bearish." One of those, the Ned Davis Research Crowd Sentiment Poll, shows optimism as "excessive."

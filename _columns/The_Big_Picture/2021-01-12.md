Stock Market Today: SMID Caps Make Another Big Splash; Here's What One Money Manager Is Watching

Have you noticed how, in the NFL, teams from mid-tier cities are making a big splash lately?




Yes, the Los Angeles Rams made the divisional playoffs. But right now, teams from outside the sprawling metropolises of America — think Kansas City, Green Bay, Tampa Bay, Buffalo, Cleveland — are shining with extra luster.


Could we draw a parallel with the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/)? Perhaps. Just looking at how the equity indexes performed on Tuesday offers more food for thought on how the living-with-coronavirus bull market is evolving.


To see the S&P 500 trade quietly after some good gains earlier this month? Just swell. A tiny gain of less than 0.1% is not bad when the large-cap index at one point fell 0.6%. The Nasdaq composite turned a normal-looking midday pullback into a 0.3% advance.


But make no mistake: The mighty mites on Wall Street hogged the ball Tuesday. SMID caps, a term to combine small- and midcaps, easily outperformed. While iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) romped 1.8% higher, SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ratcheted up almost 1.2%.

Volume rose on both main exchanges. This signals more equity trading desks across the land are deploying more capital to work.


Stock Market Today: Bulls Keep Looking Ahead
--------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, a poor print on a key small business optimism survey by the National Federation of Independent Business (95.9 in December, missing the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 102 by a mile) did not disturb the confirmed market uptrend.


Stock pickers can rejoice in the fact that individual growth stocks in the fields of health care, e-commerce, retailing, finance and consumer products are putting up big numbers, just seven trading days into the new year.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) continues to stun. Up 2.2% on Tuesday, the ETF has now gushed 7.9% higher since Jan. 1.


Preliminary numbers showed more than 1,000 companies on the Nasdaq and NYSE combined making new 52-week or all-time highs. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line, now a component of the daily chart found in the General Market Indicators page, is seeking to stay in a pronounced uptrend for an 11th straight week. In a nutshell, market breadth continues to improve. (See the page at the bottom of every Big Picture or in the [Market Trend section](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).)


How To Beat The S&P 500
-----------------------


[Sentiment gauges](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) showing a dearth of pessimism, including figures falling below 0.50 in the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) in December, remain a concern. But as noted plenty of times in this column and on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), optimism can remain at very high levels for weeks, if not months, until a key policy change, a global event, or some other news sparks the start of a serious correction.


For George Mateyo, chief investment officer at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, the supercharged gains by smaller companies reflect anticipation that the economy will make steps closer to the "old normal" before coronavirus basically shut down some sectors.


"We have been adding to areas such as cyclicals and financials, but we're not telling our clients to sell big-cap techs en masse," Mateyo, whose team has $43 billion in assets under management, told IBD in a phone interview. "It's a good time, though, to be more selective and think more in terms of small, mid and large cap."



Ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, Mateyo thinks that a potential move by the Democrats to boost the corporate tax rate from a current 21% to the mid-20s would be tolerated by the market. A lot of money has gone into fighting Covid-19, and the government must find a way to pay for that.


But Mateyo also thinks that any serious discussion to taxing unrealized capital gains would cause investors to twitch. For now, though, the chances of that happening in 2021 are apparently low.


Meanwhile, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) fund has helped Mateyo's clients get more exposure to sectors that have been performing well lately, such as manufacturing, infrastructure and energy. Unlike the S&P 500 itself, which as a market cap-weighted index is now extremely overweight in technology, the equal weight fund has shown to outperform during periods in which the economy is coming out of recession.


As if to prove Mateyo's point, shares on Tuesday rallied 0.8%.


The cost of borrowing for the long term inched up some more on Tuesday. At one point on the Cboe, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield hit a new multimonth high of 1.18%.

Stock Market Correction Worsens, As Tech Giants Crumble On Antitrust Fears
===========================================================================

The stock market ended sharply mixed Monday, but techs unquestionably sold off. What was also certain on Wall Street? Defensiveness rose, as the yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell to its lowest level since September 2017.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined as much as 2.16% before closing with a 1.6% fall. Large-cap tech stocks — represented by the Nasdaq 100 — bore the brunt of the damage as that index fell 2.2%. Both the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 reached the intermediate correction level, as they dropped more than 10% from their recent record highs.


The other major stock indexes fared much better. The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 4 points, less than 0.1%.


Volume on the Nasdaq jumped substantially compared to Friday's trading session. The heavier volume confirms institutions were heavily selling stocks in the technology sector. Volume rose modestly on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP060319-257x300.jpg)In an extra twist to the day's unusual action, [MarketSmith showed on its home page](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks) that more stocks actually rose in heavy volume vs. those that fell.


On the NYSE, winners outpaced losers by a 9-5 margin.


Still, growth stocks outside the FANG plays hardly offered any safe haven.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) was down 2.1%, lagging behind the major stock indexes amid heavy losses in top growth stocks. [Within the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), software stocks were hit particularly hard. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) fell more than 7% in heavy turnover to close below its 50-day line for the first time since a Feb. 6 breakout above a 164.18 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/).


Current Stock Market Correction
-------------------------------


The current stock market correction worsened Monday, as the major stock indexes reached fresh correction lows. How far the stock market will fall and how long the correction will last are popular questions to ask. But the reality is no one knows, which is why IBD interprets — as opposed to predicts — the stock market action.


During a stock market correction, investors should be keeping their powder dry, while waiting for a potential [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). Remember, even during the darkest moments of a bear market, a potential follow-through day is only four days away. Instead of tuning out, update your watch list with the top stocks holding up best amid the market's downdraft.


Tech Stock Leaders Crumble
--------------------------



A [new environment of regulation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/big-technology-companies-regulation-threatens-facebook-stock-amazon-google/) is hitting some of America's top technology stocks. [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) crumbled on reports of an antitrust investigation. Google stock is at its lowest level since early January. Google shares slashed 6% lower.


Fellow FANG stock **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) dropped 7.5%, falling more than 25% off its 52-week high. Facebook shares gave up their 50-day line Friday and reached their long-term 200-day moving average Monday.



Even longtime stock market leader **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is feeling the crunch of the current stock market correction. Amazon stock is below its long-term 200-day line for the first time since March 15. Gains from a 1,736.51 entry in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) topped out at 13.1% on May 3, but all of those gains have disappeared. Amazon shares fell 4.6%.


Resurgent social media giant **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) crumbled 5.5%, undercutting the 50-day moving average line, a critical support level. [Twitter stock](https://www.investors.com/research/twitter-stock-buy-now/) is still forming a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 41.02 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Software Leaders Hit Hard
-------------------------



The stock market's biggest winners since January saw significant weakness Monday. Top software stocks **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) and **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) all closely sharply lower. ServiceNow fell 5%, while DocuSign and CyberArk declined more than 7% each.


CyberArk triggered several defensive sell signals, including a [sharp break of the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in heavy volume. Volume rose over 100% above average.


**HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) hit the [7%-8% loss-cutting trigger](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) amid an over-6% swoon. The software leader fell more than 7% from a 180.10 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).


Stocks To Watch: AMD, Kirkland Lake Gold
----------------------------------------



An easy way to find leading stocks is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Investors use the RS line to find stocks that are beating the general market and can be potential stock market winners.


For example, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) has a strong RS line, as it trades within striking distance of a 30.05 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/). Last week, the chip leader [unveiled a new line of chips](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/amd-stock-new-chips-products-graphics-cards/) that received positive reviews. On Monday, AMD and Samsung Electronics [announced a partnership](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-jumps-samsung-mobile-graphics-chip-deal/), sparking a rise that topped 8%. But [AMD stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-buy-now/) closed just 0.6% higher amid the stock market sell-off.


**Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), meanwhile, surged over 5% to a breakout above a [35.30 entry in a cup with handle.](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/gold-stock-kirkland-lake-gold-prices-trade-war-fears/) The stock's RS line notched a new high, confirming the gold stock's strength. The top gold stock was added to [IBD's Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) service Monday.



Remember, three out of four stocks follow the market's general direction, according to IBD research. For every Kirkland Lake Gold that goes higher during a correction, there are losses in three other stocks (like Amazon, Paycom and HubSpot).

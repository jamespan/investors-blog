U.S. stock indexes took a timeout Friday, making moderate moves in quiet volume to end a week of big gains.


The Nasdaq added 0.5%, while the S&P 500 inched down 0.1%. The blue-chip Dow rose 0.2%. The IBD 50 popped 0.7%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


Secondary stock indexes showed greater strength. The S&P 600 sprinted 2.5% Friday, and the Philadelphia semiconductor index sped ahead 3.8%, erasing Thursday's 2.1% loss.

In that five-week period that basically defines current conditions, a check of the gauges shows just where the market's strength is.


The small-cap S&P 600 is up about 4%. The blue-chip Dow is up 3%. The S&P 500 and the Philadelphia semiconductor index are flat, while the Nasdaq is down 1%.


Blue chips haven't been relevant to growth investors for a long time. But thanks to the banks, the Dow looks good. Dow components **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) are up 13% and 20% over the past five weeks, with most of those advances occurring in the past few days.


Niche gauges have a five-week story to tell, too. The concrete industry group is up 25%. The steel producers group is up 30%.


On the downside, hospitals are down 17% and solar 12%.


Overall, the losers are associated with plays that presumed a Hillary Clinton presidency, and the winners have the stamp of Trump.


Regardless of what an investor thinks of President-elect Trump, the money chase carries the glow of change. Clinton essentially promised an extension of Obama economics. Trump is likely to go in a different direction, fostering a new group of winners.


The Street loves new leadership because it holds the chance for a longer run than trying to keep an old and tired sector chugging along. That's why IBD investors should study the sectors and industry groups that are showing strength now.


For the week, the S&P 600 advanced 10.6%; the Dow and the IBD 50, both 5.4%; and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, 3.8% each.

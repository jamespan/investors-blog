  Nasdaq Reaches 14,000, Up 7% So Far In February; Why The Growth Vs. Value Debate Is Meaningless Right Now

The Nasdaq composite claimed a technical milestone Tuesday, adding 0.1% on top of three straight days of gains and closing above 14,000 for the first time. But overall the market showed light, mixed action.




While small caps rallied yet again, investors seemed to take some profits across the large- and megacap space. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) rose 0.5% to cap a seven-session, 11.1% run-up. The S&P 500 snapped a six-session streak in delicate fashion, off just 0.1%. The S&P 500's intraday swing almost felt microscopic, a 0.4% margin from Tuesday's low to high.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged less than 10 points lower, while the NYSE composite managed to rise 0.1% and stage a seventh straight advance. It and the S&P 500, Dow industrials, Russell 2000 and Nasdaq all posted new all-time highs.


The Nasdaq climbed 0.1% and is up more than 7% so far this month.


The market continues to refute the value, for now, of debating this question: Will growth stocks keep outperforming value issues? Or will value turn the tables around?

![MP020921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP020921-210x300.jpg)Andrew Slimmon, who heads a Chicago-based team of quantitative and fundamental research analysts managing $6.5 billion in assets for Morgan Stanley Investment Management, stresses that a better way to view the action in U.S. equities is whether it's embracing risk or defensive sectors. And clearly the former strategy is working far better.


Growth And Value, Up
--------------------


"What really has been hurting? Defensive portfolio managers. Food and utilities have done poorly because we're coming out of a recession," Slimmon told IBD in a phone interview. "Even Bitcoin is reflecting how the market is embracing risk."


The iShares Russell 2000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) exchange traded fund holds a 5% gain since Jan. 1; at 252.80, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) trails by a nose, up 4.8%.


Yet a glance through the bottom quartile of IBD's 197 industry group rankings reveals year-to-date losses from the likes of confectioneries (-1.1% through Monday), paint (-2.5%), integrated telecom services (-4.8%) diversified utility (-1.3%) and soap (-3.3%).


Slimmon, who spent time as a fundamental research analyst at Morgan Stanley before switching to the buy side, notes that the team's Morgan Stanley Institutional Global Concentrated fund (MLNIX) has focused on the banking and industrial sectors since "typically coming out of a recession, cyclical stocks work largely on the value side."


That fund as well as two others led by Slimmon have invested in technology companies as well.


At the start of the week, IBD's sector-based stock tables indeed show outperformance on a mid- to long-term period in cyclical, industrial and tech areas of the market.


Headed into Tuesday's session, [Auto topped all 33 sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-feb-08-2021/) as the entire industry appears gung-ho about turning electric. Energy ranks No. 2 amid an impressive run by West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures prices past $58 a barrel. Crude started 2021 at $48.52. And let's not forget about Agriculture (ranked No. 3), Software (No. 6), Chips (No. 7), and Apparel (No. 8).


Banks rank outside the top 10. However, the sector's 16% gain year to date is nothing to sneeze at. And the S&Ls showed an 11% rally since Jan. 1 through Monday's trading.


Beyond The Nasdaq
-----------------


Market internals remain quite bullish.


Stocks making 52-week or all-time highs surpassed 1,300, according to early data. Just 62 issues fell to new lows on either the Nasdaq or the NYSE.


The Nasdaq and NYSE advance-decline lines have reached new high ground since late last week.

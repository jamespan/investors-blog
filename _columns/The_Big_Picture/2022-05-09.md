**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) on Monday slid 9.24%, the largest drop since Sept. 3, 2020, when shares fell 9.28%. Shares of **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) fell to their lowest level since June. The energy sector, a leader in the stock market, plunged more than 8%. The Nasdaq sold off 4.3%.




Those are signs of a sick stock market. And to borrow a phrase from medicine, the patient has yet to be stabilized. A stock market bottom remains elusive. For now, investors have little choice but to stay in the protection of cash.


The market correction grew broader as well as deeper Monday, with energy stocks coming undone. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) after hitting a new high on Friday. The exchange traded fund slid more than 8% in above-average turnover Monday.


A sampling of the sector's woes: Oil explorer **Canadian Natural Resources** ([CNQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNQ)) fell deeper below its 50-day line. **Comstock Resources** ([CRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRK)) also made its first break of the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) since its March 23 breakout. **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) slid 9%, enough to undercut its 21-day and 50-day moving averages. Pipeline operator **Flex LNG** ([FLNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLNG)) gapped below the 50-day line and erased all gains from its 25.51 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/). Oil giants **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) had their worst losses in months.


Other Sectors Lose Traction
---------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP050922--235x300.jpg)Oil and gas stocks joined fertilizers, self-storage, shipping, steelmakers and other industry groups among the former stock-market stars now slumping. **Livent** ([LTHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTHM)), a lithium producer that rallied last week on earnings, gave back more than 13% Monday.


The Nasdaq's 4.3% loss Monday cemented a three-day losing streak of more than 10%. That's the largest three-day decline since March 2020 (during the pandemic bear market). Its three-day, 1,341-point loss is the largest on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The S&P 500 slid 3.2% on Monday and undercut its May 2 low of 4062. With that, the index made new lows for its correction, and any hopes of a [new confirmed rally](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) are gone for now.


Big round numbers can act as ceilings or floors in stock market psychology, and the S&P 500 attempted to hold at 4000. But with a close at 3991, there's little hope for now that level will be of any help.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2% in what's become its largest losing streak since October 2020. Dow component **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) sold off 10.5%, reaching its lowest price since May 2020.


Stock Market Selling Broad
--------------------------


Selling was broad, with decliners beating advancers by more than 7-to-1 on the NYSE and by more than 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared higher on the NYSE as well.


In a small reprieve for investors, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined 0.04 basis point to 3.08%.


The price of U.S. crude oil fell more than 6% to $103.09 per barrel in Nymex trading. China's severe lockdowns are raising fears of an economic slowdown.


The IBD 50 index lost 5.4%, as oil, fertilizer and shipping stocks contributed to losses.


**Bunge** ([BG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BG)), a maker of fertilizer and other agricultural products, fell below its 50-day moving average for the first time since it broke out of a base on Jan. 7. **Nutrien** ([NTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTR)) made similarly bearish action and was kicked out of [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


Food Stocks Hold Up
-------------------



It's getting harder to find havens in this ailing stock market. The stock market seems to be in survival mode, with food makers and other essentials drawing some interest. IBD's packaged foods and cleaning products industry groups rose more than 1% Monday. Other defensive groups such as telecom services and grocery stores also rose.


**Tyson Foods** ([TSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSN)) climbed more than 2% and is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The meat producer beat profit expectations and raised its sales outlook. Rival **Pilgrim's Pride** ([PPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PPC)) was Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/pilgrims-pride-stock-flashes-bullish-signal-near-buy-point-tyson-foods-guides-higher/).


Cereal makers **Kellogg** ([K](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=K)) and **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)) were among the stocks up in volume.


Cryptocurrencies aren't doing any better. Bitcoin fell to $30,556 Monday afternoon, nearing the July low, [according to Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/).

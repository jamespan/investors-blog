Major stock indexes ended Tuesday's session with decent gains, but light volume was disappointing, particularly after two straight declines for the Nasdaq in above-average trading.


The Dow Jones industrial average hit another record high, rising 0.4%; the S&P 500 added 0.5%; and the Nasdaq composite led the way, rising 0.7%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index performed in-line with the NYSE indexes, up 0.5%. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) added 0.4%.


Nasdaq and NYSE volume fell sharply from Monday's levels. Winners beat losers by 7-to-3 on the NYSE and by 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.

When the Nasdaq plunged 1.8% on March 21, the selling was short-lived and the index was able to hold above the 50-day line. It slumped 2.6% on May 17 and quickly rebounded. The Nasdaq may follow a similar script this time around, or it might not. Either way, it's important for the individual investor to be nimble and open to a bullish or bearish outcome.


To be sure, market bulls like the fact that the distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remains light. And when it comes to the price action of leading growth stocks, sound charts still have the upper hand over weak ones â€” by a wide margin, actually.


The so-called FANG stocks turned in solid performances Tuesday. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are getting support so far at their 10-week moving averages. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is the only FANG stock below its 10-week line, but it's not in dire straits at only 8% off its high.


Financials have been a nice area of outperformance lately. Many extended gains Tuesday but faded. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) added 0.6% even after CFO John Gerspach warned of a second-quarter slump in trading revenue. Other money centers like **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) issued similar warnings last month.
Citigroup is still in buy range after a breakout from a flat base with a 62.63 buy point.


**Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) joined the financial-breakout ranks Tuesday. Comerica extended its winning streak to five sessions Tuesday, rising 1.5% to 73.87. It closed just above a 73.51 buy point. **East West Bancorp** ([EWBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWBC)) also made it five in a row Tuesday. It's now 3% above a 57.34 buy point, still in buy range.


Meanwhile, the market landscape continues to offer up an ample supply of potentially actionable names. Top-rated growth stocks like **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)), **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) and **Macom** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) are getting support at their 10-week lines.


There are plenty of other setups to consider from the likes of **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), **TTM Technologies** ([TTMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTMI)), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), among others.


The two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway Tuesday and the Fed's second rate hike this year is widely expected Wednesday when the policy statement is released at 2 p.m. ET. A rate hike has been baked in for a while now, so traders will be parsing the statement for clues about the timing of future rate hikes. The Fed has made it pretty clear that aggressive rate hikes are not in the cards; not with inflation generally in check and economic growth still sluggish.

Tuesday was another quiet day for the stock market despite a busy slate of earnings and the start of the two-day Fed meeting.


The Nasdaq eked out a 0.2% gain, the S&P 500 rose fractionally and the Dow fell 0.1%. Weak earnings fueled a sell-off in **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), but that was offset by strong showings for **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)). Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose from Monday's levels.


Coal, steel and mining stocks outperformed. Restaurant stocks lagged badly after Stifel downgraded 11 names, citing the possibility of a recession in the U.S.Â Jefferies Group downgraded some restaurants, too.


The IBD 50 rose, helped by strength in **A.O. Smith** ([AOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOS)), China-based **Yirendai** ([YRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YRD)) and **Masco** ([MAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAS)). Another IBD 50 name, **Vantiv** ([VNTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNTV)), is in a good setup ahead of its earnings report Thursday before the open.


![MP072616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP072616-151x300.jpg)When it comes to overall market health, the Nasdaq is holding comfortably above the 5000 level, while the S&P 500 is finding a new home above 2100, a prior resistance level.


After four straight weekly gains, the S&P is down just 0.3% so far this week. The Nasdaq is on pace for its fifth straight weekly gain. A pullback for both indexes wouldn't be out of the ordinary at this point, but it hasn't come yet. Their advance has merely slowed down. Expectations for a pullback seem to be growing, but warning signals aren't readily apparent.


While it's true that all of the Nasdaq's gains since the June 30 follow-through day have come in below-average volume, signs of institutional selling have been virtually nonexistent. Through Tuesday, the S&P 500 showed three distribution days, or higher-volume declines; the Nasdaq had two. Even better, leadership has broadened out to include growth stocks.


If you're sitting on some gains, look at each holding on a case-by-case basis. Don't be afraid to give solid gainers more room to work. Be less patient with middling or laggard performers. As always, be proactive and don't get complacent.


The next catalyst, up or down, could be the Federal Reserve. A two-day Fed meeting started Tuesday and a decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Not that long ago, rate-hike jitters were a sore spot for the market, but rate hikes are on the back burner for now.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) could be another catalyst. Late Tuesday, investors liked the look of its earnings report. Shares rose nearly 5% in after-hours trading. Strength in Apple helped lift the PowerShares QQQ ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) to a 0.6% gain in extended trading.


Late in Tuesday's session, another big chip merger hit the wires. Shares of **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) jumped 4% on news that it's acquiring **Linear Technology** ([LLTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLTC)) for $14.8 billion in cash and stock. Shares of Linear soared 29%.


In economic news, new-home sales in June jumped to their highest level since February 2008, according to the Commerce Department.


Homebuilders continue to be a nice pocket of strength in the market. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) reversed higher in heavy volume on Tuesday. It's still trading above an early 32.20 entry and conventional entry at 32.61. **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) is trading tightly as it works on a handle with a 49.40 buy point. And **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) is also holding gains after a breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 38.65 entry. It reports earnings Thursday before the open.

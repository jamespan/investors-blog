  Stock Indexes Rebound; 3 Technical Signs That Favor The Bulls

 U.S. stock indexes rebounded Thursday, as the Nasdaq found support at the 6000 price level.


The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 added 0.4%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose up 0.3%.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq, while NYSE volume was higher.

— The Nasdaq found support at the 6000 level the past two sessions. A trip back to a resistance level to confirm support is natural. So far, the action looks acceptable.


The S&P 500's picture looks less convincing: It still hasn't solved resistance at 2400, and is now struggling near its 50-day moving average.


— Distribution remains manageable. The April 12 distribution day expired at Thursday's close, letting the S&P 500 trim its count to three. The low count suggests funds are comfortable holding shares.


— The put-call volume ratio closed at 1.10 Wednesday. The 1.15 level is often where the market finds a short-term bottom, but 1.10 has had some predictive success, too. The last time the ratio closed at 1.10 was March 24, one session before the Nasdaq's short term low.


This low came four sessions after the Nasdaq's 1.8% dive March 21. Just glancing at the Nasdaq chart, the down day with a low close looks similar to Wednesday's down day.


Despite those positive signs, the market uptrend is under pressure until indexes show better behavior. Continue to trade with caution, cutting losses short and making fewer stock buys.


One value-oriented factor is the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has been in the 2.34%-to-2.22% range. Meanwhile, the dividend yield on the Dow Jones industrial average is in the 2.40% area.


Conservative investors, except for the most bearish, could regard the Dow as a place to get a higher yield with a potential for price appreciation.


In other words, those inclined to reject the stock market don't have a very attractive alternative.


Day's Leaders And Laggards; Brazil's Meltdown
---------------------------------------------


Leaders moving up in volume Thursday showed a technology bent. Chips and internet plays made up the day's bullish field.


Losers Thursday weren't ugly for long. For example, **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) dropped about 11% at the open, but then rebounded to end with a 3% loss. Argentina-based MercadoLibre gets more than half its revenue from Brazil, where the stock market plunged on reports that Brazilian President Michel Temer paid hush money to an imprisoned ally.


Analysts expect MercadoLibre to grow earnings 37% this year, which would be the best growth in the past seven years.


The iShares Brazil ([EWZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWZ)) exchange traded fund gapped down to a 16% loss on the corruption news. Corruption in Brazil has cut across the political spectrum, involving those on the left, center and the right.


Brazil-based airline **Azul** ([AZUL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZUL)) dropped 19%, undercutting its entire range of trade since its April 11 initial public offering. The stock had cleared a 10-day IPO base May 2, but triggered the 8% sell rule Thursday morning. Azul lost money in each of the past three years, but the Street expects a profit of 30 cents a share this year.


Economic Reports
----------------


In economic news, first-time jobless claims came in about 3% fewer than expected. The Philadelphia Fed's business gauge for May soared to 38.8, far above the consensus view for 19.6.


Leading indicators for April rose 0.3%, matching expectations.


Friday will be a quiet day for economic data. The Baker-Hughes rig count is one of the few reports expected.

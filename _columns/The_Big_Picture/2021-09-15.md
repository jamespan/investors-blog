The stock market bounced Wednesday, ending a five-day losing streak in the Nasdaq composite as indexes appear to have successfully tested new lows.




For the moment at least, the stock market is following the same script it has for most of the year. That is, the S&P 500 takes a breather and falls to its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The index then bounces and continues a trend of higher highs and higher lows.


On Wednesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.8% after coming down to about six points above its 50-day average on Tuesday. It was the seventh time this year the index found support at the 50-day line. On March 4, the S&P 500 fell 2.5% below the 50 day average and rallied back the next day.


The Nasdaq composite also rose 0.8% and found support at a different level. The composite held firm at the 15,000 level.


Dog Days For The Dow
--------------------


But the Dow Jones Industrial Average is lagging. Up 0.7% Wednesday, the Dow closed for the fifth consecutive day below the 50-day line. That's the longest period since a mid-June slump.


The Dow has recorded its worst first 10 trading days of September since 2011, matching the 1.55% drop that year, according to Dow Jones Market Data. In fact, this is the Dow's worst first 10 days of any month since May 2020, when it fell nearly 3%.


**Dow Inc.** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)), **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) are dead weight on the Dow.


Although it's looking healthier now, the S&P 500 just had its worst first 10 days of any month since September 2020. The Nasdaq's first 10 days of this month were the weakest since May.


Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by about 7 to 3 on the NYSE and by 12 to 7 on the Nasdaq. That helps a flagging Nasdaq advance-decline line, though it needs to improve. Nasdaq volume rose and trade appeared to also rise in the NYSE.


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/?intcode=qcklnks|nhpqcklnks|artpromo|2020|06|iart|na||351293&src=A00600A) bounced back with a 1.2% increase. The growth-stock index is 3.5% from a new high.


IPO stock **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) performed best on the IBD 50, up more than 7% in above-average trading. Construction products maker **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)) climbed more than 4% and appears to be [forming a new base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/).


Energy Sector: New Stock Market Leader
--------------------------------------


If there's something to complain about, it is that few IBD 50 stocks are [forming bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). At these heights in the bull market, it may be hard to find many. But sector rotation refreshes opportunities.


On Wednesday, energy stocks expanded their rally, and it's strengthening its role as a stock market leader. Third-quarter revenues for the S&P energy sector are expected to surge 52.3%, according to FactSet. That's the most of any S&P sector. Analysts have bumped up profit estimates by 18.7% since the start of the third quarter, also the most of any sector. 


In today's Market Pulse, you'll find several energy stocks up in volume. **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) and **Cimarex Energy** ([XEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XEC)) are [breaking out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) to new highs. **Cabot Oil & Gas** ([COG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COG)) shares are racing toward a 52-week-high.


Among ETFs, Invesco DB Oil Fund ([DBO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBO)) and United States Gasoline Fund ([UGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UGA)) broke out of [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/) Wednesday.


Third-Quarter Earnings Favor Stock Market
-----------------------------------------


Corporate earnings are a big influence on stock market performance, and the outlook is still sanguine. With a couple of weeks left in the third quarter, analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to surge 27.9% in Q3. That would be the third-highest increase since Q3 of 2010, according to FactSet.


"The unusually high growth rate is due to a combination of higher earnings for Q3 2021 and a comparison to weaker earnings in Q3 2020 due to the negative impact of Covid-19 on a number of industries," John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet, said in a report.


Normally, analyst estimates tend to drop as the end of the quarter approaches. The opposite is happening this year. On June 30, the consensus S&P 500 EPS estimated growth rate was 24.2%.


"Analysts and companies have been much more optimistic than normal in their estimate revisions and earnings outlooks for the third quarter to date," he added. Remember, the S&P 500 posted an EPS gain of more than 90% in the second quarter. For the full year, analysts expect S&P 500 EPS growth of 43%.


S&P 500 revenue is estimated to rise 14.8% in Q3 from the year-ago period. That would be the second highest growth in the top line since FactSet began tracking the numbers in 2008.


The estimated net profit margin for the S&P 500 is 12.1%, which is above the five-year average of 10.6% and the year-ago net profit margin of 10.9%. But it's below the previous quarter's record-high net profit margin of 13.1%.

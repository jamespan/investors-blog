  Stocks Pause; Does 7-Week Run Have To Spell The End?

Stock indexes last week suffered an interruption to the bull run, but it was the kind of pause that raises few concerns.


The Nasdaq booked a 0.1% gain Friday and 0.2% for the week. The S&P 500 stepped back 0.1% Friday and inched up less than 0.1% for the week. The IBD 50 popped 1.1% Friday and 1.6% for the week.


Volume fell across the board Friday.


The Nasdaq, which has outperformed the S&P 500 in the uptrend that began in late June, has risen seven weeks in a row. However, the week ended Friday had more of a sideways look.



Considering that the Nasdaq advanced as much as 14% during this run and hit an all-time high, a little selling is to be expected.


However, the indexes suffered stalling Tuesday, a subtle form of distribution that occurs on an up day. This is something to watch.


Distribution is at four days, neither negligible nor terrible.


However, it was a stalling day April 20 that signaled the short-term peak before the Nasdaq corrected about 6%.


Cluster distribution is another way that a situation can change in a hurry. For example, in late December and early January, the S&P 500 suffered three distribution days in five days. That cluster was enough to kick the market into correction mode.


Yet, this doesn't mean the rally has to end after seven up-weeks in the Nasdaq.


In early 2012, the Nasdaq rose in 12 of 13 weeks. In the summer of 2012, the Nasdaq rose in 12 of 15 weeks. In early 2010, the Nasdaq rose in 10 of 11 weeks. In the fall of 2010, the index rose in nine of 10 weeks.

A situation of seven up-weeks in a row means an individual investor might fine-tune his or her strategy, but fine-tune in a counterintuitive way.


Many times good gains persuade the individual investor to ease their standards in the anxious desire to get more exposure quickly. Bad idea.


At this juncture, an investor should keep their selection standards high, perhaps even raise them a notch if adding a stock to the portfolio. Apart from earnings reactions, stocks aren't moving much at all.


Or to put it in baseball terms, "get a good ball to hit."


The refusal to swing at bad pitches is a big part of what made baseball legend Ted Williams a great hitter. Likewise, an investor's refusal to lunge at stocks outside "the happy zone" is only prudent.

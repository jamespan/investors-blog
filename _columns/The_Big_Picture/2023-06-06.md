The stock market turned in another strong performance Tuesday as several top-rated growth stocks enjoyed another day of outperformance.




It wasn't that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite scored big gains Tuesday. But both indexes held firm after strong gains on Thursday and Friday, while small-caps and midcaps outperformed.


After surging above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) Friday, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) jumped 2.6% Tuesday. As market breadth improves, it's good to see small- and midcap stocks participating. The SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) also outperformed, rising 2.1%.


Both indexes held gains, helped by a strong showing for the SPDR Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)), which soared 5%. **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), a top-10 holding of KRE, jumped 6.1% and broke out over its May 23 intraday high of 39.28.


Even when the Nasdaq composite was only up 0.1% during the first hour of trading, breadth was more than 2-to-1 positive on the Nasdaq. The index closed with a gain of nearly 0.4%, outperforming the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which edged lower. But improving breadth was once again seen in the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)), which outperformed QQQ, rising 0.7%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 are starting to look extended from their 50-day moving averages, which raises the probability of a pullback. But the same can't be said for the S&P 500, which broke out Friday in higher volume — the same day that IBD raised its investment allocation to 60% to 80%.


Winners beat losers on the Nasdaq by about 2.5-to-1 Tuesday. Volume rose from Monday's totals.

The [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio is now around 87% invested after the addition of **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) Tuesday, which cleared a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) after finding support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The S&P 500 added 0.2% in higher volume, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher. Advancing stocks on the NYSE outnumbered decliners by 2-to-1.

While it's true that much of the Nasdaq composite's big gain this year has been fueled by a relatively small number of large-cap technology stocks, improving breadth is a welcome development for the confirmed uptrend.


The [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) delivered more chart breakouts in the stock market Tuesday, including one from **Primoris Services** ([PRIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRIM)), which cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) with a 28.19 entry. PRIM is a thinly traded stock, though, with an average daily dollar volume of just below $8 million. Nonetheless, earnings growth has accelerated for three straight quarters. Revenue growth has picked up the past for four quarters.


The accompanying Market Pulse graphic has been filled with leaders rising in heavy volume in recent days, a good sign for stock market bulls.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


Insurer **Kinsale Capital** ([KNSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNSL)) also cleared a base with a 345.75 buy point. But after four straight up sessions, the stock could be ready for a pullback. **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) is another stock that's run up quickly without much consolidation. The diabetes stock briefly crossed its April 27 high of 126.44, but sellers knocked DXCM just below the entry by the close.


In the enterprise software group, **Smartsheet** ([SMAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMAR)) rallied for the second straight session in heavy volume ahead of Wednesday's earnings report after the close. It was featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/smartsheet-stock-surges-off-lows-quarterly-earnings-report/) story as an earnings option idea.


Strength in growth stocks was also seen in the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which added another 1.5%. The ETF went above its 200-day moving average for the first time since December 2021. It also cleared its April 18 high of 24.34. After rising 3.6% last week, the ETF of top-rated growth stocks is up another 2.3% this week.


**Fluence Energy** ([FLNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLNC)) was one of the top gainers in the IBD 50, up more than 9%. After clearing a handle buy point of 24.88 last week, the maker of energy storage products hit a 52-week high Tuesday. It was in a group of about 20 stocks in the IBD 50 that rallied 2% or more.

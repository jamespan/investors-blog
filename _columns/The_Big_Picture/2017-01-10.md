The stock market closed mixed Tuesday after erasing much of its morning gains — a day that seemed to embody the sleepy pace of the past few weeks.


Dull as it may be, Tuesday's trading belied a record high for the Nasdaq, which reached as high as 5564. The composite has established itself as the market leader in the new year, even as its advance has moderated.


New vigor in recent days by major components such as **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is helping the Nasdaq gain an edge.


![mp_4_011017](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP_4_011017-177x300.png)The S&P 500 closed flat after retracing a 0.5% gain. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE. The increase on the NYSE meant the S&P suffered a stalling day, a subtle type of distribution.


The Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.2%.


Small caps, however, led as the Russell 2000 surged 1%. It was a bright spot for the market, although the Russell remained in a sideways pattern. The major indexes have flattened out since mid-December, which leaves the broad market with an unsettled direction.


A pause was necessary after the superb November Wall Street enjoyed. But the longer the indexes go horizontal, the more uncertainty that develops.


The passage of time has erased several distribution days, and now the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have a tolerable number (fewer than a half-dozen on each). The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at satisfactory B grades.


While the market slogs along, some psychological indicators indicate some risks. The [CBOE Market Volatility index](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), commonly called the VIX, is at levels associated with complacency, the type that sometimes ends abruptly with a market slide.


Meanwhile, a widening gulf between bulls and bears in the Investors Intelligence survey of market newsletters also shows a suspicious lack of fear. (*See the [Psychological Market Indicators](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) page, found under the "Market Trend" section at Investors.com.*)


The slowing indexes have influenced the behavior of leading stocks, leaving many of them in tight, starchy patterns that hold promise. **Primerica** ([PRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRI)), **Veeva** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) and **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) (which broke out Tuesday) are examples of those attractive bases.


As byproducts of the slowing market, some follow-on entries in the form of three-weeks-tight patterns have developed in recent weeks. But now, some flat bases are in the works, bringing additional opportunities. Stocks pulling back to the 10-week or 50-day moving average make for another family of potential buy candidates.


But the downside of a tired market is that many breakouts are stalled or the stocks have fallen below buy points. Indeed, few leaders have made good on the breakouts of the past few weeks. Square reversed lower Tuesday despite a [bullish analyst note](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/square-price-target-hiked-on-small-biz-opportunity/?yptr=yahoo), and is back near its 14.92 buy point.


Few are the leading stocks making productive moves from breakouts, such as **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)).


Metals stocks led the market, after Chinese producer prices climbed, sending metals commodities higher.


Airlines were another top group. **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) gave bullish December operating results and favorable revenue guidance.


**NuVasive** ([NUVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUVA)), a specialist in spinal surgery equipment, broke out of a cup with handle with a 69.04 buy point. The company announced Monday preliminary full-year revenue growth of nearly 18%.

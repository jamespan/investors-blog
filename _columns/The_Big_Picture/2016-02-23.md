Stocks, Again, Follow Oil's Downward Path
==========================================

The market slid Tuesday, as stock and oil prices remained joined at the hip.


The S&P 500 tumbled 1.2% , and no doubt the tumble in energy stocks took a toll. The blow to crude Tuesday came via Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, who [dismissed plans for a cut in production](https://www.investors.com/news/saudi-arabia-no-demand-worries-and-a-cut-is-not-going-to-happen/). His remarks sent oil futures down 4.6% on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The Nasdaq lost 1.5% -- more than the S&P 500, even though the composite has a much smaller share of oil stocks (less than 1% vs. 6.6% for the S&P 500). Solar stocks and biotechs were the other big drags on the Nasdaq.


In the context of the market's week-and-a-half rally, a breather seems to be in order. The S&P 500 had surged more than 6% in just six days.


At the same time, the index came near the down-sloping 50-day moving average and near prior highs around 1950. To chart readers, those levels now take on the role of resistance, at least for the short term.


Now that the Saudi oil minister seems to have doused the rally in crude, a stock pullback has the potential to get longer. Hopes for an output cut had sparked oil prices, and stocks followed along.


On the good side, the major indexes have yet to suffer a distribution day -- a loss in higher volume that would indicate heavy institutional selling. Volume fell Tuesday.


Small caps fared modestly better. The Russell 2000 fell 0.9% and remains more than 20% off its high -- what traditionally defines a bear market. The IBD 50 also came out of the sell-off down 0.9%.


A few more breakouts emerged, but as Tuesday's Big Picture noted, they continue to be unsatisfying.


**Alliant Energy** ([LNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNT)) edged past a 68.90 buy point of a cup with handle. Compounding the soft price action, volume was only average. **Church & Dwight** ([CHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHD)) inched above a 90.83 buy point, with volume two-thirds slower than usual.


Other breakouts in the past week haven't exactly screamed to new highs. On Tuesday, for example, **Volaris** ([VLRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLRS)) dipped below its 19.22 buy point. It had broken out less than a week earlier, but slid Tuesday after the company reported results Monday and Cowen downgraded the Mexican airline.


But two companies that beat profit expectations made solid breakouts. **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) soared 13% in heavy trading. **ExlService** ([EXLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXLS)) also made an impressive gain as it topped the 48 buy point of a cup base.


It's been just a week since the market made a follow-through, and it may be asking too much to expect more institutional-quality stocks breaking out at this stage. The December to early February correction was deeper than the past several market declines, which forced leading stocks to spend more time consolidating.


Of course, earnings reports are a double-edged sword. **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)) shed 3% in active trading despite Q4 results that were above views. **J.M. Smucker** ([SJM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SJM)) gapped down to a 2% loss after the Folgers and Jif peanut butter maker posted disappointing sales.

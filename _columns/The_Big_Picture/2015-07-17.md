Stock indexes struggled to get on the same page Friday as the Nasdaq gapped up while the S&P 500 sagged. The Nasdaq penciled in a 0.9% gain, while the S&P 500 added 0.1%. The IBD 50 rose 0.3%. Volume rose on both main exchanges. Friday was an expirations day, which normally lifts volume.

  

The S&P 500 trailed the Nasdaq throughout the session, largely because it was dragging two anchors — the oil and utility sectors.

  

Oil stocks account for 40 of the stocks in the S&P 500, and nearly all of the 40 stocks were down. Many lost 2% or more for the day.

  

West Texas Intermediate crude oil was nearly flat Friday but lost almost 4% for the week.

  

Utilities also struggled Friday: Twenty-seven of the 29 utilities in the S&P 500 index fell. The traditional explanation is that utilities sell off before the Federal Reserve begins raising rates. A rate boost is expected either later this year or early next year. It would be the first boost in nine years.

  

Oil and utility stocks do not have a heavy presence in the Nasdaq, thus the tech-tinged gauge was free to advance. But the Nasdaq had its own asterisk.

  

Two 16% pops — in **Google class A** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Google class C** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) shares — revved up the Nasdaq. The two Google vehicles account for a total weighting of 8.3% in the Nasdaq. The stock soared after a bullish earnings report late Thursday.

  

The sector picture is a bit muddied right now.

  

The medical sector led the market for a long time and could do so again. For example, the hot biotech industry group rose almost 70% from mid-October to late March. Since then, the group has slowed its pace. But it rose the past seven days and is at a new high.

  

Where else are leaders stirring?

  

Since June, the bank sector has pretty much taken over the lead among most new highs for the day. One of every four super regional banks was at new highs in Friday's IBD.

  

Playing this development, though, won't be easy.

  

Many hot stocks in the bank sector are small community banks that are thinly traded. This carries additional risk because shorts can move in on a hot, thinly traded stock and tear it apart.

  

The larger banks, such as **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), which also are at or near new highs, don't carry leaderlike ratings.

  

Another area showing promise is the retail sector, which scored 24 and 22 new highs Monday and Thursday.

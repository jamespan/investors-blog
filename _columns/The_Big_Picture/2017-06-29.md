  Stocks Get The Shredder; Is A Summer Pullback Underway?

U.S. stock indexes were soundly thrashed Thursday, refusing help from the banks, oil stocks and a stronger-than-expected GDP gain.




The Nasdaq staggered to a 1.4% loss, after being down as much as 2.3%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 lost 0.6%, according to preliminary data.


Volume ran higher across the board, adding distribution days to both major indexes. A distribution day, which points to institutional selling, involves a sizable loss in a major index in rising volume.


The [CBOE Market Volatility Index](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), known as the VIX, hit the highest level in almost six weeks, perhaps signaling a bottom. The VIX tracks options activity on the S&P 500 index. Still, the stock-market uptrend remains under pressure.


Three items stood out in Thursday's market.


GDP Surprise
------------


First, the GDP number: Before the market's open, the third reading on first quarter GDP rolled in. The 1.4% pop was better than the 1.2% consensus view and twice as high as the initial 0.7% reading in April.

A Boost For Banks
-----------------


Second, some good news for banks: The banks finally got some encouragement late Wednesday when the Federal Reserve gave the go-ahead to most dividend and buyback plans. This optimism carried over into Thursday's open as the money center group popped as much as 2% higher and the superregional banks 3%.


Yet part of the gains were eventually given back. For example, **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) settled for a 1.5% advance after being up 3.1%. **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) gapped up 3.5% but then retreated to a 1.9% gain.


Thinking Inside The Chart Box
-----------------------------


Third, the technicals drew a wavering line Thursday: The charts tried to give a clear signal but then backed off.


For nearly four weeks, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have traded inside a box of their own design. The Nasdaq box had set a ceiling roughly around 6310 to 6340 and a floor roughly around 6110 to 6145. The Nasdaq closed within the box Thursday.


The S&P 500 sketched a shallower base from a ceiling around 2440 and a floor around 2415. It too closed within the box.


Moves either up or down are less insignificant as long as they stay inside a recent trading pattern.


The Summer Pullback
-------------------


Yet, these three developments raise a question: Is a summer pullback underway?


Over the past eight years (2009-2016), the stock market has suffered a pullback that bottomed in the summer each year (though it didn't necessarily start in the summer). For summer, we used the official designation: usually June 21 to Sept. 21 or 22. Let's look at the summer lows through the lens of the Nasdaq.


In 2016, the summer low came early, June 27, and represented an 8.2% pullback from the previous high.


In 2015, the summer nadir arrived Aug. 24. The pullback was 18%, thanks to the flash crash.


In 2014, the summer low was pegged Aug. 7. The pullback could barely be called a pullback — down 3.6%.


In 2013, the summer low came early, June 24. The pullback was 6.7%.


In 2012, the summer low also was early, June 28. The pullback was 10.1%.


In 2011, the summer low appeared Aug. 9. The pullback was 19%.


In 2010, the summer low was on July 1. The pullback was 18.7%.


In 2009, the summer low rolled in July 8. The pullback was 8.1%.


The median pullback in these eight years was 8% to 10%. The average pullback was 11.5%.


How To Play The Summer
----------------------


Given the action of the past eight years, a pullback to a summer low is to be expected. (So far, the Nasdaq has pulled back as much as 4% from its June 9 intraday high.)


The advances after the low is set, generally are harder to quantify. (A wild ride raises the question of how many investors can hang on.)


But in each case, a rebound followed the summer low, delivering gains roughly of 7% to 24%. The median rebound was about 13%.


What does this mean? In terms of strategy, individual investors might be wise to make sure they have some money on the sidelines this summer. That way a follow-through day near the summer low could lead to buys and good gains.

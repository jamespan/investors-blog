Stock Market Bounces Off Early Losses; How Will Wall Street Respond To Earnings?
=================================================================================

What happened in the stock market on Wednesday? Something that prudent chart watchers haven't seen for a little while.




If you viewed just the first hour of the 6-1/2-hour trading session, you might have closed your laptop or exited your investment app with a grimace, or worse. Take the Nasdaq. The composite index gapped lower right from the get-go, then fell to as low as 10,910, down more than 2.3% in just an hour of stock dealing. Given that kind of action, you might have thought this would be one of those sessions in which the Nasdaq and its fellow indexes would plunge 3% or more.


Instead, however, heavy selling gave way to a healthy scoop of bargain hunting.


Stock Market Today: A Better Ending
-----------------------------------


The Nasdaq briefly powered into mildly-positive ground but, by day's end, it still registered a loss. Even so, a nearly 0.3% decline meant that, at least for now, the tech-driven index kept the lion's share of its two-day gain of more than 5.5%.


Other key indexes adopted the same narrative.

The S&P 500, a 1.8% loser in the early going, managed to whittle that decline down to less than 0.2%. Meanwhile, the small cap-dominated Russell 2000 edged 0.7% lower. But that still pales vs. an early-morning pounding of almost 2.5%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, rising a combined 5.5% over Monday and Tuesday's sessions, inched 0.1% lower on Wednesday.


Volume swung sharply lower on both main exchanges vs. the prior day. Perhaps not a surprise, given that earnings news remained super-light and that the monthly jump in private sector payrolls for September, according to ADP, only slightly beat the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


The Yom Kippur holiday likely had a significant impact on the overall trading as well, as it has in prior years. Yet upcoming data on initial jobless claims on Thursday and the September nonfarm payrolls report on Friday may likely spur heavier activity.


WTI light sweet crude oil futures, meanwhile, rose 1.7% to $87.98 per barrel following reports that OPEC+ agreed to slash production by up to 2 million barrels a day.


According to The Wall Street Journal, this decision marked the [biggest cut since the start of the pandemic](https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-agrees-to-biggest-oil-production-cut-since-start-of-pandemic-11664978144?mod=hp_lead_pos4). Natural gas futures rallied 1.3%.

Stocks Vs. Bonds
----------------


Institutions sold long-dated Treasury bonds hard on Wednesday. This lifted the yield on the benchmark 10-year note 14 basis points to 3.75%.


The market's expectation for a fourth straight hike of 75 basis points in the fed funds rate, based on futures trading on the CME, now stands at a 65% probability. A decision at the Nov. 2 Federal Reserve meeting is still almost a month away. Would a big change in that expectation impact the stock market? Surely. But few strategists on Wall Street now expect governors of the U.S. central bank to end their unanimously hawkish stance toward inflation and the cost of borrowing money.


Certainly, upcoming inflation data will get extra attention later this month. But in the near term, investors will now digest another steady flow of third-quarter results. This news will give fund managers more clues to how much high inflation, and a definite slowdown in the U.S. economy, is affecting profits, perhaps the No. 1 factor in stock prices.


The fed funds rate currently stands at a target range of 3%-3.25%.



Already, we've seen the likes of **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) warn about disappointing Q3 results. Plus, Wall Street has on the whole sharply cut profit estimates.


According to Gene Goldman, chief investment strategist at investment advisory giant Cetera, at the end of June, the Street had been expecting an 8.5% increase in earnings among S&P 500 companies. That estimate has now fallen to a trifling 2.5%.


"They've really ratcheted down the estimates really fast, but this also creates an opportunity for some upside surprises," Goldman told IBD. He also notes that, beyond the earnings season, there are some reasons to expect a return of institutional demand for U.S. equities.

Will The Recession Roll?
------------------------


For starters, Goldman thinks that the U.S. will experience what he calls a "rolling recession." That is, the contraction does not pummel all sides of the economy all at once. Rather, the housing market has already gone into recession, but mortgage delinquency is not a serious problem for the lenders. Why? Many homeowners locked in long-term mortgages at historically low rates.


Manufacturing may be the next area to get hit by the recession. Earlier this week, the ISM survey showed that overall factory activity still expanded in September, albeit mildly. But "the Fed has done an effective job" of tightening the money supply in order to cool down new orders and slow down purchases of goods.


"Business inventories have surged dramatically. And once we start to see signs of disinflation, this should help low-income households," Goldman added. "Rents are really expensive, but asking rents are starting to roll over. Asking rent is like the futures market."


Finally, the strategist thinks that we're closer to the top of yields for the 10-year U.S. Treasuries. Why? The first reason: as the two-year bond yield goes up, this puts pressure on the 10-year bond yield as well. Already, the Treasury bond yield curve has gotten sharply inverted. Traditionally, this is bad news for the stock market.


Additionally, if the Fed has been right in raising interest rates rapidly enough to tame inflation, future data should indicate that the aggressive rate hikes will be less necessary in the coming months. A change in the Fed's course could convince bond buyers to bid up the 10-year bond, which would then lower yields.


"The 60-40 (stocks vs. bonds) portfolio may come back," Goldman said.

Stock indexes coasted to a quiet close Friday, content to sit on the week's solid gains.


The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average each eased less than 0.2%, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.1%. The IBD 50 added almost 0.2%.


Volume nudged up across the board. Friday was an expirations day, which normally boosts volume.


Bulls had to be reasonably content with the week's action. The Nasdaq retook its 200-day line and now is about 2% above it.


The Nasdaq's chart has communicated a consistently bullish story since Feb. 11's bounce off the lows. Dips have been shallow. Four times the Nasdaq retreated 2% to 3% before reversing higher. The dips are hard to characterize as pullbacks. This is more like throat-clearing by the bulls than a chokehold by the bears.


![MP041516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP041516-549x1024.jpg)The Nasdaq has gained 16% since that Feb. 11 close. The gains have come in steady steps. In the past five weeks, for example, the Nasdaq's daily gain was 1% or more only three times.


Is it reasonable to expect a pullback? Yes and no. It's probably just as reasonable to expect a continuation of the trend, or perhaps a picking up of the pace.


For IBD-style investors with concentrated holdings, the action of the stocks in the portfolio is key. The game is played differently if an investor has a 15% gain on a stock than if he or she is barely above the buy point.


Look at the price and volume action of your stocks over the past five weeks or so. Four questions can help an investor decide whether to hold or fold a position:


* Is the stock showing bearishly low closes or bullishly high closes relative to its daily price range?
* Is the stock posting positive reversals or negative reversals?
* Are there signs of accumulation (gains in rising volume) or distribution (losses in rising volume)?
* Does the stock's relative strength line show lagging or leading action vs. the S&P 500?


Knowing the answers to these questions is especially important if the company's earnings report is near.


News also can affect stocks.


Economic reports were mixed Friday. The Empire State manufacturing survey for April blew past the consensus view of 3 with a reading of 9.56. Two other gauges disappointed. Industrial production for March fell more than expected, and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey also fell short of views.


**What's ahead**: The Street expects four reports on the housing sector in the coming week. They are the Housing Market Index on Monday; housing starts Tuesday; existing-home sales Wednesday; and the FHFA House Price Index on Thursday. Housing companies reporting include **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)).


Other key companies reporting in the coming week include **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)), **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **McDonald’s** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)).


**What's probably dead**: Traders say the oil meetings in Doha, Qatar, over the weekend were unlikely to lead to a production freeze. A surprise agreement would probably energize the stock market's bullish camp.


For the week, the small cap S&P 600 rose 3%; the Nasdaq and the Dow, 1.8% each; the S&P 500, 1.6%; and the IBD 50, 1.1%.

Stock Market Falls, But Calmly; The Surprising Sectors Leading In December
===========================================================================

A four-session win streak ended Tuesday about as gently as could be hoped.




The Nasdaq composite reversed lower, ending with a 0.6% loss. It was a modest decline in light of four straight gains. Volume eased on the Nasdaq, which indicated no heavy institutional selling and eliminated the chance of a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The S&P 500 narrowly missed on a fifth-straight gain after it erased gains and lost only 0.1%. NYSE volume appeared to be lower also.


As [The Big Picture noted Monday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rises-again-sp500-record-high-is-index-getting-too-hot/), the major indexes — especially the market-leading S&P 500 — appeared due for a rest after four sessions of solid gains.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP122821-268x300.jpg)Indeed, Tuesday's moderate loss can be taken as a needed pause. The S&P 500's loss Tuesday may not be enough to reset the table for buyers. But the S&P right now has to be careful to not run off its rails and not get too extended.


The Russell 2000 index reversed lower, too. The small-cap benchmark is meeting resistance at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/), which is flattening, and the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), which is bending lower.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3% and extended its win streak to five sessions. The Dow's job now is to hold above its 36,000 price level.


Sectors Leading Stock Market
----------------------------


Technology was the weakest S&P sector Tuesday, which contributed to the Nasdaq's drop. IShares Expanded Tech-Software ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) ETF fell 1% and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.2%. Biotechs, another Nasdaq-heavy group, dropped 1.3%.


Transportation stocks were relatively strong. Airlines and ocean shipping stocks outperformed, with the groups up 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively.


In railroads, **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base in light trading.


The iShares U.S. Transportation ETF ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) climbed 0.2% and, more importantly, is nearing the 281.55 buy point of a new base.


IBD's homebuilding industry group added 0.8% despite mixed housing data. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller [20-city home price index rose 0.8% in October](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), missing the Econoday consensus estimate of a 1% increase from the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, the index jumped 18.4%, slightly less than estimates for 18.6%.


Stock Market Breakouts Mixed
----------------------------


If the air went out of the major stock market indexes, it also came out of stocks making significant moves. Maybe it was another sign the stock market still needs some moderation.


**Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) jumped as much as 11% early Tuesday after the company [announced a collaboration deal](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apps-stock-climbs-on-strategic-partnership-with-google-cloud/) with **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google. But the stock vaporized all gains and closed with a 1.7% loss.


**Allegro Microsystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) broke out above the 36.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a choppy pattern but wiped out all gains. It closed below the entry.


Health care staffing firms **AMN Healthcare Services** ([AMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMH)) and **Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)) sank back below their buy points, just one day after breaking out above them.



**Simply Good Foods** ([SMPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMPL)), the [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch company](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-simply-good-foods-tops-buy-point-as-earnings-approach/), closed slightly higher but just below its 41.45 buy point. Volume was about 35% above average ahead of next week's earnings report.


Wireless tower owner **Crown Castle International** ([CCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCI)) closed above the 204.72 buy point, but volume was about half its normal amount.


Still, take heart, because of more than 40 stocks in [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s list of recent breakouts, nearly all remain above their buy points.


December Stock Market Gains
---------------------------


While the S&P 500 climbed to record highs this week and indexes are rallying, the December gains have come largely on the back of cautious investors investing defensively. It seems to belie the bullish tone of the major indexes.


The S&P health care, consumer staples and real estate sectors are up more than 8% this month, leading the eight others. To be sure, health care is partly a growth sector and partly a Covid play.


Utilities, another defensive sector, is up nearly 8%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. In fact, consumer staples' nearly 9% gain is the best since October 2000. Technology is up 4.5% this month, prior to Tuesday's close, although near highs. And consumer discretionary is up just 0.3%.

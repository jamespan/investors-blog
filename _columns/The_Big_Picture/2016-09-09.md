U.S. stock indexes suffered their biggest losses in two and half months Friday, as rate talk scattered the uncertain and unhinged the bulls.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each lost 2.5%, while the small cap S&P 600 shed 3%. The IBD 50 dropped 3.2%.

From tech plays to [dividend stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/market-sell-off-casts-wide-net-includes-dividend-names/), there was no shelter. The Dow Jones utility average dropped 3.8%, while the Philadelphia semiconductor index chopped off 3.7%.


Declining issues led advancers by a roughly 15-1 ratio on the NYSE and 6-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Meanwhile, the distribution day count rose to seven for the S&P 500 and four for the Nasdaq. The uptrend is back under pressure after only three days in the clear.


What should the individual investor do in this atmosphere?


A week ago, the Big Picture emphasized profit-taking because [the dullness of the market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-post-ho-hum-gains-market-like-watching-paint-dry/) masked distribution. If an individual investor heeded IBD's profit-taking and loss cutting rules, some of Friday pain may have been avoided.


Yet, even if an investor was slow to take action, there's no shame in lightening up now.


Defense is job No. 1. The market is not yet in correction, but a quick ugly turnabout has undermined conviction.


Could the market do a U-turn now and surge to new highs? While that's hard to imagine, anything is possible.


One bullish [psychological factor](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) was the 1.14 reading in the put/call ratio, a level that sometimes suggests a short-term bottom. But a bearishÂ factor Friday, that suggested difficult days may be ahead, was the blindness of the selling.


If hints at a rate hike from Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan drove the selling, then bank stocks should've gained ground. Banks generally benefit from higher interest rates, and the bank stocks had been rising on rumors of higher rates. But banks lost ground Friday.


It's possible that other factors could be influencing the market. For example, the market faces a challenging task in pricing in the November presidential election. The uncertainty this time isn't just the outcome but the two major party candidates themselves.


If so, that is one more reason to be cautious.


For the week, the IBD 50 severed 3.2%, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sliced off 2.4% each. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average cut 2.2%.

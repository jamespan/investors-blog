Stocks Rise Sharply As Leadership Broadens
===========================================

The stock market rose sharply Tuesday as it continued to solidify its gleaming new uptrend.

  

The Nasdaq gapped up and closed with a 1.7% surge. It was its best day since the 2.4% rally a week earlier, which resulted in a follow-through that confirmed the new uptrend.

  

The S&P 500 added 1.2%. Both main indexes closed at session highs. Volume rose, which gave the day's winnings another positive characteristic.

  

The Nasdaq's rally would have been good enough for a follow-through, had the market still been looking for that bottoming signal. As it was, the burst served as a sort of booster shot.

  

Small caps roared as the Russell 2000 climbed 2.9%, its largest single-day gain of the year. Because the Russell 2000 is a proxy for the more dynamic parts of the market, its outperformance can be considered a plus for the broad market.

  

Breadth was solid, with winners topping losers by a 5-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and better than 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

  

Indeed, the major indexes are rebounding as fast as they plunged. As they recover, they are reclaiming technical signposts that had been lost during the sell-off.

  

First, it was the 200-day moving average. On Tuesday, it was the 50-day line: The S&P 500 vaulted back above that key level, while the Nasdaq made a decisive move above its own 50-day line.

  

If there is a blemish on the market's V-shaped recovery, it is that volume hasn't picked up as much as it did when the indexes were sinking.

  

That explains why the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the major indexes are still weak. But it doesn't necessarily leave the market on wobbly legs. Upside volume also didn't compare all that favorably when the indexes came off their lows in February, April and August.

  

More important right now is the fact that so many leading stocks are breaking out and that those breakouts are bearing fruit.

  

A smattering of breakouts in the medical sector got the market going initially. Now, the leadership has broadened, with stocks in technology, finance, autos, homebuilding and other sectors pollinating the market.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **AmTrust Financial** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)), **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)), **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)), **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)), **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) are part of the new breed of leaders.

  

A number of real estate investment trusts also have broken out.

  

There's also a good pipeline of potential breakouts, with many stocks in the IBD 50 and other screens that are still forming bases. The IBD 50 jumped 1.8% Tuesday, as it too hurdled over the 50-day moving average.

  

More than 300 stocks made new highs Tuesday â€” much more than in recent days.

  

A critical event for the market will come Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve makes its latest policy statement. Wall Street will be looking for details on the interest-rate outlook.

  

The central bank is due to end its bond-purchasing stimulus program, known as QE3.

  

Nearly two weeks ago, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard suggested extending QE3. That headline helped bring indexes off their lows.

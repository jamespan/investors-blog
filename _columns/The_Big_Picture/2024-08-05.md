Bears attacked again Monday, causing stocks to plunge around the globe and spurring a change in IBD's recommended stock market exposure. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was among tech names mauled after legendary investor Warren Buffett slashed **Berkshire Hathaway**'s ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) holdings in the firm.




The U.S. market was the last domino to fall amid a global sell-off that saw the Japanese Topix index suffer its worst day since Black Monday in October 1987. It wiped out all its gains for the year amid a 12.2% decline. The Nikkei 225 index fell 12.4%.


Things were not quite so bad in the U.S., but Wall Street was awash with red ink nevertheless. The Nasdaq composite dived 3.4%, causing it to lose more ground on its 50-day line. But the fact it found support at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-200-day-moving-average/) will give some encouragement to the bulls. It now sits more than 13% below its July 11 high. The tech-heavy composite is now up less than 8% in 2024 as once-hefty gains continue to shrink.


The S&P 500 suffered its worst day since June 14, 2022, as it plunged 3%. It suffered its second gap down in succession and now sits 5.1% below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The benchmark index has already fallen 6.1% in August but retains a solid year-to-date gain of nearly 9%.


Decliners led advancers by around 13-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and more than 6-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume ran higher on both main indexes, further underlining the negative action.


Apple Crushed On Buffett Move
-----------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average may have performed better than the other major indexes, but it still got walloped. It undercut the 50-day line as it dived 1,034 points, or 2.6%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP080524-243x300.jpg)Not a single Dow component ended in positive territory. Apple was among the worst performers as it fell 4.8%, though it finished well off lows, amid the news Buffett's Berkshire had slashed its Apple holdings by roughly 50%. This was its worst day since Sept. 29, 2022. **Intel**'s ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) sell-off also continued, the chip giant diving 6.4%. Berkshire itself, which is not a Dow Jones component, fell 3.4% despite an earnings beat.


Bears gave small caps a painful beatdown, too. The Russell 2000 ended the day down 3.3% after getting support at the 200-day line. Growth stocks also suffered, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund falling 2%. It is lagging all its moving averages and is now nearly flat for the year.


In fact, there was nowhere for stock market investors to hide amid Monday's carnage, with the midcap S&P 400 index tumbling 2.7%. It ended off lows after testing its 200-day line.


Monday's sharply negative action, which came after already painful drawdowns, means Investor's Business Daily is once again reducing its recommended market exposure. It has now been set to the 0%-to-20% range.


It is advisable to continue to pare back positions in a measured fashion. Locking in profits in stocks that have rallied more than 20% above entries and jettisoning any issues that are flashing sell signals should take priority.


Fed's Goolsbee Speaks Out; ISM Reading Cools Fears
--------------------------------------------------


Underlining the pessimism on Monday was the performance of the [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), which is seen as a psychological indicator of fear in the markets. The gauge, which serves as a measure of the S&P 500's future volatility, ended the session up 64.9%. At one point it had risen as much as 181% – the biggest intraday increase in history. It was also the highest level since the 2020 Covid bear market.


With fears growing that the Federal Reserve may have made a policy mistake by holding rates steady too long, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee made a surprise [appearance on CNBC Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/chicago-fed-president-goolsbee-says-if-economy-deteriorates-fed-will-fix-it.html).


He reiterated that the Fed is focused on maximizing employment, stabilizing prices and maintaining financial stability. He said that if there is any deterioration in conditions that they are "going to fix it."


Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management's service index offered some crumbs of comfort for worried stock market investors. It showed the economy is still growing, jumping to 51.4% in July from 48.8% in June. This was better than expected. A 50 reading is considered neutral.


Economic data is sparse on Tuesday, which may help soothe skittish traders. U.S. trade deficit data for June will be the main data point, with economists expecting a reading of minus $72.5 billion.


Nvidia Hurts This Stock Market Group
------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors all ended red Monday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). In fact, it was the first time since Nov. 2, 2022, that all 11 sector lost more than 1%. Technology, communication services and consumer discretionary were down the most. Industrials held up the best, but still fell sharply.



Once again, the relative performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups served as a useful alternative perspective [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Media periodicals, cable stocks, chip equipment plays, blank check finance stocks and travel booking firms were among the few areas of strength. Each of these managed to close in positive territory.


In contrast, database software firms, drugstores, electronic consumer electronics plays and tire stocks were among the worst performers on the stock market today.


Fabless chip stocks also struggled. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) dived 6.4% [amid reports the firm is delaying its next-generation Blackwell artificial intelligence chips](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-delays-blackwell-ai-chip/) by at least three months.


Nvidia is a member of the [prestigious IBD Leaderboard list](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) of top stocks, but the position is hedged.

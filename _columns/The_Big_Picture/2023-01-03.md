Investors could not rid themselves of 2022's lingering stench Tuesday as the new year started on Wall Street with a bearish price reversal and the energy sector getting drilled.




The stock market opened 2023 decently higher but soon reversed lower. An afternoon rebound trimmed losses to less than 1%.


The Nasdaq composite wiped out a 1.4% early gain and closed 0.8% lower. In a bit of a respite, heavyweight stocks **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) climbed between 1% and nearly 5%.


The S&P 500 closed with a 0.4% drop. The index remains below its 50-day moving average and met resistance at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up much better, down only a fraction. Yet, the index continued to struggle with its 21-day and 50-day lines.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP010323-236x300.jpg)The IBD 50 index, which lost nearly 45% in 2022, fell 0.9% Tuesday.


Volume jumped on the NYSE and Nasdaq from last week's sleepy holiday levels. At the same time, breadth indicated that selling was concentrated in certain parts of the stock market. In fact, advancing stocks topped decliners by a 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by 6-5 on the Nasdaq.


Apple — still the market's biggest stock — fell 3.7% in a bearish reversal that suggests further downside ahead. A report said the company [cut MacBook, Apple Watch and AirPod orders](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-falls-amid-report-of-product-orders-being-cut-in-asia/) from Asian suppliers.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) did the most damage to the S&P 500. Shares of the electric vehicle company skidded more than 12% after Q4 delivery figures missed expectations. A few analysts cut their price targets, contributing to the steepest decline since Sept. 8, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Energy Sector Does Most Damage To Stock Market
----------------------------------------------


But selling was most acute in the energy sector.


Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) plunged 3.5%, dropping near December lows. It was by far the worst performance among the 11 S&P sector ETFs.


FactSet data shows **APA** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)), **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)), **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) and **EQT** ([EQT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQT)) also hurting the S&P 500. **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), which has been forming a base, stumbled more than 4%.



Several energy sector leaders took serious hits.


**ProFrac** ([ACDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACDC)) plummeted 15%, spoiling a cup base. **Texas Pacific Land** ([TPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPL)), which sells and leases land and retains oil and gas royalties, swooned more than 10% to the lowest close since Oct. 25. Coal producer **Peabody Energy** ([BTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BTU)) fell to its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). **Equinor** ([EQNR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQNR)) gapped down 9%, setting back its [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Take those severe declines as a sign of stress and profit-taking in the sector after 2022's leadership performance.


Some industrial stocks also got rolled over. For example, Steelmaker **Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)) sank nearly 5% below the 35.15 entry of its latest breakout.


Two Stocks Top Buy Points
-------------------------


Two highly rated stocks popped up on [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) breakout screens.


**ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) could not hold above the 57.02 buy point of a flat base, as might be expected in a stock market correction. Volume was weak, too.


**Sterling Infrastructure** ([STRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRL)) also closed below its 33.72 buy point, after surrendering most of a 6% rally. It's important to remember that breakouts have a tendency to disappoint during stock market corrections. Still, Sterling is one to watch because it is part of an infrastructure theme that some analysts expect to be [among the market's strongest performers this year](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-2023-challenges-abound-for-sp500-dow-jones-stock-pickers-can-shine/).

Stock Market Watching Economic Data
-----------------------------------


Early Tuesday, the revised S&P Global Purchasing Manager's Index manufacturing report said PMI fell to 46.2 in December from 47.7 in November, which matched the earlier estimate. New orders fell at the fastest rate on record, dating back to May 2007. Economic uncertainly and inflation led to lower purchasing power among customers, S&P Global said.


The first week of the year will bring several watch-worthy economic reports.


Minutes of the Fed's December meeting come out at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday. The first in a flood of labor-market data will also start that day, with the morning release of the job-openings data for November.


On Thursday, weekly jobless claims and the ADP employment survey for December will be released. The ADP report is a precursor to Friday's December nonfarm payrolls report from the Labor Department. According to FactSet surveys, economists expect 210,000 nonfarm jobs, down from 263,000 in November.


Next week, the stock market faces potential volatility as fourth-quarter earnings season starts.


Reports from **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) and others will offer the first glimpse into the year-end.

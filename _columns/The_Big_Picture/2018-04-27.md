Stock Market Runs Into Resistance At 50-Day Line
=================================================

Bulls started the week hoping U.S. stocks would become more earnings driven, but the market only downplayed earnings while developing resistance at its 50-day moving averages.




The Nasdaq on Friday closed with a less than 0.1% gain, after being up 1.1% in the first few minutes of trade. The S&P 500 added 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average was down less than 0.1%.


Volume fell across the board.


The Nasdaq's nasty reversal was a perfect reflection of the market's recent difficulties.


In the prior week, bank stocks had gained little despite strong quarterly reports. Earnings-related price pops dissolved quickly.

The problem wasn't just banks. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) on Tuesday delivered a huge earnings beat but could not find momentum. The stock rose 4.6% in the first 40 minutes of Tuesday's session but then reversed to a 6.2% loss.


Yet Thursday, hope emerged that earnings might finally get their due. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) vaulted 9% after crushing views.


In after-hours trade, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rose 7% and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) 8%.


Both stocks were reacting to strong quarterly results, released after the close.


Yet, Friday's session dampened the bullish mood.


Amazon and Intel staged ugly reversals.


Amazon gapped up 7.9% but then retreated to a 3.6% gain. Intel rose 5.1% and then erased everything to close with a 0.6% loss.


Once again, earnings failed to define the market.


That's a shame because Q1 is shaping up as a strong season for earnings. The problem is the market's reaction. The market is having commitment problems. Quick gains are regarded only as sell opportunities.


What is troubling the market? Uncertainty surrounds at least four items.


* Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to depart for China in the coming week. President Trump is hoping for a trade deal.
* The 10-year yield is at 2.96%. The 2-year is at 2.48%. See this week's cover story for [what the narrowing Treasury yield spread](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/10-year-treasury-yield-fed-interest-rates/) means.
* Dodd-Frank is still twisting in the wind. On Thursday, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, said he'd drop his insistence on amending the Senate bill. In return, he wants the Senate to agree on other measures.
* North and South Korea leaders met Friday. While skepticism abounds, at least the bellicose rhetoric has vanished.

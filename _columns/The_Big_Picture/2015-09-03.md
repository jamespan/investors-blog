Stock indexes popped higher in the first 90 minutes of trade Thursday and then stepped down steadily to a weak finish. The Nasdaq lost 0.3% after being up 1.1%, while the S&P 500 pegged a 0.1% gain. The IBD 50 fell 0.7%. Volume fell across the board.

  

The day's negative reversal was a reminder that this market is in correction. It's acting like it, too: up moves in weaker volume, down moves in stronger volume.

  

With the market in correction, individual investors should stay on the sidelines and wait for a confirmation of a new uptrend.

  

As the investor waits, he or she should become aware of group strength, possible rotation and group weakness.

  

Strength is seen in groups that haven't budged from high rankings in the past three to six weeks. As of Monday's IBD, they include hospitals, apparel and shoes, and Internet retail.

  

Possible rotation is hinted at in groups that have improved their rating sharply in the past three to six weeks. They include homebuilders, up 35 places in three weeks and 66 places in six weeks; food preparation, up 32 and 66 places in the same periods; and auto parts, up 36 and 45 places.

  

Weakness is found at the bottom of the 197 industry groups. The laggards include mostly commodity-tied groups. Stay away from the laggards, even if the market turns.

  

Breakouts were scarce Thursday, though **B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS)) cleared a 32.77 entry with a 12% gap up in torrid volume. The leap came on news that B&G will buy Green Giant frozen foods and Le Sueur canned vegetables from **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)).

  

Several top stocks scored new highs in above-average volume.

  

They included: **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), a homebuilder; **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)), a provider of construction and engineering services to telecoms; **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)), an Ireland-based airline; and **NCI** ([NCIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCIT)), a network engineering company, although NCI reversed lower.

  

News that Europe was considering expanding its bond-buying program gave an early boost to U.S. stocks. European indexes jumped 1% to 2%.

  

Economic reports released in the U.S. were generally favorable.

  

Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. job cuts fell 61% in August vs. July's pace. A reduction in oil-related layoffs was a key factor. The PMI Services Index and Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing data for August topped views.

  

On the negative side, first-time jobless claims were 3% worse than expected. Also, retail sales in August mostly missed views, according to Retail Metrics.

  

On Friday, the August report on nonfarm payrolls is to be released before the stock market's open. The Street's estimates range from 173,000 to 257,000, with the consensus at 223,000.

Stocks kicked off a short trading week with a bang Monday in a show of resurgence after last week's lackluster action.

  

The S&P 500 rallied 1.2% and regained its 50-day moving average. It has already recouped a little more than half of last week's 2.2% loss.

  

Helped by megacaps **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), the Nasdaq rose 1.1%. Chips and biotechs, which were hard hit in the prior week, bounced back.

  

The S&P 500 had its best day since March 18, the Nasdaq its best since March 16.

  

But blue chips outperformed, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 1.5%. Twenty-eight of its 30 issues ended higher. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were the only holdouts.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 1.4% and the IBD 50 climbed 1.3%.

  

A barrage of M&A activity (related [story](http://news.investors.com/technology/033015-745614-teva-acquiring-auspex-horizon-acquiring-hyperion.htm?ntt=Teva%2c+Horizon+See+Growth+In+Orphan-Drug+Takeovers)), as well as hope for economic stimulus in China, put the market in rally mode from start to finish.

  

In a sign of strength, the major averages never let up during the session and closed at session highs.

  

Volume, however, ended mixed from Friday's light pace. Trade grew modestly on the Nasdaq, helped by the stocks involved in Monday's merger mania, such as **Catamaran** ([CTRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRX)), **Auspex Pharmaceuticals** ([ASPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASPX)) and **Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)).

  

But trade dipped on the NYSE. Generally, it's best to see strong price action accompanied by big volume.

  

Market breadth was bullish, though. Winners beat decliners by nearly 3 to 1 on the NYSE and 2 to 1 on the Nasdaq.

  

Many leaders climbed in the IBD 50, but those up in volume were few. Only about nine of the 42 IBD 50 stocks up on the day rose in above-average trade.

  

Monday brought about a couple of breakouts in top-rated names. **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) cleared a 100.76 buy point but closed below it. **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) gave a better showing as it rallied past a 68.81 buy point in a flat base.

  

Although Monday's action was encouraging, it did little to change the overall landscape, which is still festered with distribution days.

  

There's still seven bouts of institutional selling in the Nasdaq and on the S&P 500, so investors still need to remain cautious. Keep losses short. This is not the time to load the boat with new positions.

  

The market will be closed for Good Friday.

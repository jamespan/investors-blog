Key Stock Indexes Etch New Highs; 5 Reasons Why The Stock Market May Stay Bullish In November
==============================================================================================

Key stock indexes climbed in unison, and the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 scored new all-time highs. But a stunning move by the mighty mites on Wall Street perhaps delivered Monday's most bullish surprise.




The small cap universe-tracking iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund blistered the bears with a 2.6% advance. It came tantalizingly close to taking out the March 15 closing high of 234.42. No matter; since the start of the fourth quarter, the ETF has now delivered its fifth session up 1% or more.


That compares favorably with just one day in which the popular ETF fell 1% or more over the same period — a 1.8% lambasting on Wednesday.


Midsize Is Beautiful Too
------------------------


Midcap stocks also smoked their large-cap peers, at least index-wise.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP110121-177x300.jpg)SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) soared 2.1% for the day, barreling past gains of 0.6% by the Nasdaq composite, nearly 0.3% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and almost 0.2% by the S&P 500. The midcap stock-tracking fund hit new all-time highs in each of the prior two weeks. It's now shot 8% ahead since Oct. 1.


The Nasdaq holds a quarter-to-date gain of 7.9%. That's equally respectable. Credit this gain in large part to strength in the chip, business software, automotive, retail and financial sectors of the market. The S&P 500 has advanced 7.1%.


Volume inched lower on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session. Not every up session is going to feature higher volume. But since October, institutional accumulation has been hiding in clear sight. [The daily chart of the composite index](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) highlights at least eight sessions in which it gained at least 0.5% in turnover higher than the 50-day moving average.


Headed into Monday's session, the [General Market Indicators (GMI) page](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI%20102921.pdf) revealed a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) for the Nasdaq, vs. a D+ for the S&P 500.


Those two ratings didn't change after the close.


Beyond The Stock Indexes
------------------------


The Market Pulse showcases just a small portion of leading companies that advanced in heavy turnover Monday. The [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), which is now bursting with 300 issues, paints an even bigger picture of wide-encompassing market leadership.


Of course, the two-day Federal Reserve meeting will weigh on Wall Street. Will central bankers decide to erase their $120 billion worth of monthly Treasury and mortgage-backed debt securities by the summer? Or will tapering those economy-stimulating buys be more gradual?

In the meantime, here are five additional bullish factors that, if continued, could spell further gains for top equities and key stock indexes this month:


* One, breadth is improving. One way to measure this is to compare the number of companies that rose in above-average volume for the day with those that fell in fast-paced trading. [The homepage of MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) shows 886 stocks up in volume and 117 down on Monday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq's advance-decline line looks poised to surge past its late-September peak. Last week, the NYSE's A-D line muscled to its highest level in more than a year. On Monday, winners outdistanced losers by nearly 4 to 1 on the NYSE, roughly 7 to 2 on the Nasdaq. Go to [Monday's GMI PDF page](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI110121.pdf) here for the exact numbers.
* Two, more stocks appear to be building [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). That's what you would expect when more stocks are rising than falling. IBD Live, for the past few weeks, has highlighted plenty of new emerging leaders that have jumped back above their 50- and 200-day moving averages. In many cases, these moves trigger a trendline entry point. [On Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), steelmaker **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) is a new example of such action.
* Three, economic data displays an encouraging trend of post-pandemic recovery. On Monday, stocks slumped following a new print on the ISM manufacturing survey for October. A 60.8 reading topped the [Econoday consensus view](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Reuters noted that the survey's forward-looking new orders subindex sank to 59.8, the lowest reading since June 2020. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management reported 26 commodities suffered from short supplies in October — up from 24 in September. Plus, the news agency highlighted some have been in short supply for as long 13 months in a row. Yet the stock indexes brushed off the data and plodded higher by day's end. An ISM figure above 50 denotes economic expansion. [Positive earnings news](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) during the rest of the month, particularly among commodity, tech and retail firms, could also add a tailwind for stocks.
* Four, gridlock inside the Beltway appears to be helping U.S. stocks. On Monday, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) voiced he would clearly not support an ambitious Joe Biden-proposed human infrastructure spending package that has been shaved to around $1.75 trillion. The Democrat also called upon the House of Representatives to pass the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. CNN reported that " 'holding this bill hostage' won't work in getting him to support the larger social spending and economic package."
* Five, interest rates have not resumed their feverish climb — at least yet. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note edged up 1 basis point to 1.57%. The yield hit a session high of 1.6%, Cboe data showed. That's still far below its Oct. 22 peak of 1.69%.

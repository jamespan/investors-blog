Stocks stayed in a hesitant mode Thursday, but the Nasdaq showed stalling action.

  

The Nasdaq closed up 0.1% after rising 0.6% in the morning. The S&P 500 added less than 0.1%. The IBD 50 fell 0.3%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

The action on the Nasdaq amounted to stalling, which points to distribution on an up day. The count of distribution days is not yet high enough to be a worry.

  

Although breakouts among top stocks have been missing this week, many previous breakouts continue to tack on gains, which is what a healthy uptrend does.

  

What would a survey of the breakouts since mid-October tell investors? (Bases that were third-stage or older and stocks with a Composite Rating below 90 were not included in this analysis.)

  

This is how they looked before Thursday's close. 

  

•Big winners: Six stocks triggered IBD's eight-week hold rule by rising 20% in three weeks or less from their breakouts. They are biotech **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)); Internet retailer **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)); marketing products provider **Vistaprint** ([VPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VPRT)); wood and building materials company **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)); cloud-computing security provider **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)); and maker of modules for machine-to-machine communications **Sierra Wireless** ([SWIR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWIR)).

  

•Second-tier gainers: Three stocks gained at least 10% but less than 20%. They are retailer **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) and staffing firm **Robert Half International** ([RHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHI)) .

  

•Third-tier gainers: Seven stocks gained 7% to 9%. They are tech services provider **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)); **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)); online Chinese gamer **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)); medical device developer **C.R. Bard** ([BCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCR)); **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)); **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)); and medical software provider **Cerner** ([CERN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CERN)).

  

Below the third tier are 18 stocks that have neither gained nor lost much. The group includes **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and professional network platform **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)).

  

At the very bottom are three stocks that tripped IBD's 8% sell rule: drugmaker **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)); insurer **AmTrust Financial Services** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)), which has since recovered; and drug firm **Perrigo** ([PRGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRGO)), which dropped 7.7% but would've chased most disciplined investors out.

  

Overall, the picture looks positive. The tally of 20% gainers is strong, while the failures are few.

  

However, the no-gainers and stocks still in or close to the 5% buy zone are worth watching. If funds step up and buy the slow movers, the uptrend could get renewed thrust and broader representation.

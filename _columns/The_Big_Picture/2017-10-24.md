  Meet The Stock Market's Surprising New Leader

The stock market has a new leader, and it's not one that investors are used to seeing.


The Dow Jones industrial average, which rallied 0.7% to a record high Tuesday, is suddenly the hottest index. The industrials are up 4.6% so far this month — more than double the 1.9% rise in the S&P 500 and the 1.5% increase in the Nasdaq.




Yes, the same Dow industrials that represent some of the largest and oldest companies in the U.S. are in the unfamiliar role of outperforming the technology-rich Nasdaq composite and the broad S&P 500.


On Tuesday, the Nasdaq and S&P rose less than 0.2%, back to the small changes that have characterized the indexes most of this month. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.

Several Dow components have caught fire with their latest earnings reports, a big reason why the index is so hot. On Tuesday, **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) almost single-handedly accounted for the Dow's gain after the two companies beat profit expectations and gave bullish outlooks. 3M surged nearly 6% in four times its average volume, while Caterpillar leapt 5% in six times its usual volume.


Other Dow components are doing their share, often with their earnings reports. **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) soared 9% last Wednesday; **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) solidified a breakout last week; **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) broke out Thursday; **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) is following through on its own breakout; several others are at new highs.


Tuesday's market seemed like it was centered in the Rust Belt. Strength in cyclical, industrial and materials stocks was evident in [Stocks On The Move](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?nav=ResearchSOTM). Winners on that table included **Illinois Tool Works** ([ITW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITW)), heavy truck manufacturer **Oshkosh** ([OSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSK)), **Westlake Chemical** ([WLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLK)) and **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)).


Market veterans will tell you that if the Dow is leading the market, it's a sign of a market top. There's scant evidence of that in the past 25 years or so. One time it happened was in January 1994, when the Dow about doubled the other indexes and the S&P went into a nearly 10% correction the next month.


Volatility has picked up a bit in the past week. Despite three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in the past few days, the number of higher-volume declines remains low. The losses in the Nasdaq's distribution sessions haven't been severe: Losses were no worse than 0.6%. On Thursday, the indexes reversed positively.


More indicative of the market direction these days is how long the indexes stay around new highs. It's been three weeks since the Nasdaq made a new high on Sept. 29. That's about as long as the indexes have gone before pulling back, as the indexes continue an oscillating trend this year.


In July, the composite spent seven days at new highs before it started falling on July 27. In April, the Nasdaq made a new high April 24 and kept rising for 17 days before a 2.6% sell-off on May 17. Six sessions later, it was back at new highs.


Consumer, machinery, mining, metals and telecom industry groups were among the leaders Tuesday. Health care stocks were mainly lower.


**Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) tumbled 4% in big volume and **Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)) gapped down to a 3% loss in busy turnover after both reported earnings. Biogen faces pressure in its multiple sclerosis unit, and Novartis delayed a strategic decision on its Alcon eye-care business.

  Stock Market Pulls Back Again As Outlook For Stocks Dims; Will These 11 Bullish Trends In 2024 Stretch Into 2025?

Profit-taking appeared to remain the order of the day on the stock market Monday. No major indexes escaped a wide swath of selling that hit virtually all sectors. And yet Monday's losses do not tarnish the fine gains that have accumulated in 2024.


On the penultimate day of the calendar year, the Nasdaq composite fell almost 1.2%, while the more tech-concentrated Nasdaq 100 finished off 1.3%. At one point the leading index of the stock market, the Nasdaq composite, tripped as much as 1.9% lower.




So one perhaps could strip out a tiny silver lining in the fact that it did not end at session lows. Plus, the loss by day's end would have been a lot smaller if not for some intense late-hour selling.


The S&P 500 dropped 1.1%. It had headed into Monday's session with a glittering 25.2% gain. In 2023, the S&P 500 rallied 24.2%. Also on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1%, closing below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for an eighth straight session. Its relative strength line, a measure of performance vs. the S&P 500, has faded for more than a month. The Russell 2000 declined nearly 0.8%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Breadth in the stock market was understandably negative. Losers topped winners by more than a 5-3 margin on the NYSE and 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


The loss by the S&P 500 perhaps got cushioned by some bargain-style buying in the energy sector.


Oil and gas drillers won the [daily stock market derby](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), galloping 2.9% higher. The group has been a laggard virtually all year. According to MarketSurge, even after Monday's advance the industry group still harbored a 7.5% loss for the year. Contrast that with the Nasdaq's 29.8% lift, even after Monday's battering.


Other top performers on a price-weighted basis included U.S. oil and gas producers, up 2.9%; foreign banks, up 2.1%; oil and gas field services, up 1.8%; and coal, up 1.8%.

Foreign Banks Shine In A Cloudy Session
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP123024--288x300.jpg)Among these leaders in the stock market today, just the foreign banks stand as true leaders for the year. Boosted in large part by the dramatic fiscal turnaround in Argentina and a plunge in inflation, Argentine lenders have helped the foreign banks group rise nearly 34% since Jan. 1.


**Banco BBVA Argentina** ([BBAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBAR)), a member of IBD's foreign banks group, fell 3.2% on Monday to snap a five-day winning streak. At 19.05, it still holds a marvelous cushion above the smoothly rising 50-day moving average.


Banco BBVA also has nearly doubled since shares crossed above a 10.68 handle entry on a four-month base on Aug. 30-Sept. 3. A weekly chart highlights a tripling in price since the stock bolted out of a base and a 6.37 low-priced entry in the week ended March 1. Analysts foresee earnings making a comeback in 2025, rising 19% to $1.26 a share.


Volume grew on both main exchanges vs. Friday, indicating fund managers engaged in more distribution. In its weekly market data analysis, meanwhile, Barron's highlighted that in the past week, as often seen on a seasonal basis, "the flow of cash into equity funds remained negative, with the last month's average weekly flow at negative $1.7 billion."


Just 3.43 billion shares exchanged on the NYSE, well below average. Yet the higher-than-Friday turnover signaled a penchant for taking profits rather than accumulating shares with abandon. Meanwhile, volume was well above average on the Nasdaq side, in addition to increasing sharply vs. the prior session. Therefore, as noted in the accompanying Market Pulse, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have both chalked up six [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) over a rolling 25-trading-day period.


That's elevated.

Remain Bullish, Get A Little Cautious
-------------------------------------


One could make a bullish argument and a bearish one about the stock market today. On the bullish side now, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq haven't really fallen much. Through Monday's intraday low, for instance, the S&P 500 has pulled back just 4.4% from its all-time high. As for the Nasdaq 100, the slide of 5.1% is a shade deeper.


Notice, too, how the Nasdaq 100 on Monday refused to go below its Dec. 18 post-Fed-meeting low, at least for now.


But on the bearish side, the Nasdaq composite failed to hold the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), an important technical level for active growth stock investors. Plus, the S&P 500 is now below its 50-day moving average for the third time in as many weeks. Therefore, injecting some caution into the trading environment today ahead of January, or what is typically a volatile month in the stock market, makes complete sense.


Hence, IBD reduced recommended exposure for the stock market to a range of 60%-80%, down from 80%-100%.


Action could be muted on Tuesday, the final trading day of the year, ahead of Wednesday's New Year's holiday. It will be important to see what stocks do in the first several days of 2025, before an onslaught of earnings news hits the stock market during the last two full weeks of January.


In the meantime, let's go over 11 factors that helped make 2024 a banner year for investing.


Eleven Positive Elements Of 2024
--------------------------------


One, the stock market is set to enjoy two years in a row of double-digit gains. Clearly the momentum overall remains positive. Plus, it's often been quipped that the stock market does not die of old age, Rather, as some would say, it gets murdered by the Federal Reserve. Yet we are now in the middle of a mild rate-cutting cycle.


Look back at recent history, and the late-1990s, 2012-2014 and 2019-2021 time periods give examples in which the S&P 500 registered double-digit gains in three consecutive years.


Two, thematic investing has worked well. [Artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/technology/)Â is perhaps the biggest theme now, and numerous companies have shown the revenue and earnings to back up this trade. It will be interesting to see how companies focused on artificial intelligence will behave in the first three months of 2025.


Three, the IPO market is no longer dead. [The IPO Leaders screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/?_gl=1*iqhwie*_gcl_au*NjMwMTgyMTM0LjE3Mjk4NjEzMTc.*_ga*MTE2NDI0NTk5LjE3MzUwMDgyODA.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNTU5NTc0MS4xNC4xLjE3MzU1OTU3NTAuNTEuMC4w) has shown excellent winners, such as **Astera Labs** ([ALAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALAB)) and **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)).


Four, 2024 showcased plenty of big winners with terrific fundamentals. A few show up in both the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/full) and the [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) simultaneously.


Five, the stock market often rallied amid periods of broadening stock market breadth, not thinning breadth. But certainly, the advance-decline lines have declined recently and should be observed closely.


Other 2024 Trends
-----------------


Six, accumulation has been present. The early part of November and in some sessions of December confirm active institutional buying. Headed into Monday's trade, the S&P 500 showed a solid [Accumulation/Distribution grade](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI_122724.pdf) of B on a scale of A to E. Watch to see if the Nasdaq's C+ grade, while slightly bullish, improves.


Seven, extreme optimism has died down. [Margin debt growth](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=margindebt) is certainly climbing, but it's still well below the critical 55% threshold often seen during stock market tops.


Eight, discretionary spending stocks have outperformed the staples firms. Food, beverage, cleaning product and related stocks have not led the bull run this year.


Nine, the [economic backdrop remains benign](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Some gauges of inflation are still sticky at the 2.5%-2.9% range, above the Fed's deliberate target of 2%. Yet a lot of progress has been since the spike in prices took place in 2021 to early 2022.


Ten, some observers believe productivity growth, which has come in around 2% in recent quarters, will provide a nice tailwind for equities in 2025.


Eleven, U.S. interest rates did not rush to multiyear highs in 2024. The latest upswing in the 10-year Treasury bond yield to 4.64% is certainly a concern, however, and it could be a focal point for 2025 as a new administration enters the White House. Yet since October 2023, the yield has topped 4.99%. A tighter range in interest rates could be beneficial for the stock market as corporations have a clearer picture on what it would cost to invest in capital goods, make acquisitions, and buy back their own shares.

=======================================================

The S&P 500 suffered another mild distribution day Tuesday, and semiconductor stocks weighed on the Nasdaq. But it wasn't all bad for the broad market despite another sell-off in China stocks overnight.

  

The Nasdaq fell 0.6%, the S&P 500 eased 0.3%, and the Dow gave up 0.2%. Ironically, selling wasn't intense on the S&P 500, but higher volume still resulted in its ninth distribution day. Selling was more intense on the Nasdaq, but it avoided a distribution day, leaving its count at three.

  

On the Nasdaq, declining stocks outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1. The ratio was nearly 2-to-1 on the NYSE. Waning breadth has been a yellow flag for the market for some time now.

  

Meanwhile, the S&P 500's 50-day line is fast approaching its 200-day line, indicating overall sluggish price performance for the past several weeks.

  

Perhaps nowhere is a dry-up of buying demand in the broad market more evident than in the broad-based NYSE Composite index. It's been in a downtrend since hitting a high of 11,254 in May.

  

IBD's three chip-related industry groups were among the worst-performing groups, falling 2%-3%. Be careful not to try to catch **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) suppliers like **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) on sale here. All three still look vulnerable after lengthy uptrends.

  

Strength in homebuilders buoyed the S&P 500 Tuesday.

  

One day after a survey of homebuilder sentiment showed it at a 10-year high, the Commerce Department said that July housing starts had risen to an annualized rate of 1.206 million units. That was up from the initial June estimate of 1.174 million and just above the upwardly revised figure of 1.204 million. It also was above the 1.180 million tally that economists had projected.

  

Homebuilders have emerged as a nice pocket of leadership in the market. Sector Leader **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) recently blasted out of a cup-with-handle base with a 19.23 early buy point. It formed a flat base after that and gapped up over a 20.20 buy point Aug. 5 after reporting strong earnings.

  

D.R. **Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) also have emerged in the group. D.R. Horton broke out in late July, but it's quickly become extended in price. Lennar, meanwhile, gapped up 3% Tuesday. It's still in a buy range from a 54.06 base-on-base entry. IBD's homebuilding group has rallied nearly 8% in the past eight sessions.

  

Even though the market uptrend remains under pressure, it still deserves respect. The IBD 50 held up relatively well again, falling just 0.4%. A quick scan of the IBD 50 shows plenty of healthy stocks, including large-cap names such as**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)),**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)).

  

Outside of the IBD 50, bellwethers like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) remain strong.

  

Make no mistake, though. Conditions are still challenging for growth investors. It's OK to give stocks that are working more room to work, but don't be in a rush to allocate fresh capital. The market tide isn't exactly flowing positively at the moment.

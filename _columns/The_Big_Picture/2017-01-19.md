U.S. stock indexes lost some ground Thursday, as the market padded its deficit for the week in progress.


The Nasdaq trimmed 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average each lost 0.4%. The small-cap S&P 600 stabbed 1% lower and came to rest at its 50-day moving average.


Volume declined on the NYSE but climbed on the Nasdaq. That slapped the Nasdaq with a distribution day, which points to institutional selling.


![mp011917](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP011917-243x300.png)The Nasdaq's distribution-day count is now at seven, an area of concern but also worthy of an asterisk. On Nov. 9, when IBD's Market Pulse switched the outlook from "under pressure" to "resumed uptrend," the count was seven on the Nasdaq and six on the S&P 500 — almost the same as it is now.


The market apparently can handle the heavy count, at least for the time being.


President-elect Trump will be inaugurated Friday, and his looming presence has already set a trend in certain sectors of the stock market.


So far, savings and loans and the bank sector have been the chief beneficiaries. However, they have pulled back in recent sessions.


Many quality banks are near the 10-week moving average. Can they rebound from there and stage a second leg of the run-up? If they roll over, is there a sector that can take over and lead the market higher?


A rebound in bank stocks seems more likely than new leadership, and that presumes the market's next move is up. The market, unable to find clear direction, could just as easily correct.


Companies continue to report fourth-quarter results, and that could be the deal maker or breaker more than politics.


Inauguration Day itself historically has little effect on the stock market. Price and volume action varied quite a bit in different inauguration days, even among those presidents who represented a change from the predecessor.


Still, Trump poses a problem for the stock market because of his unpredictability. The S&P 500 appeared to cheer his victory for about five weeks and then settled into a sideways pattern.


Action in the Nasdaq has skipped the sideways stuff, preferring an ascent interrupted by brief, speed-bumplike dips.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Can this top stock extend its ['Trump bump'](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/can-this-top-stock-extend-its-trump-bump-gains/) gains?*

One oddity that investors might ponder is Wednesday's 1.18 reading in the put-call volume ratio. Usually a high level like that occurs around a short-term market bottom.


The last readings at 1.15 or higher occurred from Oct. 28 to Nov. 8 — sandwiched around the Nasdaq's Nov. 4 low. In other words, the put-call accurately pegged a bottom.


But Wednesday's reading of 1.18 occurred near a market high. This is very strange.


Rather than try to force meaning from this peculiarity, individual investors should stay watchful and flexible, ready to adjust strategies as needed.


Meanwhile the two dozen or so bank stocks in the Big Cap 20 were mostly down, though in quiet trade.


**Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) lost 1% in moderately higher volume. But the money-center bank is one of the few bank stocks that have kept to sideways action. Morgan Stanley has not undercut the low of its nearly six-week pattern. Most other major banks have cut under the recent low within their consolidations.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims came in at about 8% fewer than expected. Housing starts for December inched above the Street's consensus estimate while permits missed. The Philadelphia Fed's outlook survey trounced expectations — about 48% higher than expected.


The European Central Bank left interest rates and its quantitative easing unchanged.


Friday will be a quiet day for economic data. The Baker-Hughes oil rig count will be released, but little else.

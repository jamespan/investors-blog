The energy sector led the stock market lower Tuesday, but indexes continued their mild behavior, showing little fear or froth.

NYSE volume also was higher, which gave the S&P a new [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). It still left the indexes with a manageable load of distribution over the past five weeks.


Losing stocks led winners by nearly 2-to-1 across the board.


Small caps and transportation stocks suffered more. The Russell 2000 closed 0.6% lower, and the Dow transports tumbled 1.4%. Airlines were the main brake on transports. A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast forced the cancellation of thousands of flights, complicating matters for an industry that's seeing some performance metrics slack off.


Indexes held within a trend of moderate price changes. For months, the indexes have lacked velocity; even big headlines fail to move trading desks. Nothing much can cheer the market, it seems. On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.4%, a limp response to a bullish job-growth report for February.


In such a placid market, it's hard for stocks to make big gains. That helps explain why so many breakouts among leading stocks have stalled.


On Wednesday, the market gets a new chance to make a move. The Fed will end a policy meeting, and an increase in the fed funds rate would come as no surprise. Odds of a quarter-point hike are more than 90%.


"Amid speculation of an interest rate increase from the Fed on Wednesday, the 3-month and 6-month bills are at their highest intraday and closing points since October 2008 and November 2008, respectively," said Tradeweb, a provider of fixed-income, derivatives and ETF marketplaces. "The 2-year note remains at its highest closing level since June 2009." Short-term yields are more sensitive to changes in the fed funds rate.


With the first of three expected hikes occurring sooner than many expected some weeks ago, the tone of the Fed's policy statement may indicate whether the Fed sees more work to do, said Robert Keiser, deputy chief investment officer at S&P Global Market Intelligence's Investor Advisory Services.


The bull market this month marked its eighth anniversary, and it is now the second longest since World War II, according to LPL Financial. That alone can make stock investors cautious.


Despite its age, the bull market has kept itself spry by rotating leadership. This year, financials, building materials, semiconductors and aerospace have provided horsepower at various times. But with relatively few breakouts working among the dozens that have occurred this year, investors need to be excellent stock-pickers.


 It's not an easy task but one that is much easier by filtering the best growth companies. Investors would find good choices in the IBD 50, Stock Spotlight and other IBD screens. **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) and **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) were a few in the IBD 50 in January, while they were still basing or in buy range.
In Wednesday's market, the energy sector was weakest after the price of crude continued to drop. U.S. crude closed 1.4% lower to $47.72 a barrel, the lowest since November. News that Saudi Arabia raised its production last month fanned worries of oversupply.


But the retail sector, which has been a drag on the market, was a leader Tuesday. Home furnishing, consumer electronics, discount and department stores were in the top 20 of 197 groups.


Among leading stocks, several fell in heavy trading.


 **II-VI** ([IIVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIVI)) slid below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. That triggered a sell signal for the electronics maker, which has now erased practically all gains from a breakout at 32.55 on Jan. 24.

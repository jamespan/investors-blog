Stock Market Mixed After Inflation Data As Treasury Yields Dive; These 2 Solar Breakouts Fail
==============================================================================================

The stock market ended mixed Thursday after more inflation data displayed a continuing trend of easing price pressures. The 10-year Treasury yield dived to its lowest level since September. Up next, the pivotal November jobs report is due out Friday morning.




In other notable action, recent breakouts include **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **Lattice Semiconductor** ([LSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSCC)), while [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) is rapidly approaching a new buy point. However, top solar stocks **Array Technologies** ([ARRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRY)) and **Shoals Technologies** ([SHLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHLS)) triggered sell signals.


Inflation Data, Jobless Claims
------------------------------


The Commerce Department's PCE Price Index, the [Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/key-fed-inflation-rate-eases-as-powell-shifts-goalposts-dow-jones/), came out Thursday. The index showed a 0.3% rise for the month of October, cooler than estimates, making a 6.0% year-over-year increase, which was in line with estimates. Personal income climbed 0.7% in October, topping the 0.4% Econoday estimate.


The PCE price index tracks the change in prices of goods and services purchased by consumers throughout the economy.


Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims from the Labor Department fell to 225,000 vs. 240,000 in the previous week. Economists expected claims to inch lower to 238,000.


Amid cooling inflation pressures, the 10-year Treasury yield dived to 3.52% Thursday, to its lowest level since Sept. 21. Meanwhile, investors place an 82% chance of a 50-basis-point rate hike at this month's Federal Reserve meeting, according to the [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html).

Earnings Reports: Five Below Surges, Salesforce Plunges
-------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP120122-249x300.jpg)Earnings reports Thursday included **Box** ([BOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOX)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) and Dow Jones software stock **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).


[BOX stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/box-stock-wavers-on-third-quarter-earnings/) jumped 6.5%, coming just shy of a cup-with-handle's 29.57 buy point. Five Below shares surged more than 16%, hitting the [20%-25% profit zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) from a 149.99 buy point. It's important to take at least some profits on the way up to offset some inevitable breakout failures. [Pure Storage rallied](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pstg-stock-wavers-on-third-quarter-earnings/) 3.6%, rebounding from support at the 50-day line.


On the downside, Dollar General shares dived 7.5%, breaking below the 50- and 200-day lines. [Salesforce](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-earnings-salesforce-stock-news-q32022/) plunged more than 8%, ending below its 50-day line and near its 52-week low.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.6%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.3%.


Volume fell sharply on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, and was also lower on the NYSE. Two [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq dropped off the overall count Thursday. The Oct. 26 distribution expired due to time (it's now older than 25 sessions), while the Nov. 28 distribution day is no longer relevant because the Nasdaq climbed more than 5% from that session's closing price. There is now just one day of institutional selling on both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes.


Also on the plus side, the S&P 500 is near its highest level since Sept. 12, but the Nasdaq has yet to clear its Nov. 15 high despite Wednesday's strength.


With the latest signals, investors should be cautiously optimistic about the current stock market uptrend, yet there is ample reason to remain on the conservative side. Some recent breakouts are making progress, like **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)). On the downside, market leaders Array Technologies and Shoals Technologies triggered sell rules, as their breakouts failed.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) moved down 1.4% Thursday, as the ETF of top growth stocks struggles to decisively retake its 50-day line. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Comstock Resources** ([CRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRK)) tumbled 5%, while **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) declined 4.2%.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Celsius, KLA, Lattice
----------------------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock and [IBD 50 name](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-energy-drink-stock-celsius-soars-on-pepsi-martial-arts-partnerships/) Celsius is rapidly nearing a cup base's 118.29 buy point, and is just 4% away from the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit a new high Thursday. Investors should take particular note of stocks whose RS lines are at new highs ahead of the stock price's new high.


Celsius' products include sparkling and nonalcoholic beverages and powder packets, all under the Celsius brand. It also sells Celsius Heat, which provides amino acid supplements for pre- and post-workout.


[New IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) KLA finished Thursday just below a cup-with-handle's 392.60 buy point following Wednesday's breakout. The 5% buy area will go up to 412.23 if the stock is able to regain its entry.


KLA supplies advanced process control and yield management systems for makers of semiconductors, flat panel displays and other electronics. Electronic chips are made from ultrathin silicon wafers. And the company holds a 60%-plus share of the wafer inspection and defect review market.


Lattice is in buy range past a 70.25 buy point despite Thursday's 2.4% decline. The 5% buy zone goes up to 73.76. Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), LSCC stock boasts a strong 97 IBD Composite Rating.



Solar Stock Leaders Break Down, Trigger Sell Signals
----------------------------------------------------


Solar leader and IPO stock Array Technologies hit the [7%-8% loss trigger](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) below its 22.40 buy point in a cup with handle during the stock's recent losses, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Clearly, the stock's breakout attempt is not working, and investors should act accordingly.


Shoals Technologies plunged more than 19% Thursday after the company said it is launching a public offering for 20 million shares. [Shoals also said](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/11/30/2565437/0/en/Shoals-Technologies-Group-Inc-Announces-CEO-Succession-Plan.html) that Chief Executive Jason Whitaker will step down in early 2023 due to health reasons.


A Nov. 15 breakout past a 28.57 buy point initially showed tremendous promise, as shares quickly rallied as much as 13.5% past the entry in just a few days. But those gains quickly dissipated over the next few sessions, which triggered the [round-trip sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-winning-stock-plummets-round-trip-sell-rule/). According to this rule, investors should sell the stock if it falls back near the buy point after it has made a gain of more than 10%. Try to sell before all gains are wiped away.


Lastly, Shoals stock triggered the 7%-8% loss rule from a 28.57 buy point. Investors should definitively be out of the stock by now. This type of weakness shouldn't be ignored.

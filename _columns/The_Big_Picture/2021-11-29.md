title: Stocks Today Rally After Omicron Shock, But Breadth Mixed; Nasdaq Shows These Bullish Factors

Stocks today reflected, if you will, an old-style, less-than-sweet fruitcake of responses to the latest variant of coronavirus that whacked equities all around the world on Friday.




Judging by how the major indexes did, regular readers of this column could easily see that fund managers showed more optimism for large and megacap names. They favored technology, some cyclical, and a smidgen of dividend-paying utility sectors. But they also showed a salty view toward other areas of the market.


It will take at least a few weeks for leading makers of coronavirus vaccines to fully understand the new South Africa-born omicron expression of Covid-19. But institutions did not waste time in re-accumulating shares in some of the biggest medical and biotech players that led the market in 2020.


A few, including **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) and **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), got space in the accompanying Market Pulse table.

BioNTech's 99 Relative Strength Rating underscores a 191% gain over the past 12 months.


Plus, BNTX and MRNA have both returned to above their 50-day moving averages. Their [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://bit.ly/3gxEv8u) has jumped above the neutral grade of C.


Stocks Today: Mixed Rebound
---------------------------


Monday clearly failed to show a united front among stocks and indexes.


The Nasdaq composite powered 1.9% higher and closed roughly 50 points below its session high. The tech-fortified index also took back quite a large chunk of its sharp losses during Friday's half-day session.


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund did even better, up almost 2.2%. At 399.69, QQQ sits just 2.2% below its all-time high set exactly a week ago.


The S&P 500 rallied 1.3%, even after slipping some in the final 30 minutes of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, hurt by losses of 2 points or more by components **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), gained almost 0.7%. But a reversal from decent early gains by iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) to a fractional loss disappointed.


Small Caps Slip
---------------



Notice on a daily chart how IWM is finding banana peels on its feet at the long-term 200-day moving average. The 200-day line, according to a MarketSmith chart, is currently at 224.54.


Midcap stocks also failed to hold moderate intraday gains; SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) edged up just 0.1%. Global equities, meanwhile, also showed mixed action. The FTSE 100 rebounded 0.9%. But overnight, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong fell nearly 1%.


Earlier in the year, value stocks and cyclicals drew a lot of attention. The NYSE seemed to show more market strength in terms of breadth. That is, in 2021, one could feel more comfortable about making money in non-tech stocks as more of these issues rose than fell.


Not true any longer.


While preliminary data showed winners beating losers on the NYSE by a decent 4-3 margin, IBD's industry groups analysis reveals plenty of industry groups sinking hard on Monday. You can see the changes at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). Meanwhile, on MarketSmith, the NYSE's advance-decline line has shown a steady drop for at least two straight weeks.


Steel, farm equipment, gaming, oil and gas transport and many more industry groups fell 1.5% or more Monday.


Go to a daily chart and type in "GMIAA." All Big Picture readers can also view both the Nasdaq and NYSE advance-decline lines within the large daily charts on the General Market Indicators PDF page.

Bullish Factors In The Nasdaq
-----------------------------


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite has done a good job of reducing the huge underperformance it suffered against the 500 earlier this year. As noted earlier, the Nasdaq itself, helped in big part by its FAANG members, trades quite close to recent all-time highs. Breakouts in many tech leaders this year proved fruitful.



Looking at the IBD 50, which contains a healthy mix of both Nasdaq and NYSE stocks, on Monday no fewer than 20 companies rallied 3% or more. Four fell 3% or more. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF, which has an overweighting in certain members of the list, rose 1.6%.


However, the weakened moves by former tech leaders **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) point out the importance of having solid sell rules to defend profits and keep losses short â€” even when such stocks today belong to a leading sector or industry group.

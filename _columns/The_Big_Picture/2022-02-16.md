When the stock market is so volatile that you don't know what to expect the next day or even the next hour to bring, it's better to wait for calmer trading.




Indexes on Wednesday continued a pattern of wide price swings. It's a good reason why [IBD's market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains "uptrend under pressure." It says investing in stocks right now needs to be limited and expectations should be tempered.


But in the short term, the market signals offer some hope. In the final two hours of trading Wednesday, the S&P 500 wiped out a 0.9% loss and closed 0.1% higher. For the second day in a row, the index's reversal came with support around the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/), a ledge of sorts for this uncertain market.


The Nasdaq composite also made a positive price reversal, though it closed with a 0.1% loss. The 14,000 level is demonstrating some support. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was nearly a mirror image of the Nasdaq, and closed 0.2% lower.

Market Likes Fed Minutes
------------------------


The market started rebounding at 2 p.m. ET, exactly when the minutes of the January Fed meeting came out.


Fed policymakers "suggested that [a faster pace of increases in the target range for the federal-funds rate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-eyes-potential-for-faster-rate-increases-to-ease-inflation-11645038761?mod=hp_lead_pos1) than in the post-2015 period would likely be warranted," the minutes read. That three-year tightening period unfolded at a gradual pace. The minutes also showed the Fed eager to aggressively trim its asset portfolio as inflation continues to run hot.


Yet, the minutes did not have bad surprises for the stock market.


While investors are more convinced that aggressive policy tightening is on the horizon, "the Fed minutes did indicate a faster pace of tightening relative to the last hiking cycle is warranted," Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in a commentary. "On balance, there was nothing in the minutes that suggested the Fed would be more aggressive than what the market has already priced in."


With the stock market seeing a more hawkish Fed, the minutes come off dovish, noted Jason England, global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. Job gains and inflation will guide its policy.


"This sets up the March meeting as an appropriate time to begin raising rates," England said. "However, there was no discussion around a 50 bps hike that many have priced into the market, so although it may still be on the table, that is not our base case."


Ukraine Still A Worry, But Watch For Bullish Stock Market Signs
---------------------------------------------------------------


On Monday, when worries of a Russian invasion of Ukraine ran high, [gauges of investor fear reached elevated levels](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-wavers-as-it-watches-ukraine-crisis-fed-moves-this-signal-says-stocks-may-bottom/). Those can be interpreted to be market bottoming signals, and so far the market is bouncing back.


Still, the market needs to show more than just a couple of good days to convince investors that its direction is upward. So, what bullish signs should IBD readers watch for?


First, leading stocks have to demonstrate more strength. A great many are still [forming bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Some breakouts are showing hesitation.


The IBD 50 outperformed the stock market with a 0.6% increase.


Stock Market Could Remain Volatile
----------------------------------


Investors should not expect volatility to fade anytime soon. Besides interest rates, Wall Street is worried about possible war in Europe.


Wednesday, a day that U.S. officials believed would launch a Russian military push into Ukraine, came and went without an attack. Western officials said [Russia is continuing its military buildup around Ukraine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-says-troops-withdraw-from-crimea-but-u-s-warns-ukraine-invasion-still-possible-11645007072?mod=trending_now_news_5), despite pronouncements from Moscow that it had begun withdrawing troops.



Solid Quarterly Reports: Another Key Factor To Watch
----------------------------------------------------


On the earnings front, tech results were mainly positive after Wednesday's close.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) fell modestly in after-hours trading. The chip designer [beat fourth-quarter expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-chipmaker-beats-fourth-quarter-targets/).


But **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) jumped more than 4% in extended trading after [January-quarter results topped views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-stock-rises-on-earnings-beat-in-line-revenue-outlook-share-buyback/). And **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) climbed nearly 4% after the close on the chip equipment maker's quarterly results, which [topped expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amat-stock-applied-materials-tops-first-quarter-goals/).

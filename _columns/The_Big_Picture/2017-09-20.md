Let the Fed's Great Unwinding begin.


Tech stocks teetered on Wednesday, even before the Federal Reserve announced its latest thinking on interest rates and how it would reduce its massive piles of government debt and mortgage-backed securities, but the rest of the market didn't totter.


Key indexes shaved their modest losses by day's end, while a few sector indexes scored robust gains.




The Nasdaq composite U-turned sharply in the final 90 minutes of trading, reducing a 0.7% intraday drop to less than 0.1%. The S&P 500, however, eked out a small gain to extend its win streak to four sessions and score a fourth straight closing high.


 


Volume grew on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The nice bounce off intraday lows in stronger turnover flashed yet another sign of general support for equities.

Apple has now given back mild gains past a 156.75 flat-base buy point.


Both of these two chip firms supply critical circuits to the iPhone marketer. Judging by the sharp declines by all three of the above stocks, it appeared that, at least to a small degree, institutional money moved away from tech and into other sectors including banking, energy, autos and transport.


On the enterprise and desktop software front, **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) gapped down and dropped more than 4% to 149.92 in a sort of "buy the rumor, sell the news" pattern after the digital marketing giant scored another solid quarter of growth (EPS up 47%, revenue up 26% to $1.84 billion).



Was it a sell signal? In one way, yes, since the decline came in the heaviest volume since a Jan. 19 breakout past a 111.19 buy point in a flat base. Plus, the stock closed below its 50-day moving average. However, investors with a large profit cushion can afford the luxury of time to see if institutions bolster their support of the stock.


Is the tech rally over? Likely not. Yet on Wednesday, small caps and transportation issues certainly sold some of the tech sector's thunder. The Russell 2000, which has lagged the S&P 500 all year, gained almost 0.4%. The Dow Jones transportation average, boosted by airline, freight, trucking and logistics firms, gained 1.6% to notch its best gain since Aug. 14.


Both the Russell 2000 (up 6.5% year to date) and the Dow transports (up 6.8%) are still lagging indexes compared with the tech-driven Nasdaq composite (up 19.9% since Jan. 1) and the S&P 500 (up 12%). (*Track the year-to-date changes for the latter two benchmarks, as well as the Dow industrials, via the General Market Indicators PDF via the link at the bottom of this article.*)


As seen in today's Market Pulse column, trucking firm **Old Dominion Freight** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) carved out a spot on the "Leaders up in volume" section. The Thomasville, N.C., firm has rallied more than 44% since clearing a saucer-with-handle base at 71.85 in late October.



Oil-related industry groups helped pace the upside, and no wonder. Crude oil had a marvelous session as U.S. crude futures jumped 1.9% to $50.41 a barrel. That was oil's first close above $50 since July 31.


Crude oil is still down around 6% year to date.


Numerous market observers admitted being caught off guard by the U.S. central bank's statement and remarks by Fed Chair Janet Yellen — not that the bank will start reducing its holdings of Treasury bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities by $10 billion each month starting in October, but that it is keeping a potential quarter-point hike in short-term interest rates in sight when it meets on Dec. 12-13.


For years, the Fed bought gigantic quantities of bonds to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates and help reinvigorate the economy. These actions, known as QE3, came after the Fed moved quickly to reduce to fed funds rate charged on overnight loans to big banks to practically zero following the subprime debt debacle of 2008.


Yet today, the Fed is showing confidence in the general state of the U.S. economy, even after the huge damage inflicted by Hurricane Harvey in the Houston region and Hurricane Irma slamming Florida's southern Gulf Coast.


"Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term," the Fed said in a statement.


The statement gave a somewhat sober outlook on inflation. Yet views seem to be changing, especially in light of a bigger than expected 0.4% month-to-month rise in August U.S. consumer prices last month.


"The Fed is trying to steer a supertanker through narrow straits, so they are proceeding cautiously and deliberately," Alexandra Coupe, associate director for the $9.9 billion asset manager PAAMCO, told IBD. "Intentions have been well telegraphed as the Fed is trying to mitigate any surprises. The market has been trading cautiously because investors have been burned by surprises before."


The CME Group's fed funds watch tool now shows a 70.5% chance that the fed funds rate will move up 25 basis points to a range of 1.25%-1.50% and a 3% chance of 1.5%-1.75%.


Going back to U.S. equities, market internals suggest there is still gas in the tank for further upside.


Winners beat losers by a decent margin, nearly 4-to-3 on both exchanges. The number of stocks making new highs continues to dwarf new lows. A big question: Will investors take more profits in the tech sector and reinvest in some of the laggard areas?


One way to answer that: Keep a close eye on the stocks that make IBD's [Stocks On The Move](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) table.


Second, keep an eye on the long bonds. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note continues to rebound, marking a one-month high of 2.28% on Wednesday.


Three, pay attention to changes in IBD's top screens, including Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight, IBD 50 and Big Cap 20.


Four, watch for sudden forays among defensive industry groups into the top 40 of IBD's daily rankings of 197 industry groups and subgroups. Again, use the bottom left corner of the General Market Indicators page, or the entire rankings at [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the Stocks Lists section of Investors.com, as your guide.


In other words, you don't have to come up with the answer yourself. Let the market answer it for you.


Right now, few defense-oriented industries grab the top 40 spots. Software, biotech, leisure, computer, and select cyclical industries are currently leading the market. Recent big movers: construction machinery (No. 8, up from No. 45 six weeks ago, truck transport (No. 18, up from No. 113), enterprise software (No. 23 vs. No. 51) and specialty enterprise software (No. 32 vs. No. 83).

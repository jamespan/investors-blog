title: Indexes Fall As Technology, Growth Stocks Take Harder Hits

After 13 weeks of steady gains, the stock market may finally be exhausting itself, as some leading growth stocks suffered larger losses Monday.




Major indexes fell the most since early December, which probably made Monday's losses feel that much harder. The S&P 500 lost 0.6% and the Nasdaq composite shed 0.7%. The composite was unable to hold the newly conquered 9000 level, closing at roughly 8946. Indexes sometimes stop their climb at round numbers such as 9000, which is why this level is significant.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 0.6%, but small caps escaped with a smaller loss of 0.3% on the Russell 2000. Volume rose, which added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The number of such institutional-sized declines in the past several weeks remains benign, however.


While the market decline was broad, it was more acute among growth stocks. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) slid 0.7%. By comparison, iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) lost 0.4%.

That trend picked up starting with the market's October lows. Growth stocks also tend to be more volatile than value plays. Still, any time that growth leaders fall out of favor, there's reason for IBD-style investors to be on guard.


Many software and technology leaders retreated Monday after strong advances in the fourth quarter of 2019. That included some in the IBD 50, as the index fell 0.8% Monday.


Growth Stocks In IBD 50
-----------------------


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) were in the bottom rungs of the IBD 50. Each fell 1.4% to 2.4%.


**Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) is not in the IBD 50. But the digital advertising technology stock sold off more than 7% in heavy trading. Shares are now back below the 267.74 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of last week's breakout. Universal Display also has given back a modest increase from its buy point.


The IBD 50 stocks that did best Monday were mainly in mining, telecom and financials. In other words, they weren't growth companies. **J2 Global** ([JCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCOM)), for instance, averaged EPS gains of 11% the first three quarters of this year. **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)), the giant media company, averaged 15% EPS growth the past three quarters.


Most of the top-performing IBD 50 stocks also can be termed value plays. Seven of Monday's top 10 have price-earnings ratios below 22. By comparison, the Dow's P/E ratio is about 24 and the S&P 500's is 25.5.


No Complacency For Growth Stock Investors
-----------------------------------------


While there is no topping signal, this is no time for investors to be complacent. As the year winds down, institutions could be taking profits. The Nasdaq is up 34.8% for 2019, about four percentage points below the decade-best gain of 2013. Up nearly 12% this quarter, the Nasdaq has performed the opposite of last year's Q4, when it slid into a bear market.


In a day of broad declines, the energy sector found relative strength. Drilling, oilfield services and oil machinery were among the top 20 of 197 industry groups.


The retail sector shook off early weakness. Discount chains, apparel stores, consumer electronics and leisure retailing were in the top 15 groups.


All 11 S&P sectors were lower, as were 78% of IBD's 197 industry groups. But among individual stocks, decliners led advancers by a 9-7 ratio on the NYSE and by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


There was little to celebrate in terms of new [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Brazilian airline **Azul** ([AZUL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZUL)) and footwear company **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) topped buy points in weak volume. Most earlier breakouts are still performing well or at least adequately.

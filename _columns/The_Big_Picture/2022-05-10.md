Nasdaq Rebounds Modestly; This Leading Sector Shows Surprising Weakness
========================================================================

The Nasdaq led a bland rebound on Tuesday, but not without first undercutting Monday's low — yet another sign of how the market is firmly in correction mode. Even "leading stocks" in defensive industries showed surprisingly poor action.




Plus, not all of the key indexes joined the rebound.


Add these factors to the reality that pure growth stocks are [nowhere near proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), and the regular reader of this column may conclude that sitting on a big wad of cash remains a smart move.


The Nasdaq composite rose 1%, taking back less than a quarter of Monday's 4.3% slaughter. Volume edged up 5% vs. Monday.


Yet smaller stocks couldn't join the winners column. The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund spun its wheels for a 0.3% decline. The Russell 2000 closed less than 1 point lower. Ditto for Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)). At 29.73, the ETF has plunged almost 44% from its 52-week high of 52.55.


The forward price-earnings ratios of the S&P 400 and 600 dropped to 12.3 and 11.8 on Monday, according to Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research. "Those are extremely cheap valuation multiples if there's to be no recession this year or next year, as we are still forecasting," Yardeni wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

Nasdaq Rebounds In Wobbly Way
-----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP051022-272x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.3%.


Meanwhile, Monday's vicious sell-off pumped the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) to 1.07 for that session. (Please note that on IBD's put-call graph, the data is one-day delayed.) That's still shy of the 1.15 threshold that IBD research has found often coincides with — but does not guarantee — a genuine stock market bottom.


On Tuesday, the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), an ETF tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq, gained 1.2%. But QQQ actually finished in the lower half of the day's range — not a savory close. It suggests anxious investors eagerly sold into the session's strength.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 edged up less than 0.3% but retook 4000. Some market observers may see that as a key psychological level. Yet again, the way the large-cap benchmark rebounded was hardly lip-smacking.


The S&P 500 closed well off Tuesday's high of 4068. Put another way, the index gained as much as 1.9% before backsliding.


As the daily chart shows, the S&P 500's 50-day moving average has continued to slope lower since cresting in the third week of January.



The daily chart also shows a series of lower highs and lower lows. Panelists on [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) debated whether we're witnessing a second wave of selling since the November top or a third wave.


Beyond Nasdaq: Still No Light At The End of The Tunnel?
-------------------------------------------------------


Regardless, market internals also suggest that we haven't yet seen the moment where the sellers are completely exhausted and institutional investors are climbing over each other's back to bid stocks higher. For instance, according to the homepage of MarketSmith, more stocks still fell in heavy volume vs. rising stocks. ThinkOrSwim showed losing stocks outmatching winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-3 margin.


Even food and tobacco stocks showed crumbling action. [In Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-bounces-as-nasdaq-rallies-2-1-this-stock-soars-71-but-another-one-plunges-53/) columns, we noted how cigarette maker **Vector** ([VGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VGR)) and its peers got walloped by sellers. Vector tumbled below its 50-day and 200-day lines. Volume surged to the highest level for a down session since Jan. 3.



**Mondelez International** ([MDLZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDLZ)), the 27th-largest company in market value on the Nasdaq, had a solid breakout going and got a rare mention on the IBD Live show. Yet by day's end, the global maker of sweets, candy and gum reversed for a 0.5% drop to 65.92, below a 66.45 entry in a [15-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Even though Mondelez shows a rocketing relative strength line, a 92 Composite Rating, and even a slight improvement in its after-tax margin (15% in the first quarter of 2022, up from readings of 13.1% to 14.2% in the prior three quarters), its whipsawing day reflects the difficulty that CAN SLIM investors will always have in bearish market conditions.


Signs Of Inflation Cooling?
---------------------------


Wednesday's latest monthly reading on U.S. consumer prices will undoubtedly command plenty of attention.


The Econoday forecast calls for a modest 0.2% uptick in April vs. March, when the CPI index surged 1.2%. The expected year-over-year increase of 8.1% may mark a mild fall from 8.5% growth in consumer prices in March, yet remains well above the Federal Reserve's target level of an average yearly gain of 2%.


Alex Pelle, U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities USA, expects the data to come in a bit stronger than most forecasts.


"Although we see some softening in activity, supply issues have shown little signs of abating in the previous month, and nominal income growth remains high," Pelle wrote in a note to clients. "Used car prices are expected to decline further, which will put downward pressure on core inflation. However, this matters much less for the Fed's PCE inflation target, so any negative contribution from used car prices should be faded on the way down just as it was on the way up last year."


Econoday forecasts a 0.4% rise in core inflation month on month in April, and Pelle expects the same size of increase to repeat in May.

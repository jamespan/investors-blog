Stocks stumbled further south Friday as the indexes failed to find support at any of the usual places. The Nasdaq lost 1.6%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average chopped off 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively.


The IBD 50 skidded 1.5%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges. Friday was an options and futures expiration day, which usually boosts volume.

The odds for a failed rally now appear high. Research shows that a distribution day early in a new uptrend often, but not always, spells doom.


After regaining the 50-day and 200-day lines by Wednesday's close, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 found no support at those key areas Thursday and Friday.


Low closes on both days underlined the market's weakness.


Stocks that score highly on fundamentals and technicals aren't offering much of a refuge right now.


Take a look at the Market Pulse at right.


Quality stocks falling in strong volume easily outnumbered those rising. Today's list consists of stocks that moved in volume 100% above average or more. Lower the volume threshold to 40%, and the tally would be too long to fit the space available.


Linux-based software firm **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) broke out at Friday's open but then had second thoughts. The stock cleared an 83.10 buy point and then reversed to close under it. Volume ran 435% above average.


The negative reversal can probably be blamed on the market. Red Hat might do better on a second breakout attempt, much as **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) did in November.


However, individual investors shouldn't buy the stock hoping for that kind of good fortune. Let Red Hat prove itself.


After the close Thursday, [Red Hat reported](http://news.investors.com/technology/121815-785999-red-hat-stock-hits-highs-on-guidance.htm) fiscal Q3 earnings and sales that topped the Street's consensus estimate. The company also raised guidance.


Meanwhile, banks continued to show, presumably, profit-taking, considering the run-up that bank stocks enjoyed from September to early December.


**Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) slashed almost 4% lower Friday in volume 230% above average. The anticipation of the Federal Reserve's rate hike may have lifted bank stocks, and so banks became a case of buy on the rumor and sell on the news.


With leadership unclear in the market, investors need to be cautious. However, given the scarcity of breakouts recently, disciplined investors probably face few temptations to buy.


What, then, should investors do?


IBD's sell rules offer sound guidance.


•Sell any stock that falls 7% to 8% below your buy point, and try to get out earlier than that if the stock is acting peculiar.


•Close any winning position that threatens to become a loss.


•Take profits if a stock's profit reaches 20% to 25%. Most stocks begin to correct at that level.


•Stay on the sidelines unless you spot a high-conviction opportunity. If your stock has a big profit cushion, and the relative strength line is holding up, there might be no reason to sell.


For the week, the IBD 50 rose less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq fell 0.2%, and the S&P 500 eased 0.3%.

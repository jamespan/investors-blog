title: Nasdaq Barely Up On Flat Day; Small Caps Stay Positive

The Nasdaq kept its win streak technically alive Thursday, but couldn't muster even a 0.1% gain for its eighth up day in a row.




Small caps also stayed positive as the Russell 2000 gained 0.2%. But the Nasdaq was barely above flat, and the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average chalked up losses of 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively.


Nasdaq volume fell while NYSE volume rose.


As win streaks rank, the Nasdaq's run isn't providing much drama. The past three days involved gains of 0.3%, 0.1% and 0.04%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MP080918-217x300.jpg)Granted, the bulls prefer any kind of gain to a sharp turn south. Yet, given that the Nasdaq is just off its highs, the lack of boldness is unsettling.


The market has pinned its hopes on earnings season, but reactions haven't always been in line with results.


For example, of 13 oil stocks reporting this week, six missed the consensus target. Of the seven that beat views, only four are up for the week.


The oil patch has an excuse for the lackluster reactions. Light sweet crude is on track for its sixth weekly price drop in a row. The price of crude is about 11% off its recent high.


All oil stocks, though, shouldn't be painted in the same dark tones. Some could be closing in on potential buy points.


Shale oil play **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) is working on an early stage base. The stock is about 7% off a potential buy point at 70.01.


Continental has been advancing for about a year. Given that the average leader will advance 18 to 24 months, there could be more gains ahead for this large cap.

The Street expects Continental's earnings to rise 516% this year on a revenue gain of almost 70%.


Petroleum refiner **Andeavor** ([ANDV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANDV)) is near a 151.98 buy point in an early stage base. Analysts expect earnings to increase 104% this year on 33% revenue growth.


Surprise On Oil
---------------


Bloomberg News reported a nice surprise for the oil sector Thursday. U.S. crude oil was initially on China's list for tariff retaliation. But U.S. oil has vanished from the list.


China is the world's top importer of oil, and it needs American crude.


Stocks performing well Thursday had an aggressive tilt.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) advanced 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. Both marked new highs.


Breakouts included internet content company **Yelp** ([YELP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YELP)), up nearly 27% in huge volume; Latin American online marketplace **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), up 12%; and entertainment streaming play **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), up 21%. Roku is expected to lose money for a fourth straight year and then turn profitable in 2019.


Stocks Setting Up For Breakouts
-------------------------------


Some stocks appear to be setting up for possible breakouts.


**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) rose 4.53 to 291.45. The stock is in a shallow cup base with a 293.91 buy point. Shares poked above that entry before closing below it.


**Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) is working on a flat base with a 48.34 buy point.


Both stocks carry Composite Ratings of 92 or better. A rating of 92 puts a stock in the top 8% among all stocks in IBD's database.


Economic News
-------------


First-time jobless claims came in at 213,000. Analysts expected 220,000.


The producer price index for July was flat, below the consensus estimate of a 0.3% increase. This was good news because there have been worries about inflation.

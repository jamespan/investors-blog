Stocks fell for the first time in four sessions Monday, failing to show any more follow-up buying after last week's wild but positive week. Hurt by losses in biotech, software and Internet stocks, the Nasdaq dropped 1.1%, erasing Friday's modest gain and a lot more. The S&P 500 fell a milder 0.8%, thanks to gains in energy issues. A 7% surge in oil prices boosted the energy sector, which makes up about 7% of the benchmark S&P index.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.7%. But it was small caps that fared the best Monday as the Russell 2000 fell 0.3%. The IBD 50 dropped 2%, with 44 issues ending lower.

  

U.S. stocks were under pressure from the start, following a Financial Times article that said the Chinese government will stop buying shares to prop up its stock market. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 pared losses and got close to breakeven a little before noon but faded again. They ended near their session lows.

  

Volume fell across the board from Friday's pace. Lower trade is a good thing when the market falls. Losers beat winners by about 9-to-7 on the NYSE. Advancers and decliners were virtually even on the Nasdaq.

  

Monday's action was disappointing in the sense that the main indexes didn't make any further progress after last week's huge upside reversal. The action Monday also capped an ugly August for the stock market. The Nasdaq slumped 6.9%, and the S&P 500 lost 6.3%. Both had their worst monthly performances since May 2012, when the Nasdaq tumbled 7.2% and the S&P 500 fell 6.3%. But both indexes rallied for four straight months afterward.

  

Even though the market fell, a few stocks cleared buy points. **Medicines** ([MDCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDCO)) was the most notable, as it staged a breakaway gap past a 34.80 buy point in huge volume. Over the weekend, Medicines and partner **Alnylam Pharmaceuticals** ([ALNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALNY)) announced positive data on their anti-cholesterol drug candidate ALN-PCSsc. Alnylam reversed lower.

  

Other stocks such as **Virtusa** ([VRTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTU)), **CommScope** ([COMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COMM)), **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) and **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) also topped buy points intraday. The latter two, however, finished lower.

  

As Friday's column noted, leaders such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) recently climbed back above buy points after sharp losses. While this is positive action, the market environment remains not right for buying stocks.

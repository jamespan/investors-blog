If you're an active stock picker and you set your scope on the leaders, then Monday's action was exactly what you were looking for.




But if you place your hard-earned capital on market laggards, thinking that last week's action was the start of something dramatic on a sector-by-sector basis, then Monday's moves proved disappointing.


Either way, the Nasdaq's brute strength and the quality of companies backing this leading index's phenomenal recovery from the February-March sell-off proved highly timely. After all, quarterly reports and [new outlooks on earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) for many S&P 500 companies and smaller firms will flood the market the next few weeks.



The Nasdaq's 2.5% rally took back all of last week's 1.1% decline and a lot more.


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF rallied 2.8%.


Strength in e-commerce, software, health care and select issues within the telecom, retail and consumer-oriented corners of the market ushered the composite index to a new closing high.


Solar energy, which ranks No. 2 in the IBD database for six-month performance, glowed with a 7.1% price-weighted gain Monday. (See the [day's top-performing industry groups among 197 tracked here](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jul-20-2020/).)


Monday's rally helped the Nasdaq stretch its year-to-date gain to 20%, well above the Dow's 6.5% decline.


Nasdaq Still Reigns On Wall Street
----------------------------------


![MP072020-v2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP072020-v2-218x300.jpg)The S&P 500 (up 0.8%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (up less than 0.1%), Russell 2000 (down 0.4%) and Dow utility average (down 1.4%) stood deep inside the Nasdaq's long shadow.


But the S&P 500's rally was notable. The large-cap index moved up enough to trigger the 5% advance rule and take the June 19 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) off the count.


So, relevant sessions of intense institutional selling now stand at two for the S&P 500, down from five on June 26.


Also to its credit, the S&P 500 has had to work hard to eliminate a number of big sell-offs in higher volume that shook the market in June. The S&P on Monday closed above its June high, another good sign.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), another good gauge of CAN SLIM-quality issues, surged 3% for its highest close since Feb. 20.


Winners Vs. Losers
------------------


Market breadth actually disappointed on Monday.



Preliminary data showed gainers on the Nasdaq beating decliners by fewer than 200 stocks (1,765 up, 1,580 down). With such a sharp rise by the Nasdaq on Monday, you'd normally expect a much more positive ratio.


On the NYSE, losers actually trumped winners by a hefty 9-5 ratio — a curious divergence.


Still, the regular reader of this column knows that she or he does not need 25 or 30 stocks to have a great year.


On IBD Leaderboard, which headed into Monday showed 18 companies total on the [Leaders Near A Buy Point List](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and [Leaders list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders), at least 15 stocks delivered a performance that tripled the S&P 500's gain or more. [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), one of the most stringent screens for growth stocks on Investors.com, has not topped eight stocks on its list for months.


Clearly, big earnings misses among the highfliers on Wall Street and dismal outlooks for the second half of the year could be a big factor that would puncture this solid start to the third quarter.


Also, decisions by major cities and states to re-shut the economy due to an upward spiraling of coronavirus cases and deaths could hurt the market.


Five More Signs The Market May Turn Cloudy
------------------------------------------


What are five more factors to watch for that would indicate it's time to batten down the hatches — that is, get off margin, take at least partial profits and refrain from new buys?


1. A dramatic change in the Federal Reserve's thinking on interest rates. For now, Fed officials have indicated they are not going to remove any steps to keep the cost of money low or keep debt markets operating smoothly until the economy shows real signs of recovery. Third-quarter GDP, jobs, construction and other data will gain plenty of attention. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond on Monday fell 2 basis points to 0.62%, down from 0.69% at the start of July.
2. Top growth stocks show terrible reversals lower after trying to break out of a late-stage base.
3. Big-cap techs go into [climax runs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/).
4. Watch the commodity markets, particularly crude oil and copper. Both give investors an important finger on the pulse of global economies. The U.S. Oil Fund ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)), at 29.11, has leapt 72% from its April 28 low. Copper on Monday rose 0.6% to $2.92 a pound, striping a year-to-date high.
5. Watch for giddy, [excessive optimism](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/). The [bulls-bears survey from Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) and the [Cboe volatility index](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vix-volatility-index-can-confirm-stock-market-bottoms-coronavirus-bear-market/) deserve a daily check.

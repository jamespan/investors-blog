  Stock Market Fades Late After Fed Minutes; Target Soars, Crispr Breaks Out

A quiet, orderly session for the stock market Wednesday took a turn for the worse when the minutes from the July 28-29 Federal Reserve meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET.




The Nasdaq reversed lower for a loss of 0.6%, the S&P 500 dipped 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.3%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index edged higher by 0.1%. The index recently got turned away at the 1600 level but continues to hold near its 10-day moving average.


Higher volume on the Nasdaq resulted in a distribution day for the index, its fourth in nine sessions. Volume on the NYSE came in slightly lower than Tuesday.


According to the [minutes](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-minutes-asset-purchases-dow-jones/), Fed officials "agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term." The stock market took that to mean it could be a more drawn out recovery for the U.S. economy.


![MP081920](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP081920-228x300.jpg)The Nasdaq's July 21 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) fell off the count Tuesday because the Nasdaq rallied 5% from its closing price that day. The S&P 500 on Wednesday lost its July 23 distribution day for the same reason. That leaves four on the Nasdaq and two on the S&P 500.


Wednesday's selling came amid another rise in bullish sentiment among stock market newsletter writers, according to Investors Intelligence. The bulls rose to 59.2% from 58.1% the prior week. That's the highest since the mid-January peak of 59.4% and up substantially from 30.1% in late March, just before the Nasdaq and S&P 500 confirmed new uptrends. According to Investors Intelligence, readings above 55% call for defensive measures because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.



Taking some gains in some big winners is perfectly acceptable strategy at this point. But giving your winners room to run also makes sense, especially with some many big leaders holding above key support levels. And many top performers are forming new [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), including **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)).


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Despite the late-session selling, the day yielded plenty of strong gainers. In the biotech space, **Crispr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)) broke out powerfully over a 97.92 buy point. Crispr isn't profitable yet, but the biotech boasts excellent fund sponsorship. Top-rated funds Columbia Acorn Fund (ACRNX) and T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) have increased their stake in the stock recently.


In the retail sector, **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) hit record highs on strong earnings. Target fared the best, soaring nearly 13%, but it was already extended from a 126.07 buy point. The numbers were decidedly bullish across the board at Target, with earnings up 86% to $3.38 a share. That was more than double the consensus estimate of $1.62. Revenue increased 25% to nearly $23 billion. Same-store sales increased 24% and digital comp sales soared 195%. Target reported 10 million new digital customers so far this year.

Elsewhere, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) picked up 0.5% ahead of its earnings report Thursday before the open. It's forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 268.10 buy point. **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) jumped nearly 5% ahead of its earnings report Friday before the open. It's forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 98.53 entry.


**Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) scored its sixth straight gain, though it closed near session lows. The security software leader is in a buy zone after a successful test of its 10-week moving average. **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) is also testing its 10-week line, but as noted in Wednesday's edition of [IBD Live](https://www.investors.com/ibdlive), it's not as good a test as Zscaler's due to the volatile nature of the pullback.


After the close, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) edged lower in after-hours trading after reporting earnings. Its small loss was an impressive feat considering the chip leader had rallied so much ahead of earnings. Separately, **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)), a member of the [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) watchlist, was up 4% to 206 in late trading after reporting earnings. It's forming a flat base with a 205 entry.

The stock market made an impressive reversal from heavy losses Thursday, as the Nasdaq surged more than 3% even as Russia began an invasion of Ukraine.




The stock market opened with steep losses Thursday after news overnight that Russia launched attacks against Ukraine. But the U.S. market quickly started to rebound.


At the open, the Nasdaq hit bear-market territory, down more than 20% from its record high in November. The major stock indexes accelerated higher after President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, and eventually closed at session highs. The Nasdaq came back from a 3.5% plunge to end with a 3.3% surge.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned up 0.3% Thursday, while the S&P 500 reversed 1.5% higher. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 2.6%. Top growth stocks also ended higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied nearly 2.4%. The ETF of top growth stocks snapped a four-day losing streak.

Midday Thursday, Biden announced new sanctions that will target Russian banks and elites and their families. "Putin is the aggressor," Biden said during a White House news conference. "Putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences." However, Biden withheld some measures, such as directly sanctioning President Vladimir Putin and stopping Russia from using the Swift payments system.


Volume surged on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Correction
-----------------------


One day after IBD downgraded the [market outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) from "uptrend under pressure" to "market in correction," the stock market put in Day 1 of a new rally attempt with its big reversal.


Be on the lookout for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), which would signal the start of a new uptrend, on Day 4 or later of a rally attempt. But this year's market volatility could make such a signal less significant. Follow-throughs in December and January failed.


During market corrections, investors should be in cash. But don't tune out. Instead, keep a watchlist of top-performing stocks that are trying to hold up during the market weakness. If the market is able to find its footing and stage a follow-through in the coming sessions, these stocks could be on the verge of offering new buy points.


On a positive note, the [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), a measure of investor fear, briefly surged more than 30% above its 10-day moving average Thursday. A rise of more than 20% above its 10-day moving average can signal at least a short-term market low.

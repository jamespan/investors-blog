title: Stock Market Romps Higher Despite Fed Rate Hike; Will Bear Market Take A Longer Nap?

More than a month ago, the stock market moved like a wounded animal after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on June 15 by three quarters of a point. Back then, not all voting members agreed on the size of that increase. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and crew made this clear: We're here to stop rabid inflation.




On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank showed unanimity in different ways.


One, all of the voting members of the FOMC agreed that another 75-basis-point rise in the fed funds rate — now targeting a range of 2.25%-2.5% — is necessary to get the U.S. economy balanced between prices and growth. Yet the opening statement of Wednesday's news release noted that "recent indicators of spending and production have softened." This seemed to telegraph this message to Wall Street: We are also concerned about the economy and do not want to send it into a tailspin.


[A conference call with Powell](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-delivers-huge-rate-hike-despite-slowing-growth-dow-jones/) after the 2 p.m. ET announcement appeared to give fund managers more reason to think equities remain fertile ground for investing.


Stock Market Today: Techs Lead In Broad Advance
-----------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite, gapping up at the open, finished with a 4.1% advance for one of its biggest single-day gains this year. Keep in mind, however, that history has shown that the biggest bear markets frequently feature rebounds of this magnitude. Just view the pair of 3%-plus up days on Jan. 28 and 31.


Of course, the difference between then and now, technically, deserves a look at the Nasdaq's daily chart.



Back in late January, the tech-heavy index had spent weeks below its 50-day moving average. And this technical level had topped on Jan. 4 and had begun to slope lower. That is, the medium-term trend in stock prices was already sinking. That's not the case today. The Nasdaq closed Wednesday above the 50-day line for a seventh straight session. And the 50-day line is rising, albeit for a very short time for now.


Back in March, the composite index strung at least 13 straight sessions above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) before going on another bearish leg down.


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq's gains outran advances of 2.6% by the S&P 500, 2.4% by the Russell 2000, and 1.4% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Volume picked up vs. the prior day on both main exchanges.


What Is Still Missing
---------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP_080122-138x300.jpg)The index's strong gains in heavier volume are exactly what IBD-style growth investors want to see before they deploy hard-earned money back into the market. But where should they deploy?


[A recent Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/bear-market-surrenders-ground-which-sectors-will-lead-the-bulls/) reviewed action in financial, energy and consumer-oriented stocks. The first two sectors still don't appear as if they're totally ready to lead a strong charge. Breakouts remain thin, meanwhile, and a view of screens such as [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) and [IBD's sector-ranked New Highs list in IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) confirms this fact.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) shareholders reacted bullishly to the cloud-computing and business-software titan's [fiscal Q4 results delivered late on Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/msft-stock-microsoft-misses-june-quarter-sales-earnings-targets/). Yet a 6.7% jump still leaves Microsoft more than 23% off the prior peak of its new eight-month-old base.


**ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), an innovative enterprise software giant, tanked 6% in extended-hours trading after posting its Q2 results. This means it still could be a while before the large cap retakes both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.


In the [IBD method of buying great companies](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/), the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) arrives only after a stock has spent considerable time above these key technical levels.


Thus, even though Wednesday's action carried bullish elements, the stock market still needs more time to lick its wounds. IBD readers also need to see more [quality bases finish](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) and outstanding breakouts to jump off their screens with the clarity of fireworks at night.


Looking At Interest Rates' Future Path
--------------------------------------


The next Federal Reserve meeting on the fed funds rate won't happen until September. So, the market and central bank officials will be closely studying economic data over the next few weeks. The stock market could certainly gyrate on fresh signs that inflation is either still strong or subsiding.


"From here, it is possible that the Fed slows its tightening pace, reassured by the likely peaking of inflation and pullback in inflation expectations as oil prices have fallen. However, with the labor market still a picture of strength, wage growth still uncomfortably high and core inflation set to decline at a glacially slow pace, the Fed certainly cannot stop tightening, nor can it downshift gears too much," Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to IBD.


"Combating four-decade-high inflation will take a sustained show of strength from the Fed, rendering a soft landing an almost impossible pipe dream," Shah added. "We continue to expect rates to rise above 4% next year, before recession opens the door to rate cuts in late 2023."


Inversion In Rates Could Still Weigh On Stock Market
----------------------------------------------------


The Treasury bond markets showed no surprise at the Fed's second straight 75-basis-point rate hike. After all, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond note fell 5 basis points to 2.73%.


That marks a 70-basis-point slide from the June 14 peak of 3.48%, Cboe data shows.


Institutional asset manager Cindy Beaulieu had expected the Fed's decision to opt for a three-quarter-point hike instead of what some had earlier thought would be a full-point jump. The managing director at Conning notes that it's important to watch the spread between three-month T-bills and the 10-year note. If the three-month rate goes above the 10-year rate, such an inversion signals a warning for stock market investors that the economy is headed for recession.


"We certainly follow the difference between the two-year and 10-year yields, but an inversion (between the two) tends to show expectations that the Fed will make a policy mistake, not necessarily a real mistake," Beaulieu told IBD. Her team manages $203 billion in assets, mainly concentrated in pension plans and insurance company clients.


U.S. Treasury data showed the three-month T-bill at 2.44%, the two-year note at 2.96%, and the 10-year bond at 2.78%.


The China Factor
----------------


In terms of factors that may affect inflation in the second half of the year, Beaulieu points to the possibility that improved supply chains — particularly between China and the U.S. — will help alleviate the pain felt by high prices. She sees signs that semiconductor shortages are alleviating, which could help put downward pressure on car prices.


The date of China's annual People's Congress meeting later this year has yet to be set. But once that is held, "the zero Covid policy is going to be put aside; that's our expectation," Beaulieu said. "If China is going to have any chance of reaching its 4% GDP target, it's going to have to turn on the spigots. We think this will happen sometime late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter."

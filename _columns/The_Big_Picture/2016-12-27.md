The stock market rose moderately Tuesday, as Wall Street began a short week with the usual calm that comes in the waning days of the year.


After jumping at the open, the major indexes were basically flat the rest of the day, and closed in the lower half of their daily price range.


The Nasdaq led with a 0.5% gain and made a record high. Chips and internet retailers were among the day's best. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) climbed closer to a buy point.


The S&P 500 advanced 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1%. The Dow'sÂ chase of the 20,000 level continues but it's unlikely to happen in a traditionally dull week.


![mp122716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP122716-195x300.png)Volume declined from Friday's pace on the NYSE but increased on the Nasdaq. Winners led losers by an 8-5 ratio.


Expect soft volume and index movement the rest of this week. The period between Christmas and New Year's Day tends to be one of the slowest on Wall Street. Many traders are taking time off, and there's usually a shortage of big headlines to spark trading.


Because Friday is the final session of the year and the quarter, there could be some window dressing. That's when money managers dump stocks and buy the year's winners to make their portfolios look better.


Among leading stocks, charts also were pretty quiet, although a few warrant close attention.


Netflix rose 2% and moved closer to the 129.39 buy point of a long [cup-with-handle base](http://education.investors.com/education/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787). If the video streaming service can make a new high, it would be a bullish move for one of the most widely held growth stocks.


Investors haven't found much by way of secondary entries after a rash of November breakouts. But while some leading stocks remain locked in tight price action, follow-on entries are finally emerging.


Banks have been steady for a couple of weeks, which is resulting in constructive price patterns. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) formed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) with a buy point at 245.67.


It may be the first chance to buy shares of the investment bank because the stock was largely out of growth investors' radars when it broke out in October. The stock soared as much as 42% from the breakout, without pausing enough to create a new entry until now. But a new high now would represent a riskier trade simply because Goldman has surged so much already.


**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) is near the 40.06 buy point of a four-weeks-tight pattern. If this week remains quiet, more financials in the IBD 50 could form similar patterns. **Microsemi** ([MSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCC)) also has formed a three-weeks-tight, this one with a 57.42 buy point.


Many cyclical stocks such as mining, steel and coal led the market Tuesday. Homebuilders and some related stocks also were strong after the latest reading on home prices came in line with expectations. Prices in 20 major cities rose 5.1% in October from a year earlier, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index showed.


IBD's Homebuilders industry group rose more than 1%. Home Furnishings, Cement and Wood Products also climbed more than 1%.


Most of the 19 stocks in the Homebuilders' industry group are forming the right side of bases, although none is in an attractive buy area. Still, the chart of the Homebuilding group is forming a cup with handle, which suggests some of the group leaders will follow along. (Industry charts can be viewed with IBD's [MarketSmith charting service](http://www.marketsmith.com).)


The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF also is forming a cup with handle.

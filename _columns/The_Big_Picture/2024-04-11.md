  Techs Lead Stock Market Rally As Wholesale Prices Come In Tame; Nvidia Gets Support

The Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde stock market kicked into rally mode Thursday after sharp losses Wednesday. The stock market breathed a sigh of relief after the latest reading on wholesale prices generally came in softer than expected.




Wholesale prices in March rose 0.2%, just below the 0.3% consensus estimate, after increasing 0.6% in February. On a year-over-year basis, prices were up 2.1%, also cooler than the 2.3% consensus forecast. Core prices, which exclude food and energy costs, rose 0.2%. That was in line with expectations and just below February's reading of 0.3%. Year over year, core prices increased 2.4% vs. the 2.3% estimate.


After a nice close off lows Wednesday, the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.7% in lower volume. Breadth was suspect again, with winners edging out losers.


The Nasdaq 100 performed mostly in line with the composite, with semiconductor stocks like **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) among the best gainers.


Nvidia is making a bullish first test of its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) after a breakout on Jan. 8. Broadcom is on breakout watch as it sits just below an entry at 1,438.17. Micron is too extended after its earnings surge last month. Despite some volatility in recent days, Micron is still holding above its 10-day moving average.

The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) lagged the Nasdaq 100, up 1% vs. the 1.7% gain in the Nasdaq 100 index.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Semiconductor stocks continue to be a strong area of leadership in the stock market. Broadcom and Nvidia are tracked in the fabless group, which was the day's top-performing group, up more than 3%.


The S&P 500 added 0.7% in lower volume. Advancers also outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a small margin. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ended fractionally lower but closed off lows after a near test of its 50-day line.


The strong gains for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were enough to put the stock market back on a confirmed uptrend with an increased invested percentage of 60% to 80%. If you're lightly invested, it's OK to increase exposure in measured fashion. Don't chase extended stocks. Instead, look for stocks finding support at their 10-week lines or forming new bases. Consider buying partial positions to start, adding as your stocks show progress.


For perspective, the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio added only one stock Wednesday, increasing our invested percentage to just under 70%.


Uranium miner **Cameco** ([CCJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCJ)) jumped 2.7% in higher volume. It closed just above a 50.43 entry. In healthy markets, it's typical to see breakouts follow through with further gains. We'll see if that happens with Cameco.


After giving an early buy signal Wednesday, **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) topped a conventional entry of 325.63, but the stock faded off highs and closed just below the buy point.


After a sharp break of the 50-day moving average last week and a 1.1% drop Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended fractionally lower. The blue-chip index was weighed down by weakness in **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)). The two stocks shaved about 80 points off the Dow.

Insurance stocks like Travelers were among the laggards Thursday, with five insurance-related groups down at least 0.8%.


Small Caps Remain Below 50-Day Line
-----------------------------------


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) rebounded 0.7% in lower volume after plunging through its 50-day line Wednesday in heavy volume. It's best to see declines coming in lower volume and gains coming in higher volume. That's normally a telltale sign of institutional buying.


The gains came even as the 10-year Treasury rallied another 2 basis points to nearly 4.56% after soaring 19 basis points Wednesday. Not that long ago, the Federal Reserve was expected to cut its key lending rate several times this year. Now, traders think there's a 50-50 chance the Fed will cut rates for the first time at the July meeting. There's a 57% chance of only two rate cuts this year, much less than expectations late last year of six or seven cuts.


There are plenty of reasons for the stock market to be going down at this point, but it's still showing strength despite an elevated [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) and higher interest rates.


Stocks fell sharply Wednesday when core consumer prices on a year-over-year basis came in hotter than expected for the fourth straight month. But the Nasdaq composite traded in a tight range all day and buyers lifted the index off lows by the close.


Expect more volatility ahead, but for now, the market tide is flowing positive. That's normally the best time to make money in stocks — provided you buy carefully.

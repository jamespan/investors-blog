The stock market ended the week in bullish fashion as the S&P 500 closed above the 5,000 level for the first time on Friday. More key firms are now set to post earnings in the coming week, while another inflation report looms.




The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.3% for the day and ended the week up a muscular 2.3%. Bears might contend a pullback or a pause is due, given the index has risen in 14 out of the past 15 weeks. The tech-heavy index now has the 16,000 level in its sights as it sits above all its [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/).


The S&P 500 popped 0.6%, notching another all-time high in the bargain. Its weekly gain of 1.4% means it is almost 5% above the key [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The benchmark index is also up more than 5% for the year so far.

Breadth was pleasing on the stock market Friday, with advancers outnumbering decliners by more than 2-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq exchange.Â This week's gains mean the number of distribution days has fallen to one on the Nasdaq composite and three on the S&P 500.


The Jan. 31 distribution day has been eliminated on the Nasdaq due to the 5% rule. That rule refers to the index's 5% rise above the distribution day's close.


The S&P 500 Jan. 16 distribution day is gone for the same reason, while a stalling distribution day on the S&P has been taken off due to the fact they only count when we have more distribution days than stalling days. This will return if another distribution day shows up on the benchmark index.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged as it fell 0.1% Friday, though it did inch up for the week. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) led the upside while oil major **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) were the worst laggards.


Small caps impressed, with the Russell 2000 jumping 1.5%. It closed above the 2,000 mark for the first time since the start of the year. Growth stocks also gave the bears a black eye, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund jumping 1.5%.


Inflation Data, Earnings Loom
-----------------------------


The stock market got an early boost after the Labor Department revised its Consumer Price Index monthly figures. The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics brought the rate down to 0.2% for December from 0.3%.


Despite this, some key Treasury yields actually ended the day higher. The 10-year yield crept up incrementally to 4.17% while the 2-year yield rose 3 basis points to 4.48%.


Investors will be hoping that the momentum continues when CPI data for January comes in on Tuesday. Economists see prices rising 0.3% from December and cooling to 2.9% year-over-year growth. Forecasts call for core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, to ease to 3.7% growth compared with last year.

These Stock Market Sectors Shine
--------------------------------


A majority of [S&P 500 sectors closed Friday higher](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Technology and consumer discretionary were the strongest areas while energy and consumer staples lagged.



The relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's industry groups gave investors a clearer picture of the action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Database software specialists, solar plays, fiber-optics firms and computer hardware companies all had strong sessions on the stock market. On the other side of the coin, computer game stocks, mining machinery plays, confectioners and specialty consumer products all struggled.


Travel booking stocks were also hit after **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) plunged 17.8% after it reported disappointing gross bookings as well as the surprise departure of Chief Executive Peter Kern.

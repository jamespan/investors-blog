=====================================================

The stock market's pullback extended another session Wednesday. Yet despite a disappointing reversal for all the major indexes, the decline did not disturb the overall uptrend.

  

The Nasdaq composite wasted an early 0.5% gain to end down 0.3%. The S&P 500 also fell 0.3%. Volume declined.

  

Small caps fell harder. The S&P 600 was off 0.8%.

  

In general, such reversals are not welcome for market bulls. However, the overall trading range was mild.

  

And even though Wednesday marked the Nasdaq's third decline in a row, a total loss of 1.6% over that time frame is relatively small compared to the 15% climb tracing back to the Sept. 29 low.

  

Stocks that have charged to new highs and broken out of early-stage bases since the Oct. 2 follow-through are for the most part acting decently. The gains have been meager, but few stock breakouts have flamed out dramatically.

  

While nice gains in the big-cap tech, chip and banking sectors have spearheaded this latest rally, the absence of strength in the retail sector is notable.

  

**Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) grabbed the day's headlines with its 14% plunge in heavy volume following its [report](http://news.investors.com/business/111115-780296-macys-sends-holiday-warning-signal.htm) of a third-straight drop in quarterly sales. Macy's triggered a sell signal Aug. 12 with a sharp cut of its 200-day line. Meanwhile, Wall Street research has been glum. Cowen on Tuesday noted bulging inventories among chains ranging from **DSW** ([DSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DSW)) to **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) to shoe firm **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)). Macquarie Research reportedly named 10 companies with inventories currently outstripping sales.

  

It goes to show how the holiday shopping season does not automatically spell a Santa Claus rally for the sector. Yes, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has become a market leader once again. The e-commerce and Web services giant joined IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/products/premium-investing-tools/leaderboard/) on Sept. 8. Since then, it's broken out of a cup with handle at 549.88 and rallied more than 20%. But most retailing stocks have slumped.

  

The apparel and shoe retailing group was one of the day's worst. The group's top dog and former market leader, **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)), caved below the critical 200-day moving average as the stock dropped 5.3% to 62.18 in nearly double usual turnover. Its Composite Rating has shriveled to 73.

  

Just two of the top-20 industry groups are retail-related: Internet and auto parts. Apparel retail has slid to 101st among 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance. Eleven more retail subgroups inhabit the bottom half of the 197 groups.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MP041323-240x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.1%, closing at its highest level since Feb. 15. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, moving above its previous April highs. Finally, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied 2%, its best day in nearly a month.


Volume edged higher on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE vs. the prior session. The Nasdaq's [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count sits at three, while the S&P 500 still has yet to see a day of institutional selling.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed 1.6%, retaking the 50-day line. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Array Technologies** ([ARRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRY)) rallied 1.1% Thursday, extending a win streak to four sessions. Shares are building the right side of a cup base with a 24.69 buy point.


Despite the recent clustering of distribution days — Wednesday marked the third day of heavy institutional selling in a span of just five sessions — the market outlook remains in a confirmed uptrend, which means investors continue to have the green light to buy breakout stocks. IBD's recommended exposure remains at 40% to 60%.

Are any stock market investors still expecting the Federal Reserve to trim interest rates two months from now? Well, you can say sayonara to that.




Another month of [higher-than-expected inflation at the consumer level](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-march-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/) for March led to blanket selling on Wednesday. Yet the day's [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) deserves note in that a variety of sectors and a range of leading stocks also showed some contrast in the quality of their technical pictures.


Taking the biggest hits in the stock market today? Small and midcap names for sure. But don't ignore the interest rate-sensitive plays too. Think utilities, transportation and construction.


Beyond the stock market, investors raced out of long-dated U.S. government bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped 17 basis points to 4.54%, according to futures trading.


The energy complex advanced; crude oil futures climbed 1.2% and made a recent sessions high of $86.38 a barrel. Gasoline futures edged up 1% to $2.78 per gallon.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP041024-210x300.jpg)The Russell 2000, falling 2.5% to close at 2,028, has seen its year-to-date advance shrivel to one point, or well under 0.1%. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) slid 2.1%. That marked the midcap stock market index's third decline of 1% or more in April alone. Its gain since Jan. one has gotten chopped to just under 6%.


Large caps did not fare as badly.


The S&P 500 lost almost 1% to 5,160. On a closing basis, it held above the close seen on April 4. As three of the Magnificent Seven tech giants actually gained ground Wednesday, the tech-rich Nasdaq composite eased 0.8%, or roughly a third of the sell-off in small caps.


That said, volume still grew on both main exchanges vs. Tuesday, highlighting Wednesday as another profit-taking session. And the S&P 500 logged an [eighth distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Remarkably, the average decline among these important sell-offs is a rather mild 0.55%. One reason? The eight distribution days over a 25-session time window include the stalling day on March 21, in which the S&P 500 rose 0.3%.


On the Nasdaq, the March 5 distribution day expired on time. So its count remained at seven.


Meanwhile, a daily chart of the midcap index ETF on [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?intcode=lgnv%7Clgnv%7CMarketSmith%7C2023%7C06%7Cmsp%7Cna%7C%7C725068&src=A00653) reveals MDY slashing below its 21-day exponential moving average. Ditto for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Also, the major indexesÂ finished well off their session lows despite the negative inflation data.


The overall stock market message: Sellers are in control in the short term. Hence, an exposure of 40%-60% in stocks, in place since April 4, means that cash in the portfolio serves as a useful shock absorber.


For sure, other key stock market averages highlighted the disappointing news on the [Consumer Price Index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-march-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/), which showed a 0.4% rise in March month on month and a 3.5% increase year over year. Core CPI exceeded the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), up 0.4% month on month and accelerating 3.8% vs. a year ago.

Dow Jones Breaks This Level
---------------------------



Elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1% to 38,461 and slid further below the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


As seen in the daily chart, it first closed below this important moving average on April 4. Given the robust run in equities since early November, it's natural to see the key index pause. A fall below the 50-day moving average is bound to happen.


So at this point, it's high time to monitor the best positions within your portfolio and guard your short-term profits. Those investors with gains that exceed 50% to 100% could very well decide to hold all, or a major part, of each position through a normal base-building process.


Consider this: The S&P 500 sits just 2% beneath its all-time peak of 5264. But, if the decline grows to 5%, for instance, stock market research by IBD suggests that leading stocks could fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times as much. This means corrections of anywhere from 7.5% to 12.5%, possibly more.

One Sector To Watch Like A Hawk
-------------------------------



IBD's homebuilding industry group, visible on a chart as G1520 in [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?intcode=lgnv%7Clgnv%7CMarketSmith%7C2023%7C06%7Cmsp%7Cna%7C%7C725068&src=A00653), fell 3.9% on Wednesday and tested support at its 50-day moving average. The decline from this industry group's peak on April 1 has already exceeded 7%.


Within this group, **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and construction sector cousin stock **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) have sculpted beautiful runs in recent years. Now, all three are fighting to hold their own 50-day lines.

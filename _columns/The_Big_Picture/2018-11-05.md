  On Eve Of U.S. Elections, Nasdaq Falls But Shows These Bullish Colors

Major U.S. indexes traded mixed on Monday, and Wall Street continued to show a highly defensive streak. Yet a close look at the stock market's internals indicates some bullish color emerging on the cheeks of the badly beaten down Nasdaq.




The Nasdaq composite started the day in an awful mood. It took less than an hour after the opening bell for the leading index for growth stocks to fall nearly 1.4%. But after that, investors shed their bearish clothing. A slow yet steady recovery helped pull the Nasdaq off session lows and end the day down less than 0.4%.


Other key indexes did much better, but that was in large part due to a renewed hunger for defensive and steady-Eddy type blue chips. Look at the top 20 industry groups among the 197 tracked by IBD, and you'll see that tobacco, TV and radio, soap and food preparation stocks wrung out decent gains.

A strong ISM nonmanufacturing survey for October (at 60.3 vs. the 59.1 Econoday forecast) gave fresh clues that the economy is expanding still.


As crude oil rebounded some, numerous oil-related groups surged. Homebuilding, heavy construction, alcoholic beverage, steel, meat and health insurance companies led the upside.


Bullish Colors
--------------


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq showed some positive elements that may indicate that we may not be headed into bear-market territory anytime soon.


Consider the advance-decline line, printed each day on the General Market indicators page at the bottom of the Big Picture column. After falling hard for five weeks in a row, the A-D line rebounded some last week. That's coincided with a bounce in the Nasdaq.


New lows on the Nasdaq still outnumber new highs. Yet in the prior two sessions, Nasdaq new lows fell to 60 on Thursday and 61 on Friday. That's a big dip from the 505 issues that slumped to new lows on Oct. 24.

Finally, some consumer and retail-oriented names in the Nasdaq are taking up some of the slack seen by the index's tech stalwarts. **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) is the latest example. The coffeehouse chain delivered a bullish gap up on Friday following double-digit quarterly gains in both earnings per share and revenue. With an $87 billion market cap, the Seattle-based firm is among the biggest 25 names on the Nasdaq in terms of market value.


Starbucks last week joined [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) after its new breakout.


The Dow Jones Industrials Outweigh An Apple Loss
------------------------------------------------


Eleven of the Dow industrials' 30 components lifted 1 point or more. They offset a nearly 6-point sell-off in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), still one of the best big-cap turnarounds since late 2016.


Despite the severe drop, Apple still boasts a 19% year-to-date gain. At the session's low of 198.17, the iPhone giant had dropped 15.1% from its all-time peak of 233.47. That's perfectly normal for a stock that's ready to form a new base. But Apple is close to erasing all gains from its prior 194.30 buy point.


Since its breakout from a bottoming base all the way back on Jan. 6, 2017, Apple is actually still up 78% from a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point.


In contrast, the Dow utility average rolled ahead 1.4% on Monday. Yet at 734, its gain since Jan. 1 is still less than 2%, excluding dividends.


While Apple is in no immediate position to break out in the future, its large-cap peers in the Big Cap 20 are in relatively better shape.


Looking at the [current list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) (as seen on page B17 in IBD Weekly), the average Big Cap 20 stock stands just 7% below its 52-week or all-time high. The median drop is actually less at around 5%.


More than half of the [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) are up 20% or more since Jan. 1. They include **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) (up 21%), **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) (up 26%), **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) (up 26%), **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) (up 43%) and **IAC/Interactive** ([IAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAC)) (up 62%).


Watch And Wait
--------------


Volume fell sharply on both major exchanges. That likely surprised no one. The wait-and-see tone will likely continue through Tuesday's action as investors still weigh the consequences of a U.S. midterm election that could end the Republican Party's majority rule in both sides of Congress.


Some observers noted that a new Rasmussen telephone survey found that Republicans gained a one-percentage-point lead over Democrats, and that may have helped spur the Nasdaq's rebound Monday. Yet few would doubt that the race will be close in many hotly contested districts across the land.


And even if the Democrats enjoy a major victory, would that knock off the wheels of this historic bull run? Not necessarily. After the Republicans gained control of the House during the 1994 midterm elections, stocks slid a bit more but then turned up late December that same year. Stocks enjoyed brisk gains over the next 10 months.


After The Elections, Focus On Interest Rates
--------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, the path of future rate hikes will likely dominate investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve will announce its view on interest rates after a two-day meeting ends on Thursday. Virtually no one expects the U.S. central bank to raise rates for a fourth time this year. But the CME Group's FedWatch tool of futures trading continues to point at a more than 75% probability that the Fed funds rate on overnight bank loans will go up another quarter point to a range of 2.25%-2.5% in December.


That level doesn't seem high compared to historic peaks in the past 40 years. A gradual rise in rates gives the Fed some ammunition to ease monetary policy when the next recession hits the economy.

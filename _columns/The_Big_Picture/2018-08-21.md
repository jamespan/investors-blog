S&P 500 Fades After Its Record High, And 2 Factors Favoring The Market Since May
=================================================================================

The stock market reached important milestones including a record high Tuesday, suggesting that investors face a smoother runway with few obstacles. However, action by the S&P 500 hinted that a pause may be due.




The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and made a record high during the session. The index topped the Jan. 26 prior high of 2872.87 around midday but faded as the day progressed. Stocks started losing steam after news reports that Michael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer, [reached a plea deal with prosecutors](https://www.investors.com/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-fixer-pleads-guilty/).


The deal threatens to add pressure on a White House that's dealing with an investigation into Russian election meddling. Shortly later, a jury found Paul Manafort, Trump's one-time campaign manager, [guilty on eight counts of fraud](https://www.investors.com/politics/paul-manafort-found-guilty-8-counts/).


The afternoon fade trimmed what had been a 0.6% increase for the S&P 500. That left the index near session lows and it marked a stalling day. That's a type of [distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), and might signal a pause in the market's four-day rally.

There was glory for the Russell 2000, even if the S&P 500 overshadowed it. The small-cap benchmark surged 1.1% and made its own record high. The Russell 2000 impressively kept its gains while other indexes faded.


Wall Street watchers said the S&P 500 on Tuesday tied the record for longest bull market. The current bull run started with a low on March 9, 2009, and has equaled the 1990s bull market.


Transportation stocks also shined, as the Dow transports rose 0.7% to the highest level since December 2010. Advancers led decliners by a 9-4 margin on the Nasdaq and by nearly 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The homebuilders industry group was up the most, 4.9%, after **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) gapped up sharply on an [earnings report that beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/housing-crisis-toll-bros-earnings-toll-bros-stock-soars/). Homebuilding stocks remain deep in price corrections, and the group still ranks near the bottom.


Defensive industries such as tobacco, utilities, soaps, REITs and food-related companies were among the weakest groups.


Instead, the market embraced risk. Semiconductors rebounded as the Philadelphia semiconductor index rose back above the 200-day moving average with a 2% jump. But the index remains below the 50-day line.


Stocks Trend Higher, Less Volatile
----------------------------------


After a superb January, the stock market turned sharply lower and more volatile in February. The choppy action continued for much of the spring. But since the early May lows, the major indexes have behaved much better. Indexes have trended higher, they've held above the 50-day moving average and volatility has diminished.


In the volatile period from the Jan. 26 market peak to the May 3 low, the average daily price swing of the S&P 500 was 1.6%. Since then, the average price swing on the S&P 500 is 0.7%.


Wall Street was surely spooked earlier this year by the threat of a full-blown trade war, a flattening yield curve, lofty valuations and other concerns. President Trump made Wall Street happy on one side by pushing through a big cut in corporate taxes, but also made investors uncomfortable with tariffs and criticism of the Fed's interest-rate hikes.


Still, the market has been able to brush off most worries, even if tariffs have acutely hurt specific companies. There's favorable indications for the market outlook. The U.S. economy shows little sign of wear. Earnings continue to hum. The U.S. market is outperforming foreign markets.


Best of all, there's been a good crop of leading stocks that have climbed from buy points and created new bases.


The IBD 50 is up more than 17% this year, almost the same increase it had at this same time last year. Compared with the S&P 500, [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is having a relatively better 2018. The S&P 500 had a better year-to-date performance last year (8.5% through Aug. 20) than so far this year (6.9%).


But a rising market doesn't lift all sectors equally. Sector rotation means once-hot industries fall out of favor and others emerge. Semiconductors, for example, led the market for much of this year but have struggled lately. Banks have been up and down. Energy led from April through May but has been slumping since.


Investors need to stay on top of these shifts. Study the [IBD sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-aug-20-2018/) and daily moves of [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-aug-20-2018/) for shifts. Screens such as the IBD 50, Sector Leaders, Big Cap 20 and [Stocks On The Mov](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx)e also can reveal emerging leadership.

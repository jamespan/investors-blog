Stock Market Lifts Off Lows, But Sellers Still In Control; 3 Health Care Stocks That Could Be Market Leaders
=============================================================================================================

The stock market stuck to a similar script Tuesday as early gains faded for the fourth time in five trading sessions.




Buyers lifted stock indexes off lows during the final hour of trading, but it wasn't because of falling bond yields. The 10-year Treasury yield continued its torrid ascent, up 9 basis points to 3.97% just after 4 p.m. ET.


It'll be interesting to see how the 10-year yield reacts if or when it gets to the psychological 4% level. Will it be a ceiling, where an oversold bond market finally starts to rally? That could be the fuel for a stock market rally. Or will the 10-year yield plow through the 4% level with ease as an oversold bond market stays oversold?


Stock Market Today
------------------


The third day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq composite saw the index pare a 2.2% early gain to a gain of 0.2% by the close. Volume fell. The Nasdaq's rally attempt is still intact because the index is still holding above Friday's low. Still, the weak close reminded investors that sellers are still lurking.


Advancing stocks had a tiny edge over decliners on the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP092722-258x300.jpg)The S&P 500 undercut Friday's low, falling 0.2%, and killing its nascent rally attempt. The benchmark index also undercut its June 17 low, a key technical level. On the NYSE, declining stocks had a slight edge over advancers.


Fertilizer stocks **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) and **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) were among the top gainers in the index. CF stock is holding support at its 200-day moving average, but its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) has slumped to E, the worst possible, hurt by several higher-volume declines in recent weeks. Mosaic rallied just over 4%, but it's in worse shape than CF stock after gapping below its converged 50- and 200-day lines on Friday.


**Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) also outperformed in the S&P 500, but the solar leader had a hard time holding gains like most other stocks. ENPH stock halved a 7.3% intraday gain.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which undercut its June 17 low Friday, fell for the sixth straight session, down another 0.4%. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) added 0.3%.


Stock Market Digests Economic News
----------------------------------


In economic news, August durable goods orders fell 0.2%, less than 0.4% decline in economists' consensus estimate. Excluding transportation, orders rose 0.2% just above the 0.1% consensus. Three other economic reports also came in above expectations, including August new-home sales, The Conference Board's consumer confidence for September and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing index.


At this point, the Federal Reserve wants to see weaker economic data. If the economy can slow on its own, that would take pressure off the Fed to raise rates aggressively. As it stands now, the [CME Group FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) tool shows federal funds futures traders still leaning toward another 125 basis points in hikes this year. That would bring the fed funds rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.

Fear has been on the rise in the stock market, making the bulls feel better about the possibility for a tradable rally. The Cboe Volatility index shot up 9.4% Friday and another 7.8% Monday. The put-call volume ratio on Friday hit 1.26, which is considered an excessively fearful reading.


Last week, the Investors Intelligence survey of stock market newsletter writers showed bullish sentiment at 30%, pretty much where it was in March 2020 just before a major market bottom. This year's low is 26.5%.


Even if major stock indexes flash a sign of strength with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) in coming days, it won't be a sign to move aggressively move back into the market. Why? Because growth screens still aren't yielding much in the way of prospects. Stocks bucking the trend and showing strength when the market is down are tempting to buy. But a weak market eventually takes everything down with it. Avoid the temptation of buying stocks holding up well. It's an easy way to get chopped up, even if you're taking small losses.


Stocks To Watch
---------------


**Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)) offers a good example. The stock might have looked actionable when it was up more than 2% early Tuesday, making a good case for support at the 50-day moving average. The medical supplies distributor ended higher by 0.7% but closed in the bottom half of its range.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) gapped above its 50-day moving average and ended near its session high in strong volume.


From a technical perspective, Dick's looks solid but fundamentals are tepid at best. Earnings and revenue declined for two straight quarters. Meanwhile, earnings are expected to fall 27% in its current fiscal 2023, with growth edging higher in fiscal 2024, up 4%.


In the biotech group, **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is trying to break out over a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) as it forms a flat base. Shares rose nearly 3%, but Vertex closed below its 50-day line, even with a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) at new highs.



**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) is in a similar setup, near highs and forming a flat base but just below its 50-day line.

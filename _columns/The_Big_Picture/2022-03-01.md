Stock Market Trips On Inflation, Russia Concerns; How One Strategist Views Sentiment Indicators Today
======================================================================================================

As Russia's invasion of Ukraine approaches a second week, the stock market got off to a bearish start in March. Yet, could this month lead to at least a little more certainty on the economy?




On the one hand, you've got worries that an extended conflict in Eastern Europe could further tighten snarls in certain global supply chains and lead to runaway inflation, particularly in energy commodities. On Tuesday, U.S. crude oil futures spiked past $106 a barrel. And on the other hand, you've got evidence that the U.S. economy is not teetering on the edge of recession. Just see the robust data and new orders on the manufacturing front as reported by the [Institute for Supply Management](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) on Tuesday morning.


Meanwhile, some top growth stocks are hinting that the recent sell-off could be overdone.


Coming Back?
------------


**Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) just [announced solid quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/target-stock-target-earnings-nordstrom-urban-outffiters-ross-stores/) (earnings up 19% for the January period, on top of 58% EPS growth in the year-ago quarter). Shares in the blue chip retailer popped back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time in nearly three months.


The company also unveiled plans to boost minimum pay for its workers and add additional health care benefits. The stock is basing in normal fashion after a mammoth run following an August 2020 breakout from a [large cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/) at 126.07.



Nonetheless, investors continue to show highly defensive stripes.


With more stocks still falling than rising, to be a successful stock picker in the stock market today likely means you're laser-focused on the handful of sectors that are actually rising amid the broad decline.


Finance was a winner in 2021; no longer. Today, oil and gas, agriculture, metals, shipping and chemicals are essentially the only bullish pools for fishing.


Keep a close eye on future changes in the sector rankings of [IBD's stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-feb-28-2022/). It's perhaps most befitting to see "Miscellaneous" as the No. 1 sector in terms of mid- and long-term relative price performance, at least as of early Tuesday.


Small Caps Lead Stock Market Decline
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP030122-198x300.jpg)


While the Nasdaq composite, Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each cut 1.5% to 1.8% lower, small caps did a bit worse. Both the Russell 2000 and the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund lopped off 1.9% on Tuesday.


Early data shows losing stocks outmatch winners nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by more than a 3-2 margin on the NYSE.


Money rushed even more into safe U.S. Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year bond now yields 1.71%; according to U.S. Treasury data, the 10-year yield began 2022 at 1.63%, then rose to as high as 2.05% on Feb. 15.


Fear is certainly growing over the possibility of stagflation, even if it won't exactly mirror the state of the U.S. economy and financial markets during the 1970s. And in terms of monetary policy, there couldn't be more difference between then and now. Many economists and strategists think the Federal Reserve will ratchet up the fed funds rate (or what big money center banks pay for overnight loans from the U.S. central bank) to a range of 1.75% to 2% by year's end.


However, the [CME FedWatch futures market tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html#) now sees a virtually 100% likelihood that the Fed will raise the cost of money by only a quarter point during its March 16 announcement.


Keep an eye out for a new speech scheduled for Wednesday by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and any hints of a change in his recently hawkish tone on interest rates.

Last week, the [Investors Intelligence bulls vs. bears survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) noted the continued severe drop in bullishness among newsletter writers. On IBD Live, panelists have also focused on the big decline in bullishness of the AAII weekly survey of its individual investor members.


But do these figures point to an immediate turnaround in the market? Not exactly.


Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab and a 35-year veteran observer of the equity markets, points out that contrarian market indicators carry meaning only when you have a catalyst that convinces the herd of institutional and individual investors that they are wrong about their stance on stocks.


"The catalyst needs to create an outsized move in the market. Think of the example of everyone being on one side of the boat. Then the wind blows," Sonders told IBD. That said, she does note an interesting change in the level of bullishness among so-called "dumb money" traders today vs. 2020 and 2021. Whereas two years ago, the "dumb money" confidence level as tracked by research firm SentimenTrader was fairly positive, now it's dived to 25%. Meanwhile, the "smart money" traders now show a 75% bullishness level.


"This is a very wide margin," Sonders said.


According to Sonders, SentimenTrader makes the distinction between dumb and smart money by looking at activity in the equity options market for the former and put and call options trading in OEX and commercial hedger positions in the equity index futures market for the latter.

Meanwhile, military contractors saw even more heavy buying on Tuesday.


**Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) jumped another 3.2% as volume grew 146% above normal levels.Â That gain padded holders' profits from a breakout at 409.07 to 11%. Shares are now extended past the 5% buy zone.


**General Dynamics** ([GD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GD)) has spurted 13% past a 209.18 proper entry in a well-carved cup with handle. **Raytheon Technologies** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)) has also gotten extended past a "draw-the-line" David Ryan-style breakout near 92. ([Watch IBD Live on Tuesdays](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) and other days to learn more about draw-the-line breakout points.)


At least 14 companies within IBD's aerospace and defense industry group show a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 90 or higher. Use MarketSmith or [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) to see the leaders of this group and all 196 other industries.


But **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) continues to lag. Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 38 reflects necessary improvement. The stock has also gotten rejected at its 200-day moving average since late September.


In the fertilizer stocks patch, **Nutrien** ([NTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTR)) reversed for a 1.2% loss in heavy volume. The stock has [violated an upper channel](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-channel-lines-for-sell-signals/?), hinting that the stock market leader has gotten overbought in the near term.

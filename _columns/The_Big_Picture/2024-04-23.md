The Nasdaq composite rallied sharply in higher volume Tuesday after the stock market kicked off the week with strong gains Monday.




The Russell 2000 extended its winning streak to three sessions, rising 1.8%. Strong gainers in the small-cap index included sporting goods chain **Hibbett** ([HIBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIBB)), which is being acquired by U.K.-based JD Sports for $1.1 billion.


**Sweetgreen** ([SG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SG)) also outperformed in the Russell 2000, soaring 9.5% in strong volume. The fast-casual restaurant chain is getting support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) for the first time after gapping up on earnings March 1. Notice how the breakout came in heavy volume and the pullback to the 10-week line was in light volume. That's picture-perfect price action.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite also performed well, up 1.6% on the second day of its rally attempt. Volume rose from Monday, indicating some conviction behind the buying. The Nasdaq 100 added 1.6% ahead of a busy week of high-profile earnings reports in the technology sector.


Results from [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) are due Wednesday after the close. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) report Thursday after the close.


Meta's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is still near highs even as the stock trades just below its 10-week moving average. Meta is expected to report another strong quarter, with adjusted profit up 47% to $4.97 a share. Revenue should be up 26% to $36.1 billion.


Microsoft is less than 6% off its high, while Alphabet is still holding in a buy zone from a 153.78 entry.


The S&P 500 rallied 1.2%, helped in part by a strong [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-aerospace-reports-first-earnings-after-spinout/) from **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)). Even though GE's stock price is well extended and it's too late to buy for now, the company's energy spinoff — **GE Vernova** ([GEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEV)) — is setting up in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). The latter reports earnings Thursday.


Volume on the NYSE was slightly lower from Monday's level.


Solid Breadth
-------------


Breadth was strong with winners beating losers on the NYSE by nearly 5-to-1. Advancers beat decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1.


The 10-year Treasury yield turned lower after hitting an early high of 4.65%. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 4.6%, down 2 basis points. The 10-year yield is still holding near highs amid a steady flow of mostly strong economic data. The Federal Reserve has been looking for signs of weakness in the labor market, but hasn't been getting them. That's caused traders to dial back rate-cut expectations.


In economic news, new-home sales in March topped expectations, but February data was revised slightly lower. The data fueled a nice move in the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)), which gained nearly 3% in higher volume.


While many homebuilders are still below their 50-day moving averages, **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), **Tri Pointe Homes** ([TPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPH)) and **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) moved above their 50-day lines Tuesday. PulteGroup beat Q1 expectations Tuesday.

The next piece of potentially market-moving economic data will be inside Friday's Personal Income & Spending report. On a year-over-year basis, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures price index is expected to come in at 2.7%, down slightly from March's reading of 2.8%. The PCE price index is one of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauges.


Patience For Now
----------------


The most challenging aspect to the stock market now is avoiding the pitfall of buying stocks that are acting well in a weak market. It's still early in the rally attempt as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 trade below their 50-day lines. But a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/) for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 could come as early as Thursday.

While top performers like **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) have flashed sell signals, there's still a large crop of leading growth stocks that are holding up well.


The accompanying Market Pulse graphic shows the current market exposure at 0%-20%. That's because the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dived through their 50-day lines last week in higher volume. The bearish action was a signal to raise cash. Exposure to stocks should be limited at this point and new buys should be handled carefully, if not avoided altogether.


 


In the aerospace and defense group, **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) jumped nearly 3% and cleared a flat base with a 200.64 buy point. It's still in the 5% buy zone that goes up to 210.67.


NVO Gives Buy Signal
--------------------



After an orderly pullback, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) rose above its 50-day line, giving an early buy signal. The drugmaker pulled back only 12% off its high, so the latest pattern qualifies as a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


Also in the health care sector, **Natera** ([NTRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRA)) is bouncing nicely off its 10-week line. The company shows impressive revenue growth as a provider of molecular testing services. Analysts expect annual losses to continue narrowing.


Enterprise software firm **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) is also making a solid first bounce off its 10-week line. So is **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) in the oil and gas sector.

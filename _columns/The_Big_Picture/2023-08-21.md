  Nasdaq Leads Stock Market Higher Despite Rising Yields; Can Nvidia Reignite The Market?

The Nasdaq composite rallied Monday as the stock market tried to snap out of a three-week losing streak even as Treasury yields continued to climb.




The 10-year Treasury yield rose to the highest since Nov. 6, 2007. Higher yields tend to hurt technology companies more because they rely heavily on borrowing. Yet, the tech-heavy Nasdaq led Monday's market with a 1.6% increase.


**Palo Alto Networks**' ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) post-earnings gap helped cybersecurity stocks boost the Nasdaq. Semiconductors also showed up for the composite, which had its best day since July 28.


The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, while the IBD 50 index added 0.3%.


Although it closed 0.1% lower, the Dow Jones Industrial Average accomplished a small victory by holding above Friday's low. The Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.2% decline.


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq from Friday's totals — a sign that institutional investors weren't quite convinced the market is rebounding.


Stock Market Attempting Rally
-----------------------------


With Monday's gains, the stock market is kindling a rally attempt — and a possible bottom.


Friday's close in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 near session highs counted as the first day of a rally attempt. Monday's action added to that emerging rally. As long as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 don't undercut their Friday lows, the market has chance for a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) as early as this week.


The stock market has few catalysts this week. Still, the market doesn't necessarily need a catalyst to rally.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP082123-274x300.jpg)For now, investors should be scanning [IBD screens](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). Relatively few stocks are forming bases, but more are testing or finding support after pulling back to their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Today's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch selection](https://www.investors.com/research/growth-stock-rises-47-percent-since-pulling-out-of-elon-musk-twitter-deal/), **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)), is one example.


The biggest event of the week could be Friday. That's when Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a conference of central bank leaders in Jackson Hole, Wyo.


"While last year's speech from Chairman Powell caused a strong market reaction, it is possible that reactions to his speech this year may reinforce the idea of a slow and steady market instead," Nationwide Chief of Investment Research Mark Hackett said in a note Monday. "Boring is beautiful this week."


Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, also doesn't expect Powell to change his tone.


"As we have noted previously, the Fed, and investors, will soon pivot from a focus on how high the policy rate will go to a concern about how long they will stay at that level — and what the implications are for a 'higher for longer' scenario," Nixon wrote in a report. "In our view, Powell will want to stay on message, and will try to push back against a growing market consensus that rate cuts are on the 2024 horizon."


The [U.S. economic calendar](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) is fairly light until then.


Nvidia In Stock Market's Focus
------------------------------


The earnings calendar is lighter this week, too. But **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) [results after the close Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvda-stock-will-nvidia-earnings-live-up-to-hype/) figure to get the most attention this week. This year's AI stock rally arguably started with Nvidia's last earnings report on May 24. At that time, the company cited bulging demand for artificial intelligence chips. Investors will be keen to learn details on that trend.



Bullish sentiment is already building in Nvidia. The stock rallied 8.5% Monday as it neared a record high. HSBC raised its price target to 780 from 600, while KeyBanc Capital Markets raised its price target to 620 from 550.


Even if the stock market can continue to rebound, investors are still rotating out of some of the prior leading areas.


Homebuilders is one of those industries falling out of favor. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **K.B. Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **Green Brick Partners** ([GRBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRBK)), **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)), **Hovnanian** ([HOV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOV)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) suddenly broke below support at their 50-day moving averages last week.


The group has been in the top 10 of IBD's 197 groups for multiple weeks, but its best stocks are showing fatigue.


Travel Trade Weakens
--------------------


Airlines, hotels, travel services and others that have been part of the lucrative travel trade are also weakening.


**Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) and **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) are below their 50-day lines. In lodging, **Choice Hotels** ([CHH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHH)), **Hyatt** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) and **Wyndham Hotels & Resorts** ([WH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WH)) have been pulling back for a couple of weeks.


The airlines industry group has fallen to No. 98 in industry rank from No. 23 four weeks ago. **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), **Copa** ([CPA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPA)), **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), **American Airlines Group** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) and **Allegiant Travel** ([ALGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGT)) are some of the carriers now trading below the 50-day line.


Eventually, new leadership takes over. But so far, the new leadership is elusive. Most IBD industry group charts are in downtrends of at least a couple of weeks old, or at best trying to bottom out.


Energy-related groups remain mostly in uptrends. Wholesale electronics, telecom services, diversified medical, insurance brokers and heavy construction also are largely in uptrends.

Stocks, bond yields, and virtually all commodities, anyone? On Wednesday, the action showed bullish overtones, reaffirming that since January the stock market for now is keeping a bullish outlook.




Of course, there's always a wall of worries to scale.


America just has 14 calendar days to seal a government deal to prevent a default in U.S. government bonds. The chances of a fourth straight quarter-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year is edging a bit higher. And as one special guest put it on the [IBD Live Tuesday episode](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), the stock market continues to be either a gold mine or a land mine thanks to earnings.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Yet technically, there's still room for much needed improvement. Therefore, gradually expanding positions or adding a touch more money into your best stocks remains the best course of action.


Emboldened by a favorable report on increasing deposits at **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), smaller banks gushed higher.


Among the top performing industry groups, at least five hailed from the banking sector and rose 3% or more. Superregionals paced the financial sector's move, up 6.1% on a price-weighted basis. Only life insurance did even better, rising more than 11%. Their rebound led the Russell 2000's 2.2% advance on Wednesday, best among the key stock market indexes.


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2% to 1.3% each. At 12,500, the Nasdaq stretched its stock market leadership in 2023 with a 19.4% gain.


Volume rose more than 10% vs. the prior session in both main exchanges — exactly what you'd like to see on a solid up day. With indexes improving, IBD Wednesday raised its recommended market exposure to 40%-60%. It was previously 20%-40%.

Treasurys Dumped
----------------



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP051723--216x300.jpg)Meanwhile, institutions ditched long-dated U.S. government bonds again. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond rose 3 basis points to 3.58%, the highest close since April 19.


Light sweet crude oil futures jumped 2.5% to $72.62 a barrel while copper rebounded 2.2%.


According to TradingEconomics.com, lumber futures jumped 1.5% while iron ore and steel both rallied 0.5%. But soybeans and wheat fell hard. The Baltic Dry Index has been treading water lately after breaking a roughly nine-month downtrend in March.


Go to a daily chart of the Nasdaq. Since March 31, the tech-enriched index and historical bastion of big stock market winners has now tallied at least 10 sessions in which it rose in either above-average volume or higher turnover vs. the prior session.


How about the Nasdaq 100?


As represented by the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), it shows at least seven such instances of positive price-and-volume action. Meanwhile, QQQ has maintained a cushion above its 50-day moving average for nearly 10 weeks.


That's the longest streak since a roughly 15-week span that took place from June 4 to Sept. 17, 2021.


Back To The Banks
-----------------


Western Alliance pierced the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) toward the upside for the first time in two months. It's too early to know that the operator of the Bank of Nevada has bottomed, though. Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) is homely at a 4 on a scale of 1 to 99.


The three-month RS Rating, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), is not much better, standing at an 8.



**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)), which also has reported growth in its deposits this year, has a 14 RS Rating. Wednesday's 3.4% lift took shares to a two-week high.


Amid the SVB Financial and Signature Bank implosion, Schwab plunged to as low as 45 in March. To its credit, the stock survived a test of that round number last month. Yet the large-cap financial services play remains above its steeply downward-sloping 50-day moving average.


Perhaps the unintended consequence of the Federal Reserve's rapid monetary tightening campaign since March 2022 — that is, the destruction of banks that could not manage the flight of customer deposits to higher-yield money market funds — has at least one silver lining. You'd be hard pressed to find an investor sentiment indicator that's screaming bullishness. And that's good. Why? Investors who are bearish are mostly in cash and want the market to prove they're smart to avoid equities.


However, as a bull market shows muscle, these naysayers eventually must concede that the trend is upward. They become future buyers in the stock market.


In the week ended May 10, the American Association of Individual Investors survey showed a dearth of bullish individual investors (at 29.4%). Meanwhile, the AAII's survey also showed neutral investors at 29.4% and bearish traders at 41.2%.


Fed Hawks Speak
---------------


Several key Federal Reserve officials made speeches that indicate a higher chance the U.S. central bank will raise rates for a fourth time this year.


In a speech on Tuesday, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Lorie Logan maintained a bias toward monetary tightening. Logan indicated she might favor putting a hold on rate hikes in June, then resuming them in July, according to Japan investment bank Nomura.


Nomura also concluded that Loretta Mester, chief of the Cleveland Fed, has shifted "to a more hawkish direction relative to her previous comments."


"She appeared to be open to a pause in June, but said that the Fed was not at that hold rate yet, opening the door for resuming rate hikes in the future if required, in our view," Aichi Amemiya and Jacob Meyer, Nomura economists covering North America, wrote in a note sent to IBD.


As of Wednesday, the CME FedWatch tool noted a 29% probability of the fed funds rate — what the Fed charges big lenders for overnight cash infusions — going up a quarter point to a 5.25%-5.5% target range at the June 13-14 FOMC meeting. Just a week ago, there was only a 0.4% chance.


The Treasury bond yield curve remains grossly inverted, a negative for lending and future economic growth.


As of Wednesday, the 3-month T-bill showed a yield of 5.26%, little changed for May so far, vs. 4.12% for the 2-year bond and 3.96% for 20-year notes, according to Treasury.gov.

Three Obstacles For Stock Market
--------------------------------


What's needed to drive stocks higher? Stock market internals remains iffy for both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. While preliminary data showed a 5-2 ratio in favor of winning stocks over losing ones on the Nasdaq, more than three stocks advanced for every stock that declined on the NYSE.


If this were to continue, then you might see a notable shift in the trend of the Nasdaq and NYSE's advance-decline line. (Please monitor this via the General Market Indicators page linked at the bottom of every Big Picture column.)


Second, every new bull market needs fresh blood. But the IPO market has been on life support for months.


According to [IBD's Psychological Indicators table](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DailyPsycho_051623.pdf), located in IBD Data Tables, new issues as a percentage of NYSE issues remains pitifully low at 3.2%. The five-year high: 17.2% on Nov. 19, 2021.



In this light, [IBD Sector Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) **Lantheus** ([LNTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNTH)) is a precious growth stock within the stock market today. It came public in June 2015. Admittedly, that's not very new. Yet from its 2016 low near 2, the stock has powered almost 50-fold.


Now, 100 is a key resistance level to watch.


Lantheus is a key innovator in prostate cancer testing. Earnings plunged in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic to 47 cents a share. Today, the Street sees earnings rising 32% this year to $5.58 a share and up 10% to $6.13 in 2024.


Finally, keep a razor-sharp eye on near-term resistance levels, especially with the S&P 500.


The large-cap benchmark, up 8.3% year to date, still has not hurdled over resistance near 4200. What will be the catalyst that sends the S&P 500 sailing past the May 1 high of 4186.92, or the 4195.44 peak of Feb. 2?

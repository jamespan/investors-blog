Stocks kept to a narrow range Friday, but top-rated stocks showed strong action.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each added 0.2%. The small-cap S&P 600 did somewhat better, rising 0.4%.


The IBD 50, though, led the pack, jumping 1.1%.


Strength in the IBD 50 and among small caps is a good sign. In a healthy uptrend, top-rated stocks lead. And small caps can reflect the market's appetite for risk.


Volume rose on both major exchanges. Friday was an expiration day for single stock and stock index futures and options, which routinely bumps up volume.


The market remains in a confirmed uptrend, and so far neither economic data nor international news has silenced the bulls.


News was thin Friday, with no major economic data releases. In Iraq, fighting continued but the situation was largely unchanged.


The market's reaction to Iraq has been restrained, perhaps because the potential impact on oil prices may be limited. Market watchers note that the Saudis could pump more oil if needed, and the U.S. could lift its 1973 ban on most oil exports.


The U.S. oil export ban doesn't extend to Canada, and the government waives the export ban on an ad hoc basis.


So, the market appears to be acknowledging that the world has tools to wield if the Iraq chaos dents the oil supply or boosts oil prices to dangerous levels.


Although the stock indexes showed virtually no price movement Friday, leading stocks were a different story. Two top-rated stocks broke out in fast trade.


**KapStone Paper and Packaging** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)) cleared a 32.02 buy point in a classic-looking cup-with-handle. While shaping the base, KapStone undercut the low of the previous base, resetting the base count to stage one. An early-stage breakout is more likely to work than a move out of a late-stage pattern.


**Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) also broke out. However, the consolidation is sloppy and is fourth-stage.


Several stocks showed solid follow-up action to recent breakouts. They included **GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)), **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)).


For the week, the IBD 50 rose 3.4%, the S&P 500 1.4% and the Nasdaq 1.3%. The small-cap S&P 600 added 1.8%.


The iShares **Gold Trust** ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)) rocked 2.8% higher for the week. Meanwhile, the iPath **Dow Jones Copper Subindex** ([JJC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JJC)) popped 3%. Copper is often seen as a gauge of economic health.

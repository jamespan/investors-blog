Small caps outperformed by a wide margin in the stock market Tuesday, while price action was quieter in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite.




The Russell 2000 small-cap index gapped up and rose 1.4%. The index is less than 1% from a 52-week high, but it remains well below its November 2021 high of 2,458.86.


The Nasdaq composite snapped a modest two-session slide and rose 0.4% as it battles near the 16,000 level. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by less than 2-to-1, with volume coming in very close to Monday's level. The index continues to be a pillar of strength, refusing to give up much ground after gapping up Thursday in strong volume.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq 100 added 0.2% as it tries to conquer the 18,000 level. But what's troubling about this index is that its relative strength line has really started to flatten out. Notice how the Nasdaq 100 hit an all-time high on Feb. 12 and briefly topped the 18,000 level, but the relative strength line didn't confirm with a new high of its own. The same thing happened on Friday when the index once again tried to top the 18,000 level.


Â 


The Dow Jones industrials lagged with a loss of just over 0.2%, but like the Nasdaq, it's still holding above its 10-day line. The blue-chip index was weighed down by a drop of nearly 3% for **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)). Shares were weak after **Viking Therapeutics** ([VKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VKTX)) [reported positive results for a weight-loss drug](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/viking-therapeutics-skyrockets-on-weight-loss-drug-trial-results/) in a mid-stage trial. Amgen is also developing a weight-loss drug to compete in a market that some analysts estimate could be worth up to $100 billion.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) continues to see strong demand for its weight-loss blockbuster Wegovy. The stock fell 3% early but pared the loss to 1% by the close.


**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) also lagged in the blue-chip index, down 1.5%, on reports late Monday that **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) might challenge the company's $53 billion acquisition of **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)).


Apple Turns Higher
------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reversed higher in the Dow Jones as it holds support the 180 level. Sentiment turned positive after the company said it will [abandon plans to build an electric car](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/why-apple-hit-brakes-on-autonomous-electric-vehicle-project/) and instead focus on artificial intelligence.


The S&P 500 picked up 0.2% in higher volume. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by about 3-to-2.

The next big economic report for the stock market to digest is a key reading on inflation inside Thursday's Personal Income and Spending report. On a year-over-year basis, the personal consumption expenditures index is expected to fall to 2.4%, down from December's reading of 2.6%. Core prices are expected to dip to 2.8% from 2.9%.


The major stock indexes fell sharply on Feb. 13 after the latest Consumer Price index showed inflation going in the wrong direction. A few days later, the Producer Price index also showed hotter-than-expected inflation.


What To Do Now
--------------


While the stock market uptrend continues to show signs of strength, actionable stocks remain in short supply. That's because current stock market leaders that started to move in late October and early November are way past proper entry points. In many cases, stocks setting up now could be laggards in their group.


Perhaps the best opportunities will come when the big leaders pull back to their 10-week lines for the first time after breaking out of bases.


If you've trimmed some recent winners and have cash to put to work, be discerning when it comes to new buys. If you see a stock setting up in a base, make sure it's a leader in its group. In some cases, it may not be. True stock market leaders will usually have Relative Strength Ratings of at least 80. The biggest leaders will have RS Ratings of 95-99.


Market Movers
-------------


**Shift4** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)), a provider of payment processing technology, reversed higher after an initial negative response to earnings. Shares fell more than 6% in early trading, but the stock rebounded for a gain of nearly 6%. FOUR stock cleared a 68.17 handle buy point during the week of Dec. 15 when shares jumped more than 9% in strong volume. But a Relative Strength Rating of 80 as of Monday's close is lukewarm compared to a big leader in the group like **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) (89 RS Rating).


In the aerospace and defense group, small cap **Embraer** ([ERJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERJ)) gave a buy signal early in the session by moving above its Jan. 31 high of 18.85. The Brazil-based maker of aircraft and systems closed off highs, but it's still forming a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/) with a buy point of 20.13. Embraer passes muster from a fundamental perspective as well, with two straight quarters of accelerating revenue growth.

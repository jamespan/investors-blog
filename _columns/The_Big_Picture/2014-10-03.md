Stocks popped higher Friday as the major indexes built a small cushion above their recent lows.


The Nasdaq added 1%, while the S&P 500 chipped in 1.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 trailed with a 0.7% gain.


The IBD 50 leapt 2.1%.


Volume dropped on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Advancers led declining issues by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


Although the market showed decent action in the past two sessions, a new uptrend hasn't been confirmed. Individual investors should wait for a follow-through day to confirm that an uptrend is underway.


The goal is not to pick the low but to re-enter with the odds in the longs' favor. Buying early without the general market's imprimatur is a hope built on a wish that could lead to regrets.


For individual investors who have monitored the market carefully the past year or two, recent market action has a been-there, done-that quality.


If the Nasdaq's low Thursday holds, the 5.3% drop off the high will match the average drawdown in the previous seven downturns. Rebounds off those lows varied from 7% to 13%, with the average gain being about 10%.


The market won't necessarily follow that small-ball pattern, but individual investors should be ready in case it does.


Meanwhile, keeping cash on the sidelines — in case the correction drives deeper — is prudent. In 2012, the Nasdaq suffered pullbacks of 13% and 12%.


Ideally, a bullish breaking of the market's small-ball pattern would be most welcome.


And unlike some investment strategies that are tied to valuation constraints, the IBD approach can navigate a market melt upwards. It achieves this by trying to take advantage of favorable times in the market and in leading stocks.


Regardless of what happens, individual investors should work on watch lists. Look for stocks with strong fundamentals and favorable relative strength lines, signs of base building or constructive action near the 10-week line.


On Friday, restaurant chain **Brinker International** ([EAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EAT)), operator of Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy, broke out of a double bottom with handle.


**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) broke out from a somewhat sloppy consolidation.


Stocks making new highs in strong volume included **Vasco Data Security International** ([VDSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDSI)) and **Canadian Pacific Railway** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)).


Economic news Friday was generally favorable. September payrolls were unexpectedly strong. The jobless rate's dip to 5.9% grabbed the headlines, but it was a hollow accomplishment. The participation rate edged down from 62.8% in August to 62.7% in September — the lowest level since February 1978.


For the week, the small-cap Russell 2000 lost 2.1%, while the IBD 50 shed 1.3%, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 0.8% each and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.6%.


The coming week marks the start of the Q3 earnings season. Results could help define this market. **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) reports Tuesday; **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) on Wednesday; and **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) and **Family Dollar Stores** ([FDO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDO)) on Thursday.

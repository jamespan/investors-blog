The Nasdaq outperformed in a seesaw session Thursday. Positive sentiment was fueled by better-than-expected earnings from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


In the first few minutes of trading, the Nasdaq soared more than 1%, but the tech-heavy index reversed sharply, giving back all of its gain. Reports of escalating violence in Ukraine was the main culprit.


The Nasdaq ended with a 0.5% gain, but it was a mostly sluggish performance as declining stocks topped advancers by a 3-to-2 margin. The S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average was unchanged. NYSE and Nasdaq volume came in higher than Wednesday's level.


The top performing stock index was the Nasdaq 100. It rose 1%, helped by an 8% gain in Apple. Apple is the highest-weighted stock in the index, nearly 12%. 


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is the second-highest-weighted stock at just over 8%. Its shares jumped nearly 3% in Thursday's after-hours session after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. The stock is firming up at its 10-week moving average after a recent breakout over 38.58.


With the market in a correction, the bear case for stocks holds water, but the bull case is helped by the fact that the S&P 500 is above its 50-day moving average and less than 1% off its high.


The Nasdaq flashed a sign of strength on Tuesday, rising 1% in higher volume, but it's still below its 50-day moving average.


Growth stocks, by in large, continue to face selling pressure. Many are working on potential bases, but it's still too early to tell if new buy points will emerge. Renewed and clear signs of institutional buying would help their cause, but it's not happening yet.


Recent earnings reports from **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), Facebook, **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) and **Alexion** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) didn't stir much excitement despite robust bottom-line and top-line growth. All four are firmly entrenched below their 50-day moving averages.


The IBD 50 underperformed Thursday, falling 0.3%, but there are some bright spots in the list of leading growth stocks. Several components are consolidating gains constructively, including **Myriad Genetics** ([MYGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYGN)), **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)), **Air Lease** ([AL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AL)) and **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)), among others.


Other after-hours movers on earnings included **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), up 6% and **Synaptics** ([SYNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNA)), up 8%.


In economic news, orders for durable goods rose 2.6% in March, above the consensus estimate of 2%. Ex transportation, orders rose 2%, more than double the consensus estimate. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims rose to 329,000. Economists expected a smaller increase to 313,000.

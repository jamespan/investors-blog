Indexes rallied to new highs Tuesday in an advance that was broad but, curiously, lacked the participation of many of the Nasdaq's heavyweights.




 While most indexes rallied 1% or more, the Nasdaq composite rose only about half as much, or 0.5% and still enough to make a record high. Internet and chip stocks were among a handful that fell Tuesday, which contributed to the tech-laden composite's lag. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.1%. The biotech industry group, which also is concentrated in the Nasdaq, was up only a fraction.


Some of the same Nasdaq titans that have led the market this year were suspiciously absent from the rally.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fell 0.6%, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) 0.3%, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) dipped 0.2% and Alphabet reversed lower 0.8%. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), though, rose 2.1% and is rising from support at the 50-day moving average. The video streaming company also is forming a new base, with a 204.48 entry.

It's difficult to draw conclusions from the divergence, but Tuesday's gains were otherwise constructive. The S&P 500 added 1%, the Dow Jones industrial average 1.1% and the Russell 2000 kicked the doors down with a 1.5% surge. All those indexes hit new highs.


Perhaps the Santa Claus rally — a tendency for stocks to rise in the final weeks of the year — is already unfolding.


Investors did have a material reason to cheer Tuesday, when the Senate Budget Committee [approved Republicans' nearly $1.5 trillion tax cut](https://www.investors.com/news/apple-alphabet-may-be-big-winners-as-gop-tax-bill-nears-a-vote/). The package includes a massive cut in corporate taxes to 20% from 35%.


Also in Washington, confirmation hearings began on the nomination of Jerome Powell as new chairman of the Federal Reserve, and so far he is breezing through.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE, making it a day of heavy institutional buying. That's the opposite of distribution, when institutions sell heavily. The Oct. 23 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) came off the count because it's become too old to matter any more. That left the Nasdaq and S&P 500 with just a handful of distribution days.


Winners beat losers by 11-to -5 on the NYSE and by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq.


The market erased morning gains and tumbled on news that North Korea tested a missile that splashed into waters off Japan. It was the first test in two months, and most likely was an intercontinental ballistic missile. But sellers were shoved out of the way within an hour, as indexes resumed their advance with even more vigor. They closed near session highs, in fact.


Consumer stocks led the market. RVs topped the list after **Thor Industries**' ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) strong earnings sent the stock vaulting 13% to all-time highs. Airlines and many retail industry groups also were in the top 20 of 197 groups Tuesday. Thor was a recent member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx).


Banks also did well, occupying five of the top 26 IBD industry groups and subgroups Tuesday. Regional banks were solid, and even major banks such as **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) did well, rising from support at the 50-day line.


Some financials broke out. **E-Trade Financial** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)), Minnesota-based **TCF Financial** ([TCF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCF)) and **Seacoast Banking** ([SBCF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBCF)) got good volume as they topped buy points. But **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and Georgia-based **Synovus Financial** ([SNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNV)) saw light volume on their breakouts.


New issue **Aquantia** ([AQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AQ)) broke out of an IPO base. The company, which makes high-speed communications chips for networks, got a number of positive reports from Wall Street analysts following its first quarterly report as a public company.

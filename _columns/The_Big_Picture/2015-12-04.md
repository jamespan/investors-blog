Stocks Throw A Wild Party Friday, But Volume Fades In Late Afternoon
=====================================================================

Â 


Stocks partied Friday as if the previous session's sell-off was just one big misunderstanding. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each danced 2.1% higher. Small caps, though, lagged with the S&P 600 gaining only 1%.


The IBD 50 jumped 2.5%.


Volume ran higher most of the session but then faded in the final two hours to finish lower for the day.


Still, the S&P 500 easily took back its 200-day moving average line, a day after giving it up in textbook bear fashion: big percentage loss, low close and rising volume.


On Friday, the move featured a big percentage gain, a high close but ultimately lower volume. So the bulls only got part of their move to be textbook-perfect.

From late September to early November, the Nasdaq climbed about 15% and the S&P 500 about 12%. Action has been choppy since, which isn't all that surprising.


After a party, there's some tidying up to do.


The question now is whether the market's two dips since November are sufficient to allow for another healthy rise.


Economic news Friday offered encouragement. Payrolls for November came in at 211,000, about 11% more than the Street expected. The jobless rate remained unchanged at 5%, as expected.


There was an additional positive angle on jobs. The Associated General Contractors of America in a news release Friday said that construction firms added 46,000 jobs in November, which pushed the total number of construction jobs to the highest level since January 2009.


In one sense, that was good news. In another sense, it was only a reminder of how pathetic this recovery has been.


Meanwhile, OPEC ended a meeting Friday, deciding not to cut oil production. That's good or bad news, depending on who is looking at it.


Lower-priced energy should put more discretionary dollars in the hands of U.S. consumers. However, oil jobs have been lost. According to energy researcher Graves & Co., 150,000 U.S. oil jobs were lost in 2015 through August.


One factor that could yet help the bulls this month is corporate buybacks. December ties for third place as the biggest month for buybacks, according to a Goldman Sachs study.


A couple of handfuls of leaders showed signs of institutional buying Friday. **Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) cleared a late-stage consolidation in fast trading. Retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) broke out of a base in huge volume.


Leaders hitting new highs included China-based online gamer **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and insurer **Chubb** ([CB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB)).


Chip designer **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) closed in on a possible entry at its left-side high plus 10 cents, or 150.60. The pattern is first stage.


For the week, the Nasdaq and the Dow rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.1%. The IBD 50 had a wild week, showing big daily gains and losses but finishing down 0.1% for the week.


The small-cap S&P 600 trailed the major indexes, losing 1% for the week.

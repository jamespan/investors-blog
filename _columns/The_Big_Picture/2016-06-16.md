At Thursday’s opening bell, the Nasdaq had four things on its to-do list for the day.


The four were: Stay above the 200-day moving average; end a five-session losing streak; notch a price gain in strong volume; and retake the 50-day line.


The Nasdaq’s report card had only one red mark -- it failed to retake the 50-day line. If the stock market were trying to get off the probationary status of “Uptrend under pressure,” those grades still weren’t good enough. The market needs a bolder move to convert its tentative bullishness into true conviction.


For the day, the Nasdaq staged a positive reversal to end up 0.2% after being down 1.2%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3%. The IBD 50 inched up 0.1%.


![MP061616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP061616-183x300.jpg)Volume rose across the board, but Nasdaq trade remained below average for the 11th day in a row.


Still, the technical picture improved a bit. The May 11 distribution day on the S&P 500 expired because of time. This cranked the count down to 4 on the S&P 500, matching the Nasdaq.


If the bulls were looking for encouragement, they might have found part of it in the put-call volume ratio. The ratio closed at 1.09, which is close to the 1.15 level often associated with a short-term bottom.


Technicals aside, most market watchers appear to be focused on Britain’s June 23 vote to either stay in or leave the EU.


Although polls indicate Britain is ready to leave, Betfair on Thursday said the odds of a win for the stays are 65%, up from 62% Wednesday. Gamblers factor in something polls don’t — the inclination for risk-averse voters to back off bold action when they actually vote, as opposed to just offering an opinion to a pollster.


Other economic news was mostly positive Thursday. The Philadelphia Fed’s survey of June manufacturing conditions popped to 4.7, easily topping the consensus view for 0.8, and surpassing the highest figure in the range of estimates.


Bears, though, were quick to point out that the report was not all honey and berries. Shipments, new orders, and employment remained negative.


Meanwhile, the National Association of Home Builders released a sentiment reading on homebuilders. In June, the gauged ticked to 60 after being stuck at 58 for four months.


Yet homebuilder stocks mostly fell.
That industry group is up about 2.5% this year, making an advance that has been choppy, which makes it hard to play the stocks.


For example, **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) corrected 28% from the year-end close, then rose 42%, dropped 11% and recently rose 11% before adding a handle to its pattern.


Aside from the choppy action, confidence in D.R. Horton appears to be fading. Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) unloaded 79% of its holdings in the stock in Q1.


**Coming up**: Housing starts for May will be released Friday before the market’s open. Also, Friday is a quadruple witching day, which often boosts volume.

title: Stock Market Pause Feels A Bit Worse As Indexes Pierce Key Chart Level

Earnings reports and the unexpected return of trade-war fears took indexes sharply lower Friday, as the stock market's pause felt more palpable.




The Nasdaq composite plunged 3.2% and the S&P 500 2.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.6%. Small caps came out even worse, as the Russell 2000 closed with a 3.8% loss. Indexes made little attempt to get off session lows.


Remarkably, volume was lower from Thursday, partly because trading was unusually heavy Thursday. Friday's weaker turnover spared the market from a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), suggesting that institutional investors sold selectively. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain light on distribution, with a single such day of heavy selling in the past few weeks.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) fell 2.1%. Many stocks fell below key averages or below [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq penetrated below a trend line traced from the March lows. Both indexes also closed below the short-term 10-day moving averages. Those signals indicate the market may be changing direction, to the downside.


With little distribution lately, the market could be doing nothing more than adjusting its seat position. After strong gains since March, the stock market deserves an occasional break. If you look at the last time the market sold off like this, on April 21, indexes bounced right back. But for now, some caution seems prudent.


Earnings reports from a couple of trillion-dollar market cap companies hurt the market.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) shook Wall Street after it missed Q1 profit expectations. Jeff Bezos said what likely would have been an operating profit of $4 billion in the current quarter will instead be spent on [ways to keep deliveries going and protecting employees and customers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-analyst-reports-quarterly-earnings/).



**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which [reported good and bad news for its March-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-stays-buy-zone-coronavirus-quarterly-report/) late Thursday, reversed lower and closed with a loss of 1.6%. Shares held near the 288.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Apple, another trillion-dollar stock, was added to theÂ [Leaderboard watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist).


The market took a hit from President Donald Trump, who threatened to punish China for its handling of coronavirus with new tariffs. The news rekindled fears of the U.S.-China trade war. Last year, the tariff war hurt many companies, and some economists fear that new tariffs will worsen an already weak U.S. economy.


National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/china-will-be-held-accountable-for-coronavirus-says-white-house-economic-advisor-larry-kudlow.html) that it's up to the president to impose new tariffs, and that China will be held accountable.

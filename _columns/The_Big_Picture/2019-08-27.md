Stock Market Reverses Lower On Higher Volume, But Costco Breaks Out
====================================================================

The two-week stock market rally since the [Aug. 13 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bulls-get-third-major-buy-signal-this-year-why/) continued its trend of hesitant action Tuesday. The [Treasury yield curve inverted](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/major-stock-indexes-head-south-kirkland-lake-costco-stock-buck-trend/) to its worst level since 2007, while the 30-year Treasury bond yield fell below 2%.




The Dow Jones industrials rallied as much as 156 points Tuesday before reversing lower to fall 120 points, or 0.5%, at the close. All three main indexes — the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials — remain below their 50-day moving averages. That moving average has emerged as a resistance level. Meanwhile, the major indexes are still above their 200-day support levels, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average testing that level three times since early August.


The stock market appears to be at a crossroads. Further weakness would send the major indexes below their current support levels, potentially prompting another stock market correction. On the upside, a bullish move above those potential resistance levels would place the stock market within striking distance of record highs.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the trading session with a 0.3% loss, while the S&P 500 also moved down 0.3%. Heavier volume on both exchanges — compared to Monday's trade — added a distribution day to the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500, bringing the current count to four and three, respectively.

The small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 1.35%, hitting its lowest level since January. The Russell 2000 is widely viewed as a measure of risk-taking because smaller stocks tend to be more speculative.


IBD 50 Outperforms
------------------


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) edged a fraction higher, outperforming the major stock indexes amid strength in **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)). Kirkland Lake Gold advanced nearly 5%. The [top gold stock](https://www.investors.com/research/gold-stocks-investing-price/) hit a new high, continuing its rebound from its 50-day moving average. Kirkland is a recent addition to the [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) service.


Meanwhile, Chipotle Mexican Grill continued its steady rise, gaining almost 2%. Shares are well extended from the 10-week line after a July pullback. On Tuesday, an [analyst suggested](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-stock-price-target-hike-carne-asada/) that the burrito maker will soon launch carne asada nationwide.



On the downside, **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) and **Essent** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) were two big losers Tuesday. Upland Software fell nearly 3% and is testing its long-term 200-day line. Its 50-day line is curving downward.


Essent declined 2.3%. Shares continue to shape a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) base with a 50 buy point.


Top Stocks To Watch: Costco, Pinterest, Twitter
-----------------------------------------------



With the stock market uptrend under pressure, investors need to remain focused on high-quality stocks with [strong RS lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). If the stock market action improves, these names could be some of the next big winners.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock idea **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) broke out above the 284.41 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). Shares of the [leading retailer](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) surged 5% after Costco [opened its first China store](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/top-stocks-china-costco-shoppers-dont-care-trade-war/) in Shanghai, to huge crowds. The stock is in the 5% buy zone. It is the latest of a few big retailers to rally lately, including **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)).


**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) came within six cents of retaking a 36.20 buy point in a [cup with handle.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) At its 36.14 peak price Tuesday, the stock advanced 2.2%. But the stock reversed from those early gains to tumble over 4% amid the stock market's reversal.


**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) remains in the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/research/twitter-stock-buy-now/) of a 41.02 entry in a [cup with handle.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) Shares moved up 1.7% Tuesday to close at 42.14.


Twitter's last two quarters of earnings show respective increases of 131% and 829%, indicating a huge shift in fundamental momentum. Investors should focus on stocks with this quality of earnings growth.


Current Stock Market Rally
--------------------------


Despite a wealth of negative news stories — an escalating U.S.-China trade war, uncertain Fed policy and an inverted Treasury yield curve — the stock market continues to be mostly resilient. The Nasdaq is just 6% off its record high set on July 26. Indexes have not violated the early August lows.


But no question the market has been volatile. This type of whipsaw stock market action is usually detrimental to your portfolio, and makes it hard to make progress with your trades.


Be flexible with your expectations in this volatile stock market. It is best to be cautious with exposure until the market proves itself. If the market breaks down, remember to obey sell signals and keep your losses small to avoid a big drawdown.

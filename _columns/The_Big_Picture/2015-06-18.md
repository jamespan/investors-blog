Stocks performed much better Thursday after a lackluster reaction to the Fed on Wednesday. Thanks to gains in biotechs, software and Internet stocks, the Nasdaq bolted 1.3% to 5132.95. The tech-heavy index not only cleared its recent trading range, but also nailed an all-time high. It took more than 15 years, or 5,578 calendar days, for the Nasdaq to surpass its March 10, 2000 high of 5132.52 reached during the dot-com bubble.

  

On Wednesday, Fed policymakers said they would continue to wait for more improvements in economic conditions before raising interest rates. Thursday brought about a much higher-than-expected rise in factory activity in the Philadelphia area and leading economic indicators, as well as tame consumer inflation and lower jobless claims.

  

While worries over Greece have rattled stocks recently, that wasn't the case Thursday, even as the debt-ridden country again failed to reach a deal with creditors. Eurozone leaders will hold an emergency meeting Monday.

  

The S&P 500 rallied 1%. While the benchmark index didn't score a new high, it did clear its 50-day average and broke above a short-term downtrend line from its May 20 record high.

  

Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 1.3% to an all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1% as all 30 issues advanced. The IBD 50 outshined with a 1.4% gain.

  

Volume climbed on the NYSE and the Nasdaq from Wednesday's pace. The Nasdaq had its busiest day since June 1. It's encouraging to see up days in higher trade, which haven't happened much lately.

  

Breadth was strong, with winners beating decliners by more than 2 to 1 on both major exchanges.

  

Thursday's strong gains may signal the end of months of sideways action. However, prior breakout attempts fizzled as the major averages settled back into their trading ranges.

  

  

Thursday's jump in the market also perked up some leading stocks, spurring a few that haven't done much recently. These include **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Outerwall** ([OUTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OUTR)).

  

More stocks broke out Thursday. **BioMarin Pharmaceutical** ([BMRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMRN)) gapped above a 131.64 entry, while **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)) passed a 48.66 buy point intraday.

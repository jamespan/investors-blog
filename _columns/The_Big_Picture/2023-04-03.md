Stock Market Uptrend Intact As Nasdaq Pares Losses; Oil Stocks Take Flight On Surprise OPEC Cut
================================================================================================

Oil stocks surged in the stock market Monday after OPEC unexpectedly cut daily production by just over 1 million barrels. Meanwhile, an early sell-off in software and semiconductor stocks didn't look so bad by the closing bell as the Nasdaq composite pared a steep intraday loss.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the top-performing index, up 1%, helped by strong performances from **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)).


Chevron jumped 4% and climbed above 50- and 200-day moving average. It's the second-highest-weighted holding in the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)), which gapped above its 50-day line, rising 4.5%.


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) also outperformed in the Dow Jones, helped by news that Medicare finalized its pay rates for 2024.

Money flowed into bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 7 basis points, to 3.42%, at the end of regular U.S. trading.


Stock Market Today
------------------


After rising close to the Feb. 2 high last week, the Nasdaq shook off an early downdraft and scored an inside day. It was in impressive performance, considering the scope of the Nasdaq's gains over the past three weeks. Declining stocks on the Nasdaq had a slight edge over advancers.


Preliminary data showed lower volume on both exchanges.


The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) edged lower by 0.2%, with the top-10 percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 all outside the technology sector in areas like energy and retail.


Small caps fell in-line with the Nasdaq early but the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) closed off lows, posting a gain of less than 0.1%.


The S&P 500 edged higher by 0.4% after jumping 3.5% last week.


Sharp drops in **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) were offset by gains of least 8% for **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)), **Apa** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)), **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) and **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)).


Winners had a slight edge over losers on the NYSE.


Tesla Takes A Hit
-----------------


Investors sold Tesla in Monday's stock market after Elon Musk's brainchild delivered 422,875 vehicles in Q1, up 36% year over year. But it was a little below the FactSet consensus of 431,000. Tesla cleared a cup-with-handle handle buy point Friday, but the handle only showed up on the daily chart because there wasn't much of a shakeout.


Sellers hit **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) after Morgan Stanley downgraded the solar leader to underweight from equal weight.

WTI crude oil futures were trading around $80.50 per barrel, up 6.4% after last week's 9% gain.


Marathon Oil had been on a downtrend since November, but MRO stock gapped above its 50-day and 200-day line Monday.


Other S&P 500Â  components in the oil patch gapped above their 50-day lines, including HES stock, **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)).


Eight of the day's top-10 performing industry groups hailed from the oil and gas sector. Of course, if oil prices stay high, it could present more challenges for the Federal Reserve in its fight against inflation.


Top Stocks To Watch
-------------------


The oil driller group was one of the day's top performers, up more than 5%. Inside the group, **Noble** ([NE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NE)) has the highest Composite Rating, at 91. NE stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average, rising 3.7% in light volume. Small cap **Diamond Offshore Drilling** ([DO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DO)) gapped up and is less than 3% off its high.



The stock market has lifted into a confirmed uptrend after follow-through days for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 last week. The action in individual growth stocks has improved, with several flashing buy signals in recent days like **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)), **Skyline Champion** ([SKY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKY)) and **Tenable** ([TENB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TENB)).


It's OK to increase exposure to around 40%-60%, but take your time and spread risk across leading market groups, like chip and software stocks.


If the nascent uptrend continues to shows signs of strength, growth investors shouldn't have trouble increasing exposure. As always, let the stock market guide you. If recent new buys are making progress from your entries, considering increasing position size.

**Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) jumped 3.7% after a solid bounce off its 50-day line last week. It's now past the 5% buy zone after reclaiming a 138.53 entry.

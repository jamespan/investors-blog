Stock Market Fades Late; S&P 500 Gives Up 50-Day Line, Suffers Mild Distribution
=================================================================================

The stock market closed with a whimper for the second straight session Tuesday on the final trading day of February.




At one point in February, the Nasdaq composite was up 5.9% for the month. But the monthly gain faded to a loss of 1.1% as several economic reports reminded Wall Street that inflation is still out there in spades. The S&P 500 fell 2.6% in February, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 4.2%.


The 10-year Treasury yield remains a focal point for the stock market. The yield ran up close to the 4% level before pulling back. After hitting a high of 3.98%, the highest since Nov. 10, the yield was trading around 3.93% just after the stock market close.


Federal funds futures traders expect the Fed to raise interest rates by another quarter point at the March and May meetings, although the chances of a half-point hike in March are now at 26%. For May, it's slightly higher at 27%.

The 4% level is important to watch for the 10-year yield. A surge above 4% wouldn't be good news for the stock market. But it's certainly a possibility as inflation stays sticky.


By the same token, a decisive move above the 200-day moving average for the Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish ETF ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) wouldn't be good for stocks, either. UUP reversed higher Tuesday for a modest gain of 0.3%. The dollar-tracking ETF rose for the seventh time in nine sessions.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones industrials lagged Tuesday, hurt by weakness in **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)). The blue-chip index closed just above Friday's low and isn't far from a test of the 200-day moving average. It lost 0.7%.

Goldman Sachs had its investor day Tuesday and said it was exploring [strategic alternatives for its troubled Marcus consumer-banking business](https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-ceo-says-firm-is-considering-strategic-alternatives-for-consumer-platforms-5775e5e9?mod=hp_lead_pos2). Merck, meanwhile, reported two late-stage-study failures for combinations involving its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda.


The S&P 500 eased 0.3% and closed just below its 50-day moving average. Volume rose on the NYSE, resulting in a mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Declining stocks had a slight edge over advancers.


**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) was one of the top gainers in the index, up 3.6%. The chip equipment firm introduced a patterning technology that AMAT says will help lower the cost for making advanced chips.


AMAT is just outside the top-10 holdings of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)), which ended nearly flat after rising 1.4% intraday. Top-performing chip stocks in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) included **Aehr Test Systems** ([AEHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEHR)), **Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)) and **Axcelis Technologies** ([ACLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACLS)) with gains of at least 2.5%.


Steel producers had a good day in the S&P 500, fueling the group to a gain of around 3% by the close. Inside the group, **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) outperformed with gains of 1.9% and 3.9%, respectively.


Nucor's weekly chart shows a big [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) with a 182.78 buy point. Steel Dynamics is the leader in the group, but it's extended after a couple of tests of its 10-week moving average.


The Nasdaq composite eased 0.1% in higher volume, after being up as much as 0.7%.


With the stock market uptrend under pressure, exposure should be limited to 40% to 60%. The distribution-day count, shown in the accompanying Market Pulse table, is still manageable. But increasing distribution days almost always cause problems for a stock market uptrend.


Stocks To Watch
---------------


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) is currently 47% invested, with outperformance coming from names like **Allegro MicroSystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) and **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)).


It's OK to look for stocks to buy, but keep positions small to start. If a new buy quickly becomes profitable, don't be afraid to add to the position by buying a smaller number of shares. The goal is to add to your winners. Never average down with your losers.

Focus your attention on the leading price performers in an industry group. If you miss a breakout, keep the stock on your watchlist. **Brunswick** ([BC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BC)), for example, cleared a bottoming structure during the week of Feb. 2. It's been an orderly pullback so far as the stock trends above its 21-day line. Tight, sideways trading after a breakout can often yield new entries.


**Fiserv** ([FISV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FISV)) is also showing strength and support after surging out of a consolidation on Feb. 7.


In earnings news, **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) gapped above its 50-day line but closed off highs after reporting a 488% surge in quarterly profit. But FOUR is just over three weeks into a new consolidation. It needs more time.


**Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) was another earnings winner. The provider of online car auctions broke out over the 70 level and topped a 71.03 cup-with-handle entry. But the stock faded off highs with the stock market.


Enterprise software firm **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) reversed slightly higher after the company reported another quarter of strong bottom- and top-line growth. WDAY stock is back in a buy zone after a test of its 21-day exponential moving average.

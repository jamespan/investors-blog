Stock Market Pads Gains To Cap Pivotal Week, And This Is Its New Leadership
============================================================================

The stock market's gains Friday weren't as good as the prior day, but they still marked an important steppingstone in the market's new uptrend.




A day after the Nasdaq made a [follow-through bottoming signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), indexes added to Thursday's 1%-plus rally. The Nasdaq rose 0.5% and closed slightly above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 also closed above the 50-day line, up more than 0.7%. The 50-day lines stood as potential obstacle for the market's advance, and now indexes can start forming a beachhead above those levels.


Small caps lagged. The Russell 2000 reversed lower 0.4%. Indeed, it was a better day for big caps as the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.1%.


A raft of positive earnings reports boosted the stock market the past week. China's wobbly real estate market, rising inflation and other pain points didn't hold the market back. For the week, the Nasdaq climbed 2.2%, the best week since the last full week of August. The S&P 500 added 1.8%, its best week since late July.

What Next After Stock Market Follow-Through?
--------------------------------------------


After Thursday's follow-through, investors should add stocks in measured steps, at least while the market builds on the initial push. Remember, the growth-heavy Nasdaq 100 is still below the 50-day line.


Now the question is, where to start investing? The market leadership has been shifting all year. It currently favors commodities, trucking, energy, financials and a few other sectors.


**J.B. Hunt**'s ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) [better-than-expected third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/jbht-stock-buy-range-q3-earnings/) sparked a rally in trucking stocks. J.B. Hunt itself broke out of a six-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) in heavy volume. **Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)) broke out of another flat base and closed above the 259.23 buy point. **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) is nearing a breakout.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) rose 3.8% after [earnings beat views](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-gain-ahead-of-q3-earnings-reports/), capping a mostly good week of earnings for the major banks. The stock is forming a flat base with a 420.86 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).

Tech Leaders Forming Bases, Too
-------------------------------


The technology cupboard isn't exactly bare. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) — all of them in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) — are forming [sound bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).



But the 2021 stock market has been fickle. Guarding profits will be just as important as stock picking if this new market uptrend holds up.


While Wednesday's inflation report was gloomy, other economic data was better. Early Friday, the Commerce Department said [U.S. retail sales rose 0.7% in September](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-dow-jones-retail-stocks-to-watch/) from the prior month, and 0.8% excluding autos. That was better than expected despite the end of pandemic jobless benefits for millions.


There wasn't much action in the retail sector, however. Retail SPDR ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) erased gains and closed 0.1% lower. Among retail leaders, **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)) tried to break out of an [ascending base](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rare-ascending-base-can-lead-to-powerful-gains/) but closed below the 99.74 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

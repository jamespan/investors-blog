Stocks Lose Battle At Resistance Levels; Worries Loom
======================================================

The stock market tested the bulls Friday, apparently with worries that nobody handled too well.


The Nasdaq severed 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average hacked off 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. The IBD 50 chopped off 1.7%.


Volume rose across the board, adding a distribution day, a sign of institutional selling, to the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


What is the market worried about?


First, market watchers pointed to Britain's looming vote on leaving or staying with the European Union. The June 23 vote will be close, according to recent opinion polls. The oddsmakers at the gambling houses say the chance of a British exit is only 29%.

Uncertainty might be the bigger problem here than the outcome. A leave vote would likely create jitters short term. Long-term, though, so-called experts are divided on whether it would be good or bad for business.


The second worry is the Federal Reserve's bank stress test results, which will be released June 23. Also, on June 29, the Fed will let the banks know if their plans to increase dividends or share buybacks are OK with the central bank.


Don't ask why the Fed is more qualified to make such judgments than a bank CEO. It's all about the Dodd-Frank law, and the Fed's hypothetical scenarios.


The third potential worry is the Fed's meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. No one expects a rate hike this month, so it isn't clear that this is a legitimate worry. CME FedWatch puts the odds of a June rate hike at 4%.


The stock market has some self-generated worries of its own.


After a confident rally from mid-February to mid-March, the indexes have had trouble resuming the run.


The S&P 500 climbed over 2100, closing above that old resistance level for four sessions in a row. However, on Friday the index gave up the perch.


The Nasdaq never challenged its old resistance level at 5000, instead meeting resistance near the April highs.


Although there has been some divergence in the indexes recently, they joined together under their resistance areas Friday -- not the unity bulls imagined.


For the week, the Nasdaq fell 1% and the IBD 50, 0.6%. The S&P 500 eased 0.1%.

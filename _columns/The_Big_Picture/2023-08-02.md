Nasdaq Leads Wide Sell-Off, Forces This Change In Stock Market Outlook
=======================================================================

The Nasdaq posted its biggest single-session drop in more than five months on Wednesday, and volume rose sharply. While [earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/tag/all-news-and-stock-ideas/) certainly deserved much of the blame, perhaps the primary news that helped stimulate sellers actually came from the debt markets.




Long-dated U.S. government bonds fell hard after Fitch Ratings delivered the first downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities in 12 years. The bond rating agency lowered its view on U.S. sovereign debt from a top-drawer triple-A grade to AA+.


Government leaders revealed their distaste for the news. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a former chair of the Federal Reserve, called the decision "arbitrary" and based on "outdated data."


When was the last time the U.S. credit rating got tarnished?


According to Dow Jones, Standard & Poor's pegged its rating lower in the same exact manner on the evening of Aug. 5, 2011. On the next trading day, the S&P 500 index of large-cap stocks got torched with a 6.66% sell-off. That marked its worst single-session decline since Dec. 1, 2008.


So, from this perspective, Wednesday's mauling in the stock market was not as terrible. Yet the losses among select growth stocks? Quite brutal.

Meanwhile, long-dated bonds sold off early before recouping a smidgen of their losses. On the Cboe, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond leapt to as high as 4.12%, the highest since Nov. 9, before settling to 4.07%, up 2 basis points.


Nasdaq Paces Heavy Selling
--------------------------



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP080223-1-1-205x300.jpg)While the Nasdaq composite fell 2.2% on Wednesday to 13,973, the S&P 500 lost 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed almost 1%, and the Dow Jones transportation average fell 0.9%. The Russell 2000, a popular weather vane for small caps, slid just under 1.4%. Volume expanded 18% on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session to 5.48 billion shares, according to Dow Jones Data. On the Big Board (the NYSE's old nickname), turnover increased nearly 6%.


The Nasdaq 100 tracker, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), slumped 2.2% in volume that jumped 37% above its average over the past 50 sessions. As the nearby chart highlights, volume also reached the highest level since June 16, a "witching" session of options and futures expirations. The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange.


So, in a nutshell, sharp drops in heavier turnover in the stock market like the one on Wednesday deliver the earliest signs that the bull run is suffering from fatigue.


What's more, intense selling among leading stocks bolster the argument that IBD readers may benefit from taking caution on new buys. Keeping a close eye on the portfolio to identify important sell signals is a top priority now.


One only need to look at companies such as **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) (down 24% to 115.95 in six times normal volume) and **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) (off 13% in volume 360% higher than average) to see how during meaningful downdrafts in the stock market, top stocks can fall much harder.


[Both stocks exited Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) by triggering a [key sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) — a dramatic drop through the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) in massive turnover following a nice run from a successful breakout.


Don't Ignore This Key Sell Rule Too
-----------------------------------


It also makes a lot of sense to consider taking some profits in your biggest gainers, even if they're still rising.


The concept of taking at least partial gains at 20% to 25%, or perhaps a little more than that, is built on a bedrock of evidence that even in bull markets, both growth stocks and key indexes will pull back significantly to humble traders and keep speculation from going past a boiling point.


Therefore, on Wednesday, IBD changed its current outlook for the stock market to "Uptrend under pressure" from "Confirmed uptrend." IBD also advises trimming exposure in equities to a 60%-80% range from 80%-100%.


This marks the first change in the outlook since May 10, when The Big Picture column noted an upgrade to "Uptrend resumes" from "Uptrend under pressure."


Beyond The Nasdaq
-----------------


The heavy selling on Wednesday was not limited to the Nasdaq.


Crude oil futures on the Nymex ended 2.3% lower to $79.49 per barrel, according to Dow Jones data. That marked the biggest single-session percentage drop since June 27.


Oil certainly continues to lag U.S. equities this year, down 1% since Jan. 1.


An early survey of IBD's 197 industry groups showed more than 20 groups falling 3% or more for they day. Among the highly ranked industries in terms of six-month price performance, they included database software, computer hardware and peripherals, fabless semiconductors and specialty enterprise software.


Bucking the decline? Insurance brokers rallied more than 5% on Wednesday, followed by a few defense-type industries such as dairy products and drugstores (both up more than 3%), accident and health insurance (2.4%), agricultural operations (1.4%), and finally cosmetics and paper products (up 1% each).

Bulls Vs. Bears Today
---------------------


Meanwhile, keep an eye on investor sentiment. Excessive optimism can hint at a growing absence of fresh new buyers to help push stocks higher.


The weekly Investors Intelligence survey showed [bulls as a percentage of all newsletter editors](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) polled ramping up to 57.1% on Wednesday vs. 55.6% last week. That's not only just under the November 2021 peak reading of 57.2%, but "it now exceeds the 55% initial caution level, which says to prepare a more defensive strategy," Investors Intelligence editors wrote.


Bears fell to 18.6% after a small rebound to 19.4% last week.

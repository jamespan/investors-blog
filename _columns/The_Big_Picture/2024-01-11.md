  Stock Market Ends Narrowly Mixed Despite Hot CPI; More Inflation Data Looms

The stock market finished mixed but well off session lows Thursday, as Wall Street reacted to a hotter-than-expected consumer inflation report. Now, investors will shift their attention to Friday's Producer Price index, another inflation report.




Early Thursday, the [Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-comes-in-hot-in-setback-for-fed-rate-cut-hopes-sp-500-futures-waver/) rose 0.3% for the month of December, above expectations of a 0.2% rise. The 12-month CPI rate rose to 3.4% from 3.1% in November, vs. expectations of a slight pickup to 3.2%.


The core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3% from November vs. forecasts of a 0.2% increase. The annual core CPI inflation rate dipped to 3.9%, but missed forecasts of 3.8%. The core CPI inflation rate peaked at a 40-year-high 6.6% in September 2022.


Despite the surprise in price data, the 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to 3.97%, falling back below 4%.


"Slower trend inflation is clearing a path for the Fed to begin lowering U.S. interest rates," said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in a research note to clients.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP011124-211x300.jpg)Adams continued, "Financial markets price in high odds of the Fed beginning to cut the federal funds rate as early as March. Comerica thinks the Fed will likely go slower than financial markets price in. The Fed got burned by underestimating the intensity of inflation's surge over the last few years, and they would rather overcorrect and keep rates high for longer than necessary than cut too early and allow inflation to rebound."


Meanwhile, more inflation data is due out Friday morning, with the early release of the Producer Price Index.

What To Do Now
--------------


The Nasdaq continues to see resistance around 15,000, a key psychological level to watch.


Still, with the stock market near new highs, IBD recommends an exposure level of 80% to 100%.


There has been only a handful of new breakouts during the recent rebound, like **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) and Nvidia. Dexcom is modestly above its buy point.


A great resource for finding daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks topping buy points. In Thursday's list, there were two breakouts; one was Microsoft.


Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows a handful of stocks nearing buy points in bases. For example, **Rollins** ([ROL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROL)) is approaching a 43.98 cup-with-handle entry.

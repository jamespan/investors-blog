  Stock Market News: Dow Tumbles 600 Points As Apple Weighs

Sellers swarmed the major stock indexes again Monday after a weak session Friday that saw the S&P 500 flash a distribution day. In stock market news today, a 5% decline in shares of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) weighed on the technology sector. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) took a hit in the Dow, falling 7.5%.




After falling 1.6% Friday, the Nasdaq composite fell 2.8% Monday. The index could be poised for another test of 7000 level as it sits 11% off its high. Meanwhile, after three straight closes above its 200-day moving average, the S&P 500 fell below the line, down 2% for the day. The bogey is still holding above the 2700 level.


The Dow Jones industrial average dropped below its 50-day line, ending with a loss of 2.3%, or 602 points.  Nasdaq and NYSE volume fell from Friday's levels.


Monday's weak session resulted in a lowered IBD market outlook to "uptrend under pressure." A lowered outlook doesn't mean it's time to turn 100% bearish and aggressively raise cash. It is time to look at current holdings and play defense where necessary. It's also not the time to be aggressively buying stocks. Nibbling here and there is still OK, but risks are higher.


Stock Market News
-----------------


In stock market news today, shares of Apple lagged badly after **Lumentum Holdings** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)) cut its earnings outlook. Lumentum, a key Apple supplier, said a large customer asked it to "materially reduce shipments." Shares of Lumentum cratered 33%.

Jho is accused of laundering billions of dollars embezzled from a statement investment fund known as 1MDB.


In other stock market news today, several technology stocks took hits in the Nasdaq 100. Chip stocks **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) underperformed with losses of 5% or more.


Results from Nvidia are due Thursday after the close. At 35% off its high, Nvidia's chart is in rough shape. But some stocks in compelling setups ahead of earnings reports this week were featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/option-trading-cisco-systems-nordstrom-earnings/) column.


General Market Health
---------------------


The S&P 500 gapped down Friday, losing 0.9% in higher volume. The weak action resulted in a distribution day for the index, two days after it [followed through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) powerfully, confirming a new uptrend. The bulls on Friday got a small amount of comfort when the index found support at its 200-day moving average and closed in the top half of the day's price range.


The stock market's weak action so soon after Wednesday's follow-through certainly gives pause. But it's too early to declare the nascent uptrend dead. For the uptrend to be truly to be killed, the major stock indexes would have to take out their lows of Oct. 29. That wouldn't necessarily prevent IBD from lowering its outlook before indexes drop that much if the market deteriorates more.


Falling oil prices are also spooking Wall Street. U.S. crude oil futures lost ground for the 11th straight session, settling at $59.93 a barrel, down 26 cents. Oil initially traded higher after [Saudi Arabia said it would cut exports](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-jump-saudi-arabia-signals-opec-production-cuts/) next month.


What To Do Now
--------------


The market remains in a confirmed uptrend — albeit a slowing one — so it makes sense to keep a watch list of compelling setups. While breakouts from the likes of **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)), **Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)) and **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) are not working very well, there's no shortage of other breakouts that still look OK.


Just look at charts of [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) names **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) as well as other top stocks like **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), **HMS Holdings** ([HMSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HMSY)) and **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)).


Then there's a name like **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) that's showing signs of accumulation as it works on the right side of a base. If the market uptrend kicks back into gear, it's important to have a list of names handy that could lead the market higher. Emerging leaders can be found in powerful screens like the IBD 50 and Stocks On the Move on the home page of Investors.com.


Strong Sales At Alibaba Not Enough
----------------------------------


In other stock market news, shares of **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) didn't react much to news that the company's 24-hour Singles Day event generated $30 billion in online sales. The former China leader is a good example of how repeated signs of institutional selling can really cause problems for a stock. Mutual funds and other big investors started dumping shares in late June amid signs that economic growth in China is slowing.

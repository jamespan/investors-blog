  Stock Market Falters As Nasdaq Wrestles With This Important Level

After one of the best weeks of the year, stock market indexes fell modestly Monday, while small caps ignored the selling. Leading stocks outperformed, too.




The S&P 500's 0.4% drop showed a stock market perhaps content with its gains up to now.


The Nasdaq composite edged down 0.1% as it tested resistance at the 16,000 level for the second time this month. That level coincides with the record high of 16,212 set at the November 2021 market peak. Thus, this is shaping up as an important test for the market.


While selling was muted, weakness in Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) was one bearish factor in Monday's stock market. The stock slid 4.4% in its largest penetration below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) since early December.


The company faces [criticism of its Gemini artificial intelligence system](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-artificial-intelligence-ai-controversy/), including how it represents some historical events. Alphabet was one of the worst performing stocks in the S&P 500 Monday, according to FactSet.


Volume rose on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. However slight the increase was for the NYSE, it was enough to add a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) to the S&P 500. That's a total of five, which is a bit of a concern.


Declining stocks topped advancers by a 3-2 ratio on the NYSE, but winners led losers by about 6-5 on the Nasdaq, FactSet showed.


To be sure, the stock market's superb uptrend won't go on uninterrupted. Yet, there's not much evidence that a pullback is imminent. With a conflicted picture for investors, IBD continues to recommend 60%-80% exposure to the stock market.


Indexes Still Look Extended
---------------------------


One way to measure overextended indexes is by comparing them to their 50-day moving averages. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are now more than 4% above their 50-day averages. That's not extreme, but also nothing we'd consider a comfortable gap.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP_5x3_022624.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 just came off their best week of the year so far. The Dow climbed 1.3% and the S&P 500 1.7%. For both, its was the best weekly performance since the week of Dec. 15. Both indexes have climbed 15 of the past 17 weeks.


The Nasdaq rose 1.4% last week, but that was not as impressive as its 2%-plus gains the week of Jan. 12, Jan. 19 and Feb. 9.


The Dow fell 0.2%. Monday was the first day for **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) in the Dow industrials. Amazon, which replaced **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) in the storied index, fell less than 0.2%. Just like the Nasdaq, Amazon is trying to recapture its November 2021 record high.


The index change puts another member of the [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) in the Dow's ranks. Also in the Dow are **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


Amazon accounts for more than one-fourth of the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector, and its addition increased that sector's weighting in the Dow from 13.1% to 15.9%, according to Ned Davis Research. It is still the third biggest sector in the Dow, after financials and health care.


Small Caps Lead Stock Market
----------------------------


While the main indexes sputtered, small caps climbed for a third straight day. The Russell 2000 added 0.6%.


But even in this index, there was a schism in performance. The iShares Russell 2000 Growth ([IWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWO)) exchange traded fund outperformed with a 1.1% increase, while the iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF ([IWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWN)) barely rose 0.2%.


Indeed, growth shares gave the stock market some support. The IBD 50 index rose 1.1% thanks in large part to techs and two stocks in particular.


**CleanSpark** ([CLSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLSK)), a bitcoin mining company, soared nearly 24% to its highest level since November 2021. Crypto-related stocks, one of the best performing in the new year, rallied broadly.


**Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) jumped 9.6% after Rosenblatt Securities [raised its price target](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/arm-stock-jumps-price-target-hike/) for the stock to 180 from 140 and kept a buy rating.


Only three S&P sectors — technology, energy and consumer discretionary — closed higher Monday and none was better than 0.4%. Security, database, education and financial software were four of the 10 best-performing industry groups.


One encouraging piece from Monday's stock market was the high number of top-rated stocks that rose in high volume, even if most didn't clear buy points. **Coinbase Global** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)), **Dream Finders Homes** ([DFH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DFH)), **Comfort Systems** ([FIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIX)), **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) and **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) were some of those standouts.

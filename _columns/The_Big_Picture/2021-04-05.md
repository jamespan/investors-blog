An equity index or two notching a new high? Check. "Laggard" indexes showing bullish technical action? Check. True growth stocks breaking out with nice volume? Check. Substantial news or economic data supporting the advance? Check.




Four weeks ago, it might have been hard to check off these proverbial boxes on what the [stock market is doing today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


On March 5, the Russell 2000 briefly fell to a one-month low. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, saw more air hiss out of its speculative balloon. At one point, the index dropped as much as 12.5% below its all-time peak of 14,175. Wonder stocks from the class of 2020, such as **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Teladoc** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) and **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), got pounded further below their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) or 200-day lines.


But, to use that old saw, ah, what a difference a month makes.


Fast-forward to today, and the market seems to be tiring of the "bifurcation trade" that saw growth stocks lag.


![MP040521](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP040521-254x300.jpg)On Monday, the bulls sprinted upon the session open following the three-day market holiday. News on the ISM manufacturing index (reported on Thursday, rising to 64.7, a 37-year high) and strong rebound in U.S. nonfarm payrolls (announced on Friday, 916,000 net new jobs added last month, crushing the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)) made it a tough day for short sellers and other bearish traders. Also Monday, the ISM services index for March also trounced economists' expectations (63.7 vs. 58.6).


The Nasdaq's 1.7% gain Monday marked a third straight day in which the index gapped up at the open. That is, the session's low held above the prior session's high. That's called a bullish gap. Plus, this "laggard" index — at least in 2021 — has created some nice space above its 50-day moving average.


Did you notice on a daily chart how the Nasdaq's 50-day moving average is still rising? That may come as a surprise, given that the Nasdaq has recently suffered its biggest pullback since a 12.9% drubbing in September.



The S&P 500 plowed ahead 1.4%, marking new all-time highs for a third straight session. These recent strong gains squashed the relevance of the March 2 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/), since the S&P 500 has now gained more than 5% from that sell-off's closing price. The Nasdaq weeded out two distribution days, March 3 and March 24, on the same rule.


A 2% gain by the Nasdaq 100, meanwhile, on Monday highlighted how megacap techs — those with a market cap exceeding $100 billion — enjoyed a rare session of market leadership. Some of the [FAANG firms](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) got some airtime on [IBD Live on Monday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A).


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF lagged, but still rose a fourth day in a row, up 0.5%. At 224.83, it sits 4% beneath an all-time peak set on March 15.


A 4.4% tumble in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices likely sparked profit-taking across the oil and gas sector. As you may have seen, a fistful of related industry groups have been holding court within the top 20 rungs of IBD's 197 industry rankings. But it's not as if the top dogs are collapsing. **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), for instance, slumped 6.9%. But volume came in 23% below the stock's 50-day average. Plus, the small cap has gotten superbly ahead of its fast-rising 50-day moving average.


Action by CPE, as well as emerging new leaders such as **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) and **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)), hint that it's time for these recent highfliers to catch their breath.


[The new highs list](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), meanwhile, affirms the market rally continues to broaden.


Let's glance at [Thursday's new highs list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-apr-01-2021/). Topping it, sector-wise, was the Building Sector. Seventeen companies hit new all-time or 52-week highs.

Seven Large Caps To Watch
-------------------------



**Scotts Miracle-Gro** ([SMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMG)), **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)), **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) and **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) all deserve close analysis.


All seven are either breaking out of a new base or forming a [new chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). The more the current market presents new [breakout opportunities](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/), the more likely institutional investors are deploying capital as government bond prices keep falling.


The first four companies in the above list hail from [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). The last three all held a spot in [Monday's IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). Together, these seven feature dynamic opportunities in cannabis cultivation, semiconductors, e-commerce, digital marketing, 5G wireless growth, data storage and orthodontics.



SMG has earned top-drawer status with its 97 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 (miserable) to 99 (masterful).  With the exception of corporate turnarounds, leading growth stocks tend to have ratings that balance each other out. An 83 Relative Strength Rating? Not stunning, but close to the average RS Rating of 87 seen among great winners at the start of their long ascents.


Scotts Miracle-Gro is starting to reach escape velocity after rising past the 5% buy zone from a breakout point of 238.91 in a small cup with handle.


From 2014 to 2018, the Ohio-based gardening and cannabis cultivation products giant delivered lumpy bottom-line growth. Things changed in 2019; earnings jumped 20% to $4.47 a share that year. Then profits vaulted 62% to $7.24 in 2020. The Street sees earnings rising another 22% in the fiscal year ending in September to $8.82 a share.

Cash Exits Long-Dated Government Bonds
--------------------------------------


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to as high as 1.73%, according to Cboe data. (See a chart of the yield at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) by punching in "zero-TNX."


Keep an eye on the [Earnings Calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), which will balloon in size toward the final two weeks of April.

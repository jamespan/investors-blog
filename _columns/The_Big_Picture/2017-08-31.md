  Stocks Go Where They Hadn't Gone In 2017

U.S. stock indexes delivered head-turning action a third day in a row, a rare occurrence this year.


The Nasdaq posted a 0.9% gain Thursday, following up nicely on Wednesday's 1.1% thrust and Tuesday's positive reversal that erased a nearly 1% loss to end with a small gain.




Also Thursday, the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. Small caps led as the Russell 2000 popped 1%. The Nasdaq rose in August, the ninth monthly gain in the past 10 months.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. The July 27 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/could-you-have-spotted-the-1987-stock-market-top-yes-heres-how/) fell off the Nasdaq's count because of time.


Several items underscored the market's recent vigor.


No. 1, the closes have been high in the day's range in each of the past three sessions. While indexes were flat after IBD changed its market outlook from "under pressure" to "uptrend resumes" Aug. 22, the market's situation has clearly improved this week.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP083117-218x300.png)This isn't the time to party like it's August 1982, but this uptrend is hanging tough despite North Korean belligerence, Hurricane Harvey and a paralyzed Congress.


No. 2, the major indexes have built a bit of cushion above their 50-day moving averages. This builds investing confidence because it points to institutional support at a key area.


No. 3, Thursday was the Nasdaq's best follow-up session of the year. The Nasdaq has posted a gain of 1% or higher 10 times this year, including Thursday. Six times the next session was a decline. Twice the next-day advance was less than 0.4%. Once the next session's pop was 0.7%. Thursday's results beat them all.


No. 4, the Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), an exchange traded fund that tracks the IBD 50, is at a 52-week high and up 25% so far this year.



No. 5, the old IBD rule of buying a stock breaking out on the day the market outlook turns to confirmed uptrend has met with some success. On Aug. 22, breakouts included **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)), which now is up 10% from a 98.10 entry; **Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)), up 6% from a 102.42 entry; and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), up almost 4% from a 92.09 buy point.


A fourth stock that broke out Aug. 22 was **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)), but it is now 4% below a 15.37 buy point.


Why the focus on the day of the resumed uptrend? IBD founder William J. O'Neil favored buying a stock if it breaks out on the follow-through day. (In this case, the resumed uptrend is presumably not as emphatic as a follow-through day, but the principle is the same.)


Why favor the early move?


If an uptrend proves its worth, the IBD-style investor wants some early exposure. (More about this subject can be found atÂ [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/).)


The five items noted above shouldn't be taken as a sign that hazards no longer exist.


In fact, if an investor has suffered minor burns this year from stocks losing small gains, then the investor could lean toward [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/).


Taking small profits, rather than seeing them vanish in a market U-turn, is perfectly defensible.


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) broke out Thursday, clearing a 127.88 buy point intraday in a double-bottom base. The stock closed under the entry. The base is late stage, and the stock is a wild mover.


Economic news carried no heft Thursday as most data, including first-time jobless claims and pending home sales, were unremarkable and did not carry over to stocks.


Friday will offer a full plate of data. Reports will include nonfarm payrolls, two manufacturing indexes, construction spending and consumer sentiment.

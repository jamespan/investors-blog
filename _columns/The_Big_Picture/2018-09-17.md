Indexes fell and the stock market's leading sectors were the weakest on Monday, in a sign that the market's rebound is quickly fading.




The Nasdaq composite led stocks lower, with software, internet, health care and other sectors that have led the market among the day's weakest. The Nasdaq lost 1.4% and closed below the 8,000 level just three sessions after it climbed above it.


More important, the composite is dropping back near its 50-day moving average. Just a week ago, the index looked to be on track to rebound from its latest normal pullback. Now, the Nasdaq has undone most of the work and faces a new test at the 50-day line.


As if to confirm the weakness, the Nasdaq added a distribution day because volume rose from Friday's levels. At the same time, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes lost the Aug. 10 distribution day, which is now too aged to count. That left the number of distribution days on the Nasdaq unchanged but still higher than normal. NYSE volume fell.

The index is down 2.6% for September, while the S&P 500 is off 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.4%. On Monday, the S&P 500 lost 0.6%.


What's happening with the leading index? Certainly, some technology areas have struggled. The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF ([XSD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XSD)) is 4% off its Sept. 5 peak. IBD's biotech industry group also is off 4% from its prior high.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are having weak Septembers. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) dropped 3.2% Monday on news that [it's investigating data leaks and bribes of some employees](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-spinoff/). Amazon is close to falling to its 50-day moving average.


But Monday's weakness spread to other leading sectors. The Dow transports lost 0.9% as logistics and trucking industry groups slid 2% or more. Ship operators were down 1.8%.


The SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) made a record high Thursday but on Monday tumbled 1.2%. In the first week of September, when the Nasdaq struggled, consumer discretionary stood up well under market pressure. Now, that sector looks vulnerable.


Health care emerged this month as a leader, but on Monday the high-rated medical research industry group lost 2%, generic-drug companies fell 1.5% and the No. 1 outpatient and home care industry group declined 1.3%.


What Investors Should Do
------------------------


With so much of the market leadership under selling, there's reason for investors to be more cautious. Increasing exposure right now seems riskier when there's no consistent uptrend in the broad market.


The market's fading rebound also has made it difficult to find successful trades. Breakouts for **Charles River Labs** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)), **Old Dominion Freight Lines** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)), **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)), **Echo Global Logistics** ([ECHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ECHO)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) illustrate that point.


The Russell 2000 fell 1.1%, with health care and technology small caps notably weaker. The index also is easing back toward its 50-day average.


In large part, stocks cooled on signs that the U.S. and China are intensifying their trade dispute. Just days after the U.S. sought new talks, the White House was [sending strong signals that it will impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-soon-beijing-done-talking/). China is threatening to retaliate. An announcement was expected late Monday on new tariffs.


Tariffs would impact many technology components, which is one reason there's been weakness in that sector.


A handful of stocks topped buy points Monday, but none the type of company that would interest growth investors. **Independence Realty Trust** ([IRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRT)) and **Colony Credit Real Estate** ([CLNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLNC)), both real estate investment trusts, topped buy points. **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)), a fertilizer maker with high EPS growth the past few quarters, cleared a flat base but closed below the 32.42 buy point.

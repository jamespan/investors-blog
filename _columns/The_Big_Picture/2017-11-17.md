Small Caps, Retailers Perk Up; Senate Panel OKs Tax-Cut Bill
=============================================================

Small caps were the sole gainers Friday as the major indexes ended modestly down.




The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.4%, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 trimmed 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average hacked off 0.4%.

Volume rose on the Nasdaq and was lower on the NYSE. Friday was an options expiration day, which normally boosts volume. Higher NYSE volume would have given the S&P 500 another distribution day.


The coming week is expected to feature quiet volume. Some fund managers are likely to start Thanksgiving early or extend it. The stock market will be closed Thursday.


For the week, action was mixed. The Russell 2000 rose 1.2%, ending a three-week losing streak. The Nasdaq gained 0.5%. On the downside, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively.


Retail Strength
---------------


Among industry groups, top gainers for the week included retailers.


The strength among retail is something of a surprise. For months now, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has cast a shadow over the whole retail sector. The presumption was that if Amazon wasn't eating a retailer's lunch, it'd soon be by for supper.


Last week a few signs developed that suggested the situation might be improving for brick-and-mortar retailers.


The apparel and shoe retail industry group rose about 9% for the week. Home furnishings gained 6%. Specialty retail popped 5%. Jewelry retail and wholesale added 4%.


Meanwhile, Amazon.com and its internet retail group advanced 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively, for the week.


It would be easy to make too much of this. The change is early, and the ratings of retail stocks have a long way to go to become market leaders.


But the situation is worth watching.


Tax-Cut Plan Advances
---------------------


Meanwhile, U.S. Senate Finance Committee approved a tax-cut package in a party-line vote. Republican leaders hope the full Senate will pass the bill when Congress returns after Thanksgiving. If the full Senate approves, then the Senate and House would have to hammer out their differences.


The stock market would likely react if a bill gets to President Trump's desk. With all the disunity among Republicans, it's unlikely the stock market has baked in a successful outcome.

The stock market ended the week on a bum note despite closing the week near highs for the year. With a heavy slate of important earnings reports looming, the market uptrend could be heading into a key period.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day down 0.2%, but its weekly gain of more than 3% remained impressive. The tech-heavy index sits near highs for the year and was up in 10 out of the past 12 weeks. It is sitting pretty above its [short-term moving averages](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/) and shed its June 23 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to a 5% gain from that day's close.


The S&P 500 also reversed lower as early buyers headed for the exits, closing down 0.1%. The benchmark index jumped about 2.5% for the week and continues to looks strong. It remains up about 17% so far in 2023.


Decliners outnumbered advancers by around 3-to-1 on the NYSE and more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. [Volume was also mixed](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/). At this stage, the stock market uptrend continues to show resilience. IBD recommends sticking at 80% to 100% exposure, but be ready to take action on any sell signals in case there is a pullback.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best among the major indexes, grinding 0.3% higher.Â **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was the top performer with a 7.3% lift after it posted a strong earnings report, while **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) lagged.

Earnings Tsunami Looms Large
----------------------------


This week delivered cooler-than-expected inflation data, which helped to propel the market higher.


However, earnings season is now kicking off with gusto. Big bank results were generally positive Friday, but the devil as in the details. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) all beat views, but Citi was punished amid weakness across several of its businesses.


The pace picks up the coming week, with **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) among the heavy hitters set to deliver results.


And there is more economic data, with U.S. retail sales for June coming Tuesday and last month's housing starts data coming on Wednesday.


Stock Market Action: Health Stocks Lead Upside
----------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors ended the session mostly in the red. Health and consumer staples were the only gainers, while energy and financials struggled the most.


The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a deeper insight into the day's action.


Periodicals, food wholesalers and a range of health-related groups were the best performers. The latter groups bounced due to UnitedHealth's report.


On the other side of the coin, fiber-optics plays, toy stocks and a range of oil & gas groups all lagged.

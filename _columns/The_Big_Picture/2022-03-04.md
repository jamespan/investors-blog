Stocks Today Remain In Correction, But These Sectors Still Generate Trading Opportunities
==========================================================================================

The correction in stocks today remains strangely bifurcated.




If you mix Friday's [outstanding U.S. jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-february-2022-hiring-surges-but-wage-growth-cools-dow-jones/) with the huge leap in energy prices, you really cannot conclude that 2022 has the same concoction of 1970s-style stagflation. But make no mistake, the environment remains mostly toxic for individual investors.


The Nasdaq caved as much as 2.3% before trimming that loss to 1.7% by the close. Even though the economy added 678,000 jobs in February, smashing the Econoday forecast, Wall Street preferred to focus on new developments in Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine and the rocketlike move in crude oil prices lately.


U.S. crude futures expiring in March soared 6.9% to $115.10 a barrel, according to Oilprice.com.

"Wage growth will probably continue to accelerate this year," Cleveland wrote in an email to IBD.


The S&P 500 whittled its morning loss better than the Nasdaq. It ended off 0.8%, yet still closed the week off 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5% to cap the week down 1.3%. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF slipped 1.9% for the week. As seen on a weekly chart, the small cap-focused exchange traded fund wilted in its attempt to retake its downward-sloping 10-week moving average again.


Yet, just like in 2020 and in 2021, but in totally different fashions, this year is teaching investing newbies all about the concept of bifurcation.


[The IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), these days, could jokingly be renamed the "IBD Energy 20." Although the index itself is still down 9.2% for the year, it's stuffed with oil and gas stocks that have done exceedingly well so far in 2022.


Stocks Today: Big Movers In Energy, Metals
------------------------------------------



**Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), which headed into Friday's session ranked 12th and 13th in the list, are staging serious gains following their breakouts. OXY traced three neighboring [cup bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) from March last year. The first two [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/)? Meh. But don't they still say third time's the charm? That was certainly the case as the Houston-based oil and gas explorer cruised 11% during the week ended Jan. 28, clearing a 35.85 buy point.


Occidental's gain hit 56% on Friday.


**Newmont** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)), a new member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), raced more than 9% higher for the week. The gold mining giant also shot past a 70.47 entry in a [deep cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/) in hefty turnover.


Cash is still king. As an asset class, it still outperforms the S&P 500 (down 9.2% since Jan. 1) and the Nasdaq (down about 15%) this year.


Yet strength in the precious metals, industrial metals and agricultural chemicals areas of the market has offered the intrepid investor some solid short-term trading opportunities. But at this point, even in these current leaders, it does not pay to chase.

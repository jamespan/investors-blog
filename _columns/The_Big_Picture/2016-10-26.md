Small-Cap Stocks Lead Decline, But Dow Up As Cash Rushes Into New Sectors

Stocks struggled for a second session in a row Wednesday, disappointing the bulls and essentially wasting what was a strong start for the week.


On Monday, the Nasdaq composite rose 1% and staged only its third gap up in price over the past month or so. (You can see the gap by going to the General Market Indicators page; click on the link at the end of this article.) That gain is now gone. The tech-heavy index followed Tuesday's 0.5% retreat with a 0.6% decline.


![mp102616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP102616-160x300.png)As seen on the big daily chart, the Nasdaq is now a whisker below its key 50-day moving average.


Even worse, volume grew vs. the prior day for a second straight session. Significant declines in higher turnover are known as distribution. Fact: [Distribution days](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) matter. When they pile up quickly in the span of several weeks, the market may be poised for a top.


The Nasdaq now holds six distribution days, equaling the count for the S&P 500 over the past 25 sessions. On Wednesday, although turnover on the NYSE increased, the S&P 500 did not log a new distribution day because its 0.17% decline fell short of the 0.2% minimum threshold.


Six distributions are certainly on the high level. So, why isn't the market falling like a rock?


One reason: Not all of the sell-offs have been severe. Only one of the six distribution days exceeded 1% (the 1.5% drop on Oct. 11, which placed IBD's current market outlook back into "uptrend under pressure"). The other five declines were relatively mild at -0.9% (Sept. 29), -0.2% (Oct. 4), -0.5% (Oct. 13), -0.5% (Tuesday) and -0.6% (Wednesday).


A second reason: The Nasdaq is supremely concentrated in a handful of large-cap tech companies, and these stocks are actually thriving.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), for instance, fell for a second session in a row but the pair of declines are trivial compared with Friday's 4.2% surge that also triggered a breakout past a 58.80 buy point. The business software and cloud computing giant finished the day at 60.63, within buying range.
Base-on-base patterns often present an opportunity to make good money, particularly when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. And the market has remained in such a state for nearly four months, following the rare Day 3 follow-through that took place on June 30.


A third reason: Institutions appear to be switching horses as the flood of quarterly results shed light on which sectors are doing better and which ones are doing worse amid the slow-growth economy. Even though the market fell overall, some groups excelled on Wednesday. The aerospace and defense industry group rose 1.1% on breakouts by **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) (past a 139.55 buy point within a superlong base) and **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) (224.22 buy point). Both posted solid earnings increases in Q3.


Also making solid gains were the integrated computer systems, education, data storage, and truck transport groups, all up more than 1%. Super-regional banks rallied 0.9% as a group. **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) may lead the automakers higher following strong third-quarter earnings announced after Wednesday's close.
Perhaps for this reason, the major indexes continue to hover not far from their 52-week highs. The S&P 500 looks poised to finish below its own 50-day line for a seventh straight week. However, at 2139, the large-cap gauge lies just 2.5% below its all-time summit of 2193.


A possible fourth reason why the indexes won't fall hard, at least until the results of the Nov. 8 elections: Investors are hungry for yield.


Strategists at Birmingham, Ala.-based Regions Asset Management note that roughly 60% of the Russell 1000 Growth Index's year-to-date return of 4.87% "has come from the quintile of stocks with the highest dividend yield at the beginning of each quarter." The S&P 500 has a yield of just over 2%, but as seen in IBD's [The Income Investor column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/), there are plenty of companies that beat that yield and have been rising steadily since January. These stocks include telecoms, tobacco companies, chip firms, real estate investment trusts and utilities.


The Dow Jones industrials, which tends to lag the other key indexes, staged a rare day of outperformance. Thanks to a 6.52-point lift by Boeing and a 1-point gain by **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), the price-weighted blue chip index eked out a gain of nearly 0.2%.

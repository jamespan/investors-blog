The stock market gave more signs it may be coming out of its correction after the main indexes reversed higher Wednesday. Still, the market outlook is uncertain.




Index gains were smaller than Tuesday's but just as significant, if not more so.


Down as much as 1.2% early, the Nasdaq composite started to rebound around 10 a.m. ET and reinforced its rebound in afternoon trading. It closed 0.5% higher.


The S&P 500 reversed for a 0.4% gain. Both indexes closed at session highs. It's always encouraging when buyers are able to shove aside sellers and prevail into the close.

Above all, the stock market's action Wednesday represented another building block in a potential bottoming process. While it's still too soon for a rally confirmation, the week's action is trending in the right way.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 held above their Monday lows even after coming dangerously close during Wednesday's weakest levels.


The latest stock market advance wasn't particularly broad, however. The small-cap Russell 2000 diverged lower, off 0.6% despite that it too trimmed losses. Declining stocks actually outnumbered advancers by an 8-7 ratio on the NYSE and by 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


IBD 50 Outperforms Stock Market
-------------------------------


The IBD 50 made its own bullish reversal and climbed 0.8%, outperforming the stock market.


As The Big Picture has been noting, investors need to be prepared for the stock market to switch back to a confirmed uptrend, which would reopen the spigots for new stock buys.


While many growth stocks sold off the past several weeks, market rotation has brought new sectors into the leadership. Financial and energy sectors right now furnish most of the [stocks setting up near buy points](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/stock-market-correction-explore-chart-patterns-with-oil-stocks-banking-stocks/).


Growth stocks tend to correct much more than the main indexes, which means a great many declined long and deep enough to start [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/). In fact, 10% losses in individual stocks run broadly across the market.


Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab, said in a report that the S&P 500's moderate decline (5.9% to Monday's low) belies the widespread declines.


Many Stocks Fall More Than Stock Market
---------------------------------------


"For all the chatter about 'the market' having been resilient this year, that really just refers to the 'benchmark' S&P 500 at the index closing level," she noted. "The churn and weakness under the surface has been more significant."


As of last week, more than 90% of the S&P 500's constituents had fallen at least 10% from their highs. For the Nasdaq components, it's been nearly 90%. And 98% of the Russell 2000 has fallen at least 10%.



For now, stock winners are coming in sample size only. That's all right; we wouldn't expect much more until the stock market direction improves.


**Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) gapped past the 194.69 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of an undefined base, according to [MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The maker of lighting and other building products beat profit and sales expectations early Wednesday.

**Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)), in [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/growth-stock-to-watch-ibd-50-insulin-pump-provider-resists-choppy-market/), is finding support at the [10-week moving average,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) as is **SiTime** ([SITM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SITM)).  **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) got support at the 21-day exponential moving average.  These stocks and others could find themselves in buy areas when the stock market uptrend improves.

title: Market Outlook Worsens On Trade War; Reasons To Treat The Drop More Seriously

A deepening trade war with China sent stocks plummeting Monday, and the stock market has quickly turned more dangerous.




The Nasdaq composite plunged 3.4%, its worst drop since Dec. 4, and the S&P 500 chopped off 2.4%, the worst day for the index since Jan. 3.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) got slammed with a 3.9% drop to 32.25. The ETF of high-growth stocks fell below its 50- and 200-day moving averages.


It wasn't just the sheer magnitude of losses that was alarming, but the way the market seemed to break open for sellers. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell below their 50-day moving averages. On Thursday and Friday, indexes gave investors some hope as indexes found support at the 50-day lines amid positive reversals.


There was no such rebound Monday; indexes closed near session lows. Declining stocks led advancers by about a 5-1 ratio across the board. All S&P sectors fell except for the defensive utilities sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4% and closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Jan. 29.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP051319-257x300.jpg)Indexes had already notched five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) each over the past several weeks before Monday. Most of those came since the end of April, when trade talks suddenly went from cordial to hostile.


Leading stocks weakened sharply Monday, [with the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) tumbling 3.9%. Only some defensive components such as **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) and some real estate investment trusts kept the IBD 50 from doing worse.


With the market deteriorating fast, IBD on Monday changed its market outlook to "correction." Last week the market outlook had already been downgraded to "uptrend under pressure." With a market in correction, investors need to guard themselves even more.


Be sure to [sell any stock that falls 7% or 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) below your purchase price. Take more profits, especially with stocks up more than 20% from their entries. Margin is especially dangerous, so get off it. Avoid buying stocks until conditions improve. This is not the time to increase exposure to equities.


While last week the market still held hopes for a minor pullback, Monday's action caused a rethink. Increasingly, the market looks like it is making a vertical violation. That's a term IBD uses to describe a serious decline that could last weeks or months, like the one last October to December.


In such a scenario, the market is likely to sink deeper and may take two or three tries to bottom out. Remember, in the October-December slump, two [follow-throughs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) failed.


Vertical Violation Could Mean Larger Decline
--------------------------------------------


There are several symptoms of a vertical violation in the current market: The indexes broke sharply below their 50-day lines; there are new lows in the market; indexes fell five of the past six days; Nasdaq plunged more than 3% in a single day. Those signs echo the October top.


Could it be any easier for investors this time? In a sense, yes. The trade dispute is one that could be resolved quickly if the two sides come to terms. Even a temporary truce like the one in early December could ease tensions.


The market may be getting oversold, too. The put-call volume ratio rose to 1.16 on Monday. Readings that high often have signaled market bottoms in the past, although the signals sometimes failed during last year's bear market.


On Monday, [China retaliated by hiking tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-dow-jones-falls-apple-tariffs-apple-stock/) on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports from 10% to 25%. That followed additional tariffs President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports Friday.


Trade is not the only worry on Wall Street.


The yield curve inverted again Monday, when the three-month yield of 2.418% topped the 2.396% yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Other yield spreads also inverted, according to electronic marketplace operator **Tradeweb** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)). Geopolitical tensions with Iran are flaring up, causing volatility in energy markets.


But no doubt trade is the market's flash point. Most of Monday's worst industry groups were ones sensitive to trade, including consumer products and retail (sectors that import a lot from China), semiconductors and industrials.

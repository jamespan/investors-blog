For stock market investors, Wednesday's action reaffirmed that stock pickers can feel like they're discovering either a land mine or a gold mine.




The brutal gap-downs following earnings reports by **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), South Korean e-commerce firm **Coupang** ([CPNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPNG)) and semiconductor designer **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) after the close on Wednesday offer the latest proof. "Gold mine" moves in the stock market came in the form of strong gap-ups such as [Leaderboard options play](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/earningoptions) **Toast** ([TOST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOST)) in the restaurant technology space.


Yet overall, the major averages hinted that the current pullback amid a broader uptrend has not changed much since IBD's recommended exposure shifted at a roughly 50% level (that is, a 40%-60% target range) both on April 4 and on April 12.


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Wednesday, the action among popular indexes indicated some defensiveness.


While the Nasdaq composite wilted less than 0.2% and the Russell 2000 fell nearly 0.5%, the S&P 500 closed the day down 3-hundredths of a point. However, financial and bank stocks helped prop up the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a gain of 0.4%. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) joined two other Dow industrials components that rose 3 points or more on the day.


At 39,056, the Dow Jones expanded its year-to-date gain to 3.6%.


The stock market indeed has shown more of a penchant toward financial and industrial firms lately.


New Highs Vs. New Lows
----------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP050824-288x300.jpg)IBD's new highs list on Tuesday's action showed solid numbers.


On the NYSE, 196 companies reached 52-week or all-time highs while just 16 hit new lows. It was similar action on the Nasdaq. A total 141 issues made new highs, more than quadruple the 34 new lows.


[Go to IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to see the entire list. [Click on New Highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-may-07-2024/), and you'll see that Finance, Building and Machinery sectors dominated the new highs list.


In fact, similar numbers regarding new highs and new lows turned up on [Monday's stock market statistics](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-may-06-2024/).


Volume dipped on both main exchanges vs. Tuesday. Elsewhere, the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yield rose 3 basis points to 4.49%. Crude oil futures added nearly 1.1% yet remained below $80 a barrel at $79.20.Â Gold edged 0.3% lower to $2,316 per ounce.


Through Wednesday, the stock market has seen healthy gains for the year. The S&P 500 has rolled 8.8% ahead. And the Nasdaq has lifted 8.6% higher after surging 43% last year.


Meanwhile, at least 25 industry groups have forged an advance of 15% or more since the start of 2024. They include computer hardware, building maintenance, data storage, database software, restaurants, fabless chips, ship transportation and shoes.

The Covid Effect
----------------


At the Milken Institute's annual conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., Kevin Jestice, senior vice president of Columbus, Ohio-based Nationwide's investment management group, emphasized that for investors in a variety of products, including ETFs, collective trusts and even variable annuities, equity performance has been a key driver of long-term gains. And Jestice noted that over the past 12 months, investors who disagreed with the Fed's stance that America could avert a recession might have lost opportunities for portfolio growth in equities.


"I always remember a quote from a former professor who said, 'Don't fight the Fed,' " Jestice told IBD. Understanding how the Federal Reserve views the economy and their monetary policy stance is a prevailing factor of monitoring within Nationwide's investment management team.


Jestice thinks "tamed yet sticky inflation" will tamp down economic growth in the near term. But he notes factors have the potential to support the ongoing advance in stocks: 1) a resilient consumer; 2) the lingering effects that the Covid-19 pandemic had on consumer demand for both goods and services; and 3) historic fiscal stimulus to certain sectors of the economy, including investment in the country's semiconductor manufacturing capacity.


Renewable Energy World on Wednesday reported that more than 100,000 jobs have been created in the solar, wind, geothermal and hydroelectric industries since the Inflation Reduction Act became law.

Soft Landing Thesis
-------------------


Therefore, Nationwide's Jestice sees a real possibility that the Fed will in fact achieve a soft landing, even as the yield curve in U.S. Treasuries remains inverted.


"It's dangerous to say we're in a new paradigm in terms of the economy, but this time it really is different," he said.


According to Tradeweb data, as of Tuesday's bond market close, the 2-year note showed a yield of 4.83%, or 37 basis points above the 10-year bond's yield of 4.46%. At the end of the first quarter, that gap stood at 43 basis points (4.62% vs. 4.19%).


Mark Minervini, two-time winner of the U.S. Investing Championships, agrees.


"We messed up the entire economic cycle with Covid. It was really a shock in many ways," Minervini said on [IBD Live's daily show on Wednesday](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A). He noted the last time the correlation between stocks and bonds got out of whack was during World War II.

From Attractive To Most Pricey
------------------------------


Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, noted in an interview with IBD at the Milken conference on Tuesday that her team sees Latin America as among the most attractive pools in which to fish in terms of longer-term equity returns.


Highlighting that, Principal's research has found that in Brazil, for instance, valuations have been cheaper than now only 6% of the time in the past. How about Chile? Only 2%. The benchmark of that stock market, the IGPA on the Santiago Stock Exchange, is up 6.8% year to date.


Latin America Vs. Asia Stock Market
-----------------------------------


As for Asia? Shah said while prices are at a high premium for India equities, "it's a good example of when things go wrong in China; it's a good diversifier away" from that major economy.


Keep in mind that the Principal team has a distinct advantage in picking investments in emerging markets vs. individuals. With boots on the ground, the mutual fund giant can select among a greater range of companies, both in the form of stocks and bonds, not only in India but in the Latin American countries noted above.


IBD's foreign banks industry group ranks a strong 17th among 197 industries for six-month performance, according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF).


Meanwhile, iShares MSCI India ([INDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INDA)) has outperformed a large number of other country-specific exchange traded funds.


For instance, from Jan. 1, the ETF has risen 6.6%. It outpaces a 5.5% lift by the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ([EEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEM)) fund.



The iShares MSCI Brazil, however, has slumped 7.3% despite nifty gains by Brazil-based companies including **Nu Holdings** ([NU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NU)) (up 44% since Jan. 1, forming a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) (which gets most sales in Brazil) and jet maker **Embraer** ([ERJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERJ)).


The iShares Latin America ([ILF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILF)) ETF, down around 1.6% year to date, has fared poorly compared with the strength seen in Argentine banks such as **Grupo Financiero Galicia** ([GGAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GGAL)) and **Banco Macro** ([BMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMA)).


Shah also noted U.S. and Japan equities as having the highest valuations, yet deservedly so due to a number of factors, including economic growth and the potential for revenue and earnings increases.

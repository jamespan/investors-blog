Bears Slap Around Nasdaq, Drive Chip Index Lower
=================================================

U.S. stock indexes dropped for a third day in a row, with the Nasdaq taking the biggest hit.




The Nasdaq skidded 0.9% Thursday, while the S&P 500 braked 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1%. Small caps fell 0.7% in the S&P 600.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index sagged 2.7%. [Chip equipment stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-equipment-stocks-micron-kla-tencor/) were hit especially hard on comments from two industry executives.


Volume fell on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.Â Because of Thursday's declining volume, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dodged [distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MP_5x5_090618-267x300.jpg)On Aug. 30 and Tuesday and Wednesday of this week one or both indexes suffered distribution.


Cluster distribution isn't a good sign for the stock market. Yet, bears haven't been able to take full advantage of the situation.


Bears and bulls alike would have a hard time arguing the Nasdaq's chart is anything other than mixed.


In the past three months, the Nasdaq has notched new highs followed by small advances and small pullbacks. Pullbacks have been in the 4% to 5% range, with the latest pullback of 3% still in progress.


Gains from one high to the next have been even smaller.


Bears could pin their hopes on this fact: While the overall action has been up, a decline of about 3.5% would erase all the gains since the Nasdaq's mid-March high.


Bulls With Bearish Hopes
------------------------


Oddly, there are bulls who would welcome a sharp pullback, if only to shake out the weak holders and set up a smooth advance.

But two pullbacks of 12% and 11% in the Nasdaq ending in February and April didn't get the job done. Weak holders presumably stayed put, which led to continued choppy action.


So, the bulls wish list might look very similar to the bears list.


A 19.5% decline in the Nasdaq from July 2015 to February 2016 led to a fairly smooth advance.


Such a decline could happen now but only because anything can happen in the stock market.


Catalysts on the negative side haven't been able to rattle investors. For example, the trade situation has fostered uncertainty, but so far the indexes have kept their cool.


Two Breakouts
-------------


Breakouts added up to little Thursday, but there were two early stage breakouts.


**Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) rolled about 4% higher in strong volume. The stock crossed above a 164.20 buy point.



Filtration systems provider **Donaldson** ([DCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DCI)) advanced more than 6% to clear a 52.30 buy point.


On the trade front, Canada and the U.S. went into a second day of negotiations.


Meanwhile, the dispute between the U.S. and China has turned quiet but no less fierce. According to Bloomberg News, China is convinced that when the pain hits both countries, the U.S. will not be able to hold out as long as China can.


Key Area To Watch
-----------------


For the stock market, a test could be shaping up at the 50-day moving average for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Either the indexes will find support there and bounce higher, or the indexes will slice under the line, potentially setting up a test at the 200-day line.


Both indexes are 1% to 2% above the 50-day line.


Of course, there is a third possibility. The indexes could move sideways, clinging to the support area but accomplishing nothing.


Economic News
-------------


First-time jobless claims were fewer than expected. The Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing gauge was 3% stronger than estimated.


On the negative side, Challenger job cuts rose about 42%; factory orders were slightly worse than expected; and the ADP jobs report was 10% below the Street's consensus.

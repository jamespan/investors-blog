Nasdaq Commands Gains As This Key Factor Boosts The Stock Market
=================================================================

The stock market behaved virtually the way you would like it to when we're just days removed from the confirmation of a new uptrend in play. Good earnings drove the advance. Key indexes rose sharply. Volume expanded. Leading stocks outpaced the market's advance. And the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) throttled higher.


The Nasdaq composite led the way Tuesday, rising more than 1.7%. That marked the index's fifth advance of 1% or more in April and gave the marquee index for growth stocks a 2.6% boost since it and the S&P 500 both staged a [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) on April 10.


A follow-through day signals it's time for a new significant rally to pick up steam and for breakouts among high-quality growth stocks to mushroom.


The S&P 500 lagged the Nasdaq by what felt like the equivalent of a few horse lengths, rallying 1.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 rose nearly 1%. The Russell 2000 rallied 1.1%.

Volume edged higher on the Nasdaq and was indicated higher on the NYSE, a sign that equity trading desks across the land and seas got extra busy scooping up shares.


The Nasdaq led the major indexes last year with a 28.2% gain, and so far it's not showing any signs of letting up. The tech-heavy composite, at 7281, is up 5.5% since Jan. 1. The S&P SmallCap 600 holds a 3.9% advance. The S&P 500 is up just 1.2%.


Even though the key indexes show some disparity in year-to-date gains, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and even the Dow Jones industrial average all hurdled back above the 50-day moving average. That's bullish. So was the strong market breadth in favor of advancing stocks over losers (nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE and more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP041718-245x300.jpg)Look at the top 25 industry groups among IBD's [daily ranking of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). For the most part, retail, computer, software, internet and medical groups crowd the top slots. The Nasdaq either dominates or enjoys a healthy weighting in these types of stocks. You don't search the Nasdaq for REITs, utilities or defensive stocks, which are lagging this year.


If you want to get the most bang for your investing buck, you'll want to focus your hard-earned money in those stocks that belong to leading sectors, not lagging ones. You never know when the laggards will turn. And leading industries can stay on top for quite a long time. That's the essence of the [L in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), IBD's seven-point paradigm for stock investing success.


At the same time, select energy stocks continue to fortify the advance as well, including oil and gas explorers and solar energy plays with solid earnings and outstanding relative strength. This is a boon for indexes such as the S&P 500, NYSE composite and Dow industrials.


Superregional banks, meanwhile, lagged after some folks on Wall Street were apparently disappointed with the 9% top-line gain by leading stock **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)). Q1 profit growth shined, up 51%, but the revenue increase was weaker in comparison with the prior two quarters (up 14% in Q3, up 15% in Q4). Comerica slumped more than 3% and fell sharply beneath its 50-day moving average in more than 2-1/2 times its usual turnover.


It's still a stock picker's market.


The Market Still Loves Movies
-----------------------------


The follow-through offers a great time to test the market waters with a new buy. But don't buy a stock until it actually breaks out.


Movie and TV show streaming innovator **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) set the bullish tone early on Tuesday after it issued superb first-quarter results (earnings up 60% to 64 cents a share, revenue up 40% to $3.7 billion, a quarterly best). Net subscriber gains impressed the Street. Net margin jumped 100 basis points to 7.8%, the highest in at least 5-1/2 years.



And as IBD has reported in its [technology coverage](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/), the company is gaining might in overseas markets, not just in North America.


The Los Gatos, Calif., innovator is part of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/), which saw nine of the current 11 member stocks crush the major indexes' gains on Tuesday. They include other consumer spending and business-oriented names **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) and **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)).


All 11 Leaderboard stocks show detailed annotations related to buy points, sell points and other notable action on their daily and weekly charts.


The IBD 50
----------


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF rushed 3.2% higher. At 34.72, the exchange traded fund boosted its year-to-date advance to 4.6%, following a 34% climb in 2017.


As noted in the latest [Inside The IBD 50 column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/companies-ibd-50-earnings-growth/), 29 companies within the list of prestigious growth companies are expected to increase profits by 40% or more. Tech, leisure, consumer spending, business services and some medical stocks make up the bulk of this group.


Check IBD's [new highs list](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/)Â and the [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) table, which runs throughout the market day, to scout new breakouts as well. Expect stocks to break out to new highs and surpass proper buy points in heavy volume, not low turnover. You want the institutions on your side.

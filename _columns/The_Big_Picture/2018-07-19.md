Small Caps Stay Positive; Trade-War Worries Rise
=================================================

Small caps outperformed Thursday, but major U.S. indexes lost ground as trade-war worries grew.




The Nasdaq trimmed 0.4%, and the S&P 500 echoed the move. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.5%. But the small-cap S&P 600 advanced 0.7%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, but climbed on the NYSE.


The [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count on the S&P 500 was unchanged. While the S&P 500 added a distribution day Thursday, the June 13 distribution day fell off the count because of time.

CLOSE




Tariffs remain the chief scare for the market, and the fear cranked up another notch Thursday.

For instance, among stocks reacting to quarterly results, **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) gapped down 13%. After the close Wednesday, the company topped earnings estimates by 15%. Yet that beat couldn't overcome the problems from the Trump tariffs. CEO Roy Harvey said the tariffs are creating a significant headwind for the company.


Meanwhile, news that European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker will meet with President Trump on Wednesday for trade talks only underlined low expectations surrounding the talks.


Trump has shown no signs of being interested in a trade deal with the EU.


Instead, Trump reportedly is considering tariffs of 20% on auto imports from Europe. The EU has a list of retaliatory tariffs on standby.


For the stock market, the sad angle is that none of this has to happen.


In a world that embraces free trade, the opposite would be possible. Japan and the EU recently signed a trade deal that will remove almost all tariffs between the two countries. The agreement is expected to go into effect early in 2019.


Optimism On The Street
----------------------


Yet there was some conditional optimism on trade among Wall Street analysts Thursday.


JPMorgan's chief global strategist, David Kelly, said he expects a trade-war cease-fire before Election Day.


If that doesn't happen and tariffs slow the economy, Democrats are likely to retake the House and put checks on tariffs, he said.


Small Caps Pop
--------------


Small caps showed impressive action Thursday, with several stocks in the S&P 600 gapping up in strong volume.


Oil equipment maker **Chart Industries** ([GTLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLS)) gapped up 14%. **Insteel Industries** ([IIIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIIN)) stormed ahead 18%. **Badger Meter** ([BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)) popped 9% higher. All three stocks moved after earnings reports.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's leaders included retail and oil stocks. Groups lagging included metal ore miners.


Economic Data
-------------


Economic news was positive Thursday.


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 207,000 — about 6% fewer than expected.


The Philadelphia Fed's business outlook gauge for July came in at 25.7, about 17% higher than the Street estimated.

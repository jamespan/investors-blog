Buyers pushed the stock market higher again Tuesday, but the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 closed in the bottom half of their intraday ranges after early strength.




Falling bond yields and more weakness in the U.S. dollar fueled an early 1.3% intraday climb for the Nasdaq composite, but the gain faded to 0.6% by the close. The index briefly rose above its 50-day moving average but closed below the line in higher volume. Breadth was strong on the Nasdaq early, with winners beating losers by more than 3-to-1. But breadth faded to just over 2-to-1 positive by the close.


The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) also rallied 1.3% intraday but its gain narrowed to 0.55% by the close. The exchange traded fund ended the day 1 point above its 50-day line, its first close above the line since Sept. 14.


Small caps fared best, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) up 1.1%. That fund was poised for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/) on the fifth day of its rally attempt but fell short with a gain of 1.1%.


The S&P 500 picked up 0.5%. The benchmark index is still below its 50-day line, which is just above the 4,400 level.


Stock Market Today
------------------


In the early going, advancing stocks swamped decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by more than 5-to-1. But the ratio faded to less than 3-to-1 positive. NYSE volume was higher.

Beaten-down financial stocks like **Truist** ([TFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TFC)) and **Zions Bancorp** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)) were among the best gainers in the S&P 500, but both stocks are still far off their highs. Zion's 40-week moving average has been a wall for the stock since late July.


Out of the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)). was the day's best gainer, up 1.4%. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) was the worst performer, up 0.1%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%.

Money flowed into bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 13 basis points to around 4.65%. The Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish ETF ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) fell for the fifth straight session and looks poised for a test of the 21-day line. The drop in the 10-year yield came ahead of two key inflation reports.


Upcoming Inflation Readings
---------------------------


The latest reading on wholesale prices is due Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. On a month-over-month basis, economists see prices rising 0.3%, down from a 0.7% gain in August. Year over year, the price gain is 1.7%, up slightly from 1.6%. Core prices, which exclude food and energy, are expected to rise 0.2% month over month, unchanged from August. Year over year, core prices are seen rising 2.1%, down slightly from 2.2%.


Inflation remains on the stock market's mind, but optimism grows that the Federal Reserve finished its rate-hike campaign to bring inflation down.


Another up session Tuesday proved encouraging after Friday's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/) for the Nasdaq composite. But with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 still below their 50-day lines, IBD's recommended invested percentage stays at 20%-40%. It's OK to increase exposure gradually, but only if new buys are giving positive feedback by making progress from your entry.

Movers And Shakers
------------------


**Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) rallied for the fifth straight session and closed near its high. It's tempting to chase a stock like Super Micro, but it's up in 12 out of the past 13 sessions. It's not actionable now but could be if it completes a proper base.


Several stocks gave early buy signals, including **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which moved above last week's high. But as with the major stock market indexes, TSLA finished the day well off its highs. Still, a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) remains in place with a 278.98 entry. Tesla reports earnings next week, with results due Wednesday after the close.


**Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) rejoined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Tuesday. The stock jumped above its 50-day line and cleared a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) as it forms a flat base.


A couple of other stock market leaders joined the breakout ranks Tuesday, but both stocks closed near lows. **Vertiv** ([VRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRT)) and **Modine Manufacturing** ([MOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOD)) soared out of flat bases early in the session, but sellers knocked both stocks well off highs by the close.



Finally, the initial public offering for **Birkenstock** ([BIRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIRK)) was set to price late Tuesday at the top end of a proposed range of 44-49. A sleepy IPO market has shown some signs of life lately with the recent debuts of **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), **Instacart** ([CART](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CART)) and **Klaviyo** ([KVYO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KVYO)).


Klaviyo looks the strongest of the three as the enterprise software firm sets up in an IPO base.

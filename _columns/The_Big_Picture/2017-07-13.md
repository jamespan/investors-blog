  Stocks Extend Recent Gains; 3 Big Bank Earnings Friday

U.S. stock indexes posted small gains Thursday, as the market protected the previous session's solid advance.




The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. Small caps had a tougher time throughout the day. The Russell 2000 ended just under the break-even line.


Volume declined on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.


Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified before Congress for a second day in a row. She provided no surprises.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP071317.png)The strangest note was no fault of Yellen. At one point, a senator asked about problems related to opioid use. The Federal Reserve's stated mission involves fostering "stability, integrity and efficiency of the nation's monetary, financial and payment systems." Monitoring opioid abuse isn't under the Fed's umbrella.


Perhaps that strange wandering off the subject underlined the routine nature of Yellen's testimony. (The most interesting details had already come out in Wednesday's testimony to a House committee.) Politicians, if they wanted the spotlight, were left to posture about unrelated items. There really wasn't much new for Yellen to say, and she kept to a professional tone.


The stock market showed little reaction to Yellen's remarks Thursday. Gains were small, and the trading ranges for the major indexes were exceedingly narrow.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, lowly rated groups scored the day's biggest gains. Top gainers included the department store group (30% off its high) and auto parts group (34% off its high).


Meanwhile, top-rated groups were mostly down.


When dead-cat bounces are the best a session has to offer, the bulls have little to work with.



Among widely held stocks, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) popped 1.4%, its best daily percentage gain in about two weeks. Volume, though, was below average.


Apple is working on an oddly shaped flat base. The stock is trying to retake its 50-day moving average. If Apple does complete a base, it will most likely be a stage-two pattern. As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from later bases.



**Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)) is another widely held stock that is showing potentially good action. The stock has been consolidating since early March and is just under the 258,970 high in the handle. The pattern is first stage.


Coming Up Friday
----------------


Retail sales for June will be released before the market's open. The Street's consensus view calls for a 0.1% advance.


Industrial production for June is expected to rise 0.3%.


Business inventories for May are seen edging up 0.3%.


The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment for July is pegged at 95.1.


Big Banks To Report Q2 Results
------------------------------


Three major banks will report Q2 results before the market's open Friday. The Street expects earnings at **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) to decline 3% to $1.21 a share. The consensus view for **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) is a 2% pop to $1.58 a share. Analysts set the target at $1.01 a share at **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), which is the same as the year-ago figure.


In Q1, all three banks beat the Street's consensus estimate.


After a nice run from November to early March, the money-center banks declined for about three months. They have been rising since early June and are less than 3% off the March high.


Volume in the money centers was down sharply Thursday. The Street apparently was willing to step back and wait for the data from the three banks.


Expectations are modest for the three banks. This could help the stocks, if they can deliver some upside surprises.

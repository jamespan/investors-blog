  Stock Market Fiddles With Big Tech While Regional Banks Burn

Stock market indexes gyrated three ways in Wednesday's divergent session. Led by Dow Jones component **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), Big Tech attracted speculative buyers looking for another trip to 1999, lifting the Nasdaq 100 ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) about 0.6%. But Dow Jones megacaps refused to cooperate despite an encouraging **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) report, drifting to a 0.7% loss.




Adding to the confusion, the blue-chip S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 flip-flopped higher and lower, looking for guidance, before aggressive sellers took control into the close.


First-quarter earnings have soothed Big Tech so far, but regional banks — led by **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) — look scary despite Wednesday's small upside. The SPDR Regional Bank ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) hit a two-plus-year low early, warning that financial contagion fears are still growing.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) got slammed for a 4.3% loss, dropping Elon Musk's EV company back to January levels. The Jan. 26 unfilled gap between 146 and 154 now looks vulnerable in the short term.


At the same time, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) rallied more than 10% after hours, building on gains fueled by restructuring and job cuts. Maybe it's time to stop calling Marc Zuckerberg's college project "Facebook," its retro non-metaverse identity.



The Dow Jones Industrial Average failed to capitalize on the Boeing report, drifting sideways to lower through the session. However, defensive stock-market superstar **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) has [attracted buying interest recently](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-leader-procter-gamble-breaks-out-chipotles-big-plans/), lifting into the 154.90 buy zone after a well-received earnings report earlier this week.


PG stock eased 1.2% Wednesday, closing at 154.58.


Stock Market Flight To Safety
-----------------------------


Defensive issues continue to shine, with PG stock and market leader **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) leading the way this week.

Procter & Gamble earnings are expected to grow 9% in 2024, more than many so-called growth stocks. The Dow component also pays a comfortable 2.41% annual dividend yield, which can keep growth stock investors in the game until speculative interest returns.


Nasdaq 100 Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) led the upside Wednesday after Mr. Softee's upbeat report, but it gained less than 1% and is still grinding through a monthlong trading range. Wednesday's volume was mixed, with the Nasdaq spiking higher and NYSE volume settling under Tuesday's depressed levels.


The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose just 3 basis points, while long-dated securities ticked lower. The 10-year has been rangebound since September 2022.


Big Tech Vs. Regional Banks
---------------------------


Wall Street has directed investor attention toward Big Tech this week, but plummeting regional banks are telling a different tale.


For starters, regional bank First Republic fell nearly 30% Wednesday after admitting a depositor exodus.


IBD sister publication Barron's noted that the troubled bank [held $104.5 billion in deposits, losing an astounding $72 billion in the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank](https://www.barrons.com/articles/first-republic-stock-loss-deposits-regional-banks-e45a54d1) failure.  The bank is now cutting its workforce and offering great terms to other banks for current liabilities, but few are biting so far.



Regional bank funds are hitting new lows at the same time, telling risk-conscious investors that this isn't the right time to load up on widely held plays that worked in the last decade.


What To Do Now
--------------


IBD's stock market outlook shifted to "uptrend under pressure" after Tuesday's closing bell, in reaction to weakening indexes amid poor market breadth.


Now is the time to reduce exposure to the 20%-40% level in recognition of adverse price action.


However, blue-chip indexes continue to trade well above fourth-quarter 2022 levels. In addition, the S&P 500, Dow Industrials and Nasdaq composite continue to hold support above their 50- and 200-day moving averages.


The Russell 2000 is the outlier as we head into the middle of 2023, flashing the most bearish market signals and trading below the 50- and 200-day lines. It's a problem because emerging growth companies that fill many IBD watchlists dominate this index.


And it's no secret these innovative companies are struggling with inflationary and recessionary headwinds that undermine market breadth readings.


Bottom line for investors in April 2023 is to continue to exercise strict risk management skills when analyzing potential exposure until strong technical signals tell us to increase exposure.

Growth stocks that got TKO'ed in the fourth quarter? Up. Small caps, up. Bond yields, up. Copper and crude oil futures, up. The Dow Jones utility average, barely up.




Two days after the stock market issued a [potential key turning point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) after a depressing December for equity investors, IBD readers today have every reason to pay closer attention to growth stocks and breakout opportunities.


True, finding a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) nowadays seems only a wee bit more likely than finding a four-leaf clover in hard-pack snow in Vermont. But know this: As a [confirmed new uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) heats up, the avid hunter of growth stocks may just find a blossoming of breakouts from [good bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) and strong-volume moves to new highs.


Back to the present. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and even the Dow Jones industrial average all rounded up gains of 1% to 1.1%. After a Day 7 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/) took hold Friday on the S&P 500, Tuesday's solid advance is just what you want to see. Turnover fell modestly on both main exchanges, according to early data. However, this alone does not diminish the value of Tuesday's up day.


In fact, when you consider four positive new developments during [today's stock market action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), it's all the more reason to be courageous and willing to take a flier on new emerging leaders. After all, that's what new bull runs produce.


Positive Development No. 1
--------------------------


First, notice how the "Leaders up in volume" section in the Market Pulse table outweighs the "Leaders down in volume" section.


That's exactly what you want to see in a confirmed new uptrend. And the list of gainers spans from a heavyweight [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) to an apparel turnaround story (**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX))) to recent IPOs in the market-leading software sector (**Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) and **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN))).


Why, by the way, would Crocs even be included among the leaders?


Never forget that corporate turnarounds can become huge winners. And the shoemaker just may be on the cusp of its biggest earnings ramp up since the 2010-2012 period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 163% to 42 cents in the just-ended calendar year 2018. There's more. They also see profits jumping another 152% to $1.06 a share in 2019.



Positive Element No. 2: A Broadening Rise By Equities
-----------------------------------------------------


Second, market internals are improving notably.


Advancers smashed decliners by a greater than 3-1 ratio on the NYSE and by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Give some credit to the small caps and midcaps — that is, those companies with a market value of less than $10 billion.


The Russell 2000 easily outperformed large-cap equity indexes on Tuesday, rising 1.5%. The midcap S&P 400 gushed 1.7% higher. The small-cap S&P 600 rolled ahead 1.5%.


Another way to look at the internals of the market? Count the [number of stocks making new 52-week and all-time highs vs. new lows](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/new-highs-lows-stocks/). At one point on Tuesday, market data showed as many as 50 companies on the Nasdaq and NYSE hit 52-week highs vs. 47 new lows.


The Data Tables section in Stock Lists at Investors.com shows a daily roundup of stats on new highs and new lows. What makes IBD's list so unique: The stocks are arranged by sector. That way, you know which industries are heating up fast. The very best stocks on Wall Street tend to come from leading industry groups, not laggards. This is a quintessential part of the [IBD CAN SLIM investment paradigm](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). L stands for Leaders.


Positive Element No. 3
----------------------


Third, the base of high-quality growth stocks building [key chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is expanding.


Please read the weekly column [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/), [IBD 50 Growth Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/), [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) and IBD's signature stock lists (IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Sector Leaders and IPO Leaders) to quickly form a superb watch list.



India's **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)), **ZenDesk** ([ZEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEN)), **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) and **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) are forming [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Fourth, sector rotation is afoot yet again.


Check out IBD's [stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jan-07-2019/). In the Dec. 24, 2018, issue of IBD Weekly, the Banks sector ranked a terrible 31st and S&Ls held the worst spot, ranked No. 33. No more. Through Monday's trade, Banks rebounded to No. 26, thanks in part to a 3.6% year-to-date gain. S&Ls are no longer the worst. The Mining sector, which includes IBD 50 stock **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), has dropped to No. 33. Software continues to improve in rank.


Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors' U.S. SPDR ETF business, told IBD that the banks provide "reasonable earnings growth despite a flattening yield curve." With interest rates still low and a Federal Reserve showing a change of heart on the pace of future rate hikes, Arone thinks the new views at the central bank may lead to some steepening of the yield curve. That's good for bank profits.


Keep Watching The Global Economy
--------------------------------


Signs of progress on trade talks between the U.S. and China evidently helped encourage buyers to come out of the woodwork. One U.S. official told news wires that negotiations will continue Wednesday. Make no mistake: In no way has the long-term rivalry between the two economic and military superpowers abated.


Yet Wall Street also may have shown a strong sense of optimism because negative news on the German economy (industrial output sank 1.9% in November) and more obvious signs of slowing in the mighty U.S. economy hardly stopped market bulls in their tracks. (The [December ISM services index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) edged lower but still reflected expansion, yet the NFIB's monthly survey on small-business optimism rose a touch last month.)


Growth Stocks Outperform Early
------------------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), a big laggard in 2018 (down 16.8%) after pounding the S&P 500 performance with a 34% gain in 2017, is off to a brisk start in 2019. [Innovator IBD 50](http://www.innovatoretfs.com/etf/?ticker=ffty) rose 2% to 28.87. Volume surged 80% above average. The exchange traded fund is now up 4.5% year to date.

As Stocks Seek Direction, Three Ways To Gauge Where They're Going
==================================================================

After a two-day rebound, a slump in technology stocks resumed Thursday, leaving the stock market in search of direction.




The Nasdaq, more heavily weighted in techs than the other major indexes, fell 0.7%. The S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.7%. One day after capturing its 200-day moving average, the Russell 2000 dipped right back below that level.


Volume fell, saving the indexes from a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). In fact, the S&P 500 shed one distribution day because the June 10 distribution session is now too far back to matter.


A pause or pullback in the stock market is almost natural at this stage. The Nasdaq rallied as much as 63% from its March low. The composite has hardly rested, finding support at the 21-day exponential moving average with each pullback. It happened again this week, reinforcing the moving average's reliability.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP071620-236x300.jpg)Indexes rebounded in late trading Thursday, showing that bulls haven't gone away. The Nasdaq and other major indexes this week have paused, but not so badly to leave the market uptrend in doubt. Indexes are wrestling with competing scenarios and seemingly unsure of their next steps.


Some warning lamps are flashing among economic indicators. Renewed restrictions on businesses, mainly those that provide services to the public, seem certain to slow the economy's rebound. At the same time, the stock market rallies every time there's encouraging news about vaccines for Covid-19.


Sell signals or weak action in a handful of leaders should have forced investors to lower their exposure. On [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) were cut, while several others were reduced in position size. The IBD 50 fell 0.8% Thursday.


Late Thursday, another top stock came under pressure when **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) [beat subscriber estimates but missed profit expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-earnings-q2-2020-nflx-stock/). Shares plunged 10% in extended trading.


Three Ways To Gauge Stock Market Direction
------------------------------------------


What to look for next?


First, watch for fatigue in your holdings. It's been a week during which a number of leaders changed in trading character.


Second, watch the 3233 price level on the S&P 500. It now looms large. That's the high of June 8, and bulls will be pleased if the index can top that level decisively. For now, the S&P 500 is showing hesitation.


Third, the Nasdaq dipped below the 10-day moving average Thursday, but bounced back above it. That's a positive sign. Watch for the Nasdaq to hold above that line and the 21-day average.


It also will be important if indexes pile up more distribution days. The S&P 500 cannot afford many more.


Early Thursday, the Labor Department reported [1.5 million workers filed new claims for unemployment benefits](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/unemployment-claims-raise-red-flag-coronavirus-stalls-recovery-dow-jones-falls/) last week. On a seasonally adjusted basis, claims dipped 10,000 to 1.3 million. While that was slightly worse than expected, the massive numbers of claims has skewed the seasonal adjustment, making that data uncertain.


Jobless claims jumped in Florida, Georgia and California, where new restrictions on businesses were put back in place in response to rising coronavirus infections.


Retail Stocks Lead Stock Market
-------------------------------


Retailers displayed relative strength after June sales came in better than expected. Retail sales rose 7.5% in June, beating economists' estimates for a 5.2% gain. This data point also came with a caveat, because the tally is largely from the period before the latest coronavirus surge.



U.S. retail sales have virtually returned to pre-coronavirus levels, BMO Capital Markets Economic Research senior economist Sal Guatieri said in a report. But the resurgence in coronavirus infections suggests slower progress in coming months. "The bottom line: The better-than-expected resurgence in consumer spending of late is offset by the disturbing resurgence in infections across the South and West, which threatens to send nervous shoppers back to their homes in coming months amid still-high joblessness."


The SPDR Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) rose 0.7% and edged above the 45.52 buy point in a handle area. Utilities were the day's top sector.


Financials were mixed after **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) [blew past earnings and revenue expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/morgan-stanley-earnings-bank-of-america-earnings-q2-2020-bank-stocks/). EPS rose 59% to $1.96 a share on a 31% increase in revenue to $13.41 billion. Fixed-income and equity trading revenue surged, echoing a bullish metric for big banks in Q2. Morgan Stanley stock climbed 2.5%.


**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) also beat views, although earnings fell to 37 cents a share and revenue dropped 3.5% to $22.3 billion. The stock fell 2.7%. Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) was flat after erasing gains.

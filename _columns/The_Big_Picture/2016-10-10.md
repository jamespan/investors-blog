Stocks Rise In Quiet Volume; Oil And Gas Names Lead As Oil Spikes 3%

The stock market started off the week on solid footing, although volume was light due to the Columbus Day holiday. Oil and gas stock did the heavy lifting as oil prices jumped again.


The Nasdaq composite gapped up and rose 0.7%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each rose 0.5%. Both closed in the lower half of their intraday price ranges, not counting the price gaps. On a strong day for oil and gas stocks, you'd think the S&P 500 would've been in the driver's seat, but that wasn't the case.


Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both main exchanges by roughly 12 to 5.


The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.1% gain. The small-cap index bounced nicely off its 50-day line Monday after closing just above it Friday. The IBD 50 performed in line with the Nasdaq, up 0.7%, although 10 names rose 2% or more, including **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)). After a low-volume pullback, it's still in buy range from a 45.47 entry.


![mp101016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP101016-184x300.png)The S&P 500 rose above its 50-day moving average early in the session but ended below the line. The 50-day line has emerged as a resistance level in recent days for the benchmark index. The Dow showed similar action.


The S&P 500 has notched seven distribution days in the past few weeks, but only three had the feel of true institutional selling â€” with a decline of 2.5% on Sept. 9, a 1.5% drop on Sept. 15 and a 0.9% decline on Sept. 29. It's a market under mild distribution at best. But mild distribution can morph into heavy distribution at the drop of a hat, so it's important to keep monitoring signs of institutional selling in the form of higher-volume declines or stalling sessions.


West Texas intermediate crude oil rose $1.35, or 3.1%, to $51.35 a barrel, its highest level in more than one year, after Russia said it was ready to join OPEC in cutting output. OPEC last month announced a preliminary agreement that aims to cut 700,000 barrels a day. An official decision is expected when OPEC meets in Vienna in late November.


Large cap **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) cleared a base-on-base pattern with a 191.04 buy point. Volume was slightly above average.


Group peer **RSP Permian** ([RSPP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSPP)) also cleared a flat base, with a 40.84 buy point in similar turnover.

Oil drillers and oilfield services firms also outperformed in the sector.


[IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) name **Zimmer Biomet** ([ZBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBH)) came close to clearing a 133.29 buy point.


On the downside, a couple of strong-performing new issues ran into trouble. **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) crashed 14% in heavy trade on news of a share offering. **Acacia** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)), meanwhile, fell 7.5% after dropping nearly 9% Friday after the company priced a follow-on share offering at 100. Those who bought Acacia when it bounced nicely off its 50-day moving average last week should be out of the stock because of Monday's heavy-volume break of the 50-day line.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) held up relatively well despite a sell rating from Deutsche Bank. Shares traded in a tight range, falling 1.4% in light turnover. The negative comments came ahead of the company's earnings report next week (Oct. 17).


**Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) will be in the headlines early Tuesday when it reports Q3 results before the open. It might not have the look of a typical CAN SLIM stock, but there's a lot of "new" going on at the aluminum giant.


Alcoa is splitting into two companies soon, in a move to protect shareholders from volatile commodity prices. Arconic will focus on engineering parts for the automotive and aerospace industries. Alcoa will focus on mining, smelting and refining. For the current quarter, after four straight quarters of declining earnings, analysts see profit rising 67% to 35 cents a share. Alcoa is working on a shallow, cup-shaped with a 33.01 buy point.

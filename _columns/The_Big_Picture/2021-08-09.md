title: Stock Market Acts Dull, But Here's What These Leading Stocks Say About The Trend

Dull trading is unexciting trading, to be sure. Yet dull moves can still mean the overall action in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) is constructive.




Amid a month that often draws angst and paragraphs of bearish sentiment among Wall Street veterans, Monday's mixed treatment of the major equity indexes can, in some ways, be quite surprising. After all, long-dated U.S. Treasuries sold off. Oil bears sold ferociously.


And growing worries whether semiconductor firms may become the next industry to fall within the crosshairs of antitrust regulators in China are no doubt putting more than a few investors on edge.


And yet a drop of less than 5 points by the S&P 500, or less than 0.1%, and a 0.3% dip by the Dow Jones Industrial Average to 35,100 indicated that fund managers are less eager to take profits for now.

![MP080921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP080921-235x300.jpg)A 0.6% drop by the Russell 2000 carries a little more weight. Yet that barely exceeds a quarter of the combined gain of 2.3% this small-cap index mustered in the prior two sessions. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite and the tech-centric Nasdaq 100 both edged nearly 0.2% higher. The former holds a modest 2.4% gain since July 1. That slightly underperforms a 3.1% lift by the 500 over the same time frame.


In contrast, WTI crude oil futures sank 2.1%. Gold softened 1.8%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. government bond jumped to 1.31%, the highest level in three weeks, Cboe data showed.


Volume cooled slightly on both main stock exchanges; on the NYSE, turnover fell by a mere 4 million shares to a total 3.177 billion shares.


Meanwhile, action among top-rated growth stocks showed a bullish bias on Monday. [Within the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10), no fewer than 19 companies logged a gain of 1% or more. That compares nicely with 11 names that fell 1% or more so far.


Stock Market Today: Dropping Hard Within The IBD 50
---------------------------------------------------


Looking at the early losers, it shouldn't come as a surprise that **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) fell harder than the market. With any commodity-driven stock, you harbor the additional risk of cyclical moves. But among the others that fell more than the major averages, the selling mostly looked like normal bouts of profit-taking after some really strong short-term rallies.



A daily chart analysis and weekly chart view of the likes of **Ares Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **Lightspeed** ([LSPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSPD)), **Gartner** ([IT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IT)) and **Global-E Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) affirm this point.


**Datadog** ate some of the bullish gap produced from its 15% catapult higher on Aug. 5. Yet the enterprise software firm whittled down its big early loss to a 1.5% decline. Notice how volume, while heavy, pales in comparison with Thursday's awesome gain.


Global-E, as a fast-moving midcap growth stock, is just being Global-E.


The 4.8% drop Monday, on top of Friday's 10% thrashing, is certainly unpleasant for shareholders. So far, the e-commerce facilitator has made key tests of the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Will it survive another?


More Results To Come
--------------------


Stock market activity should heat up. We're still a long way away from completing what's generally been a favorable second-quarter earnings season.


Please check out the [Earnings Calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) and the latest [Stock Market Today columns](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) to keep abreast of market-moving earnings news.


Meanwhile, the astute IBD reader no doubt is keeping a close eye on the elevated [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on both the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Indeed, a large number of institutional sell-offs should never be ignored. Yet few of the current distribution days in the rolling 25-trading-day account showed real bite. For instance, out of the five seen in the Nasdaq lately, just the July 19 decline (1.1%) exceeded 1%.


The average drop for the seven S&P 500 [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), including a rare stalling day on July 14, is a reasonable 0.6%.

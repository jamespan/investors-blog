Stocks kicked off a shortened week of trading with a mixed performance Tuesday, but it was an impressive showing as buyers came into the market late in the session.


The S&P 500 was poised for another distribution day, albeit a mild one, but the benchmark index pared losses and ended near its session high, falling just 0.1%. The Nasdaq added 0.3% and the Dow lagged, falling 0.5%, weighed down by weakness in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)). Volume rose sharply from Friday’s levels, although trading was light Friday ahead of the Memorial Day weekend.


For the month of May, the Nasdaq rose 3.6% and the S&P 500 added 1.5%. The Dow ended fractionally higher.


Oil and gas names outperformed in the S&P 500 Tuesday. Miners and biotechs also outperformed.


Crude oil for July delivery ended lower ahead of Thursday’s meeting of oil producers in Vienna. It lost 23 cents, or 0.5%, to $49.10 a barrel after hitting a high of $50.10. The $50 level is starting to look like a resistance level.


![MP053116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP053116-177x300.jpg)Don’t look now, but the Nasdaq and S&P 500 could try to clear April highs soon. The Nasdaq is within striking range of its high of 4969.32. The S&P 500 is just below its high of 2111.05. With the market in a confirmed uptrend, the bulls have reason to be optimistic. But the prior highs also pose a possible resistance level.


What the market also has going for it is plenty of high-quality names acting well and holding near highs. A bona fide market uptrend should have quality growth stocks leading the charge and several are in position to provide that leadership. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are good examples.


Meanwhile, the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) is trying to break out over a descending trend line found by connecting the highs starting in early August. The index of leading growth stocks rose nearly 0.2% Tuesday.


IBD 50 member **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) is showing signs of accumulation. It’s near highs as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base. NetEase is working on its fourth straight weekly price gain.


Also in the IBD 50, **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) isn’t showing the same accumulation trends as NetEase, but it’s setting up in a cup-shaped base ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close.


Among Tuesday’s movers, top-rated **International Game Technology** ([IGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGT)) rose for the third straight session in above-average volume. It’s still in buy range from an 18.74 cup-with-handle buy point.


A breakout for **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) looked good for a while Tuesday when it cleared a flat base with a 260.93 entry, but it ended below the buy point. Volume was average but still the heaviest for an up day since early April.


In economic news, consumer spending in April rose by the most in almost seven years, giving the Fed more reason to raise rates at the June meeting. The odds of a rate hike at that meeting spiked last week, but it’s not a slam dunk by any means. Last week, odds of a rate hike were around 30%. Now, they’re around 23%.


Meanwhile, consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in May to 92.6, according to the Conference Board. The new reading missed the consensus estimate of 97 and was also below April's upwardly revised reading of 94.7.

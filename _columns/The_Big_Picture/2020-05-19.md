Stocks forfeited mild gains Tuesday during a sell-off that started right before the start of the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average spent virtually the entire session in lower ground. Given the prior day's stout gains and a strong rally since the middle of last week, Tuesday's pause does not look abnormal.




Was the late-afternoon based on headline-reacting algorithmic trading programs? No one can answer definitively. But anything related to the coronavirus still gets plenty of attention.


The Dow industrials' 1.5% drop stood out vs. a 0.5% decline for the Nasdaq composite. The S&P 500 backtracked nearly 1.1%. The small-cap S&P 600, up 7.2% on Monday, retreated 2.1%.


Volume fell on both main exchanges.

On Monday, stocks roared on Phase 1 results from **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), the Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech that has received a nine-figure contract to come up with a vaccine for Covid-19. News that all 45 trial participants developed binding antibodies (while eight of the 45 also showed apparently more significant "neutralizing antibodies") cheered investors.


But on Tuesday afternoon, CNBC cited a story on StatNews.com that warned against excessive optimism. The website noted that Moderna's partner, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been notably silent about the study so far. A Johns Hopkins University researcher argued that two-week-old antibodies don't necessarily survive.


Meanwhile, StatNews added that "testing for neutralizing antibodies is more time-consuming than other antibody tests and must be done in a biosecurity level 3 laboratory."


Dow Jones Vs. Nasdaq
--------------------


At 24,206, the 30-stock Dow industrials certainly looks much better than it did two months ago. But it still stands barely above the midpoint between a February peak of 29,568 and its March 23 low of 18,213. The Dow still treads on the south side of its 200-day moving average.


In contrast, the Nasdaq is showing signs of leading both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages — plus the 21-day exponential moving average — higher.



**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) stung the Dow Jones, falling 7.25 points, or nearly 3%, in above-average volume. The home-improvement chain was an absolute all-star in the early 1980s. After its in IPO on Sept. 29, 1981, shares soared more than 17-fold over the next two years, forming tightly wound bases along the way.


But back then, it was a sprightly young growth stock, producing heavy-duty profit and sales growth.


On Tuesday, the blue chip reported an 8% drop in first-quarter earnings to $2.08 a share, missing the FactSet view by 8%. Sales jumped 7%. Its rebound from a multiyear low of 140.63 is darn impressive. A new breakout could still emerge. But the new big winners of this confirmed uptrend are showing much stronger increases as the post-coronavirus economy evolves.


The Dow Jones is simply not as nimble an index in capturing new growth trends. That's why making a regular habit of using dynamic stock lists — from the wide-net [MarketSmith 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) to the superfocused [Sector Leaders screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) to the curated lists on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) — give investors a chance to outperform a blue-chip gauge.


Beyond Dow Jones
----------------


**Livongo Health** ([LVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVGO)) bucked Tuesday's decline. Shares gained nearly 3% and now stand 35% above a 44.90 handle entry on a big cup base. The Mountain View, Calif., company's digital devices help users manage chronic health conditions, including diabetes.



Like Livongo, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) and **Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) have gotten [airplay on IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958). All three are transforming diabetes care. The quartet's average [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is almost 95. All four companies have a home on the Nasdaq.


The median RS Rating for the 30 Dow industrial stocks is 61.

A modestly higher open Wednesday quickly turned tail as major averages declined again in higher volume.

  

The weak action was enough to put the market into a correction. The Nasdaq slumped 1.4%, continuing its string of underperformance. It closed decisively below its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 lost 0.7% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.6%.

  

The selling intensified after President Obama spoke sternly in Brussels about the Russia-Ukraine situation.

  

The IBD 50 underperformed, falling 2.2%. Nearly half the names on the list of top-rated growth stocks are below their 50-day moving averages.

  

The market has made it a habit recently of sending mixed signals about its health, but the negatives outweigh the positives for now. The S&P 500 is only 1% off its recent high, but its past seven declines show closes in the bottom half of its intraday range or near lows. That's a sign of waning buying demand.

  

The recent rotation out of biotech stocks, a former leading group in the market, is also noteworthy. In recent cases where the market uptrend has been under pressure, significant rotation out of market leaders was absent.

  

So where has the money gone? The Dow isn't the most relevant of indexes these days, but money has been flowing out of aggressive growth stocks and into blue-chip names. Dow components such as **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) are flirting with or hitting new highs.

  

What we know for sure is that it's a market under distribution. IBD changed its outlook to "market uptrend under pressure" on March 13 when the Nasdaq notched another distribution day, falling 1.5% in higher volume. That was the time to start adopting a defensive posture with current holdings.

  

Signs of distribution in the major averages have been out there for a while, meaning exposure to stocks should have been limited headed into Wednesday. If you're still holding profitable positions in institutional-quality names like **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)), **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)), that's OK, but they should be kept on an even tighter leash now.

  

Facebook gave up its 50-day moving average in heavy volume on news it's buying virtual reality headset maker Oculus for $1.9 billion in cash and stock. A 32% gain from a 54.93 buy point is now just 10%.

  

China-based **Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)) flashed a sell signal Wednesday. It crashed below its 50-day moving average and round-tripped a 29% gain from a 96.35 buy point.

  

Meanwhile, the highly anticipated IPO of **King Digital Entertainment** ([KING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KING)) was a dud. The maker of the "Candy Crush" smartphone game slumped 16% on its first day of trading. The company priced at 22.50, at the midpoint of a proposed range of 21-24.

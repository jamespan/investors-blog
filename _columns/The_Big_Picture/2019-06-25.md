  Fed Debate On Interest Rates Spooks Investors; Is The New Bull Run Over?

When uncertainty wafts through the air on Wall Street, institutions smell it. On Tuesday, they reacted with considerable force.




Key stock indexes suffered their biggest decline since the market set a near-term low on June 3 and the Nasdaq posted a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) just four trading sessions later.


Yet perhaps the biggest damage in the session appeared in the charts of the latest breakout attempts by top growth stocks. A few made the accompanying Market Pulse table.


**Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) and **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) issued classic sell signals for those who bought at [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) earlier in the year. The two dynamic leaders in work management software and budget gyms, respectively, dived below the 50-day moving average in hefty turnover.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP_2x1_062519-206x300.jpg)A failure to quickly rebound back above the 50-day or 10-week line, following a strong price run-up, constitutes a [key defensive sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).


Nasdaq, Techs Lead The Decline
------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite fell the most among the key indexes, losing 1.5%. Credit even bigger sell-offs in enterprise and desktop software firms as well as weak action in the FAANG stocks for the outsize loss, the Nasdaq's biggest since a 1.6% crumbling on June 3. The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, slipped nearly 1.7%.


The S&P 500 fell almost 1%. Small caps, licking big wounds in recent weeks, somehow outperformed. The Russell 2000 gave up 0.6%, the S&P SmallCap 600 less than 0.5%.


Volume jumped on both main exchanges. That added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. The overall count remains low.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped nearly 1.9%, sinking more than 1% for the second time in three sessions. The Dow transports backtracked 0.9% and the Dow utilities 0.7%.


On the economic front, a sharp drop in May new-home sales and a slide in a key consumer confidence survey for June also helped set the day's negative tone. (See details in the [IBD Economic Calendar](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).)


Fed Debate Today
----------------


Wall Street opened on a sour note, then accelerated its sell-off after news wires reported comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He reiterated during a speech hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations in New York that the central bank is "insulated from short-term political pressures," Reuters reported.


Powell and colleagues are also "grappling" with the question of whether the tariff war between the U.S. and China and future inflation warrant an immediate cut in interest rates. James Bullard, head of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, reportedly told Bloomberg TV that he thinks a 50-basis-point cut in the rate on overnight loans to big banks is unwarranted at the upcoming July 30-31 meeting.


Bond traders currently see a 100% chance of at least a quarter-point shave in the fed funds rate late next month. Over the prior 3-1/2 years, the Fed raised short-term interest rates from a target range of 0%-0.25% to the current 2.25%-2.5%.


On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year note dived below 2% for the second time in four trading days. U.S. Treasury data showed the yield finishing the day at 2.00%, down 7 basis points since the start of June.


That drop is plain vanilla compared with the 23 basis-point plunge in yields on 3-month T-bills, from 2.35% to 2.12%.


And no wonder. The latest CME Group Fed Watch data also shows a 19.6% probability of three cuts of a quarter point each in the ultra-short-term fed funds rate by September to a 1.5%-1.75% range. Traders also now price in a nearly 25% chance of at least four quarter-point cuts — not a misprint, four — to a 1.25%-1.5% range by the Fed's final meeting of the year on Dec. 11.


Big Caps Vs. Small Caps
-----------------------


On a technical standpoint, large caps have delivered better returns in the second quarter.


At 2917, the S&P 500 still holds a 2.9% gain since April 1. Three trading days remain in Q2. The large-cap index also just spent its 13th straight session above the key 50-day moving average.


At 922, [the S&P 600](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nyse-s-and-p-smallcap-600-index-0sandp6.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily) is down mildly in Q2, off almost 2%. The index has [dipped further below its own 50-day moving average](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nyse-s-and-p-smallcap-600-index-0sandp6.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily). That 50-day line, drawn in red in all IBD daily charts and at [MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks), has treaded mildly lower since the end of April.


Steve Lipper, senior investment strategist at Royce Funds, notes that the current lagging performance by small caps ($3 billion market value is his cut-off) is rare. The fund manager's research finds that looking at 12-month returns over the past 20 years, smaller gains by small caps vs. large caps take place only 6% to 7% of the time.


Lipper credits the gap to the big decline in yields for long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds, noting that lower yields tend to benefit large cap firms more.


"The direction of the ISM survey also runs in favor of large caps right now," Lipper told IBD in an interview. "When the ISM survey falls, there tends to be more headwinds for small caps."


These Sectors Defy The Stock Market Drop
----------------------------------------


Some food and restaurant stocks attracted buyers.



**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), formerly on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) this year, gained 1.2% and is holding above a recent breakout point at 721.31.


Industry compatriots **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **Yum China** ([YUMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUMC)) edged higher. The latter is forming a cup that shows a perfectly normal correction of 20.5% from head to toe within the new base. A handle hasn't formed yet.


Outside the restaurant patch, two Chinese growth companies have now joined [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders).

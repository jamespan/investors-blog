The stock market whipsawed following a hotter-than-expected jobs report, with the lack of a decisive move underlining the uncertain picture ahead.




The Nasdaq composite fared best as it inched 0.1% higher, giving it a five-session win streak. It ended the week up a muscular 4.6% and managed to edge past the 10-week moving average to boot. Nevertheless, it remains down almost 26% for the year.


The S&P 500 faded late after a choppy day, slipping 0.1%. A gain of 1.9% for the week means it is still languishing below its major moving averages.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was disappointing, with most ending up in the red. Only health and technology managed to turn in gains. Materials lagged the most.


Blue chips also failed to make any headway. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session down 0.1%. [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **UnitedHealth Group** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were among the top components.


The Russell 2000 ended the day fractionally negative, though it was solidly higher for the week. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) also saw gains fade late as it fell 0.1%.

Optimists will point to indexes holding weekly gains, but continued volatility looks likely.


Jobs Report Hot, Strengthens Fed's Hand
---------------------------------------


Stocks in general managed to shrug off an early slide after news that the economy [created 372,000 jobs in June](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-stays-strong-in-june-as-wage-growth-eases-dow-jones/). This was well clear of the Econoday consensus for 270,000 jobs.


Wages edged up 0.3% from May, in line with estimates. Year-over-year, wages were up 5.1%, slightly above the 5% consensus.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya told IBD the payroll report has paved the way for another 75-basis-point rate hike at the next Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting at the end of the month.


"Wall Street is growing nervous that the Fed will have to aggressively tighten policy and that will send the economy to a recession at some point next year," he said. "Stocks go down as yields go up, but hope for a soft landing is keeping the bond market sell-off at bay."

Industry Group Benefits From Elon Musk Report
---------------------------------------------


It is always important to keep track of the top-performing industry groups, even in a lukewarm session.



Friday was a day for solar stocks to shine, with medical services plays also faring well.


The struggling auto manufacturers group also managed to squeeze out a solid gain thanks to **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which rose 2.5%. The stock was boosted on [a report that threw further doubt](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-acquisition-by-elon-musk-in-jeopardy/) on CEO Elon Musk's deal to buy **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)). Reports late Friday suggested that Musk was indeed terminating the deal.


Tobacco stocks and consumer loan plays were among the worst performers. Consumer electronics retailers also struggled badly. The group includes **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), which plunged 5% following the firing of finance chief Mike Recupero.

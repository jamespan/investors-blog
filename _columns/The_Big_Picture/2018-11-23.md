Nasdaq 100 Falls 5% For Week As This Sector Fell Harder Than Apple
===================================================================

On a day when most Americans are focused on buying — that is, good deals on Black Friday — traders on Wall Street seemed more intent on selling. And this time, Apple did not just fall solo.




**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) dropped more than 2.7% to 171.97 and is now barely up for the year. The megacap tech's 26% correction from a 233.47 high is unmistakably weighing on the Nasdaq composite. The tech-heavy index sagged 0.5% on Friday to close the Thanksgiving holiday-shortened week with a 4.3% loss.


Apple And The Nasdaq 100 Get A Black Eye
----------------------------------------


The Nasdaq 100, which houses the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, dropped almost 5% for the week. That marked its worst weekly performance since a 7.3% slide in the week ended March 23.


On Friday, the Nasdaq showed a slightly smaller drop than the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, both of which fell around 0.7%. The reason can be summed up in one three-letter word: Oil.


Near-term West Texas Intermediate oil futures plunged again. On Friday, prices fell more than 6%. At $50.39 a barrel, WTI has now fallen a staggering 35% below its 52-week peak near $77.


This body-slamming of crude oil prices comes amid a growing controversy over U.S.-Saudi Arabian relations following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And oil's impact on U.S. equity markets is plain to see.

Oil and gas royalty trust fell more than 4%. The international exploration and production (E&P), U.S. E&P, drilling, field services and integrated industry groups each fell 3% or more. Coal, steel, metal ores and gold mining shares also plummeted.


When Oil Falls Big Time, So Do U.S. Stocks
------------------------------------------


The last time crude oil went into a bear market? It began in June 2014. Oil tumbled from around $107 to a low of just above $26 in January 2016. U.S. equities did not fall as much. But the S&P 500 suffered at least three intermediate corrections of 10% to 15% over that time frame. The S&P 500 eventually hit new highs in July 2016.


Volume on Friday fell sharply vs. Wednesday as Wall Street closed its session at 1 p.m. ET, rather than the usual closing time of 4 p.m. But compared with the turnover at 1 p.m. on Tuesday (roughly 1.4 billion shares) and at 1 p.m. on Wednesday (981 million), Nasdaq turnover also ran lower at that hour.


A handful of [top growth stocks in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) showed some encouraging action. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) edged up 0.3%. The Russell 2000 ended a hair higher. Airlines, which benefit from lower crude oil prices, helped push the Dow transports up 0.5%.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 1 basis point to 3.05%, matching an Oct. 2 low.

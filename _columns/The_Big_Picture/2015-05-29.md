Stocks Suffer Moderate Sell-Off, But Strength Persists In Niches
=================================================================

Stocks chalked up yet another week of small changes and tight weekly closes. The Nasdaq on Friday fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.6%. The IBD 50 lost 0.5%.

  

Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq.

  

The action was enough to add a distribution day to both major indexes. However, the count remains manageable for now. Recent stalling and distribution — and accumulation — have had a soft quality, contributing to the market's indefinite tone.

  

Distribution involves a significant loss in a major index on rising volume, pointing to institutional selling. Accumulation involves a decent gain in rising volume, suggesting institutional buying.

  

For the week, two days of distribution and one of accumulation added up to a mixed picture. Fund managers can't seem to come to a consensus on this market.

  

Take a look at the weekly charts of the indexes.

  

In the past four or five weeks, weekly gains and losses have been less than 1% in the major indexes and most often less than 0.5%. This is virtually no movement.

  

Volume declined in each of the past four weeks. (The Memorial Day holiday shortened the most recent week.)

  

If the market were a single stock, tight weekly closes in mostly low volume would be considered constructive action, though the market "stock" would need a breakout to prove its true worth.

  

The market has been stuck in this channel of sorts since late February. While breakouts among top-rated stocks continue to appear, strong action after a breakout is rare.

  

Back further on the Nasdaq chart, another narrow channel ran from late November to mid-February. The highs of that channel essentially became the lows of the current channel.

  

The temptation is to expect a decisive move up or down from the channel. However, there's the possibility for a repeat: A step or two up might lead to a new channel, with the current highs becoming the lows.

  

That move would be positive, but it might not be enough to drive solid gains after a breakout.

  

Is there anything that could shift this market into a decisively bullish or decisively bearish mode?

  

The news has in a sense tested the market. Yet even Greece's debt, China's economic deceleration and signs of a slowing U.S. economy haven't been able to trigger heavy selling.

  

On the buy side, mergers and talk of mergers have at times fired up segments of the market. On Friday, managed-care stocks advanced on reports that **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) might be [a takeover target](http://news.investors.com/052915-754859-humana-might-sell-itself-aetna-cigna.htm).

  

While mergers can help stocks in the same industry group — just take a look at the Market Pulse below — it's hard to sustain broader market gains with acquisitions in a single group.

  

Economic news was mixed Friday. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for May came in slightly stronger than expected. Meanwhile, the second take on Q1 GDP came in with an 0.7% decline, one tick better than the 0.8% decline expected.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 gained 0.3%. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 lost 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively.

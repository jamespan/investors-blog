Stocks Stay Sideways; Jackson Hole Gala, GDP Ahead
===================================================

U.S. stock indexes sketched more sideways action on their weekly charts Friday, leaving both market bulls and bears uneasy.


The Nasdaq was virtually flat Friday while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.2% each. The Dow Jones utility average showed the biggest loss, a 1.3% drop, while the Philadelphia semiconductor index led on the upside with a 0.9% pop.


The IBD 50 inched up 0.1%.

For the past five weeks, the S&P 500 has moved sideways with only a slight upward bias. The Nasdaq has done the same for three weeks.


Individual investors might be tempted to wonder what the next move will be: a breakout from the trading range or a breakdown?


Evidence is mixed.


For the bears, three things stand out:


First, the ratio of bullish advisors to bearish advisors is hinting at a market top.


Second, the percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day moving average line is disturbingly high.


Third, the indexes have enjoyed a good run since February, which by bear logic makes the market due for a pullback.


For the bulls, four items make their case:


First, sector rotation is looking more growth-oriented as chips, electronics and software rise, while utilities and more defensive sectors fade.


Second, the balance of new highs to new lows is still positive, though it has shown some slippage.


Third, the broadest gauge of the money supply, Divisia M4 including Treasuries, ticked up 4.9% in July. Monetarists say this should eventually help the U.S. economy.


Fourth, for bulls who like to play themes, there's no shortage of choices: Oil appears to be resuming its February-June run; online retail is beating the heck out of bricks and mortar stores; and banks could benefit if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates a notch.


The notion that the Fed will raise rates -- at one of its remaining 2016 meetings -- gained credence last week.


For the week, the IBD 50 rose 0.9%, and the Nasdaq, 0.1%. The S&P 500 was nearly flat.


**Coming up**: Look for plenty of economic data but also two big items: The second take on GDP in Q2 will be released before the market's open Friday. And the annual Fed symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., will be held Thursday and Friday. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen will speak Friday.

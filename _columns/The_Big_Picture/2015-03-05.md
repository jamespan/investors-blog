Stocks took more baby steps Thursday as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 continued a cautious trend.

  

The Nasdaq tapped out a 0.3% gain, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.1%. The IBD 50 rose 1.1%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

The Jan. 28 distribution day on the S&P 500 dropped off because of time. A distribution day, which points to institutional selling, is no longer relevant to current conditions after five weeks.

  

The indexes have been relatively quiet since mid-February, scoring an average daily gain of 0.1% on the Nasdaq and even less than that for the S&P 500.

  

News didn't budge the indexes much Thursday, which in one sense was fortunate.

  

U.S. economic reports were lackluster. First-time jobless claims were worse than expected, and January factory orders missed the consensus estimate.

  

The big news, though, came from Europe. The European Central Bank announced it would begin its quantitative easing program Monday. All but the exact timing of this was expected, but an additional announcement was not widely anticipated.

  

ECB economists raised their 2015 economic growth estimate to 1.5%, up from 1% in December. For 2016, they lifted the estimate to 1.9%, up from 1.5%.

  

This did next to nothing to fire up the U.S. stock market.

  

A quiet market that shrugs off good news doesn't lend itself to broad gains. Individual investors need to find the strong niches within the market to succeed.

  

Going into Thursday's trade, the Nasdaq [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-spotlight/030515-742170-biogen-idec-stock-new-high.htm) was up 17% year to date, easily topping the major indexes.

  

At the turn of the year, chip stocks on the Nasdaq were popping up in the Spotlight screen, and they have done very well.

  

Another area of strength is select big caps. The Big Cap 20 Index is up 8% year to date vs. 2% for the small-cap S&P 600.

  

Even some familiar big-cap names are doing well.

  

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) cleared a flat base in January and is up sharply from its breakout.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) passed a 103.84 flat-base entry in October, a 114.87 early entry in January and a 119.85 buy point in February. The stock gained 21%, 10% and 5% respectively from those entries.

  

Both stocks had to endure some turbulence, but the patient investor was rewarded.

  

These two stocks might not be kicking rivals and taking names like they once did, but these are solid gains in the current market.

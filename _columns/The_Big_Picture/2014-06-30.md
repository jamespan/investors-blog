Market Gives Mixed Showing, But Leaders Shine
==============================================

The market started a short trading week with mixed results Monday. But leaders gave a better showing.


Thanks in part to chip and software stocks, the Nasdaq mustered a 0.2% gain. The tech-heavy index rose as much as 0.4% and touched a fresh 14-year high. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rallied 1.1% to its best closing high since March 8, 2002.


The S&P 500 seesawed to a fractional loss. But it's still less than 1% away from its June 24 record high. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.3%.


The IBD 50 outperformed with a 0.4% gain. **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) jumped 5% to a record high. It's now nearly 4% past a 47.03 buy point from a late-stage base.


**Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) ramped up nearly 5% in more than twice its average trade. The stock closed 32% past a 25.19 entry from a cup-with-handle pattern.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) added to its seven-week win streak. Although it ended off its session high, it still added 3% after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the stock and reiterated an overweight rating.


**Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)), **Principal Financial Group** ([PFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFG)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) each tried to break out from bases. Volume was soft in all three. Gilead even reversed lower. A breakout is a time where you want to see overwhelming demand for shares, so trading volume should be at least 40% above average.


Volume was down sharply on both major exchanges Monday. That wasn't surprising because the rebalancing of the Russell indexes jacked up Friday's turnover.


With the stock market closed Friday for the Independence Day holiday and a half-session set for Thursday, investors can expect trading to taper off as the week wears on.


Preholiday trading tends to belistless on Wall Street.Don't forget to re-evaluate your portfolio and see which of your holdings are up 20% to 25% from buy points. In most such cases, you should be taking partial profits. Energy leaders such as **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) and **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) have climbed enough that investors should consider taking profits.


You don't have to keep holding stocks that haven't risen much from their buy points. You can sell those and use the funds on other breakout stocks.


There is one wrinkle to this week's four-day trading week: The June jobs report will be out Thursday morning and may make for some volatility.


Stocks capped the month of June with strong gains. The Nasdaq jumped 3.9% for its second straight monthly gain. The S&P 500 rose 1.9% â€” the fifth straight month of gains.

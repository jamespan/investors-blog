These Growth Stocks Get Hammered, But Nasdaq Rallies 3rd Straight Week; Watch This Stock Market Risk In October
================================================================================================================

Investors can always count on earnings season for some sensational moves.




On Tuesday, Wall Street giant **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and most of the money center banks grabbed tons of media play. JPMorgan, [back in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), finished with a 3.8% gain for the week and a refreshed [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past 117.34.


Then came **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), whose CEO admitted during a quarterly conference call that new orders have slowed. That stock got sent to the cleaners. The member of IBD's enterprise software industry group plunged 14% for the week, raising questions whether it's hit bottom.


So, doesn't it feel a bit strange that the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for the week (albeit by only 0.2%) despite JPMorgan's bullish advance? Or that the Nasdaq composite actually moved higher for a third straight week (up 0.4%, following gains of 0.5% and 0.9% in the prior two weeks) despite a bruising session on Friday and a black eye for business software firms heading into the weekend?


A Weird Week On Wall Street
---------------------------


Here's another quasi-paradox to chew on.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP_8x7_101819-274x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite fell 0.8% and volume climbed. This price-and-volume action translates into yet another [day of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). And as the Market Pulse shows, the distribution count has reached as high as the number of runs the Houston Astros' sluggers have been hitting against the New York Yankees pitching staff lately. In other words, it's a high number.


The S&P 500, off 0.4%, also picked up another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) as NYSE volume rose. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.8% but rebounded decently off its session low.


So, how can the IBD outlook remain "confirmed uptrend" when the market is still littered with real institutional selling?


One explanation may be this: Rotation is getting hotter and heavier.


Remember how, in the first half of the year, it seemed like almost every column on Investors.com featured some company involved in cloud-based software? Not anymore. In the first half of 2019, security, desktop, specialty enterprise and medical software stocks gushed to new highs. But look at the [new highs list lately](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-17-2019/), and you'll see more of a tilt toward areas such as construction, real estate and REITs. Retail has joined the party too.


Keep a close eye on [earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) the next two weeks. Tons will come, and with it some risk for the month of October. Negative outlooks can certainly cause even more selling pressure to hit U.S. stocks.


Growth Stocks And Lower Interest Rates
--------------------------------------


Meanwhile, the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates for a third time this year increased to 89%, according to CME Group. This means that the fed funds rate will likely go down a quarter point to a 1.5%-1.75% range at the end of the Oct. 29-30 meeting of the U.S. central bank.


Homebuilders had a great week, rising 2.7% on Friday and advancing nearly 9% for the week. Wood products, medical systems and equipment, metal ores and heavy construction firms also enjoyed beefy gains Friday.

Small cap **PennyMac Mortgage** ([PFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFSI)) highlighted in today's [New Highs column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/leading-stocks-at-new-highs-a-groundhog-day-performance/), followed through on a breakout past a 32.34 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [tight flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).

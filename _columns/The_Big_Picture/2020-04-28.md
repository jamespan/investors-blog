Growth Stocks Take Back Seat To Small Caps, Cyclicals; Not Time To Sell Stocks Yet
===================================================================================

Many leading growth stocks deserve a break. Some institutional investors evidently agreed.




Tuesday's mixed session contained a wee bit of [sector rotation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-stock-market-winners-watch-changing-industry-group-power/). Some stocks and ETFs decided not to follow the bullish dance of "two steps forward, one step back." And a few breakouts fizzled.


However, the 35,000-foot view of Wall Street still seemed to give the picture that a confirmed market uptrend, [started on April 2 thanks to the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) and now headed for its 19th session on Wednesday, still shows decent legs.


On the short side of the market spectrum, the Nasdaq composite fell 1.4% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.5%. But the Russell 2000 beamed 1.3% higher; the NYSE financial sector index matched that gain. The NYSE composite rose 0.5%.


Indeed, construction, energy and financial issues shined. Regional banks, perhaps rising on the prospect that more U.S. states will lift some Covid-19-related stay-at-home orders, helped boost other indexes.

Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session — in fact, by fewer than 5 million shares, or around 0.1%, to 3.67 billion. Turnover grew mildly on the NYSE, according to early data.


Significant declines of 0.2% or more by the key indexes in higher turnover meet the textbook definition of a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). [Too many big distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/) in a short period of time can end a bull run. The spate of heavy selling in late February serves as just the latest example.


But at this point, these sessions of unusually strong professional selling have been scant.


Bad Day For Nasdaq, But A Better Rating
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP_1x1_042820-249x300.jpg)Meanwhile, headed into Tuesday's trading, the Nasdaq showed a much-improved Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-.


That's up from the lowest possible grade of E in the March 30 edition of IBD Weekly.


Plus, a closer look into market internals suggests that Tuesday's down day was not that discouraging.


Advancers beat decliners on both exchanges. On the Nasdaq, gainers led by a 4-3 ratio. On the Big Board, the margin improved to nearly 5-to-2 in favor of rising stocks.


If the NYSE continues to show this bullish trend, expect its advance-decline line to reach its highest levels since early March. (Please see the A-D line by going to the [General Market Indicators page, on the S&P 500 chart](https://services.investors.com/pdf/IBD2704152507GMI2.pdf). The page is updated each day at "Market Trend" on Investors.com. A link is also found at the bottom of each day's Big Picture.)


Here's another curious divergence. Volume among stocks on the Nasdaq that rose in price exceeded turnover among declining stocks by roughly 300 million shares.


Growth Stocks Today
-------------------


Volatility will likely rise in general as a mother lode of companies report quarterly results. [Monday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/sp500-russell-2000-reclaim-key-levels-breakouts-lack-luster-this-way/) notes FactSet research is so far pointing to smaller than expected gains for sales and fewer earnings beats among S&P 500 firms.



After the close, [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) showed weakness following good but not great results. Q1 [profit surged 200% to 18 cents a share](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-earnings-q1-2020-amd-stock/). But it just met the FactSet consensus view. The growing force in gaming and data center semiconductors also trimmed the lower end of full-year sales guidance.


Looking at action in extended-hours trading, the low of 52.40 simply carried AMD's stock back into the [handle of its emerging cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Meanwhile, market leaders **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) all eased in light or decelerating volume Tuesday.



[Others in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) bucked the decline with tidy gains, including **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)), now forming a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Will This Type Of Base Form In More Growth Stocks?
--------------------------------------------------



Among breakouts, IBD 50 firm **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) and new IPO **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) did the opposite of what you'd like to see. Both finished the day below their buy points in cup-without-handle bases (335.53 and 19.60, respectively).


The strong short-term bounce off the market's March 23 low has resulted in many highly rated stocks forming [V-shaped bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/). "Straight up from the bottom" is another phrase from IBD founder William O'Neil that has gotten mentioned in recent sessions of [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958).


However, a failed breakout does not mean the next breakout will also fail. Perhaps the next few months will see another kind of pattern form: [the base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/).


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) slid nearly 1.9% Tuesday. [MarketSmith's chart pattern recognition feature](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) highlights a cup with handle for QQQ.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF fell 1.8%, backtracking below its sharply downward-sloping 50-day moving average. It's now given back just a portion of its 7.8% gain since the April 21 close.


Buying strengthened on the long end of U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell 5 basis points to 0.62%. The Federal Reserve is slated to announce the results of a two-day meeting on interest rates on Wednesday.


U.S. GDP Data Coming: A Rear-View Mirror Report?
------------------------------------------------


On Wednesday before the market open, expect the [first reading on U.S. gross domestic product](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). It will be a historic number.


[The Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) shows a consensus estimate for a 3.7% contraction on an annualized basis for the January-March period. But you could drive a Mack truck in between the worst view (a 7% plunge) and the most optimistic one (-0.3%).


Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at Los Angeles-based bond fund management giant Payden & Rygel, expects GDP to crater 20% in the second quarter.


"We expect an elongated U-shaped recovery after that," Cleveland told IBD in an email. "No sharp bounce back. You can't turn off an economy and turn it back on with ease. By year-end 2020, U.S. economic output is 4% below end-2019 levels."


All the more reason to believe that 2020 will be great for stock pickers.


Plus, never forget that the stock market itself is a forward-looking economic indicator.

Why Growth Stocks Suggest The Stock Market Uptrend Is Not Ready To Quit
========================================================================

The session ended well for the stock market Wednesday, as indexes and most growth stocks managed to rebound from morning sell-offs. It was another sign the confirmed market uptrend is not quitting.




The Nasdaq composite sank as much as 2.1% but recovered that entire loss. The composite closed 0.8% higher, finding support near its short-term 10-day moving average. It was a remarkable rebound, and one that many growth stocks mirrored.


Technology, health care, internet and telecom — sectors that propelled the stock market from its coronavirus-bear-market depths — came under duress this week. [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), a growth index, fell 0.3% and is down more than 2% for the week. Many [software leaders that served as stay-at-home or telework tools slid](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/software-growth-stocks-work-from-home-plays-fall-as-states-reopen/) as coronavirus lockdowns were relaxed more.


The rotation left some leaders wounded. **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) has lost 11.3% since the market came back from Memorial Day, wiping out much of the gains from its 281.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) lost 4.6% Wednesday and 8.1% for the week. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Silicon Motion** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and other growth leaders tumbled.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MP052720-250x300.jpg)However, many stocks pared losses or even made bullish price reversals. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)), **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) rebounded after [touching their 50-day and 10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). That shows institutional investors took advantage of the dip to buy more shares.


Bullish Price Action For Growth Stocks
--------------------------------------


Those single-day price bars with long bodies and closes near the top delight chart readers. Many other top-rated stocks found support at other key price levels. In sum, the woes of top growth stocks could be short-lived.


The market shows little fear despite significant threats. Health experts fear more people will contract Covid-19 as commerce slowly reopens. U.S. coronavirus deaths hovered around 100,000. The economy faces massive unemployment. President Donald Trump said he plans [a strong response to China's security law](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-slides-on-u-s-china-tensions-doubts-about-russian-output-cuts-idUSKBN233016?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29), which limits Hong Kong autonomy.


Stocks seemed ready to pause when the S&P 500 got to the 3000 level this week. As The Big Picture had noted, that's the type of major round number that can trigger profit taking. If institutions want to lock in profits, they'll take any excuse to sell. The S&P 500 milestone seemed to be the trigger.


S&P 500 Closes Above 3000
-------------------------


The S&P 500 rebounded to a 1.5% gain Wednesday and closed above 3000 for the first time since March 5. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.2%.


Small caps shined, as the Russell 2000 rallied 3.1%. It is a good sign for the market when smaller stocks — often viewed as higher risk — participate in a market rally.


It's also encouraging that market leadership is broadening. The [Nasdaq's advance-decline line](https://services.investors.com/pdf/IBD2605152515GMI2.pdf) is now on a higher trajectory after three weeks in which it lagged the index's advance. The NYSE's advance-decline line shares a similar shape, although it tracked the S&P 500's May retrenchment.


Advancing stock led decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq Wednesday and by better than 13 to 3 on the NYSE.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. What could have been a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) earlier in the session turned out to be a day of accumulation. No matter, the amount of distribution in the current market is negligible.

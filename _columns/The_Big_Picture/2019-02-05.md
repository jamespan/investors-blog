  Stock Market Keeps Rising, But When Will It Pause?

The stock market extended its winter rally, with the major indexes fighting off a midday slump to close 0.5% to 0.7% higher.




Indexes opened higher but gave back gains starting around 11 a.m. ET. After a two-hour retreat, indexes resumed their advance and climbed almost into the close.


The Nasdaq composite added 0.7%. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), its second largest Nasdaq component, fell after an earnings report. The parent company of Google late Monday [beat fourth-quarter revenue and earnings expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alphabet-earnings-google-stock-q4-2018/), but lower operating margins appeared to disappoint investors.


But Alphabet started rebounding at 11:30 a.m. ET and closed with an increase of 0.9%. The stock is forming a cup-type base.

Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 up less than 0.2%. Volume rose on the NYSE and the Nasdaq. Advancing stocks led decliners by a 5-3 ratio on the NYSE and by 5-to-4 on the Nasdaq.


Techs in general were robust. The new S&P Communications Services sector (which includes Alphabet), the consumer discretionary and retail sectors were strongest.


Indexes closed near session highs. That's a bullish trend seen on daily and weekly charts of the major indexes. Such behavior indicates that investors may be reluctant to buy, but are persuaded by the end of the session. It is the mirror opposite of what indexes did for most of their December swoon.


The advance-decline line of the NYSE is at the highest since September, and it is leading the Dow and S&P 500 advances. The Nasdaq's A/D line is about where it was in November and trending higher. In short, investors are growing hungrier for shares.


With each step forward, the market is closer to a pullback, or at least a pause. That's a risk to keep in mind as indexes approach key tests.


The S&P 500 is less than 1% from the 200-day average, where resistance is possible. The Nasdaq is about 1% away from that line.


But so far indexes have been clearing key levels with little difficulty. Dow was the first to come up against the 200-day average, and it is now 2% above it. It also had little trouble rising past 25,000, a psychological level.


The S&P 500 is above the significant 2700 level. The Nasdaq does face possible resistance around 7485. Any of those could end up a rest stop for the market.


Certainly, there's no institutional selling to worry about. Only one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is still on the ledger, after the Nasdaq climbed sufficiently Tuesday to render the Jan. 16 stalling day as irrelevant.


Indexes in late January paused for not even two weeks and resumed climbing. Another pause wouldn't be surprising, but it's hard to tell when it could happen while the market rises nearly unimpeded.


The risk of the Fed overcorrecting with its tightening policy has diminished, which leaves political issues as the main risk or reward factor. Trade talks with China loom as the biggest hurdle. Brexit is another issue. Earnings also are a big factor.


Breakouts continue to feed the current market uptrend, many of those helped by strong earnings. **Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) broke out solidly. But **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) faded badly after topping the 56.52 buy point of a [cup with handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Both are in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


The IBD 50 added 0.8%, thanks to Horizon and a batch of software and internet stocks that had most of the largest gain on the list.

It's often said that a weak stock market eventually brings everything down with it, and that was the case Friday as major stock indexes sold off hard again.




An earnings sell-off for **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and sharp drop for **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) dragged on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while broad weakness in health care stocks like **HCA Holdings** ([HCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA)), **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), **Universal Health Services** ([UHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UHS)) and **DaVita** ([DVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVA)) weighed on the S&P 500.


After getting turned away at its 200-day moving average Thursday, the S&P 500 plunged 2.8%, taking out Monday's low. The index is still holding above the March 16 [follow-through day's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) low, but the weak action was enough to change IBD's market outlook to a market correction.

Just when it looked like dividend-paying, real estate investment trusts would be a safe haven during the market turmoil, several breakouts are already facing headwinds, including **Life Storage** ([LSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSI)) and **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)). Both dipped below buy points.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrials slumped below its 50-day moving average and the 34,000 level, falling 2.8%. The Nasdaq composite tumbled below the 13,000 level, falling nearly 2.6%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq. Preliminary data showed volume rose slightly on the NYSE.


Declining stocks trounced advancers on the NYSE by about 7-to-1. Nasdaq decliners had the upper hand over advancers by about 3-to-1.


There was some fear in the stock market Friday. The Cboe Volatility Index surged above its 50-day moving average, rising more than 20%. But that was offset by a relatively tame [put/call volume ratio of 0.87](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall). It's important to pay attention to fear indicators because excessive fear and dire headlines have been seen at many market bottoms in the past.


But we're not in an excessively fearful market yet.


Materials Stocks Lag
--------------------


The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) was the worst performing S&P 500 sector, down more than 3%. Top-weighted stocks in the ETF like **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) and **Newmont** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) ended with weekly losses of 15% and 12%, respectively, while **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) lost 2.6% after a bad reversal.

Freeport-McMoRan dived below its 50-day moving average Thursday and fell sharply again Friday. Newmont gapped below its 50-day line Friday after reporting lackluster Q1 results. Nucor showed stalling action Thursday by rising in heavy volume but closing in the bottom half of the day's price range.


Consumer stock **Kimberly-Clark** ([KMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMB)) was a rare bright spot. It gapped up above its 200-day moving average, rising 8%, after reporting earnings and giving a strong outlook.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) and **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) also bucked the trend. Both stocks are holding support at their 50-day lines as they form new bases.



Keeping a watchlist of stocks holding up well in a down market is a good way to be prepared for the next stock market uptrend. But with the stock market in a correction, taking profits and raising cash is the best course of action for now.

  Stock Market Gains As It Heads Into Key Fed Meeting; Tesla Helps This Group

The stock market ended a good week on a high Friday, even though gains faded into the close. Despite next week's Federal Reserve meeting, there are plenty of reasons for enthusiasm.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fared best once again as it rose 1%. It popped more than 4% for the week and reclaimed its 200-day moving average in the process. The bulls will win big if it can hold above this key level.


The S&P 500 closed 0.3% higher, giving up some upside into the close. It ended the week with a 2.5% gain. The benchmark index is now pulling away from its 200-day moving average, an important and bullish move. But it did add a distribution day due to stalling action, a negative.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average endured a seesaw session, posting a tiny 0.1% gain. Its weekly gain of 1.8% was more encouraging, allowing it to retake the 50-day line. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) soared while **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) plunged on a glum quarterly report.


Small caps managed to squeeze out a gain, with the Russell 2000 up 0.4%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) disappointed, gaining just 0.2% after a late fade. It remains below declining moving averages even as it gets closer to 50-day resistance.


Bullish Indicators Flash, But Stock Market Awaits Fed
-----------------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite has gained nearly 10% since the Jan. 6 follow-through day, an exceptionally strong performance in such a short period.

Eric Krull, co-author of "The Lifecycle Trade" and a longtime IBD subscriber, noted on [Friday's IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/) that in "moneymaker" rallies after a follow-through day, the average gain is 5.5% over a similar time frame, and in "life changer" rallies the average gain is almost 8%.


Krull defines a "moneymaker" as a Nasdaq rally lasting a minimum 15 days and posting gains of 3% to 5%. A "life changer" adds 15%+ upside and lasts more than 15 days.


Given recent bullish action, IBD recommends increasing exposure to 60% to 80%. But be ready to move quickly as things can rapidly change on the stock market.


This is especially important to bear in mind with the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting taking place next week. While recent economic data has been encouraging, a surprise could rattle markets.

Tesla Stock Helps This Group Flourish
-------------------------------------


The S&P 500 stock market sectors ended the session mixed Friday, with consumer discretionary and real estate posting the best gains. The energy and health groups lagged.



As usual, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups offered a deeper insight for investors.


Education software plays, internet retailers and trucking transportation stocks were among the winners. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) helped the automaker industry group turn in the best performance of the day, as it soared 11%.


Toy stocks, media periodical plays, semiconductor equipment firms, auto part wholesalers and oil & gas refiners were among the worst performers.

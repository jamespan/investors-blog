Stock Indexes Post Big Gains, But One Thing Is Missing
=======================================================

The stock market on Friday delivered its best action since the Feb. 14 follow-through as the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 grabbed gains and then protected them.




 The Nasdaq rallied 1.8%, while the S&P added 1.6%. The Dow Jones industrials advanced 1.4%. The small cap Russell 2000 rose 1.25%.


Volume fell across the board, according to preliminary data. The declining volume dimmed part of the day's shine. But the S&P 500 and the Dow retook their 50-day lines, joining the Nasdaq, which reclaimed and held its 50-day a week and a half ago.


In some ways, Friday was a day that favored caution. Groups scoring the day's best gains included utilities and tobacco.

The FANG stocks and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were up without exception, pegging gains of 1% to 2.8%. Each moved in below-average volume.


The 30-component Dow Jones industrial average also showed confidence. Nine stocks moved up at least 2%. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) led with a 4.2% gain. All nine showed below-average volume.


Among the day's losers were two stocks that not too long ago were looking like buys.


Restaurant chain **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) broke out in November and advanced as much as 36%.


Wingstop's 10% intraday drop Friday to its 50-day line, where it found support, wasn't a disaster for those holding shares since November. The stock closed down 5% for the day, and a 28% profit from the November gap-up open is there for the taking.


Another stock that took a hard hit Friday was **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)). The midcap plunged nearly 16% in heavy volume.


In January, Universal Display was 55% above its 200-day line. On Friday, the stock knifed 8% below the 200-day.


There's a lesson in Wingstop and Universal Display: Don't be shy about taking at least partial profits at the 20% to 25% level.


Finding another stock that has the potential to rise 20% is often easier than getting a 20% riser to jump another 20%.


What kind of stocks should be held for possible greater gains? Only those that are clearly institutional quality.


One way to identify quality is to look at a fund's biggest positions.


Coming up: On Tuesday, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell will testify before a House panel. On Wednesday, the second take on Q4 GDP will be released before the open.

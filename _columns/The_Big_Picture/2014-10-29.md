Nasdaq Chalks Up Mild Distribution Day As Fed's QE3 Bond Buys End

The stock market saw limited selling Wednesday after the Federal Reserve concluded a two-day meeting by ending a massive two-year program of buying U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to pump up the economy.


The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3% in higher volume. Intraday, the decline was as steep as 1%. It was just the second down day in 10 sessions for the premier index.


The drop in higher volume, known as a distribution day, was the first for the Nasdaq since a nearly four-week correction bottomed out in the middle of this month.


A distribution day indicates highly motivated selling by fund managers, the true force behind big market shifts. Yet a market that's in a confirmed uptrend can continue to chug higher while picking up a distribution or two once in a while.


The S&P 500 also declined in heavier trade. But the 0.1% dip was too small to be considered evidence of big institutional selling.


The Russell 2000 fell 0.3% after leaping 2.9% on Tuesday for its best gain in 2014 so far. The small-cap S&P 600 gave back just 0.1%.


The U.S. central bank hinted that it is clearly in no rush to make any serious change to the cost of funding for the country's banks. Why? The Fed acknowledged that consumer spending and business investment are growing fine, but the housing recovery is still weak. Plus, inflation is still running below target.


It's been just a little more than a week since the market scored a strong follow-through on Oct. 21. Since then, top-quality growth stocks have done reasonably well.


In any fledgling rally, some growth engines are bound to sputter. The 13% flop by **AmTrust Financial** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)) and the sharp gap down by **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) are fresh examples.


How does an investor deal with such stock-specific volatility?


You can hold a stock that slides back to the proper buy point so long as you have real conviction in the stock. If you decide to sell, you can always buy shares back if the stock shows better action.


Every stock is bound to correct in price after a healthy run. Institutions take profits. So should individual investors. A great time to do so is when a stock rises 20% to 25% past a proper entry.


That's exactly what happened with Facebook, the fourth largest company on the Nasdaq.


Long before the social network announced Q3 results on Tuesday, the stock cleared a 66.57 buy point within a three-month cup with handle in dull volume on June 24. After a slow start, the stock gained traction. On Friday, Facebook closed at 80.67, up 21%.

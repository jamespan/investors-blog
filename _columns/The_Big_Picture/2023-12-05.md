The stock market continued to take a breather Tuesday even as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) helped lead a resistance among so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Attention now turns to a private sector jobs report due Wednesday that comes on the heels of cool data from the Labor Department.




The Nasdaq composite inched 0.3% higher Tuesday but remains down 0.5% for the week so far. The tech-heavy index is hovering in a trading range and currently sits between its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and the 10-day line.


The S&P 500 ended a seesaw session with slender loss of 0.1%. The benchmark index also looks to be taking a pause after last month's breathtaking lift and sits about 4% above the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes, though its dip of 0.2% was still paper-thin. **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) was among the better performers on the much-watched index while **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) lagged.


Decliners outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by around 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was middling on both stock market exchanges.


Bears took a chunk out of small caps, which have outperformed lately. Nevertheless, the Russell 2000 remains above the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) despite a 1.4% dip, and was only modestly lower for the week. Growth stocks closed near session highs but the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) still fell 0.3%.


ADP Jobs Report Due After Cool Data
-----------------------------------


Signs of a cooler job market are key for future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. And there were further signs of a slowdown in the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, known as the JOLTS report, released by the Labor Department Tuesday.


Openings came in at 8.73 million in October, a decline of 617,000. This was well shy of the median forecast for 9.4 million openings and the lowest reading since March 2021.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP120523.jpg)There is further employment data on deck for the stock market Wednesday. This time it is the ADP employment report, which acts as a second helping in the week's jobs data feast. Economists predict that employers added 128,000 workers in November compared with 113,000 in October.


But the main course comes Friday, when the Labor Department releases the nonfarm payrolls figures for November. Analysts expect an increase of 190,000, which would be a lift from October's rise of 150,000. Investors will be especially keen to get their just desserts here.


Treasury yields continued to give up ground. The 10-year yield sank 12 basis points to 4.17% while the two-year yield fell eight basis points to 4.58%. The yield curve remains inverted.


At the moment the market thinks there is a 64% chance of a rate cut in March, which rises to a 90% chance of a rate cut in May, according to [the CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html).

Apple Boosts Magnificent Seven Amid Stock Market Pause
------------------------------------------------------


A majority of the [S&P 500 sectors closed lower Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Technology and consumer discretionary outperformed while energy and materials suffered the biggest drops.


The relative performance of the 197 IBD industry groups gave a deeper insight into the performance of the [stock market today.](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) Tire stocks, drugstores, electronics wholesalers and database software plays all outperformed.Â Conversely, integrated telecom services stocks, cable and satellite plays, auto retailers and oil-and-gas realty trusts all had tough sessions.



A fightback by megacap tech stocks was a key feature of the day's action. Apple and Nvidia led the Magnificent Seven higher. Apple turned in a gain of 2.1%, as its valuation moved back above the magic $3 trillion mark in the process. It got a boost after iPhone assembler Foxconn raised its sales outlook.


Nvidia did even better on the stock market, rising 2.3%. [The Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) looks to be finding support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).

**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) enjoyed a 0.9% lift but **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) lagged as it skidded 0.5%.

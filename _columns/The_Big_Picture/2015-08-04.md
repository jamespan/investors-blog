Stocks eased Tuesday, another day in which finding direction proved to be an elusive task. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell 0.2% as both held within small price ranges. 

  

Volume rose across the board, which gave the S&P another distribution day. (The Nasdaq's loss was too small to be considered heavy institutional selling.)

  

The day's results widened the gap in distribution between the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The S&P's seven days of higher-volume declines are a concern. But the Nasdaq is at a normal level of just two distribution days.

  

The composite has been the better index this year, but the disparity in distribution days reflects the perplexing nature of the market.

  

The main indexes continue a pattern of short-term advances and declines â€” never enough to cause a correction or enough to climb more than a few weeks.

  

The up-and-down movements have made it tough for growth stocks to produce enough gains to cushion themselves against a sell-off.

  

There's been no shortage of breakouts, but staying power sometimes is elusive. **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) are examples of leading stocks that wiped away gains of more than 10% from breakouts and are now below the buy point. Both also illustrate the risk of a bad earnings report.

  

In some cases gains from breakouts are ridiculously brief, as was the case of **Columbia Sportswear** ([COLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COLM)). The stock soared as much 18% Friday after its profit report, but on Tuesday it had erased nearly the entire gain.

  

Part of the problem facing investors is that a mainstay of the bull market has been flagging.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) shares this week fell below their long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since the big 2012-13 correction. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is at lowest-possible E, and the up-down volume ratio is a pitiful 0.4. In short, institutional investors are shedding Apple shares.

  

Apple, a longtime Wall Street darling, has a huge influence on the market. At the end of June, nearly 4,900 mutual funds owned the stock, not to mention some 175 hedge funds, 2,600 advisors, about 176 banks and scores of other institutions. Apple single-handedly accounts for 7.2% of the Nasdaq's total weighting.

  

For every Apple iPhone, iPad or other product, there's a tail of suppliers whose fortunes also depend on the success of those gadgets. Much of that food chain has been struggling, too.

  

**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) are under duress, although not entirely due to their Apple links. (See related story on Page B12.)

  

The IBD 50 rose 0.1% Tuesday, thanks in part to post-earnings rallies by **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **AmTrust Financial** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)).

  

Those two have been winners lately, and a reason why investors should not be entirely out of the market. Rather, it's a time to be guarded, knowing that even when breakouts don't have any obvious problems, what happens afterward matters just as much.

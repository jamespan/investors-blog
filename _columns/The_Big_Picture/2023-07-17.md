  Stock Market Rally Keeps Its Mojo But Still Faces These Risks; Will This Sector Show Cracks?

Gains by key indexes on Monday proved fairly broad and favorable to growth areas of the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?). And following last week's bullish advance, the action gave a signal that institutional investors are not changing their intentions to quickly gain more exposure.




However, looking at the sell-offs in a few companies, IBD readers may want to remain vigilant for signs of that inevitable pullback. And the next three to four weeks' worth of earnings news may provide that catalyst for profit-taking.


Stock Market Today: Don't Defy The Nasdaq
-----------------------------------------


On Monday, the Nasdaq joined small caps in leading the advance. A 0.9% rise by the tech-centered Nasdaq composite easily wiped away Friday's tiny loss of less than 0.2%. At 14,244, the Nasdaq also closed above 14,000 for the third straight session.


You'd have to go all the way back to April 2022 to see that feat previously accomplished. The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rolled ahead almost 1%. At 15,713, it's now up an eye-popping 43.6% since Jan. 1 and up 3.5% for the current third quarter.


The small-cap Russell 2000, down 1% on Friday, gained a bit more than 1% on Monday and recouped that day's loss. That performance outdid a 0.4% rise for the S&P 500 and a 0.2% gain by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.



Plus, equal-weighted indexes did well on Monday. As noted frequently on the [daily IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/), the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) deserves regular monitoring too. QQEW on Monday coasted 1.2% higher in heavy turnover.


Volume fell on both exchanges vs. Friday's session. During the summer, it's not at all surprising if you see turnover shrink. But this week also ushers in the true start of the quarterly results. Volume should rise especially in those companies that report earnings.


Breadth remained bullish in the stock market.


Early data showed that advancers on the Nasdaq topped decliners by more than 900 stocks. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by a slimmer margin of 5-to-4.

Beyond The Stock Market: Weak Day For Metals, Energy
----------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP071723-1-217x300.jpg)Meanwhile, some commodities failed to keep up with the stock market's advance in the wake of news that China's economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the second quarter. A Chinese economic official was quoted as saying the country is on track to post 5% GDP growth for the year.


The world's No. 2 economy is typically known for its big appetite for industrial commodities. However, recent data has shown that China is actually experiencing a worrisome slowdown in both exports and imports, catching many stock market observers off-guard.


While copper futures slumped 2.3% on Monday to $3.84 a pound, crude oil futures on the light, sweet category dropped 1.7% to $74.05 a barrel.


Perhaps **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)), one of the largest producers of copper, could shed further light on the balance of supply and demand for the industrial metal. FCX shares, down 1.5% on Monday, is forming a long base. Freeport-McMoRan has yet to prove it's going to become a stock market leader in 2023.


You can see on either a daily or weekly chart how FCX continues to show a relative strength line that has marked lower highs and lower lows since January. You'd like to notice the opposite.



The Phoenix-based firm reports Q2 results on Thursday.


Industry Group Winners And Losers
---------------------------------


Among the 197 industries tracked each day by IBD, Monday's leaders included solar energy, up 6.8%; educational and media-related software, up 4.3%; as well as semiconductor equipment (3.4%), travel booking (2.8%), fabless semiconductors (2.6%), Southeast banks (2.3%), department store chains (2.3%), and oil and gas drilling (2.1%). Dozens more industry groups rallied 1.5% or more.

On the downside, a host of telecom groups sank 1.3% or higher amid [concerns of dealing with lead sheathing in telecom cables](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/telecom-stocks-lead-sheathing-issue-could-put-t-stock-vz-stock-in-doghouse/). Telecom giant **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) tanked 7.5% in the heaviest volume for a single session so far this year. VZ hit fresh 12-year lows. Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) has plunged from 76 a year ago to 11 on a scale of 1 to 99.


Dairy product stocks, a defensive area in the stock market, lost 1.7%. The group tied with foreign telecom services for the day's worst price-weighted decline.

What To Watch As Additional Downside Risks
------------------------------------------


Beyond what's happening in China, a potential further correction in commodities and a negative reaction to upcoming earnings news, what else should IBD readers monitor closely?


One excellent way to keep a pulse on the stock market each day: [IBD's Stocks On The Move table](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx).


In real time, an IBD reader cannot only actually see which stocks are seeing significant moves, up and down, in heavier than usual turnover. The reader also can get hints that the big fund managers are taking gains in certain sectors or industry groups and moving into new areas.



On Monday, a couple of innovative names in the general consumer spending category — thermos and outdoor lifestyle brand **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) and luxury home furnishings chain **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) — registered significant price declines in above-average turnover.


Yeti, which jumped more than 11% last week in higher weekly turnover, fell 6.5% on Monday. Volume more than doubled vs. its 50-day average and hit the highest level in three weeks. That drop sent shares further away from a potential breakout past a 45.32 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). YETI has been building an elongated [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) base since February.


RH Stock Breakout Still Intact
------------------------------



RH, a midcap growth stock, has successfully cleared a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-without-handle-base-can-runneth-over-with-rich-stock-chart-gains/) that's five months long and features a 351.53 [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/). It dropped 3.2% to 364.99 in rapid trading on Monday. Ideally, you want to see stocks that break out in the current stock market give back very little of their advances in the days and weeks right after surpassing key entries.


Surely, bond investors believe the Federal Reserve is near the end of its latest monetary tightening cycle. But it's not clear yet what 10 rate hikes since March last year — taking short-term rates from a 0%-0.25% target range to 5%-5.25% — will do to the future of spending by U.S. consumers.


In other financial markets, bitcoin dropped nearly 1.2% to $29,931 on Monday. Investors bid up long-dated U.S. Treasuries, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond down 2 basis points to 3.79%.

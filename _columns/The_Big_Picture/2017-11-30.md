Blue chips led the indexes on a strong day Thursday, as several bullish elements converged.




 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average stormed 1.4% higher, while the S&P 500 spurted 0.8%. The Nasdaq popped 0.7% and the small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.1%.


Volume edged higher from Wednesday's pace on the Nasdaq, and was sharply higher on the NYSE.


The S&P 500, Dow and Russell 2000 each marked a new high.


The best news of the day was only indirectly financial. The news involved two items, tax-cut legislation and OPEC's stance on production, both of which suggested a lessening of uncertainty.


Tax-Cut Vote Near
-----------------


Conviction grew that the U.S. Senate would pass its tax-cut bill. A vote was likely either late Thursday or early Friday. The House has already passed its version. The two bills would have to be reconciled before being sent for President Trump's signature.


The stock market is hoping the cuts in corporate taxes to 20% will shift money into something more productive than the tax-dodging moves that current rates encourage. In that sense, the corporate tax cuts could be helpful to the economy. Some major bank stocks rose on expectations of a boost to after-tax profits and that [broader economic strength will boost interest rates](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/mccain-gives-gop-tax-cut-plan-a-green-light-sp-500-rolls/).


OPEC To Keep Curbing Output
---------------------------


Meanwhile, at a meeting in Vienna, OPEC, Russia and others agreed to extend oil output cuts to the end of 2018. The production cuts are expected to support prices. Higher prices would help U.S. oil explorers and producers. Oil prices Thursday edged up 12 cents to $57.42 a barrel.


Two blue-chip oil stocks in the Dow appeared to benefit from the news.


**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) popped 1.3%. The stock climbed 1.5% in strong volume. Chevron closed above its 50-day line. The integrated oil stock  is closing in on a 120.99 buy point in a flat pattern.


Fellow Dow component **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) rose 1.2% in twice its usual volume. Exxon also retook its 50-day line.


The Dow is up 23% so far this year. Three stocks in particular have boosted its performance: **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), up 77%; **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), up 51%; and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), up 48%.


Dow Stocks In Buy Zones
-----------------------


Five Dow stocks that are either in buy zones or approaching buy points include Chevron, **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) (which appears to be forming a base), and **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)).


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's leaders included oil stocks, retail, airlines and biotechs. The biggest losers included newspapers, department stores and some regional banks.


Economic News
-------------


Data were mostly better than expected Thursday but only narrowly so. First-time jobless claims checked in at 238,000, just under the consensus view for 240,000. Personal income rose 0.4% in October, above views for 0.3%. Consumer spending increased 0.3%, matching the consensus estimate.


The Chicago purchasing managers gauge rolled in at 63.9 for November, topping the consensus for 63.5. Readings above 50 point to economic growth.


Friday's data releases will include motor vehicle sales for November, two manufacturing indexes for November and construction spending for October.

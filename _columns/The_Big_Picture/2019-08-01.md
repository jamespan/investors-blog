Trump's New Tariffs Energize Stock-Market Bears
================================================

The U.S. stock market reversed lower with a vengeance Thursday, as President Donald Trump announced plans to slap China with additional tariffs.




Blue chips (the Dow industrials) dived 1% after being up as much as 1.2%. The Nasdaq leaped almost 1.7% but ended down 0.8%. The large-cap S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. That marked a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq and for the S&P 500. Distribution involves a drop in a major index in rising volume — the footprint of institutional selling.


With distribution rising and the major indexes suddenly weakening, IBD's stock market outlook was downgraded from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure."

Be sure to sell any stock that falls more than 7% or 8% below your purchase price. Consider taking some profits, especially with holdings that are up more than 20% from their breakout points. Also, be more cautious with any new stock purchases.


Trump Shakes Stock Market
-------------------------


Bulls initially appeared to own the day, erasing the losses from the previous session. Trump, though, was busy doing some spadework for the bears. Trump posted entries on Twitter early in the afternoon.


The [president wrote](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tariffs-hit-dow-jones-china-trade-war-fed-rate-cut-outlook/) that China reneged on a deal three months ago, failed to buy agriculture products as promised and failed to halt the selling of highly addictive drug fentanyl. Trump added that a "small, additional" tariff of 10% would be implemented Sept. 1 on $300 billion in goods from China. He added that the U.S. looked forward to "continuing our positive dialogue."


For the stock market, any hope of progress on trade looks increasingly dim. Bulls are running out of excuses to make for the market.


At this point, the bears appear to be winning a long war of attrition.


Resistance Areas On Nasdaq Chart
--------------------------------


Take a look at the Nasdaq's stock chart. Resistance emerged in late August at 8133. In late April, the Nasdaq confirmed that area of resistance and then sank. In July, it seemed like the resistance was history, but Thursday the Nasdaq closed under the 8133 mark.


Over the past 11 months, the Nasdaq has essentially made no progress other than surviving a bear market drop of more than 20% from August to Christmas and an almost 11% pullback from early May to early June.


Granted, those corrections led to recoveries that were playable. The bulls, though, would like to see something more long lasting and less sensitive to news.


Strong Performers In Stock Market
---------------------------------


Despite Thursday ugliness, there were some stocks that didn't seem to realize that a stock-market war was underway.


Medical testing firm **NeoGenomics** ([NEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEO)) [stabbed 6% higher](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/neogenomics-stock-breaks-out-cancer-testing-outlet-bullish-signals/) in strong volume. The stock cleared a 24.94 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). NeoGenomics' [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/apple-trillion-value-stocks/) made a new high. The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance.


Business software provider **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)) knifed 12% higher in busy trade. The midcap stock struck a 52-week high after the company's earnings report.


Gold Miner And Gold ETF
-----------------------


Gold miner **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) jumped 8% in strong volume, completing a successful test of its 50-day line.



SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) had a wild day. The exchange-traded fund dropped as much as 0.7% and rose as much as 2.4% as the tariff news spurred interest in gold. The ETF closed four pennies off its high for the day.


Economic News
-------------


First-time jobless claims came in at 215,000 vs. the Street's consensus estimate of 241,000.


Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported planned job cuts in July fell to 38,845, the lowest level in 11 months.


The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Situation report for July will be released before the stock market's open. Analysts expect nonfarm payrolls reached 151,000 in July, down from June's 224,000.

The stock market bounced Monday but still faced an array of risks from surging yields, labor strikes, the economy, a political standoff and seasonal factors.




After posting its worst week since March, the stock market rebounded a bit. The Nasdaq climbed nearly 0.5% and the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 rose 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1%.


Indexes reversed modestly higher and tested their August lows. The Nasdaq's low Monday was nearly identical to the Aug. 18 low of 13,161.76. The S&P 500, which undercut its August low last week, closed Monday barely above that level.


The Dow found support at its 200-day moving average.


That has the making of a possible market bottom, but the stock market still has a lot to prove.


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq. Decliners edged advancers on both exchanges.


Stock Market And Yields
-----------------------


Last week, the Nasdaq lost 3.6% and the S&P 500 2.9% — their worst weeks since March.


It's no coincidence that the stock market sold off last week as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield broke out above the 4.4% level. The Fed's higher-for-longer forecasts sent investors fleeing from bonds and stocks.

While Monday's moderate reversals at prior support levels give the stock market something to work with, there's no clear sign of a new rally attempt.


Market internals are weak.


Indicators such as the 10-day moving average of new highs to new lows and the advance-decline lines of the NYSE and Nasdaq remain bearish.


The number of [52-week lows](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-sep-22-2023/) is the highest since early May and far outpaces new highs. Nasdaq new lows have hit triple digits for six sessions in a row. (IBD counts only stocks with EPS Ratings of 60 or higher.)


In the S&P 500, 42 stocks hit 52-week lows Monday, the second most this year since March 13.


The pool of leading stocks holding up keeps shrinking. The IBD 50 index underperformed with a 0.1% gain Monday.


Institutional investors certainly are in no mood to buy. In less than one month, the exposure index of the National Association of Active Investment Managers fell 66% from a July 26 peak. The index has bounced moderately in the past few weeks, however.


Stock Market Could Be Volatile Friday
-------------------------------------


Friday is shaping up to be a volatile day for the stock market, in what insurer Nationwide's Chief of Investment Research Mark Hackett called "Fireworks Friday."


"Investors should brace for a week that could redefine market sentiment and strategy for the quarter ahead," Hackett said.


The Fed's most important inflation gauges come out early Friday with the August Personal Consumption Expenditures index and PCE price index. And the August personal income and personal spending reports should tell investors something about the health of the U.S. consumer.


On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will host a town hall with educators in Washington, D.C., that will include a Q&A session.


A government shutdown could start over the weekend. Federal spending authorizations expire Saturday. If Congress doesn't reach an agreement by midnight Friday, government services will shut down the next day.


On Monday, House leaders were still trying to convince Republican holdouts to support spending bills and a short-term funding measure to keep the federal government running. But so far, there's no sign of a breakthrough.


Seasonal, Labor Risks For Stocks
--------------------------------


Studios and the screenwriters' union [reached a tentative agreement](https://www.investors.com/news/writers-strike-nears-conclusion-on-new-agreement-streaming-studio-stocks-rise/) to end a 146-day strike. It includes several key victories for writers. Studio and streaming stocks were mixed. A strike by the Screen Actors Guild continued, however.


The United Auto Workers on Friday expanded a strike against Detroit automakers. The labor action threatens a broad section of the U.S. economy.


Perhaps the woes of September shouldn't come as a surprise. Historically, September is the worst month for stock market performance. The S&P 500 averages a loss of 0.5% and the Nasdaq loses 0.7% on average, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. It's even worse in preelection years like this one, especially for small caps. The Russell 2000 historically loses 1.3% in preelection years.


Investors might want to quote a popular song by Green Day: Wake me up when September ends.

Stock Market Bounces Sharply As Oil Falls Below $100, Yields Drop At Covid-Crisis Pace
=======================================================================================

Just as the stock market was teetering, it showed it still has some fight in it after shaking off an early sell-off.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 opened with losses of roughly 2% but battled back to erase most of the damage or even finish higher.


The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and closed at session highs, despite a rout in the energy sector and some cyclicals.


Technology stocks, which tend to be more sensitive to interest rates, took advantage of a slide in Treasury yields. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite reversed higher to close up 1.7%. The composite made an impressive 3.8% swing from low to high.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP070522-222x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed well off the day's lows, down 0.4%. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) lost 2.6% and is close to touching its 200-day moving average. Consumer and tech stocks such as **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) performed best in the Dow.


Volume rose from Friday's preholiday trading. Advancing stocks led decliners by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq, but losers led 8-to-7 on the NYSE.


Nasdaq Tests Key Level
----------------------


The Nasdaq is making a stand around the 11,000 level but now faces a test of resistance at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Since April, the index hasn't been able to hold above that level for more than nine days.


The S&P 500 made a positive reversal for a second straight session, as did the Dow.


Investors by now should realize that it's impossible to discern market direction from one or two days of action. So while the last two sessions offer reason for stock market optimism, uncertainly over interest rates, inflation, geopolitics and other factors should keep traders on the defensive.


Financial markets are signaling worries about the economy, a risk that looms large over the stock market.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 9 basis points to 2.80 Tuesday, and has fallen nearly 40 basis points in four sessions. Dow Jones Market Data says it's the steepest four-day yield decline since March 2020, when the Covid crisis hit financial markets hardest.


The fact that yields are falling even as the Fed remains steadfast in rising interest rates suggests the bond market fears an economic slowdown.


Economic Slowdown In Stock Market's Eye
---------------------------------------


Some economic reports have shown slowing in economic growth, and oil traders are cutting demand forecasts. The price of U.S. crude oil fell in Nymex trading by 8.2% to $99.50 a barrel — the first close below $100 since May 10.



On Tuesday, the stock market also appeared to cheer falling Treasury yields. That's the conundrum for the stock market: Costs of fuel and borrowing are falling, but that's because the economy could have a bigger problem on its hands. Such a mixed outlook makes it hard to trade stocks.


The current market has a habit of mocking bullish signals. The most recent [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), on June 24, almost immediately came under attack from stock market bears. A similar pattern has occurred multiple times in this year's bear market.


IBD's [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) is "uptrend under pressure." That tells investors to reserve stock buys only for exceptional cases and keep market exposure limited.


Despite the bullish index reversals, only four of the 11 S&P sector indexes closed higher. Communications services and consumer discretionary rose more than 2%. But cyclicals such as industrials and materials fell more than 1%.


Utilities lost 3.4%, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) tumbled 4%. The ETF is barely above its 200-day moving average.


Highly rated oil stocks such as **Earthstone Energy** ([ESTE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESTE)), **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) and **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) fell under their 200-day lines.


The IBD 50 underperformed with a 0.4% loss as some cyclicals underperformed. **Atmos Energy** ([ATO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATO)), **Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers** ([RBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBA)), **Amaren** ([AEE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEE)) and **Permian Basin Royalty Trust** ([PBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBT)) slid 4% to 11%.

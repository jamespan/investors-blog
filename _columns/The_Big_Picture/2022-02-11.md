  Stocks Today Tank Broadly; How Far Could Indexes Fall In An Attack On Ukraine?

Nearly 24 years ago, events in Russia pounded stock markets worldwide. After the government defaulted on its bonds and let the ruble slide, Reuters nicknamed the sell-off the "Russian Bear." Now, the oil and gas-rich country threatens to smack a nascent rally in stocks today with the potential invasion of its neighbor Ukraine.




The Nasdaq composite paced broad selling, falling 2.8%. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF slid 3.2%. That marked its eighth single-session decline of 2% or more in 2022.


Other key indexes fell less, but their action provided cold comfort; the S&P 500 lopped off 1.9%, the Dow Jones industrials 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 1%.


Stocks Today: Indexes On The Back Foot Again
--------------------------------------------



Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), off 2.4%, remains 29% off its peak and miles below its slumping 50-day moving average. On the Cboe, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond sank 7 basis points to 1.95%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP021122_2-289x300.jpg)The [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) since late January remains tame. But more importantly, traders who gained market exposure after a [follow-through day on Jan. 31](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-positive-move-as-nasdaq-again-rallies-more-than-3-percent/) are now under water. You can call that an expectation breaker.


Add the additional fact that only a sliver of industries are furnishing stocks producing stout breakouts, and it justifies a downgrade of the current outlook to "uptrend under pressure."


This new change means the confirmed uptrend that began on Jan. 31 lasted all of nine trading days.


Before that, here are the other changes in the IBD outlook since December:


* Dec. 3, 2021: Market in correction
* Dec. 15: Follow through: market in confirmed uptrend
* Dec. 17: Uptrend under pressure amid quadruple witching day
* Dec. 23: Uptrend resumes after S&P 500 hits new closing high
* Jan. 5, 2022: Uptrend under pressure as distribution returns to the market
* Jan. 18, 2022: Market in correction; four distribution days on the S&P 500
* Jan. 31: Follow-through on Nasdaq, S&P 500; market in confirmed uptrend


As you can see, market conditions have been changing violently for two straight months plus.


Even before Friday's action, veteran IBD readers likely kept a lot of their powder dry. The market still has a scarcity of outstanding breakouts from stocks with true [CAN SLIM fundamentals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/).


Rather, commodity stocks today in the oil and gas, copper and agricultural fields are mavericks, bucking the general trend.


As market breadth stays thin, investors going long right now are waging a truly uphill battle. On Friday, losing stocks trumped winners by nearly a 3-1 margin on the NYSE, 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq. Remember, too, that in wobbly uptrends, early holders can shoot down breakouts by selling into the strength that catapults good stocks into new highs.



**Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)), fresh from reporting great Q4 results, is the latest example. Shares went from an early 6.6% gain to a 2.7% loss. Volume tripled the stock's 50-day average to the highest level this year so far.


Russia's Threat And Fear
------------------------


The U.S. stock market has survived World War I and II, and even showed significant moves up during the Vietnam War and Persian Gulf War years. But these events can still take Wall Street by surprise.


The Cuban missile crisis took place in October 1962. Back then, the S&P 500 was already slumping. Then it fell 8% over a seven-day stretch, bottoming out at 52.55 on Oct. 24. Three months later, however, the 500 had rallied 25% off that low.



On Friday, the Cboe S&P 500 Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, jumped 17.5% to 28.1. That marked the highest level in nearly three weeks. But that still pales vs. a 38.94 reading recorded on Jan. 24, which marked the S&P 500's low so far in 2022.

The stock market moved higher Thursday, but it was small caps that stood out the most amid quiet moves. Meanwhile, **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) was a shooting star as it exploded on earnings and some other breakouts flourished.




The Nasdaq composite spent most of the session in positive territory before turning in a final gain of 0.2%. It is now up more than 1% so far this week and remains bullishly clear of short-term and major [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/).


The S&P 500 made another all-time high as it edged up 0.1% but failed to close above the 5000 level despite briefly clearing that milestone. Bulls will be keen to see the benchmark index secure 5000 Friday. The index is now up nearly 5% so far this year.


Advancers held the edge over decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, while volume was mixed.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average kept pace with the other major indexes on the stock market today thanks to a 0.1% rise. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) led the much-watched index as the entertainment stock soared 11.5% on a well-received quarterly report.


Small caps gave the bears a black eye, with the Russell 2000 popping 1.5%, allowing it to bullishly pull clear of the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tool-50-day-moving-average/). Growth stocks also outperformed, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) vaulting 1.6%.


Jobless Claims, Inventory Data Rolls In
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP020824-238x300.jpg)It has been a light week for economic data. However, U.S. Bureau of the Census data showed Thursday that wholesale inventories in the U.S. had risen 0.4% in December. The median forecast from economists was for a 0.3% rise. Companies tend to increase their inventories when sales are rising.


The inventory-to-sales ratio came in at 1.34 months compared with 1.40 a year ago. This metric reflects how long it takes a company to sell all its goods.


Meanwhile, applications for unemployment benefits fell by 9,000 to 218,000 for the week ended Feb. 3, according to the Labor Department. The job market continues to look remarkably strong.


Arm Stock Soars, Helps This Industry Group
------------------------------------------


Sectors on the [S&P 500 closed mixed Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Energy and real estate fared best, while financials and utilities lagged.

Cable and satellite TV stocks, clothing makers and database software companies all outperformed. Fabless chip plays also had a good day, boosted by a remarkable 47.9% gain for [Leaderboard name](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) Arm Holdings. The IPO stock closed almost 61% above its 50-day moving average due to the explosive move, despite finishing well off session highs.


The British chip designer was boosted not just by good earnings and guidance, but by management highlighting the fact that the artificial intelligence boom has lifted demand.


In contrast, fiber-optic plays, toolmakers, wholesale drug suppliers and auto parts retailers all struggled. Tobacco stocks also coughed up painful declines.


Stock Market Today: Multiple Stocks Clear Entries
-------------------------------------------------


One concern for investors has been the fact that many leading stocks are extended above buy points. There was a plethora of buying opportunities this week, however.


Enterprise software firm **Braze** ([BRZE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRZE)) tested a 58.67 buy point, though it closed just below the entry. The stock has lackluster earnings but is in the top 5% in terms of price performance over the past 12 months.



It was left for dust by **Advanced Drainage Systems** ([WMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMS)). The stock gapped out of a first-stage flat base. The relative strength line also hit fresh heights as shares popped 14.4% in high volume following a positive earnings report.


**New Oriental Educational** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) also gapped above a base. The Chinese education stock has been making good progress since a late-July breakout. Its latest consolidation is of the third-stage variety, so its advance is not altogether fresh, but the stock remains well off all-time highs.


Other notable breakouts this week include **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), **Assurant** ([AIZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIZ)), **JFrog** ([FROG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FROG)), **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) and **Stellantis** ([STLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLA)).

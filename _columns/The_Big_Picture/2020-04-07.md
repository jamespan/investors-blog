title: Stocks Let Big Early Gains Wither; What The Nasdaq, S&P 500 Should Avoid Right Now

Stocks wasted a golden opportunity to post a second straight session of strong gains Tuesday. While losses turned out modest, the way they surrendered early gains would clearly disappoint virtually any [CAN SLIM investor](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-execute-a-solid-trading-plan-letter-grade-system/).




The number of new coronavirus cases in certain countries, such as Italy and the U.S., appears to have cooled off in the past few days. Congress is working on a fourth rescue plan to help small businesses. Plus, some money flowed out of long-dated bonds. The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond's yield jumped for a second straight session, and in a big way, up 8 basis points to 0.75%, the highest in April so far.


But after both the S&P 500 (on Thursday) last week and the Nasdaq composite (on Monday) posted their own [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/), you'd like to see bullish action continue. That is, stocks should show a touch of weak action at the beginning and buying muscle at the end of the session.


Instead, the opposite happened on Tuesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP040720-236x300.jpg)The Nasdaq opened with a positive gap and rose almost 3% in the opening minutes. But the tech-centered index failed to hold those gains; from around 12:30 p.m. in New York, it slid in steady fashion and ended with a 0.3% loss.


The S&P 500 had an even wilder day. An early 3.5% surge melted into a loss of just under 0.2%. So its swing from high to low approached 4%.


Stocks Today Reveal Heavy Institutional Selling
-----------------------------------------------


Volume rose mildly on both major exchanges. Thus, the Nasdaq got tagged with the first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) of the current new rally since the [stock market's important session on Thursday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/). The S&P 500's loss did not meet the 0.2% (without rounding) minimum required for a clear distribution day.


The S&P SmallCap 600 held just a fraction of its big intraday gains, rising 0.4%. The IBD 50 sank nearly 1.1%.


Within the context of action over the past two days, the Nasdaq's reversal may not seem overly bad. The index rallied 7.3% on Monday, and its gains over an 11-session stretch had reached as much as 22.8% since hitting a calendar-year bottom on March 23.


Imagine the Nasdaq rising, on average, 2.1% each day for 11 straight trading days. You'd be inclined to accept at least one such negative reversal such as the one seen on Tuesday.


However, more sessions like this, and early into the advance, would not bode well for this nascent rally.


See The Market In This Light
----------------------------


Market corrections that begin with a [vertical violation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/) — a sharp break below the 50- or 200-day line — tend to damage stocks so hard and investors' psyches enough that the [market may see at least one follow-through fail](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). We saw that movie back in the fourth quarter of 2018. But at this point, it's too early to predict such is the case today.


One way to assess the quality of a follow-through, however, is seeing the market through the lens of leading stocks. And on Tuesday, the picture wasn't pretty.



Stocks ranging from **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) and **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) to **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) and **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) mirrored the equity indexes' unsavory action.


Vertex finally broke through upside resistance at 250, a nice round number. Will that price become a level of institutional support?


Dexcom's action wasn't terrible. It's still crafting a [handle on a new cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


At this point in the game, the market needs to see stocks with excellent fundamentals and [rising fund sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-new-stock-market-leaders/) succeed on their breakouts, not fail.


Keep in mind that while some highly rated leaders showed rebounds off their recent lows with trampoline-like force, they also risk forming bases that are either [too wide and loose](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/winning-stocks-show-tight-closing-prices/), [too narrow in time](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), or too [V-shaped](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/).



That looked to be the case with **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)).

Understanding how the stock has behaved in the past and [how the current base looks right now](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) also give important insights ahead of a decision to buy or take a pass.


A failed breakout does not mean a growth stock will automatically fail again at the next breakout attempt. Watch for the [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/) to emerge if a stock refuses to fall much. Indeed, the second or third breakout attempt may hit pay-dirt.


Creating A Watchlist: These Sectors Are Atop The Heap Now
---------------------------------------------------------


Looking at IBD's stock research tables, [the Chips sector](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-apr-07-2020/) has made an impressive climb to No. 2 among 33 tracked for intermediate- and long-term price-based performance.


Down 12.8% since Jan. 1, the sector contains at least 15 companies that boast a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) or higher. A few have popped onto the [watchlist of Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist). Some have carved a spot [within the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), including **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) on the semiconductor equipment side and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) in the chipmaking arena.


SEMI, representing 2,100 member companies in electronics design and manufacturing, notes in a late-March seminar held jointly with global management consultant McKinsey & Co. that most manufacturing workers in China outside Hubei province are expected to return to their jobs by the end of April. The proportion of factory employees returning to work in Hubei's cities except Wuhan could reach 70% by then.


"McKinsey is also 'seeing evidence of a rebound in demand led by China's online sales' as rising consumer confidence and a surge in the popularity of work-from-home policies spur strong spending on laptop computers," Didier Chenneveau, a McKinsey partner in the supply chain practice, was quoted as saying. However, business concerns are now shifting to parts shortages and logistics as many planes have been grounded. SEMI counts as much as 60% of air freight in the U.S. and Europe is carried in the cargo holds of passenger aircraft.

Volatility has cooled, at least in the index options market. The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), or the VIX, rose nearly 2% to end a three-day slide. The VIX finished Tuesday at 46.11, down 46% from its historic peak of 85.47 set less than three weeks ago.

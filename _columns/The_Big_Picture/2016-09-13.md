Just like Hillary Clinton, the market is still in need of a rest.


On a day in which the Democratic candidate for the most powerful position in the U.S. government decided to stay off the campaign trail until at least through Wednesday, stocks acted like they are trying to shake off an illness of their own.


With the exception of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), up on rosy news of strong initial orders for the iPhone 7 at telecom carriers Sprint ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) and **T-Mobile** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)), tech stocks of virtually all stripes joined the summary sell-off in the commodities space.


The S&P 500 led Tuesday's broad decline, down 1.5%. After weeks of tight action that had market pundits wondering when volatility would return, the large-cap benchmark has now posted three sessions in a row of 1%-plus moves. The Nasdaq fell less on Tuesday, down 1.1% after Apple, the market cap-weighted index's biggest component, jumped more than 2% to 107.95, not far from a potential breakout at 110.33.


Volume rose on both major exchanges, adding another distribution day to the count.


![MP091316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MP091316-175x300.jpg)With as many as eight distribution days, or sessions of serious institutional selling, now plaguing the S&P 500, that fact alone should give both investors and short-term traders reason to move with heightened caution.


Even before IBD switched the market's outlook to "uptrend under pressure" two times within the past month (once on Aug. 24, and again on Sept. 9), it's likely that readers following key sell rules would have had at least some cash in the portfolio to weather the market's sudden choppiness. How?


You may already know the golden sell rule (cut losses short, to a maximum of 7%-8%). But perhaps the "platinum rule" these days is to take at least some profits on the way up. That is, if your stock has risen 20% to 25%, sell some shares. If you think the stock will go up 30% or 40%, that's fine too. It shows you either bought it correctly and it's one of the most powerful plays in 2016, or you have patience and conviction.


Yet cash can be a highly valuable position when the market tips from confirmed uptrend into one that is under unusual selling pressure. And you are a lot closer to raising even more cash or going to zero exposure in equities for your trading account when the market continues to show even more declines.


The No. 1 killer of stock market rallies is a recession. That does not seem likely today. R.W. Baird noted to clients on Tuesday that the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond spiked after the U.S. Census Bureau reported that real household median incomes rose more than 5% in 2015, the first gain since 2007.


The U.S. dollar rallied sharply as well. This in turn hurt commodity stocks, which are priced in U.S. dollars. **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)), **Randgold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) and **Anglogold Ashanti** ([AU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AU)) have all failed to rebound after undercutting their 50-day moving averages.


Tuesday's market technicals made it clear that the market took another step toward shifting into a genuine correction, even if the major indexes haven't fallen that much from their 52-week peaks. On the NYSE, losing issues trounced winners by a nearly 8-to-1 margin as the NYSE composite slid 1.9%. Oil, banking and mining shares have a bigger impact on this index than on the Nasdaq. The new high list last week featured dozens of banking and finance stocks. Not anymore.


At 10,535, the NYSE composite is 6.4% below an all-time peak of 11,254 set in May of 2015. The index is also back to a price area where the index had trouble rising past from April to June. Will a prior resistance level become support?


One thing to watch carefully now: How many stocks in IBD's screens, from the **[Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/)** to the **[IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)** to **[Your Weekly Review](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/)**, are failing to find support at their respective 50-day and 10-week lines? If the 50-day line fails to provide support, expect price corrections to grow deeper and new bases to form. Some growth stocks, such as retail and consumer plays **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), are trying to find buying support at the longer-term 200-day moving average.


The 10-year Treasury bond yield jumped to as high as 1.752%, according to real-time data tracked by Tradeweb. That breached the 1.74% near-term peak seen on June 23. Higher interest rates could pinch rate-sensitive issues and companies that use a lot of debt. Home improvement stocks, ranging from **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) to new IPO **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) to cabinets maker **Fortune Brands** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)), have cooled off.

Stock Market Mixed As Nasdaq Edges To New High; Leaders Start To Emerge In This Sector
=======================================================================================

The stock market returned from the Labor Day holiday with little appetite for buying. Even the Nasdaq, which made a new high, was lackluster.




The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, though it held above the 4500 level. The Nasdaq composite rose a fraction. Despite a flagging performance, the Nasdaq managed a new high at 15,403.


Decliners led advancers on the Nasdaq by 8-to-5. In fact, the Nasdaq may not have closed higher without the help of a few of its largest stocks.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) which [set a Sept. 17 date to unveil its new iPhone model](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-rises-on-iphone-13-launch-event-date/), climbed 1.6% to a new high. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) [rose 2.7% to a new high](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-surges-ahead-of-busy-schedule-of-new-content-releases/). **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) added 1.6% and made a new closing high.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP090721_2-237x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% after manufacturer **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) slid 4.4% to a six-month low.


Russell 2000 Falls; Stock Market Breadth Weak
---------------------------------------------


The Russell 2000 lost 0.7%, easing after two weeks of productive gains. While the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed well off Tuesday's lows, the small-cap benchmark struggled most of the day around the session lows.


Declining stocks led advancers by 11-5 on the NYSE. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The Nasdaq's Aug. 17 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) was deleted because the index climbed more than 5% from that day's close.


That left the Nasdaq with only two distribution days. But the S&P 500 added a distribution day because NYSE volume was higher. An increase in NYSE volume was almost unavoidable, because trading dried up Friday ahead of the three-day weekend. Thus, Tuesday's distribution didn't seem like a typical day of institutional selling.


IBD 50 Cooling Off
------------------


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) reversed lower. But its 0.1% loss was forgivable following a run of 10 gains in 11 days. **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) rose more than 4% and **Avantor** ([AVTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVTR)) added 3.1%.


In [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), a couple of stocks sold off. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) fell 2.6%, practically wiping out Friday's entire gain. **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) sold off 6% and erased the entire 15.5% surge Friday on its earnings report.


Friday's employment report was disappointing, and with no new major markers on the road, the stock market found it hard to move much Tuesday. The Friday report said U.S. employers [added 235,000 jobs in August](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-miss-could-delay-fed-tapering-futures-volatile/), well short of expectations for more than 700,000.


The report clouded the outlook for the Federal Reserve's planned taper of asset purchases. The Fed had already signaled its intentions to start cutting back on bond purchases this year, and it was just a matter of what month.


A rebound in the energy sector that began Aug. 20 is still fading. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) fell 0.6% Tuesday. But some stocks in the sector are starting to look better.


Emerging Leaders In Energy Sector
---------------------------------



**Noble Energy** ([NE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NE)) shot out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) Monday with a breakout past a 26.10 buy point. The stock is extended from that entry. Last week, the offshore drilling contractor reported its Noble Globetrotter II drilling ship was damaged during hurricane Ida.


**Denbury Resources** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)), **Cimarex Energy** ([XEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XEC)), **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) and **Range Resources** ([RRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RRC)) are forming the right side of bases. **Antero Resources** ([AR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AR)) broke out of a double-bottom base last week and is extended from the 5% buy range. **Magnolia Oil & Gas** ([MGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGY)) tried to break out last week and remains near a 16.48 buy point.


While poor fundamentals dogged the industry, sales and earnings growth are now much better across the leading companies. The [homebuilding industry group also is asserting leadership](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-fades-this-industry-may-be-rotating-into-leadership/).


With its new high Tuesday, the Nasdaq looks a bit more extended than it did last week. Investors should come to expect a pullback when the composite starts to drift away from its measured advance. At least that's been the norm this year.


Can S&P 500 Extend Its Win Streak?
----------------------------------


The S&P 500 just logged a seventh consecutive monthly gain. That's another reason for investor caution. Yet longer term, stock market history still favors the bulls.


Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist with Truist Advisory Services said in a report that in past seven-month win streaks, stocks have moved higher six months later 13 out of 14 times. Also, whenever the market was up more than 15% through August (as is the case in 2021), stocks have averaged an additional 4% gain by year end.


"Moreover, new highs in the market are not an issue as long as they are supported by fundamentals," Lerner added. "And the biggest driver behind stock returns this year has been earnings, with a capital E. This is consistent with one of our key themes over the past year, that the earnings power of corporate America was underappreciated. That said, it would be perfectly normal to see at least one gut-check before year end ..."


Last week, other analysts also noted that [historical trends favor stock market bulls](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-sp500-stock-market-too-high-this-data-says-no/).

  Stock Market Ends Week Mixed After Jobs Report As Treasury Yields Jump

The stock market ended the week mixed following the July jobs report, as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hit record highs.




Early Friday, the [Labor Department said](https://www.wsj.com/articles/july-jobs-report-unemployment-rate-2021-11628196413?mod=hp_lead_pos1&mod=hp_lead_pos1) the U.S. economy added 943,000 jobs and the jobless rate fell to 5.4% in July, signs of the labor market strengthening. The surveys for the jobs report don't fully reflect the potential impact of the delta Covid-19 variant, because they were conducted in the middle of the month. It wasn't until later in July that many more governments and businesses started imposing masking and vaccine requirements. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 1.29%, its highest in more than three weeks.


The Nasdaq closed 0.4% lower, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.5%.


![MP080621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP080621-246x300.jpg)Leading growth stocks showed moderate losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 0.9% Friday. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) advanced 5.3%, solidifying a breakout past a 222.18 buy point in a cup base.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE compared with Thursday's numbers.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The Nasdaq snapped a four-day win streak Friday following Thursday's all-time high. The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 hit record highs. For the week, the Nasdaq climbed 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively.


The market trend remains in a confirmed uptrend. Leading growth stocks are mostly acting well, like **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), which triggered the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stock-trading-rules-the-eight-week-hold-rule-and-its-wrinkles/) the past week. But there are some recent losers. **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule from a 463.09 buy point last week.


Keep in mind that the market's [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remains at an elevated level. The S&P 500 has seven distribution days, while the Nasdaq's count rose to five following Friday's new distribution day.

Breakout Stocks: MercadoLibre, Tesla
------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/leaderboard-10-year/) stock **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) is trading just above a 1,755.05 alternate buy point following Thursday's nearly 14% surge. Shares dipped 1.7% Friday. Per Leaderboard analysis, the stock's first 5 minutes of trading notched a high of 1,755.05, and MercadoLibre is trading at a reasonable level above that price. A trend line within the base may also offer another early entry point.


The stock is also building the right side of a cup base, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Another possible entry looms at 2,020.10. And be on the lookout for a potential handle to offer a more risk-optimal buy point.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [MercadoLibre stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-mercadolibre-inc-meli.aspx) shows a weak 55 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) slid 2.2% Friday, snapping a seven-day win streak. The electric-vehicle giant recently found support at its 50- and 200-day moving averages, which is bullish for the stock's prospects.


Shares are just below a 700.10 aggressive buy point deep inside a correction. Meanwhile, a deep, large base continues to take shape.

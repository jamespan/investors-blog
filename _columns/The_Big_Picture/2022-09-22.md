Stock Market Correction Deepens As Dow Jones Tests 30,000 Level
================================================================

The stock market correction deepened Thursday as the major stock indexes hit more correction lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly gave up the 30,000 level before closing just above it .




Amid a stock market that continues to weaken, these four leaders — **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)), **Toro** ([TTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTC)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) — are holding up better than most.


Jobless Data, Treasury Yields, Costco Earnings
----------------------------------------------


The Labor Department's initial jobless claims rose to 213,000 vs. a revised 208,000 in the prior week. First-time unemployment claims have come down noticeably from the summer's 250,000 trend. A strong job market gives the Fed more room to raise rates to combat inflation.


The bond market reflected that. The 10-year Treasury yield surged to 3.71% Thursday, hitting its highest level since February 2011. Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices rebounded from two days of losses. Oil prices rose nearly 1%, placing West Texas Intermediate futures back above $83 a barrel.


**Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) reported [better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/costco-stock-costco-earnings-membership-price-hike/) and matched sales results late Thursday, Still, COST stock dropped more than 2% in extended trade. In early September, Costco shares triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a cup with handle's 552.81 buy point.

Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Tests 30,000 Level
------------------------------------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%, testing the 30,000 level, about where the index bounced in June and July. The S&P 500 closed 0.8% lower. The Nasdaq composite declined 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 lagged, sliding 2.3%. All four major stock indexes hit new lows since IBD's market outlook changed to "market in correction" on  Sept. 16.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP092222-300x298.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and also appeared to be higher on the NYSE.


Top growth stocks underperformed Thursday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slid 3.1%, hitting a new 52-week low. In fact, the ETF is now at the lowest since March 2020, nearing the lows of the Covid bear market. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), health stocks held up the best, as **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) gained 0.7%.


Stock Market Correction: What To Do Now
---------------------------------------


The stock market trend remains in correction mode amid this week's sharp losses. The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since June 30 and could soon be testing its June lows. So investors should be mostly, if not entirely, on the sidelines.


To prepare for a new stock market rally, investors should be waiting two things: a rally attempt, then a follow-through day.


In a market correction, the first day the index closes higher counts as Day 1 of its attempted rally. The action on Day 2 and Day 3 is irrelevant as long as the index doesn't undercut its latest low. If that low is undercut, the rally try is done and the market needs to try again. The Nasdaq hit more correction lows Thursday and didn't close in the upper half, so a new rally attempt will have to wait for another day.


On Day 4 and later, you are looking for the Nasdaq or S&P 500 to rise sharply in higher volume than the previous session. That's [a follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). It gives investors the green light to start buying leading stocks breaking out past correct [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It should put your portfolio and mindset in sync with the stock market action by gradually committing capital to leading stocks.


During a stock market correction, don't tune out. Instead, create watchlists to find emerging stock market leadership by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, the RS line angles upward. If a stock lags the broad market, the line will point lower.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch
-----------------------------



Amid the stock market volatility, four leaders are among the stocks to watch: Continental Resources, Neurocrine, Toro and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.


Oil explorer and producer Continental Resources is building a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a 72.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares are trying to stem their recent slide around their 50-day line. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) touched a recent high last week but remains a bit off its 52-week high.


[IBD 50 Stocks To Watch pick](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-biotech-leader-neurocrine-biosciences-eyes-new-buy-point/) and [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Neurocrine Biosciences is building a flat base that has a 109.36 buy point. The stock's RS line hit a new high Wednesday.


[IBD 50 stock](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) Toro is just 5% away from a [flat base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) 92.05 buy point. With an RS line at new highs ahead of a potential breakout, the stock is sharply outperforming the broader market.


Vertex Pharmaceuticals remains below its 50-day line as it forms a new flat base with a 306.05 buy point. The stock's resilience makes it a top idea to watch during the ongoing market weakness, as indicated by a RS line that is approaching new highs.

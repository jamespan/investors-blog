Stocks closed out March with small losses Friday, keeping with the recent trend.


The Nasdaq lost less than 0.1% Friday, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.2% and 0.3% respectively.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MPa033117.png)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE, adding a distribution day to the S&P 500.


For March, the Nasdaq posted a 1.5% gain, its fifth up-month in a row. The S&P 500 was just under flat for March, ending a four-month win streak. April has been an up-month for the Nasdaq in seven of the past 10 years.


In March, the sometimes sizable losses and gains in individual stocks were offsetting.


In other words, investors could've encountered wildly different results depending on where their money was placed.


Among stocks in IBD's screens at the beginning of March, savings and loan **BOFI Holding** ([BOFI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOFI)) dropped 15% for the month, and RV company **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) skidded 13%.


Banks had a down month, but overall the losses weren't as dramatic as those of BOFI. Losses in the 3% to 6% range were more typical.


The bullish camp in March had more stories to tell.

China-based internet company **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) gained 28% for the month. Another China-based stock, **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), advanced 23%. **Supernus Pharmaceuticals** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)) also rose 23%.


Cloud-based software provider **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) gained 18%. Construction products provider **GMS** ([GMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMS)) pushed forward 17%. Medical device maker **Glaukos** ([GKOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GKOS)) added 15%.

The biggest gainer was **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), which rose 35% in March, mostly because of a planned merger with **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)).


While an acquisition-driven price jump can't be predicted, an IBD-style investor could've captured the entire gain. The first valid entry came Feb. 13, when Mobileye cleared a cup- with-handle base in heavy volume.


The stock was 5% above the 45.03 entry the day before the acquisition news sent Mobileye sailing an additional 28% higher.


Earnings season will start to gain some steam in the coming week. Companies reporting include **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)).

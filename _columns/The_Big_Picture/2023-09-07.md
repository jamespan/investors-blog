The stock market finished mostly lower Thursday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite tumbled further below a key support level.




As the stock market uptrend struggles to gain traction, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) are setting up to move higher.


Jobless Claims, Earnings Reports
--------------------------------


Early Thursday, the Labor Department's first-time jobless claims dropped to 216,000. They were expected to rise to 238,000 vs. 228,000 in the previous week. The data indicated continued firmness in the labor market, which may encourage high interest rates for longer.


U.S. Treasury yields ticked lower, with the 10-year yield settling at 4.26% Thursday, just off its 52-week high.


On the earnings front Thursday, **American Eagle** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)), **C3.ai** ([AI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AI)), **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **Sprinklr** ([CXM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXM)) and **UiPath** ([PATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PATH)) were big movers.


AEO stock reversed lower 2.5%, while C3.ai dived more than 12% but bounced off the 200-day moving average. GameStop shares moved up nearly 0.8%, while CXM stock slashed gains to less than 0.3%. It remained above a 15.50 buy point. Finally, PATH stock surged 11.5% to approach a 19.03 double-bottom entry.


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% after erasing earlier losses, while the S&P 500 moved down 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%, extending a losing streak to four sessions. Even though the Nasdaq ended sharply off its lows, it closed below its critical [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It made a minor move below the line Thursday.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP090723-274x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. That took the [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count up to two on both indexes.


The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 1%.


In the Dow 30, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was the session's big loser. Apple stock sold off 2.9% after the [Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-bans-iphone-use-for-government-officials-at-work-635fe2f8) that China ordered officials at central government agencies not to use iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work.


On the upside, chip giant Intel is in buy range past a 37.19 flat-base entry, with a 3.2% advance Thursday.


Top growth stocks finished lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.4% Thursday, getting some support at the 200-day line.


In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **PDD Holdings** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) tumbled nearly 5%. Shares are back in buy range above a 92.79 buy point in a cup with handle, though they triggered the [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/amazon-stock-amzn-triggered-key-profit-taking-rule-before-flashing-sell-signals/) after erasing double-digit gains.


This week's volatile action underscores the importance of raising market exposure carefully and methodically after a follow-through day. And following Thursday's further decline below the 50-day lines in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, the stock market outlook was downgraded to "uptrend under pressure."


The [IBD current outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) still calls for a recommended stock market exposure of 20% to 40%, but that's only if your recent purchases are holding up. Right now, it makes sense to move back into defense until the overall environment improves.

Stock Market Leaders: Adobe, Duolingo, Netflix, Shopify
-------------------------------------------------------



With the market uptrend under pressure, investors should focus on stocks with strong [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/), such as these:


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Adobe is still above a 552.94 buy point in a short consolidation despite two days of losses. Shares are in the 5% buy area. Adobe announces its fiscal third-quarter results on Sept. 14.


Duolingo is tracing a double-bottom base with a 162.20 buy point. Shares regained their 50-day line in recent sessions, and are about 5% away from their next entry. Meanwhile, the RS line is at its highest level since mid-July.

Streaming giant and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Netflix continues to build a cup base with a 485 buy point. An early entry at Tuesday's high of 453.45 is also in play.


Finally, Shopify shares are quietly consolidating in the wake of last week's jump. A 71.43 buy point in a cup base is about 10% away. And an earlier entry is at 67.60, according to [IBD MarketSmith.](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)

The stock market turned a positive day into a mixed session, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reversed from solid gains to end lower despite cooling inflation data.




The producer price index, which measures wholesale inflation, came out Thursday morning. Producer prices dropped 0.5% in July, far below the expected rise of 0.3% and down from June's 1.1% increase. Year over year, prices rose 9.8% vs. an expected jump of 10.3%. On Wednesday, the [CPI inflation rate](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-is-finally-falling-the-good-and-bad-news-for-the-dow-jones/) finally pulled back from a 40-year peak in July, as the consumer price index came in cooler than expected.


Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims rose to 262,000 from the prior week's 260,000. Econoday estimates called for 260,000 initial unemployment claims.


On the earnings front, key earnings movers included Dow Jones media giant **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), along with **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)), **Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)) and **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)). [Disney shares](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-earnings-disney-stock/) jumped 4.7%. [AOSL shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/aosl-stock-alpha-omega-semiconductor-q4-2022-earnings/) surged nearly 8% after paring gains, while Cardinal Health rallied 5.2% to break out past a cup base's 64.63 buy point. Dutch Bros rallied 5.2% after trimming a much larger gain.

Stock Market Trend
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average cut gains to just 0.1%, while the S&P 500 reversed slightly lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite moved down 0.6%, finding stout resistance around the 13,000 level, but it's still on track for a four-week win streak. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.3%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP081122-228x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and appeared to be lower on the NYSE. The Nasdaq added another [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), taking its total count to two. The S&P 500 still has just one day of institutional selling.


Amid a string of big gains in recent weeks, it would be natural for the major stock indexes to consolidate for a period of time to digest those gains. Thursday's reversals were a sign that indexes could be taking a break.


Investors should be proactive by taking some profits among winning stocks. Meanwhile, it's still smart to be on the hunt for more top stocks breaking out in heavy volume past correct buy points.


Top growth stocks also reversed lower Thursday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.1%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **New Fortress Energy** ([NFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFE)) advanced 3.9%, extending a win streak to five sessions and rising 12% above a cup base's 52.47 buy point.


Energy stocks extended this week's gains as oil prices continued to rebound from last week's losses. West Texas Intermediate rose more than 2%, trading above $94 a barrel. The Energy Select Sector ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) jumped 3.4%, on pace for a 6.6% weekly advance.

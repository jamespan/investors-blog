Stock Market Rallies Off Lows In Bullish Session; Growth Stocks Lag, But Iqvia Scores Breakout
===============================================================================================

The stock market took a step back early Monday, with most of the selling concentrated in the Nasdaq composite. But the weakness amounted to just another test of the 21-day exponential moving average for the Nasdaq, and the index closed well off session lows in another display of resilience. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 marked new closing highs.




Despite the strong close, declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by more than 2-to-1. Losers topped winners on the NYSE by less than 2-to-1.


The stock market reacted negatively to news that retail sales and industrial production in China slowed more than expected. Meanwhile, a weaker-than-expected print from the Empire State Manufacturing index didn't help matters. It fell to 18.3 in August, down from July's reading of 43 and below the consensus estimate of 30.


It's a busy week of economic data, with July retail sales data due Tuesday. The minutes from the late-July Federal Reserve meeting will be released Wednesday at 11 a.m. PT.

The stock market was also jittery on growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will start to taper its monthly purchases of bonds and mortgage-backed securities before the end of the year. But the bond market isn't convinced of that timeline yet. The 10-year Treasury yield closed off lows but still fell 4 basis points to around 1.26%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite pared a 1.4% intraday loss to 0.2% in lower volume, with large-cap technology stocks doing a lot of the heavy lifting.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) crossed the 150 level to a fresh all-time high. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) also scored a new high. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) closed off lows and is holding support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) ahead of its earnings report Wednesday after the close. All three stocks are members of [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


But selling was pronounced in other top-rated growth stocks like **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), **Mercado Libre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)). All five ended with losses ranging from 3% to 5%.


Leading growth stocks generally had a rough go of it. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) also pared losses but still fell 1.2%. Top gainers in the IBD 50 included **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) and **Doximity** ([DOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS)). AutoNation joined [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) Monday, thanks to a bullish bounce off the [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) in heavy volume.


But Singapore-based internet giant **Sea Ltd.** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)) lagged in the IBD 50. Shares slumped 5.2%, with earnings due Tuesday before the open. SE stock is still holding above its 50-day after a failed breakout over a 278.10 buy point.

The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 each added 0.3% in the stock market today. **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) led the Dow Jones, with gains ranging from 1.4% to 1.8%. Health care stocks performed well overall Monday. The top-performing S&P 500 sector fund was the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)), up 1.1%.


**Iqvia** ([IQV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IQV)), another health care name, was a top gainer in the S&P 500, up nearly 3% to 255.29. It cleared a flat base with a 254.15 buy point Monday. Volume was light but rose sharply from Friday's level.


S&P 500 Loses A Distribution Day
--------------------------------


The July 19 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 fell off the count because the index rallied more than 5% from its closing price on that day.


In the diversified operations group, **Crane** ([CR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CR)) reversed slightly higher. The stock broke out Wednesday in strong volume, then pulled back to its 10-day moving average and found support Monday. Crane is still in the 5% buy zone from a 100.03 entry. Group peer **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)), meanwhile, is just below an alternate entry of 236.96.



After six straight gains, **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) and **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) lagged, but buyers came in and lifted both stocks off lows. Another leader in the group — **Ternium** ([TX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TX)) — also pared losses and found support at the 10-day line.


It remains a challenging environment for stock picking, which means it's OK to favor some cash at this point. Compelling technical setups have been a mixed bag. **Textainer**'s ([TGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGH)) breakout looked good last week, but sellers have been in the stock for three straight sessions.


The bottom line is that there are still enough healthy stock charts out there to be encouraged. If you own a growth stock that is having problems making headway, don't be afraid to trim the position or sell it outright.


It's OK to nibble at bullish setups when they arise, just keep your initial purchase small. The market will tell you soon enough if your timing was right.

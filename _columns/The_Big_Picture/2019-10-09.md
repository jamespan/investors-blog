The stock market ended with solid gains Wednesday, but lower volume once again left the bulls wanting more. Ahead of the start of China trade talks Thursday, sentiment was positive early after published reports said China might be willing to accept a partial trade deal if no more U.S. tariffs are imposed.




A rally in software and semiconductor stocks helped lift the Nasdaq to a gain of 1%, but actionable buy candidates remain in short supply. The S&P 500 rallied 0.9% and the Dow Jones industrials added 0.7%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in well below Tuesday's levels, continuing a trend in recent weeks of higher-volume declines followed up by lower-volume gains.


The stock market strengthened a bit after the minutes from last month's Federal Reserve meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET. Several Fed officials said the probability of a recession "had increased notably in recent months." The stock market took that to mean there's still a possibility of two more rate cuts before the end of the year.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP100919-258x300.jpg)Despite Wednesday's gains, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still below their 50-day moving averages after stiff selling Tuesday, when institutional selling resulted in a fresh [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Since Sept. 24, the Nasdaq shows five declines of 1% or more in higher volume. Pronounced distribution like this makes it a challenging environment to say the least for growth investors. Stocks just have a hard time making headway amid persistent institutional selling.


That's why growth investors should continue to tread carefully. With the stock market uptrend under pressure, it's OK to have some exposure and to give winners room to run. But new buys are risky. Over the past month or so, meaningful signs of institutional buying in the indexes have been virtually nonexistent. Every gain for the Nasdaq since Sept. 12 has come in lower volume than in the prior session.


Dow Jones Movers
----------------


Among the [FAANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rallied 1.2% to 227.03 after Canaccord Genuity reiterated a buy rating and raised its price target to 260. Apple continues to show relative strength after reclaiming a 221.47 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) was the Dow's top gainer, up 1.9% to 138.24. The cloud leader is back above its 50-day moving average, but it's still below a 141.78 entry. Late Monday, Jefferies upgraded Microsoft to buy and raised its price target to 160 from 93.


Chip Stocks Strengthen
----------------------


Semiconductor stocks outperformed after Tuesday's sell-off, but whether or not chip stocks will be able to provide sustained market leadership is still in question amid China trade headlines.


**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100 Wednesday, up 3.1%. But a breakout attempt over a 52.52 buy point hasn't gone anywhere. Still, the stock continues to hold above its 50-day moving average with a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) near highs. Group peer **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) looks good as it holds above a 58.71 entry. After a low-volume pullback, **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) is back in buy range from a 45.22 buy point.



Among chipmakers, **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) is the outright leader in the group. It's extended past the 5% buy zone after a breakout over a 44.98 buy point, but a couple of other chipmakers are near buy points. **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) is back above its 50-day moving average as it trades just below a 130.47 entry. **STMicroelectronics** ([STM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STM)) is just below a 19.78 entry as it holds above the 50-day line.


Software Stocks Rally
---------------------


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 1%, led by strength in software stocks like **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)). But both former high fliers are below their 50-day moving averages, a situation that most software stocks find themselves in currently. Some may go on to form proper bases, but not without renewed signs of institutional buying.


The two stocks left standing in the software sector at this point are **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) and **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)). Coupa is back near highs after flashing a sell signal from a 148.10 buy point. DocuSign was a top gainer in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), up 3.7%. It's in buy range from an alternate handle entry of 65.17.

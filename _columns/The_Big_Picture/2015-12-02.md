Nasdaq Posts A 7th Distribution Day As Markets Reverse
=======================================================

Â 


Stocks slumped in higher volume Wednesday, a disappointing attempt by the major indexes to reclaim key psychological levels. The focus should intensify on what the Nasdaq is doing now.


The Nasdaq composite's reversal Wednesday was the opposite of what one would like to see.


An early modest gain of 0.4% was enough to send the Nasdaq rising above a clear resistance level near 5160. But the rally lasted barely 90 minutes.


![MPv_120315](http://ibdcmsprod10/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MPv_120315.gif)As Fed chief Janet Yellen addressed the Economic Club of Washington in the U.S. capital, the gains quickly dissolved into losses. Her concerns about slack in the labor market and weak core inflation, as well as repeated assurances that the central bank's monetary policy will remain "accommodative" for quite a long time, seemed to give investors less confidence in the country's overall economic prospects.


By day's end, the Nasdaq withered to a 0.6% loss in 2% higher volume, triggering a seventh session of distribution in recent weeks.


The S&P 500, weighed down by severe selling in the oil patch, dropped 1.1%, also in higher turnover. As it's done all year, the S&P 500 has failed to hold above 2100 for long. The Oct. 27 distribution day expired on time, so the count for the S&P stays at six.


The days' 15 worst declines among IBD's 197 industry groups came from the oil, mining and transportation sectors.


In normal circumstances, such a high distribution count in one or both of the major indexes would normally tilt IBD's Market Pulse to a negative outlook.


So, why does the current outlook remain at "confirmed uptrend" for now? Let's first dissect the Nasdaq's seven distributions.


Two are suspect. Monday's distribution day (-0.2%) was technical in name, and it compared volume to a half-day session on Friday. The Nov. 17 day was stalling. Generally, markets do not peak on a flurry of such action.


Among the five other distribution days, only two showed fierce selling: Nov. 13 (-1.5%) and Nov. 12 (-1.2%). The other two declines were mild (-0.4% on Oct. 30, -0.2% on Nov. 10).


Second, Internet, financial, software and chipmaking stocks still show poise. **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) burst higher late Wednesday following solid Q4 results. [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) shows that while the number of breakouts on the whole is limited, breakouts are still gaining ground.


Third, investor psychology is not overly bullish, a positive factor.

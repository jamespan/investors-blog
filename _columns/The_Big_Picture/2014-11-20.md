Stocks Rebound From Bad Start As Retailers Show Strength
=========================================================

Stocks stumbled at the opening bell Thursday but quickly reversed en route to an up day.

  

The Nasdaq added 0.6%, while the S&P 500 lagged with a 0.2% gain. The small-cap S&P 600 popped 1.2%, smoothing over the previous session's 1% dent.

  

The IBD 50 tacked on 0.3%.

  

Volume ran higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE.

  

While daily gains in the major indexes have been unremarkable so far this month, losses also have been small, and quiet enough to keep a lid on the distribution-day count.

  

A distribution day (a significant decline in a major index in rising volume) points to institutional selling. There are few signs so far that funds are eager to bail out on this uptrend.

  

On Thursday, the bullish price moves included home-furnishings retailer **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), which cleared an alternative entry just above 84; fuel card provider **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), which had been dancing around a buy point; and quartz countertop maker **CaesarStone** ([CSTE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSTE)), which poked above an eight-month consolidation.

  

Among IBD's 197 industry groups, retail held five of the day's top 10 slots.

  

However, profit-taking in some fast movers also was evident. Action camera maker **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) and driver technology firm **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) suffered 9% and 6% losses respectively. After sprinting ahead in August and September, the two new issues have consolidated in a volatile fashion.

  

With the indefinite action in the major indexes for most of this month, individual investors might wonder if the uptrend can find a second wind.

  

One thing that could give the uptrend a boost is corporate buybacks. Corporations have a history of buying back shares in November and December.

  

Companies that in recent weeks announced a boost in their buyback budgets include **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), a $5 billion program; **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), $2 billion; **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)), $1 billion; **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)), $500 million; **Madison Square Garden** ([MSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSG)), $500 million; **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), $300 million; and **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)), $200 million.

  

Each of the above stocks has a Composite Rating of 95 or better, except for former leader Kors.

  

Economic news was mixed. Jobless claims were higher than expected, but existing-home sales topped views. The Philadelphia Fed survey trounced views but has been volatile in the past.

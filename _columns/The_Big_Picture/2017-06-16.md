  Stock Indexes At Odds, But This Group Is Showing Grit

 Stocks on Friday completed a week of contradiction, as the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sketched different pictures.


The Nasdaq lost 0.2% Friday and 0.9% for the week. The S&P 500 closed barely above the break-even line and rose less than 0.1% for the week.

The two weekly charts for the major indexes look like they are describing different markets.


The S&P 500 has a sideways look. The Nasdaq looks more like an index ready to head south.


The Nasdaq's ugly action June 9 — a 1.8% dive — was enough to change IBD's market outlook to uptrend under pressure. But the S&P 500's 0.1% loss that day was only enough to justify a yawn.


Distribution also differed on Friday. The Nasdaq picked up a distribution day Friday. But the S&P 500 lost the May 11 distribution day because of time. Both indexes remain with a modest number of distribution days.


Taken together, these details add up to three question marks.


Is the recent action showing early signs of sector rotation? If so, the bulls would be happy. The market might be tired of tech and ready to feed a fresh batch of stocks.


Bulls can make money in that environment.


Or is the recent action just a flight to safety? For the week, the Dow Jones utility average gained 1.7%. Tobacco stocks were up 0.9%, according to early data. The bears love a flight to safety. It often heralds the beginning of a correction.


Or is the recent action the beginning of a choppy, uncertain market? In some ways, the choppy market would be the worst outcome. Choppiness is just bad enough to make it hard to hold stocks, and just good enough to make it hard to sit on the sidelines.


The week's best gainers settled nothing.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the 15 biggest percentage gainers for the week included three from the building sector, two from the leisure sector and four from defensive areas.


Yet, there were signs of strength Friday.


Data released Friday showed bad misses on housing starts and permits for May, but the homebuilder stocks showed resilience. After falling 1.2% early, the homebuilding industry group erased all of the loss to end up slightly for the day.


Recent breakouts among the bank stocks also showed grit.


Stocks staying within the 5% buy zone included **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)), **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)) and **East West Bancorp** ([EWBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWBC)).

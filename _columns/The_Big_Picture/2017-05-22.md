 The stock market kicked off the week with more gains Monday as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite extended their winning streaks to three sessions.


The Nasdaq added 0.8%, closing less than 0.1% off its all-time high. The S&P 500 added 0.5%, the Dow gained 0.4% and the Russell 2000 picked up 0.8%. The Russell hasn't quite reclaimed its 50-day line yet. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Friday's levels.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MP052217.png)On Wednesday, indexes fell hard in heavy volume, raising concerns that a pullback could gain steam. Similar to the indexes' price action March 21, the selling Wednesday was short-lived. It was an unequivocal day of institutional selling, but big percentage declines in higher volume have been the exception, not the rule, in recent weeks. Even when the distribution-day count was starting to get elevated in the Market Pulse graphic, it was never a market under meaningful distribution, and that's still the case now.


For now, major averages have found their footing, and growth stocks are acting well overall. The bulls have reason to be optimistic, but it's still a market where one negative headline can unleash a wave of selling, so it's important to keep profitable positions on a tight leash.


Growth stocks outperformed again Monday, with the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) up 1.3%. More than half the names in the index of leading growth stocks rose 1% or more.


**Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)) was a big winner in the IBD 50, up 7.5%. It's still in buy range from a 56.02 buy point.


Fiber-optic stocks were strong across the board after Needham upgraded shares of **Applied Microelectronics** ([AAOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAOI)) to a strong buy and set an 85 price target. Shares jumped 12%.


**Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) also did well in the group, rising 6%, helped by an upgrade to buy from hold at Stifel Nicolaus on improving market trends and recent contract awards. The company will announce second-quarter results on June 1.


Defense stocks got an early lift Monday on news of several deals out of Saudi Arabia totaling around $110 billion. **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) closed off session highs but still rose 1.5% to 277.03. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) did the same, rising 1.6% to 183.67.Â  Lockheed is still in buy range from a 270 buy point, while Boeing is trying to reclaim a 185.81 buy point.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) fell sharply late Friday on news of a share offering. Shares were poised for a lower open Monday, but the emerging leader quickly reversed higher, ending with a gain of nearly 5% to 52.51. The stock gapped up over a 46.31 buy point May 12. The stock's open price on that day (47.58) presented a later but still viable buy point.


Shares of **Dell Technologies** ([DVMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVMT)) also outperformed, rising nearly 4% to 67.38 in higher volume. The stock offers a good example of what a conviction bounce off the 50-day line should look like. It's back above a 65.88 buy point and still in buy range.


Benchmark crude oil for June delivery added 40 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $50.73 a barrel. OPEC meets Thursday and the market is feeling more comfortable that OPEC-led production cuts will be extended, possibly into early next year.


After the close, shares of **Take-Two Interactive** ([TTWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTWO)) slumped 9% after the company said the launch of its highly anticipated "Red Dead Redemption 2" will be delayed until the spring.

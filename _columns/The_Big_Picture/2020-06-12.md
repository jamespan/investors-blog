The stock market ended an erratic session with moderate gains Friday. The major stock indexes briefly turned negative in midafternoon trade after the Centers for Disease Control said lockdowns may be again necessary if coronavirus cases make a comeback.




The Nasdaq composite rallied as much as 2.9% before closing with a 1% gain. The S&P 500 climbed 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.9% — boosted by an 11.5% surge in shares of **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrials had the worst day since March 16.


Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 2.3%. Leading growth stocks underperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 1.1% to recover a portion of Thursday's 4.7% sell-off. Volume was substantially lower on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Thursday's session, removing some of the strength from today's rebound.

Stock Market Rally Fades
------------------------


Friday's volatile but positive action left the Nasdaq's [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count at two, while the S&P 500 has three distribution days. Despite Thursday's sell-off, the stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend. It's normal for stocks to take a break and consolidate, potentially offering new entries at support levels or new bases.

Some top growth stocks are again testing their key support levels. On Friday, FANG stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) slid 1.8% to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time since an April 13 breakout above a 383.11 handle buy point. However, strong selling was absent, indicating the support level is still in play.


On Thursday, **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) closed below its 50-day line, but ended right at that key level after Friday's 1.8% gain. Bearishly, the stock's relative strength line is far from its old highs, indicating stock market underperformance.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) skidded almost 4% after two analyst downgrades Friday. Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from equal-weight to underweight, while Goldman Sachs downgraded the electric-auto maker from buy to neutral. Shares are still above an 869.92 entry in a cup with handle.



Stocks To Watch: Qorvo
----------------------


Qorvo, another Leaderboard stock, is back to its 108.88 buy point in a cup with handle after a strong breakout on June 2. According to IBD Leaderboard commentary, "Qorvo sold off and is testing its buy point, right now holding above it."

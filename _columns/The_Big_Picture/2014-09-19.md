===============================================================

Stocks delivered a weak follow-up to Thursday's resumed uptrend as signs of institutional selling reappeared.


The Nasdaq fell 0.3% while the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1%. Small caps took the day's hardest hit. The S&P 600 skidded 1.1%.


The IBD 50 fell 0.4%.


Volume rose across the board, partly because of quadruple witching expirations and the [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) of **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)).


Although the China-based e-commerce stock grabbed the headlines with its initial public offering, individual investors should resist the temptation to dive in prematurely.


An IPO should be allowed to form and break out of a consolidation before an individual investor buys shares.


Alibaba opened at 92.70 and closed at 93.89. Technically, the stock was up 38% from its issue price of 68, but individual investors don't have access at that price.


Meanwhile, the major indexes showed weak action. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 pegged new intraday highs in the first five minutes of trade and then reversed lower.


The Nasdaq's action constituted distribution, a sign of institutional selling.


The S&P 500's loss was too little to meet the definition of distribution. However, the S&P 500's reversal off its new high and close in the bottom half of the day's range were negatives.


Only 12% of IBD's 197 industry groups rose for the day. Many of the top gainers were defensive — utilities, tobacco, food and soap.


This is not the kind of action that bulls like to see a day after the indexes post new highs.


Ideally, it's best when an uptrend returns through a follow-through day. However, a new high that signals a resumed uptrend can work.


This year, though, resumed uptrends haven't fared well.


On Jan. 14, a new high on the Nasdaq nudged the market back into an uptrend, but the move didn't last. The indexes began to decline Jan. 23 and bottomed in early February.


On April 1, a new high on the S&P 500 brought back the uptrend label. The indexes began losing ground two sessions later and bottomed in mid-April.


Bulls, though, could take comfort from the market's successful handling of uncertainty — the jitters over Federal Reserve language, Scotland's secession threat and Alibaba's big splash.


The S&P 500 gained 1.3% for the week, the IBD 50 0.7% and the Nasdaq 0.3%.

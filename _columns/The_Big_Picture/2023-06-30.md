The stock market ended the first half of 2023 on a high as indexes popped on mild inflation data. The bulls now have the clear upper hand heading into the second half the year.




The Nasdaq composite powered 1.5% higher, with its weekly lift an impressive 2.2%. The tech-heavy index has gained in nine of the past 10 weeks. In addition, its 31.7% gain so far in 2023 made it its best first half of a year since 1983. It now has a cushion above all its short-term and major moving averages.


The S&P 500 was no slouch either, popping 1.2%. It actually outshined the Nasdaq on a weekly basis, with a 2.3% gain, and is also clear of its short-term moving averages. The benchmark index is up about 16% so far in 2023 and sits at a new 52-week high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes, but still rose 0.8%. It was a day to remember for component **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) as it closed with a $3 trillion market cap after rising 2.3%. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) also outperformed.


Small caps underwhelmed, however, with the Russell 2000 lifting a puny 0.4%. Growth stocks outperformed though, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) jumping 1.9%.


Mild Inflation Boosts Indexes, Sparks This Bullish Switch
---------------------------------------------------------


Stocks were bolstered after the Commerce Department released its personal income and outlays report for May. Personal income rose 0.4%, in line with estimates. The PCE price index rose 0.1% on the month, with an annual increase of 3.8%. Both numbers met estimates.


Crucially, the core PCE price index data, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, was encouraging. It rose 0.3% on the month and 4.6% year over year, both cooler than analysts expected.


The report saw the 10-year Treasury note yield edge lower. The disinflation process appears to remain intact, and the Supreme Court decision Friday to block the Biden administration's $430 billion student-loan debt forgiveness plan should put further pressure on consumers.


With indexes looking bullish and the market in a confirmed uptrend, IBD is raising recommended exposure levels to 80% to 100%. However, investors should take care when adding exposure, taking stock of current market levels and increasing at a measured pace. It is also key to remain nimble in case there is a pullback.


Next week will not be entirely quiet, even with markets being closed July 4 to mark Independence Day. Wednesday sees the release of the latest Fed minutes, while the June unemployment report is due Friday.

Solar Stock Market Group Shines
-------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors all ended the session in positive territory. Technology and consumer discretionary led the upside, while energy and real estate made the slimmest gains.


The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave further insight into the stock market action.


Computer hardware stocks, solar companies and oil & gas drillers and field services plays were among the best performers.


On the flip side, wholesale food stocks, mail-order retailers, truck transportation plays and cable stocks lagged.

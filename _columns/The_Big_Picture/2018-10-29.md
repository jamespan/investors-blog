Bears Stuff Early Stock Market Rally; The No. 1 Thing To Do Right Now In Growth Stocks
=======================================================================================

An early rebound by growth stocks in the stock market received Wall Street's version of an NFL blitz.




Ever notice how sometimes a running back gets the ball, tries to advance a yard or two, and then gets smothered by the defense as the team on offense ends up losing four or five yards? The major indexes played that running-back role on Monday.


Yet even in these relatively dark times on Wall Street, now is the best time to begin assembling a good watch list of potential new leaders. At some point, the weight of heavy sellers will lift. And when a [new follow-through takes place](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), if it's a good one, you should see at least a handful of high-quality growth companies launch breakouts to new highs during the same week or month.


And sometimes, [stunning breakouts can even take place on the same day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) as the follow-through itself.


A Stunning Reversal By The Nasdaq
---------------------------------


An early gain of as much as 1.8% by the Nasdaq composite not only got squandered. The tech-heavy composite dropped as much as 3.4% with roughly 15 minutes to go in the 6-1/2-hour trading session. At 6922, the Nasdaq had fallen 14% off its high, making its biggest correction since a 10-week 18.7% dive through February of 2016.


Some bargain-hunting (or was it mostly short-covering?) in the waning minutes helped cut some of that wicked decline. Yet overall, stocks got bloodied with two trading sessions remaining in October.


The Nasdaq finished the day down 1.6% and touched 7000 for the first time since May 3. The Nasdaq 100 lopped off 2%. Another rush to safe-haven names helped buffer the S&P 500's slide. The large-cap benchmark fell 0.7%. The NYSE composite edged just 0.3% lower. The Russell 2000 fell 0.4%.


Volume fell on both main exchanges. But early data showed that turnover remained heavy.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, hospital, dairy, shoe, confectionery, automaker, packaged food, Northeast banking, Western and Southwest banks, and S&L stocks all rallied well more than 1%. They underscored the growing urge among institutions to load up on defensive areas of Wall Street.


The Dow utility average rallied 1.4% higher. At 740, the collection of dividend payers is now up 2.3% since Jan. 1.


These Growth Stocks Simply Keep Dropping
----------------------------------------


FANG stocks may soon be called the "de-FANGed" gang if Monday's session gets repeated as often as the events that define the Bill Murray comedy classic "Groundhog Day." **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) got ripped for a 5% loss to 284.97. The online streaming video giant has joined the other three longtime tech darlings in sinking sharply beneath its 200-day moving average.

As the Market Pulse table shows, the sell-off was not limited to megacap techs.


Large-, mid- and small-cap growth leaders bled more of their big gains achieved over the past several months. While **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) enjoyed a 45% boost on news that **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) is going to acquire the innovator of enterprise-level software, the software sector continues to basically implode.


For many months, Software ranked first within IBD's Stock Research Tables. These tables are sliced and diced into 33 separate sectors. The Retail, Medical, Business Services and Consumer sectors had tended to round out the top five rankings.Â No longer.


Retail, Defensive Names Do Better
---------------------------------


Telecom has jumped up to No. 2 in the stock tables. Medical and Software remain in the top 5, as they still sport large year-to-date gains. But now Alcohol has jumped to No. 6, Food and Beverage to No. 8, and Utility to No. 10.


Meanwhile, interest-rate-sensitive issues continued to flag signs of big selling. Chip, electronics, mining, building and auto stocks rank among the very worst in the stock tables.


Economic data did not fan much buying. Personal income growth of 0.2% for September sorely missed the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/); the Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing service saw a sharp drop in its October index, to 17.6 vs. 23.3 the prior month.


No one knows when the market will bottom out. Will it occur around the Nov. 6 midterm elections? Or when the Federal Reserve signals that it just may slow down its pace of interest rate hikes, including six alone since March of 2017? Or when President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping decide to end their game of trade tariff chicken?


The savvy IBD reader refrains from guessing. Instead, he or she will wait patiently for the next rally that features a [good follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). The best ones typically take place on Day 4 to Day 7 of a brand-new rally attempt. But others took place well after the 10th day of a first up session and engineered a productive market rally.


Discount and variety retailers, for now, seem to be in a good spot to lead the market when it is in fact ready to engage in a new uptrend.


A Few Names Remain In IBD Leaderboard
-------------------------------------


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) currently features **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) on its Leaders list and watch list.


The average RS Rating among these three companies? A solid 91 on a scale of 1 to 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tractor-supply-co-tsco.aspx).


How about the 30 companies making up the Dow Jones industrial average? The mean Relative Price Strength is currently 67.


Since Oct. 1, the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) has highlighted seven companies from the retail and consumer sectors.

Wall Street Bears Stay Quiet As These Indicators Show Bullishness Is Not Extreme
=================================================================================

Shhhhhhhh. Sometimes quiet action on Wall Street is good.


In certainly one of the quietest days of trading for equities in a quite a while, Wednesday still saw the Nasdaq composite rally for a seventh straight day and the S&P 500 barely budge after rising for the prior four sessions. The Nasdaq eked out a less-than-0.1% gain to 7888, coming within a forearm's length of its all-time peak of 7933.


The S&P 500 large-cap benchmark, after rising more than 44 points over those four up days, erased less than 1 point on Wednesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MP060818-219x300.jpg)Small caps stood their ground. The Russell 2000 surrendered 1 point. The small-cap S&P 600, which notched a new all-time high of 1083 on Tuesday, lost less than that on Wednesday.


Bigger Movers
-------------


The bigger movers on Wednesday? The Dow utility and transport averages fell 0.4%. U.S. crude oil futures dropped 3.5% to $66.75 a barrel.


Volume contracted on both exchanges. So with the distribution-day count still at a very manageable level and few if any of the top leading stocks showing signs of severe selling stress, IBD's current outlook for U.S. equities remains at "confirmed uptrend."


A few other signs of the market's still-robust health? Consider these points:


One, the Nasdaq handled a swift sell-off from July 26 to 30 that sent the tech-rich index back to its 50-day moving average. But instead of cutting through the key medium-term support line, the Nasdaq rebounded. The S&P 500, S&P 600, and Russell 2000 also trade on the north side of their rising 50-day lines.


Two, breadth is improving again. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line continues to rise since early last week, although it remains below the July 9 high.


Three, stocks making new 52-week or all-time highs still outmatch new lows. On Tuesday, 337 issues made new highs on the Nasdaq and NYSE, vs. 84 new lows. That's a bullish ratio. Go to [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) within IBD Stock Lists to monitor this on a daily basis.


Four, [market psychology gauges](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) show that investor optimism hasn't yet reached a boiling point.


Bullishness among newsletter editors hasn't yet reached the 60%-plus level in January that preceded the first 10%-plus correction in stocks in nearly two years. The [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) has certainly dropped hard lately, but has yet to go below 10 like it did in mid-January.


China Threatens Tariffs Again
-----------------------------


A new 25% Chinese tariff on $16 billion in U.S. goods, including steel, oil and autos, still hasn't triggered a long and meaningful sell-off that would disintegrate the long bull market. But clearly certain sectors of stocks are feeling the heat.


Take the steel producers. **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)), **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)), **ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)) and others all failed to make much headway after breaking out of bases earlier in the year. Since President Trump's surprise election win in 2016, they have certainly gained some lost ground. Tax cuts are part of the reason. However, they are all flat or down sharply since Jan. 1 this year.


Through Tuesday's action, the [steel group ranked a lowly 177th](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-aug-07-2018/) for six-month price performance.


A savvy growth investor will shun those lagging industries within the market (IBD tracks 197 industry groups each day) and focus one's money, brainpower, and time on the leaders of the vanguard industries.


This Sector Is A Leader
-----------------------


Lately, the medical sector has become part of the cream that rises to the top.


**Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), the inventor of a novel new heart pump that is saving lives, hasn't been doing too hot lately. But all leaders need to take a break and build a new base. And that's exactly what the Massachusetts-based company is doing after a beautiful breakout in January past a 200.38 [flat-base buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) and a 125% advance to its June 20 high of 450.93.


"Health care is traditionally a very good growth area, where you can always find innovation," Chuck Severson, senior portfolio manager at R.W. Baird in charge of midcap growth strategy at the Milwaukee-based money manager, told IBD. In May, Envestnet chose Baird as top midcap fund manager for 2018.



Severson noted that Abiomed has no competitors and is "still in the very early innings" of its growth cycle. Their biggest problem: getting doctors to learn how to use their devices.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) also represent what's new and exciting — not just for growth stock hunters but also for the greater economy, the future quality of life and work, and consumer-oriented markets in general.


[Online dating site leader Match scored a big gain](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/internet-stock-google-owner/) and moved past an aggressive buy point for experienced stock traders after the company's earnings report.

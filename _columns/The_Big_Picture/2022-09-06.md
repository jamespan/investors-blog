  Stock Market Falls Again As Bears Run Wild; These Stocks Struggle Most As Yields Spike

The bears continued to run free and took another bite out of stock market investors as Treasury yields spiked on Tuesday. A surprise service-sector jump raised expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates.




The Nasdaq composite fell by the biggest margin out of the major indexes. It extended its losing streak to seven trading days as it dipped 0.7%. It is now the Nasdaq's longest losing streak since November 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq lost yet more ground on the 50-day moving average and is now down more than 27% so far in 2022.


The S&P 500 tried to rally into positive territory early in the session but ended up surrendering 0.4%. It has now fallen in six of the past seven sessions.


Adding further gloom to the picture was the fact the Nasdaq volume rose and also was higher on the NYSE. This means an extra [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq and for the S&P 500. The Nasdaq and S&P  now carry six days of higher-volume declines as the current market uptrend looks in severe danger of failure.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) also disappointed, as a majority ended the day lower. Communication services and energy fared the worst as the defensive utilities and real estate areas turned in the best gains.

Small Caps Struggle; Yields Spike Amid Surprise
-----------------------------------------------


The bears spanked small caps as the Russell 2000 fell 1%. The fact the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is currently populated by a bevy of energy names played against it on Tuesday. It reversed 1.2% lower.


Stocks in general were smacked after the Institute for Supply Management's U.S. services index rose to 56.9 in August from 56.7 in July. This was a surprise because analysts had expected it to drop to 55.2.


The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped 15 basis points to 3.34% as aggressive rate hikes look increasingly likely.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya told IBD the resilient economy is paving the way for more Fed tightening.


"Stocks are going to struggle because too much of the economy is doing well and that leaves Wall Street vulnerable to an extended period of rising interest rates," he said. "The dovish pivot and the end of interest rate hikes with the December FOMC is not how this will play out."

These Stock Market Groups Struggle Most
---------------------------------------


The performance of the IBD industry groups was telling on Tuesday.


It was a bad day for retail, with jewelers, automobile, home furnishings and consumer electronics retailers among the worst performers. Generic drugmakers also struggled.



On the other side of the coin, solar stocks shined brightest, while coal stocks and steel producers also made good gains.


Among the best performers in the solar area was **Sunrun** ([RUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUN)), which was the [IBD Stock Of The Day for Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/run-stock-lights-up-residential-solar-market/).


While it is not actionable for now, shares have popped above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.


Sunrun stock is worth adding to one's watchlist as it could form a bottoming base in a few weeks.

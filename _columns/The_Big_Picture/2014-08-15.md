Stocks showed determination Friday as reports of a Russia-Ukraine military clash failed to do much damage.


The Nasdaq rose 0.3% after falling as much as 0.6% on the midmorning scare. The S&P 500 closed flat. The IBD 50 advanced 0.3%.


Volume rose across the board. Friday was an options expirations day, which often lifts volume.


With the market only recently turning to a confirmed uptrend, keeping the uptrend alive is job No. 1. So far, the indexes have avoided trouble, and Friday's bullish counterpunching by the major indexes was respectable, if not impressive.


The indexes were up 0.7% on the Nasdaq and 0.5% on the S&P 500 when reports of a Ukraine-Russia skirmish hit the news wires. Both major stock indexes headed south, erasing all of the early gains and pulling the Nasdaq and S&P 500 under the break-even line.


This could've been the beginning of something very bad. A distribution day appeared to be shaping up, and a sizable loss in rising volume soon after a follow-through day often can doom a new uptrend. But after shrugging off a report of zero growth in eurozone GDP on Thursday, the market handled the Russia-Ukraine news equally well.


Top-rated stocks continue to score new highs, even though the marketwide gauge of new highs is modest. Stocks scoring new highs during the week included **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)), **Avis Budget** ([CAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAR)) and **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)).


U.S. Steel became the second steel producer to raise its Composite Rating to 90 or better. The other is **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)).


(The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 puts a stock in the top 10 percentile.)


The steel industry group was rated No. 39 in Friday's IBD, among 197 industry groups. Six weeks ago, steel was buried at No. 159.


Meanwhile, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) on Friday completed a bullish three-weeks-tight pattern that could provide a new entry at 75.60. The stock is extended from its most recent breakout from a cup-with-handle base. However, the three-weeks-tight pattern could allow new buying should the stock break past the buy point in strong volume.


Economic news was mixed Friday.


The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August missed the Street's consensus estimate, but that was after hitting a four-year high the previous month. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for August also missed views.


However, industrial production for July topped estimates and the Producer Price Index was in line with the Street's consensus estimate.


For the week, the IBD 50 popped 2.8%. The Nasdaq added 2.2%, while the S&P 500 rose 1.2%. The small cap Russell 2000 trailed with a 1.1% gain.


In the coming week, earnings reports will be heavy on retail stocks. Companies reporting include **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) on Monday, **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) on Tuesday, **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) on Wednesday, **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) on Thursday and **Ann** ([ANN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANN)) and **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) on Friday.


None is a highly rated stock, but together they could make a statement about the mood of consumers.


The retail sector has been stuck on the sluggish side. Retail was No. 19 of 33 sectors, as of Friday's IBD.

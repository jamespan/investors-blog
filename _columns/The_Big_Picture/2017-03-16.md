U.S. stock indexes staged a weak follow-up to the previous session's strong gains, but select pockets in the market did well Thursday.


The Nasdaq was essentially flat, while the S&P 500 shaved off less than 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.2%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.

Homebuilders have been a pocket of strength lately. The group is the No. 1 gainer over the past eight weeks, No. 1 over the past four weeks and No. 1 in Thursday's session.


Stocks in the builder group in or near buy zones include **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)), **TRI Pointe Group** ([TPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPH)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)).


One cautionary note: Neither the building sector nor the homebuilding group are highly rated. Going into Thursday's session, the building sector was No. 18 among 33 sectors. The homebuilders were No. 52 of 197 groups.

Blue chips have been another pocket of strength in the market. They have done well in the rally that began after the Nov. 4 closing lows.


Within the Dow, the top four outperformers in the rally are **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), up 40%; **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), up 35%; **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), up 29%; and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), up 28%. On Thursday, the four showed sideways action.


Many individual investors will look at this and say it's just a useless list of stocks that should've been bought three months ago.


Sometimes that's true, but not always.


As a leading stock rises, it pauses to form consolidations before beginning a new thrust. Goldman, for example, has been consolidating since mid-December. A big-volume gain now could provide an entry off the 10-week line.


Apple is extended from a first-stage base. That means the next base would be second stage. Breakouts from a first- or second-stage base are more likely to work than those from later bases.


Boeing and JPMorgan aren't offering any new entries right now, but they too remain low in the base count.


Economic news was mostly favorable Thursday.


Housing starts for February were about 1% higher than the consensus target. Permits missed by about 4%. First-time jobless claims were higher than expected but just barely so. The Philadelphia Fed's business survey for March was about 9% stronger than expected. The gauge measures regional manufacturing conditions.


Friday will be a quadruple witching session. This involves the expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, single stock futures and stock options. Normally, this will increase volume, particularly in the final hour of trade, and some price volatility.

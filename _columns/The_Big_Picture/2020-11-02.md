Stocks Today Show Strength On A Key Rise In This Measure Of The Economy
========================================================================

Even in the year 2020, it's still the economy.




On the eve of hotly contested elections across the world's No. 1 economy, investors decided to plunge back into stocks today — at least in a limited manner. And a better than expected rise in manufacturing activity in both the U.S. and China likely helped prevent another bloodbath of selling.


One session after the S&P 500 tanked as much as 2.3% Friday before cutting the day's loss to 1.2%, the key benchmark for large-cap stocks rebounded 1.2%.


At 10 a.m. ET, the Institute for Supply Management noted that its heavily watched manufacturing index rose to 59.3 in October. That smashed not only the [consensus forecast of 55.7 by Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). It also eclipsed the highest forecast at 57. A figure above 50 denotes expanding factory activity. This data followed news overnight that the Markit/Caixin latest manufacturing survey beat economists' expectations and showed continued growth in China, the world's No. 2 economy.


![MP110220](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP110220-235x300.jpg)The fact that October's level for the Supply Management manufacturing index also sharply topped the September figure of 55.4 hinted at accelerating economic activity.


Even after the ISM news, the market's rebound stalled in early-afternoon trading. Perhaps some institutions simply wanted to raise more cash ahead of the epic battle for the White House between incumbent Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Yet the way stocks finished on Monday perhaps offers some temporary relief, hinting that the current correction — like the one in September — may be milder and short-lived compared with the February-March coronavirus crash.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average did even better than the S&P 500; its 1.6% jump took back all of Friday's mild 0.6% decline and more. However, who were the real stars on Monday? Give credit to the "SMID caps," small- and midcap stocks.


These Sectors Do Better In Stocks Today
---------------------------------------


The small-cap iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) rallied nearly 1.8%. Meanwhile, SPDR S&P Midcap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) stormed almost 2% higher for the day. Both of these important sector indexes climbed back above a key technical level, the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).



You cannot say the same for the Dow.


The Nasdaq, hurt by another bout of heavy profit-taking in select enterprise software and internet content firms, put on the costume of market laggard all day long. Yet it still managed to eke out a 0.4% gain.


What makes Monday's session also interesting?


The Nasdaq turned in an [inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/). That is, the session high and low fit within Friday's zenith and nadir. This action, technically, implies that equity traders did not exactly want to go out on a limb.


Indeed, volume cooled off on both main exchanges.

While the market is now officially in a correction, a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) can appear right when investors least suspect it. And it usually gets born amid heaps of pessimism.


But are market participants pessimistic enough? Yes, the [Cboe VIX market volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) has spiked. But only recently, the [Investors Intelligence survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) showed bullishness at an alarming level of more than 60%.


'It's The Economy, Stupid'
--------------------------


The four words above, made famous by Democratic strategist James Carville, certainly still apply in 2020. And you can bet that the market will look way past the elections and scour the data for signs that America and the globe will get closer to normal and eventually put the coronavirus into quarantine.



Currently, lockdowns and curfews planned and currently underway in the U.K., France, Germany and Spain have hit the European bourses hard. Take a look at iShares MSCI Germany ([EWG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWG)). The exchange traded fund rose 1.4% on Monday, but is still down 8.5% since Oct. 1 — a horrible start to the fourth quarter.


Notice how the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) has crested and is starting to slope lower.


Keeping an eye on EWG and its French counterpart, iShares MSCI France ([EWQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWQ)), may give IBD readers a sense of when the market feels the economic risk of Covid-19 has been properly discounted.


Market Breadth Improves
-----------------------


Winners outmatched losers by a 3-1 margin on the NYSE. That's promising. On the Nasdaq, the ratio was less spectacular but still solid at 2-to-1 in favor of rising stocks.


Yet another critical component of bullish market internals — the number of stocks making 52-week or all-time highs — likely won't show up for weeks if not months. (Track the new highs vs. new lows each day at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Earnings reports will still determine some short-term direction, too.

Beyond The Election: Spend, Spend, Spend?
-----------------------------------------


The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond's yield fell one basis point to 0.87%, but the cost of money has been rising since August. In other words, as interest rates rise, it costs governments more to launch new rescue packages or infrastructure projects to help the battered economy.


Some institutional investors want government leaders to be bold.


In a note titled "Covid-19, Climate Change, And The Need For A New Marshall Plan," the co-founder and chief investment strategist of the respected Boston-based money management firm GMO laments that too many folks focus on the country's debt levels.


"It is double-entry bookkeeping. For every dollar owed there is a creditor to whom it is owed. And if you are concerned with liquidity, then of course it is interest coverage that counts," Jeremy Grantham wrote. "Today's negative real interest rates for risk-free loans, even on long-dated debt, makes it a very advantageous time for governments and corporations to borrow and invest. Yet many of them act as if they are intimidated by the debt ratio, as opposed to interest coverage."


"We have clear incentive, I would argue an imperative, to produce a very large and sustained public works program," Grantham added.


Perhaps that's just another reason to look well past Tuesday's elections, and what Congress will do?

  Indexes Resilient Again Despite Chip Slide As This Top Group Rallies

Major stock indexes ended slightly lower Tuesday in another impressive display of resilience amid daunting geopolitical headlines and a sell-off in semiconductor stocks.


The Nasdaq composite eased 0.2%, recovering nicely from a 1% intraday decline. The index found support at its 50-day moving average as it bounced.


The S&P 500 pierced its 50-day moving average but rallied off lows, ending with a loss of just 0.1% and above the 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%. Nasdaq volume rose, resulting in another mild distribution day for the Nasdaq. A March 7 distribution day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell off the count due to time. NYSE volume also rose.


Small caps outperformed with the Russell 2000 up 0.7%. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) performed mostly in-line with the major averages, down nearly 0.3%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP041117.png)The stock market had a decidedly defensive tone for a good part of Tuesday's session as gold miners and bonds rallied sharply.


June gold gained $20.30, or 1.6%, to settle at $1,274.20 an ounce, the highest settlement in about five months. Among gold miners, **Barrick Gold** ([ABX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABX)) added 3% to 20.09 in heavy volume as it works on a cup-with-handle base with a 20.88 buy point.


The 10-year Treasury yield shed 6 basis points to 2.30%. With indexes holding near highs and the 10-year yield still under pressure, the bond market and stock market once again seem to be at odds. The stock market might be feeling pretty good about the underlying health of the economy, but the precipitous drop in the 10-year yield in recent weeks means the bond market isn't so sure.


Homebuilders were another pocket of strength in the market Tuesday. **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) added 3% in heavy volume. It's acting well after a breakout over a 33.58 buy point. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), which reports earnings next week, is also performing well as it works on a cup-with-handle base with a 34.15 buy point.


Semiconductor stocks were weak across the board after published reports said **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was ending its relationship with German firm Dialog Semiconductor, a maker of power-management chips. Apple will reportedly replace Dialog's chips with in-house technology.


Apple supplier **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) plunged 6% intraday but ended with a loss of 2%. The stock cleared a 64.26 buy point Friday but is now below the entry.


Meanwhile, selling was intense in a few high-profile new issues. **Jeld-Wen** ([JELD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JELD)), **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) and **MuleSoft** ([MULE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MULE)) showed losses ranging from 2% to 4%.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 have basically been moving sideways since early March. Back-and-forth action since then has made it a challenging environment to make money in individual stocks. It's always good to have an edge as an individual investor, but an edge is difficult to find at this point. The distribution-day count remains higher than optimal, while the price action in individual growth stocks has been a mixed bag at best.


Not that long ago, the market was worried about the Fed and the course of interest rates. Now its attention seems to be focused on geopolitical risk after developments in Syria as well as heightened tension with Russia and North Korea.


The CBOE volatility index rose for the third straight session, bringing its three-session gain to 22%. It's now about 19% above the 10-day moving average. When the VIX rises more than 20% above the 10-day line, it can signal a positive shift in market direction.


For now, the risk-reward ratio seems to be tilting out of investors' favor. That tends to be the case when the market uptrend is under pressure. Some exposure to growth stocks makes sense, but aggressive exposure does not.

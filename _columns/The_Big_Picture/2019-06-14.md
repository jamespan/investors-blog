  Young Uptrend Buys Time But Little Else

Stock indexes fell for the third time in four days, as the young uptrend failed to find much traction after big gains the previous week.




The Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 sawed off 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sanded off less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 dropped less than 0.2%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and unconfirmed figures showed higher NYSE volume.


The Nasdaq closed under its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 held above its 50-day line. Indexes were modestly higher for the week, and gave back nothing from the previous week's strong gains.


Economic news was mixed.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP_NoD_061419-274x300.jpg)U.S. retail sales grew 0.5% in May on a month-to-month basis, below the expected 0.7% gain. On a year-ago basis, sales of 0.5% topped views for 0.4%.


The Street took the mixed results as a negative for the stock market. A weaker retail result would've made a rate cut by the Federal Reserve more likely. The Fed will meet Tuesday and Wednesday.


CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the odds for a rate cut next week at about 25%.


In other news, industrial production in May rose 0.4% month to month. The consensus estimate called for 0.2%.


China's Economy Slows
---------------------


Meanwhile, China's economy continued to fall off its historically fast pace. Industrial production in May rose 5% year over year, the lowest gain in 17 years.


China's retail sales in May grew 8.6% year over year — above the consensus estimate of 8.3%. In April, China's retail sales popped 7.2%, the lowest in 16 years. U.S.-traded shares of Chinese companies were mainly lower.


Chip stocks contributed to the day's gloom, as IBD's three chip groups shed 2% to 3%. **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) warned of a ["broad-based slowdown" in demand](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/broadcom-stock-chip-stocks-fall-fading-recovery-hopes/). Seven weeks ago, the semiconductor sector was No. 2 among 33 sectors. Now it's No. 21.


Stepping back to study the past 10 months or so, it's easier to get a grasp of the market's big picture. Four elements are providing the colors for the picture.


Coloring The Picture
--------------------


No. 1, China. While it's easy to blame President Donald Trump for the trade standoff, China's intransigence plays an equally dark part. Market watchers don't see an easy way out of the standoff.


No. 2, interest rates. The Fed will heed the data it sees and act accordingly. Trump isn't the first president who has tried and failed to influence the Fed.


No. 3, nowhere land. From year end to early May, the Nasdaq advanced in 17 of 19 weeks. But all that did was erase a 24% October-December decline with a 32% gain from the Christmas Eve low — essentially a net no gainer.


No. 4, recession fears and oil. "Since 1970, the U.S. has never experienced a recession without oil prices first doubling," Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, noted Friday. Light sweet crude bottomed at $42.36 on Christmas Eve. A doubling would take it to $84.72.

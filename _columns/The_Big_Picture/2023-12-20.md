  Stock Market Takes Well-Needed Break; This Sector Did Much Worse

The Grinch might not steal Christmas this year. Yet it felt like he made a presence in the stock market on Wednesday.




Investors and the financial media scrambled for reasons why major indexes went into a waterfall-like decline from around 2:15 p.m. ET after moving like relaxed house party guests ambling around the living room, sipping gently spiked eggnog for most of the day.


Substantial news on the economy or a specific industrial sector? Nothing to be found. A swoon in other financial markets? Nada. On the Nymex, crude oil futures edged up 0.4% to $74.22 a barrel. Gold traded pretty much flat. More likely than not, some large fund managers basically decided that, after nine straight days up in the major benchmarks, now was a ripe time to take profits.


Stock Market Today
------------------


While smaller issues fell a little harder, the profit taking in the stock market felt evenhanded. The S&P 500 wasted an early 0.2% gain and fell 1.5%, matching the Nasdaq composite's decline. A 1.9% slide by the Russell 2000 topped a 1.6% spill by the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund.


Meanwhile, the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 1.3%. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), member of the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), led a quartet of components falling 4 points or more. None of the Dow Jones' 30 stocks gained.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MPexpos_122023-250x300.jpg)Meanwhile, a poorly received earnings report from **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), down 12% to 246.25 in the heaviest volume since Sept. 16, 2022, hammered the Dow Jones transportation average as it dropped almost 2.4%. The Dow transports remain up a healthy 4.7% for the month.


Only a handful of industries among the 197 tracked by IBD gained ground. They included household and office furniture (up 1%), food wholesalers and newspapers (up 0.8% each), and books and hand tools, both rising 0.5%. See the [full daily performance of all 197 industries](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-20-2023/) every trading day at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


Volume rose 9% on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session to 6.29 billion shares. On the NYSE, turnover edged up 4% to 4.2 billion. The increased activity, shareswise, added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500.


Yet the distribution count remains low. And early Wednesday, the S&P 500 actually edged up just enough to wipe out the Dec. 6 distribution day on the 5% rally rule. Thus, both key indexes currently show just one distribution day each over the rolling 25-session period.


Watch This Gap
--------------


Certainly, technical reasons for the sell-off seem to be the chief reason for Wednesday's move. As noted during [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), the S&P 500 on Tuesday had gotten more than 7% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Even during a strong uptrend, a substantial rise above this key intermediate-term technical level has shown to presage a pullback at the minimum.


On July 27, when the S&P 500 reversed after making year-to-date highs, on that session's high the large-cap index reached 5.6% above its own 50-day line.


For sure, one down day doth not make a trend. But active investors need to stay vigilant about their newest buys. They should also monitor their positions closely and address these questions:


* Did I buy shares well above the [proper buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-buy-zone-is-the-sweet-spot/)? In most cases, a stock that has risen 5% above a proper buy point is extended.
* Is my stock reversing lower soon after a recent breakout? If gains are getting squeezed fast, that justifies [early selling to avoid a loss](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-growth-stock-golden-sell-rule-when-take-losses-fast/).
* Have some of my stocks reached a healthy profit level? A cardinal sell rule: [Take at least some gains at 20% to 25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


Overbought Conditions In The Stock Market?
------------------------------------------


[On MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=APA1BQ), the Daily Market Indicators page (under the symbol NASDQ) showed the "Short Term Overbought — Oversold Oscillator" recently surpassing 500. David Ryan, three-time U.S. Investing Championships winner and a regular guest on IBD Live on Tuesdays, has noted in recent years the stock market has often paused when this momentum indicator reached such a level.


Of course, it does not mean that a confirmed uptrend is over. Heavy distribution days, failed breakouts, weak rebounds in lower volume that follow heavy-volume sell-offs and generally weak action among leading sectors still offer the best signs that a change in trend may be in store. For that reason, IBD's current outlook remains with a suggested market exposure level of 80%-100%.

Other Financial Markets
-----------------------


Bonds did not move much despite the afternoon selling in stocks. The yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 4 basis points to 3.87%, ending near session lows, based on Cboe data.


Overseas stocks fared poorly.


The iShares Emerging Markets ([EEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEM)) ETF slumped 3.6%. Volume jumped 41% above average as the highly liquid fund undercut its 200-day moving average. EEM's year-to-date gain got trimmed to a paltry 2.5%.

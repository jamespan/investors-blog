Stock market bulls were in a good mood Friday, shrugging off a weaker-than-expected reading on consumer confidence, along with another jump in year-ahead inflation expectations.


The stock market weakened just after 10 a.m. ET, when the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey came in at 57.9 vs. expectations of 64. Inflation expectations rose to 4.9% from a previously reported 4.3%.




But the selling was short-lived. The Nasdaq composite turned in a bullish performance on the third day of its rally attempt, rising 2.6% as volume edged lower from Thursday. The Russell 2000 small-cap index wasn't far behind with a gain of 2.5%. And breadth was positive on the Nasdaq exchange by roughly 3-to-1.


Stock Market Today: A New Start For S&P 500
-------------------------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MP031725.jpg)Meanwhile, the S&P 500 bounced 2.1%, also in slightly lower volume. Friday marked the first day of a rally attempt for the S&P 500 after the benchmark index slumped 1.4% Thursday and undercut Tuesday's low. Winners swamped losers on the New York Stock Exchange by slightly more than 5-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average halted a four-session slide and rallied 1.5%. **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) were among the top percentage gainers in the blue-chip index as both stocks tested support at their 200-day lines.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) led a strong rally among the Magnificent Seven stocks, with gains of 5.3% and 3.9%, respectively. But the big gains didn't do much to repair the technical damage done to both stocks in recent weeks.


Several other top-rated growth stocks in [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com) are still damaged after many recently flashed sell signals with sharp breaks of their 10-week lines.


While Friday's gains were strong in the major stock indexes, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are still in the early stages of recovering from pronounced signs of institutional selling.

Higher-volume declines followed up by lower-volume gains are typical during a stock market correction. Stay on the lookout for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-how-to-invest-using-follow-through-days/), but also keep in mind that new buys aren't exactly plentiful at the moment. A former big leader like **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) has started to recover, but it's still below its 10-week line.


Setups To Watch
---------------


While most growth stocks are still in the early stages of recovering, some names are showing exceptional strength and are good candidates for the watchlist. **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) reclaimed its 50-day line with conviction, rising nearly 7%. In the security software group, **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) is holding gains well after recently surging on earnings. It still shows strength near the top of a long consolidation that started nearly a year ago.



**GeneDx** ([WGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGS)), a provider of personalized health insights through genetic testing, continues to hold gains well after gapping up sharply on earnings on Feb. 18. It's back in a buy zone from a 98.87 entry, but the stock tends to swing wildly. **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), meanwhile, is holding support at its 50-day line as it retests the top of a prior base.


On a strong day overall for Chinese stocks, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) raised exposure slightly Friday by increasing the iShares China Large Cap ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) exchange traded fund to a full position. Leaderboard also added the ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF ([UPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPRO)) as a full position. Headed into Friday, the model portfolio was about 21% invested. It's now closer to 40% invested.

The stock market ended the day firmly lower as bears bashed Big Tech, and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) got especially mauled by sellers. Investors hope to see the Santa Claus rally shift into gear in the coming shortened week.


The Nasdaq composite ended the day well off session lows, but still plunged 1.5%. Crucially, it got support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which helped it notch a weekly gain of 0.8%. It is the only major index with a monthly gain and has notched a strong year-to-date climb of 31.4%.




The S&P 500 also closed off lows, despite dropping 1.1%, after it found buyers at the important [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It snapped a two-week losing streak as it turned in a weekly lift of 0.7%. The benchmark index is now up 25.2% in 2024.


Decliners led advancers by more than 4-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by almost 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume also was higher, adding distribution days to both the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best out of the major indexes as it skidded 0.8% Friday. While it inched higher for the week, it remains down 4.3% for December and below its 10-week line. Big Tech powerhouses **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were the worst performers on the closely watched index.


Small caps were slapped lower, with the Russell 2000 tumbling 1.6%. It continues to hold above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rule-no-21-use-200-day-line-to-spot-overheating/) but lags below its other moving averages. Bears mauled growth stocks — with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund diving 2.8% Friday, though it remains clear of its 50-day line.


Investor's Business Daily is holding its recommended exposure to the 80%-100% level as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq got support at key levels. However, with noteworthy weakness among Big Tech plays and other leading stocks, it makes sense to be at the lower end of this band.


Stock Market Falls As Trade Deficit Expands
-------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP122724.jpg)One sliver of economic news Friday was the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported the trade deficit in goods rose nearly 5% last month, widening from $98.3 billion in October to $102.9 billion in November. Worries over Trump tariffs could actually lead to a further widening of the gap — at least in the short run — if companies choose to front-load orders before the tariffs take effect.


Next week features another holiday-shortened period, with the stock market closing for New Year's Day. There still will be some economic data, with pending home sales dropping Monday and the S&P Case-Shiller home price index due Tuesday. Construction spending data drops Thursday while the latest ISM manufacturing reading is released Friday. [The earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/hubspot-fortinet-axon-earnings/) is bare, however.


The stock market is currently enveloped in the Santa Claus rally period, which runs through the last five trading days of December and the first two of the new year. Investors should still be rooting for it to succeed, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.


"When investors are on the 'nice' list, and Santa delivers a positive Santa Claus rally return, the S&P 500 has generated an average January and forward annual return of 1.4% and 10.4%, respectively," he said in a note to clients.


Tesla Drags Down This Stock Market Group
----------------------------------------


All of the [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday in the red](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Consumer discretionary and technology were the worst-performing areas. Energy closed essentially flat, but was nominally negative. It remains one of the worst-performing sectors of 2024.



As ever, investors could get more insight into [action on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by delving into the relative performance of IBD's 197 industry groups.


Nearly all ended the day lower, with oil-and-gas royalty trusts, integrated computer system companies and telecom infrastructure plays among those hardest hit.


Automakers had the toughest session, though, weighed down by Tesla's sharp dip. But while the electric-vehicle giant fell 5%, it remains above its 21-day exponential moving average amid strong postelection gains. A member of the Magnificent Seven club, Tesla remains nearly 74% higher for the year.


Only a handful of groups ended the day in positive territory. Medical software companies, tire firms, food wholesalers and airfreight firms were among the best performers.

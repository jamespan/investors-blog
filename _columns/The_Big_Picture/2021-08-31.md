Let's just say it. Action in August among many growth stocks turned out, well, august.




Major equity indexes moved in dull fashion on Thursday. Small caps inched higher, large caps dipped. But they all roundly capped a bullish month, adding a little more luster to what's been a pretty good year in performance.


The Nasdaq composite edged down less than 0.1% for the day, but that hardly nicked the 4% gain for the month.


Tech firms certainly did the heavy lifting practically all month long for the Nasdaq. But they rested on Tuesday. Looking at the [197 industry groups tracked by IBD each day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), generic drug, drugstore chain, toy, consumer electronics retail, gaming software, gold and silver, oilfield services and automation machinery stocks delivered fine gains of 1% or more. Many of these groups rank in the bottom half of [IBD's daily performance table](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


MP083121Not A Shabby Day Or Month For Nasdaq
--------------------------------------------


Winners edged losers on the Nasdaq exchange Tuesday by nearly a 3-2 ratio.


On the NYSE, the bullish breadth was less dramatic, as advancers beat decliners by roughly 5 to 4.


Sure, the Nasdaq has proved somewhat more volatile than the S&P 500 in 2021. But this past month's action repeats some other bullish moves, including a 5.4% jump in April and a 5.5% boost in June. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) advanced almost 4.2% in August.


The Nasdaq's monthly gain soundly beat rises of 2.9% for the 500, 2.1% for the Russell 2000, and 1.2% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. And perhaps if it weren't for the solid gains by tech components within the 30-stock blue-chip index, the Dow likely would have rallied less than that.


Among the Dow's nontech members, **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) reasserted its market leadership. The Wall Street-cum-Main Street bank's stock ramped up 10% in August. No wonder its 91 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) tops all 29 other Dow industrial stocks. But **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) soured in the month, hacking off 3% to 7% of their value.


The Nasdaq's bulky gains failed to exceed an almost 8% surge by the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)).

Beyond Nasdaq: What To Watch In September
-----------------------------------------


Part of the reason why stocks did not move so much on Tuesday? Treasury securities traded rather quietly ahead of the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend.


Long-dated government bonds also showed listless action. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond finished at 1.3%, up 7 basis points in August. Thirty-year bonds yielded almost 1.93% on Tuesday, down roughly 3 basis points for the month.


Clearly, institutional investors will keep an eagle eye out for the next Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates, slated for Sept. 21-22. Many Fed watchers are expecting more detail on when the U.S. central bank will begin tapering its hefty $120 billion worth of bond buying per month. What could affect the governors' decision making until then? Perhaps a new slug of economic data, including the August ISM survey on Wednesday and the August U.S. payrolls data, gets top priority.


Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to IBD that last week's comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell delivered confidence on Wall Street about taking very gradual steps to remove policies that have kept the cost of money low.


"Powell took the opportunity to settle some market nerves by reinforcing that there is no mechanical connection between tapering asset purchases and interest rate lift-off," Shah wrote. "By divorcing rate hike timing from the tapering decision, Powell is looking to avoid repeating one of the key characteristics of the 2013 taper tantrum that had contributed to the disruptive bond market sell-off."


"Powell should deliver additional information about tapering at the September FOMC meeting and, provided the next few employment reports convey continued progress with both labor demand and labor supply, the Fed is likely to advance to a tapering announcement by year-end," she added.

Best Industry Groups, Interesting Action In Leading Stocks
----------------------------------------------------------


A survey of the [top industry groups as of Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-aug-30-2021/) shows some fast-paced moves up the rankings by fabless semiconductors (from 127th six weeks ago to 5th in terms of six-month relative price performance), security software (45th to 8th), health care services (132nd to 11th), medical research equipment and services (35th to 17th) and design software (162nd to 30th).


**Iron Mountain** ([IRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRM)) showed rare action Tuesday as it cleared a new 46.96 buy point in an 11-week cup-with-handle. Shares rallied 2.3%. Volume jumped 10% above its 50-day average. That's not a tremendous increase. But turnover hit the highest level since Aug. 9.



**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), a Dow 30 stock, succumbed to month-end profit-taking. Shares fell 2% in volume that grew 19% above normal levels. The stock may be poised to test support at the 10-week moving average for the first time since its breakaway gap past 148.05 on June 25. NKE is also wrestling with a possible fourth straight week of declines.


**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is having a sprightly week so far. Shares of the financial payments innovator have jumped 3.7%, which would be the biggest weekly gain since late July. PYPL also lumbered back above its own 10-week line after a recent breakout from a sloppy cup-like base crumbled.

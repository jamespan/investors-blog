title: Stock Market Falls Despite Yellen Debt Ceiling Tout; Solar Stocks Shine

The stock market ended a mixed week on a sour note, even as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made optimistic comments about the debt ceiling. With key retail earnings ahead, investors need to stay engaged.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day 0.4% lower. Still, it ended with a slender 0.4% gain for the week and has moved higher in seven out of the past nine weeks. The tech-heavy index is now up more than 18% for the year.


The benchmark S&P 500 ended well off its lows as it dipped 0.2%. It fell slightly for the week but remains above the 21-day exponential moving average and retained most of its cushion above the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Decliners outnumbered gainers slightly on the NYSE and by less than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume fell, signaling a lack of trading conviction.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped slightly but closed flat. Its weekly dip of 1.1% held a hair above the 10-week line. **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) fared best Friday while **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was the worst laggard.


Small caps gave up slight ground, with the Russell 2000 closing down 0.2%. Growth stocks had the toughest time on Friday, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) reversing 0.5%.


The stock market outlook has changed to "confirmed uptrend" but bad breadth and plenty of potential potholes have concerned investors. As a result, limited 20% to 40% exposure make sense.


Yellen Shares Debt Ceiling Optimism; Key Retail Earnings Ahead

There has been much debate about the debt ceiling and whether the U.S. will eventually default on its debt.


Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sounded bullish when speaking about the subject on the sidelines at a G7 meeting in Japan.


"Our focus is on making sure that Congress does raise the debt ceiling," she told Bloomberg. "I feel that's something we're going to succeed in doing, and we're working hard to make sure that that gets done."


Meanwhile, stocks toiled after the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to a six-month low of 57.7. This was lower than analysts had expected. Given the consumer-driven nature of the U.S. economy, this raises recessionary fears.


Investors should get more insight in the coming week, as monthly retail sales data and earnings reports from **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) are due.

Solar Stocks Shine On Stock Market
----------------------------------


The S&P 500 stock market sectors ended the day mixed, with a slight bias to the positive. Defensive utilities and consumer staples fared best while financials and consumer discretionary struggled.


The performance of the IBD Industry Groups offered further insight for the discerning investor. Transportation equipment makers, grocery giants and alternative energy plays all outperformed.


But solar stocks shined, boosted after the U.S. Treasury released new rules that detailed how solar manufacturers can receive extra tax credits for making products in America. [IBD 50 member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) **Shoals Technologies** ([SHLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHLS)) was among the stocks that popped.


Food wholesalers, generic drugmakers, auto stocks and educational software plays were among the worst performers in Friday's stock market.

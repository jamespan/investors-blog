Stock Market Dives As 10-Year Yield Hits 3%; FAANG Stocks Take A Beating
=========================================================================

The stock market ended sharply lower Tuesday as the 10-year yield hit 3% for the first time in more than four years. Leading growth stocks and FAANG names sold off hard. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite suffered another distribution day, putting the market uptrend under pressure.




The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite slumped 1.7%. The S&P 500 lost 1.3% and the IBD 50 gave back 1.7%. Small caps held up well as the Russell 2000 eased 0.6%. Financial stocks held their own Tuesday, which helped prop up the Russell 2000.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose sharply from Monday's levels. Despite the losses, investors weren't overly fearful. The put-call ratio came in at somewhat tepid 0.99. Readings above 1.15 indicate extreme fear and have been seen at market bottoms in the past.


The [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count is still relatively mild, with two-higher volume declines each for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. That gives the bulls some comfort, although damage in the stock market was widespread Tuesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP042418-192x300.jpg)The so-called FAANG names took a beating as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) ended with losses of around 4% to 5%. After giving up its 200-day moving average Monday, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) extended losses, falling 1.4%.


Leading software names also took heat as **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)), **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) lost support at their 50-day moving average lines.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 confirmed a new uptrend April 10 with bullish gains in higher volume. All gains from the [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) day are now gone.


What To Do Now
--------------


Plenty of damage was done to the stock market Tuesday. That means individual investors should be playing defense, not offense, now that the market outlook has weakened to an uptrend under pressure. Playing defense means raising cash and getting out of the market's way.


That said, decent technical setups are still out there, particularly in certain areas of the financial sector. Several regional banks offer good examples. **Fifth Third Bancorp** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)) gapped above its 50-day moving average on strong earnings. It's only 4% off its high as it works on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 34.67 entry. Other big regional banks are near highs as they work on bases, including **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)), **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) and **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)).

While the regional banks look interesting, the same can't be said for other financials like **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)). All three are entrenched below their 50-day lines amid slack demand.


In the oil space, **BP** ([BP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BP)) cleared a cup-shaped base with a 44.72 entry in heavy volume but ended below the buy point.


10-Year Yield Backs Off
-----------------------


The 10-year yield rose to just over 3% but ended at 2.99%, up 2 basis points. Wall Street is growing increasingly confident that four rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are in store this year, not three that were once expected. The Fed's next meeting is May 1-2 with no rate hike expected at that time. A quarter-point hike is expected at the June 12-13 meeting, to a range of 1.75% to 2%.


Earnings In Focus
-----------------


Meanwhile, earnings reports took center stage again. Results were generally solid, but price action was not. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) beat earnings and sales expectations, but the stock gave up its 200-day moving average, a longer-term support level.


**Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) tried to clear a flat base early in the session but failed in spectacular fashion. There was plenty of good news in the defense contractor's earnings report, but Wall Street was disappointed when the company didn't raise its [cash-flow expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/lockheed-martin-reports-q1-earnings-f35-revenue/). It's a big week for defense earnings. **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)), **Flir Systems** ([FLIR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLIR)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) report Wednesday before the open. **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)) reports Thursday before the open

CLOSE




Dow component **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) also reversed sharply lower on earnings, falling 6% to 144.44.


It's an important week for the market with several high-profile reports in the technology sector due. Will strong earnings reports be enough to fuel a new round of buying? That's a big question mark at this point. Results loom large Wednesday and Thursday from the likes of  Facebook, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), Amazon and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).

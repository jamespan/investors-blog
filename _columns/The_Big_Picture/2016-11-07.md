Major stock indexes rose out of a deep slumber Monday and scored big gains by the close. Volume fell from Friday's levels, and base breakouts were hard to come by, but several growth names tacked on nice gains in heavy volume.


Investors got a hint of strong open Sunday. Futures for the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 and Dow soared after FBI Director James Comey told Congress that a review of new Hillary Clinton emails did not change the agency's decision that Clinton should not be prosecuted.

Several biotechs made big moves but many have been beaten down mercilessly in recent months. Hospital stocks and managed care firms also did well, but both groups rank near the bottom of IBD's 197 industry group rankings.


Advancing stocks swamped decliners on both exchanges by more than 4-to-1.


**FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) jumped 3% to 180.02. It's still in buy range after a breakout Monday from a flat base with a 177.46 entry.


**Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)) gained nearly 3% to 216. It's near the top of a flat base with a 224.17 entry.


**Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) jumped 3% to 62.23. It's working on base with a conventional entry at 63.21.


The star of the day was the IBD 50, up 2.9%. Nearly half the names on the list rose 3% or more.


**Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) reclaimed its 50-day moving average in heavy volume ahead of its earnings report after the close. After finishing the trading day at 1480.33, shares were trading at an all-time high in Monday's after-hours session, up 5% to 1560.


**CommScope** ([COMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COMM)), meanwhile, rose for the third straight session in above-average volume. It's near the top of consolidation that started in June with a conventional entry at 33.19.


After nine straight declines for the S&P 500, Monday's strong gains were good to see. Meanwhile, a screen of stocks with top Composite Ratings up in heavy volume yielded 25 names, the most in some time. That said, the market still has to prove itself for more.


At least part of Monday's strength was due to short-covering by the bears. Once the short-covering runs its course, it's important to watch for fresh signs of institutional buying.


Three strong up days in a row from June 28-30 put the market back in a confirmed uptrend. It amounted to a tradable really before distribution days started to appear in the second half of August.


Investors always need to weight risk vs. reward ahead of a decision to buy a stock. Ask yourself these questions: Is the current market an easy environment to make money in growth stocks? Have breakouts in heavy volume been working? Are leaders acting well? Is it obvious that new institutional money is coming in from the sidelines?


If you answered no to some or all of these questions, it's best to be tread cautiously and wait for uncertainty to subside in the market.

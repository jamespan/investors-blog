  Stocks Trim Gains; Is This Market Pattern Set To Repeat Itself?

The stock indexes reached record highs Monday but pared gains, leaving investors to wonder if the market is already poised to give back ground.




Indexes jumped to a good start in the first 20 minutes, but an afternoon wave of selling reduced the day's gains. A late-afternoon bounce was insufficient. There was no clear explanation for the drop, although the market has gone through similar brief slides many times in the past several months.


At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite labored to gain just 0.1%, leaving the Nasdaq in the lower half of the day's price range.


Small caps led comfortably, with the Russell 2000 leaping nearly 0.7%. The index has been lagging all year, but it has outperformed the Nasdaq every day since Sept. 11, the last time the market rose more than 1%.


If small caps are emerging leaders, they are only catching up to the rest of the market. While the Russell 2000 is up about 6% this year, it's been lapped by the Nasdaq (which has steamed ahead almost 20%) and the S&P 500 (11.8%).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MP091817-194x300.png)Volume fell Monday, which was practically a foregone conclusion after quadruple witching expiration of options and futures caused trading to balloon Friday.


It's hard to be disappointed in the stock market when it's done so well this year. Yet, indexes have tended to pull back soon after they make new highs. While gains have been fruitful, they've occurred in small wavelengths rather than prolonged moves.


That's all good, and it has also kept the Nasdaq from anything worse than a 4.4% pullback. But it has made it somewhat more difficult to make money with stock breakouts. Lacking a sustained market advance, like the one in January and February, stocks have to battle the market's prevailing winds.


Trading rules are essential in these cases. [Cutting losses short at 7% or 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) controls the damage of a wayward stock, and should also keep you in the good stocks that overcome post-breakout troubles. Adding shares when a stock finds support is another way to stick with and nourish a winner.


Of course, there have been plenty of uninterrupted winners. IBD 50 members **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), **Control4** ([CTRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRL)), **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)),Â  **CBOE** ([CBOE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBOE)) and **National Beverage** ([FIZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIZZ)) have hardly encountered serious threats following their respective breakouts.


Even though the Nasdaq lagged, there was plenty of institutional interest in technology leaders. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) followed through from Friday's breakout past 174.66 to stretch an already outstanding advance from March 2016. Fiber optics, networking, chip and other technology industry groups led.



Defense was another popular sector after **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) agreed to acquire rocket manufacturer **Orbital ATK** ([OA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OA)) in a $9.2 billion deal. Orbital shares, well, skyrocketed 20%. Northrop added 3% and rose past a 274.71 buy point.


Utilities, solar energy (the No. 2 industry group), airlines and some medical stocks were underperformers on Monday.


The number of distribution days has whittled down, and there's been only one new one this month. That alone reduces risk, but the more important element is whether the market will continue its pattern of just staying for appetizers at new highs rather than taking part in a full meal.

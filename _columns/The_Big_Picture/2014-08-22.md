Stocks ended mixed in slow trade Friday as the market greeted Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's speech with a yawn.

  

The Nasdaq tacked on 0.1%, while the S&P 500 retreated 0.2%. The IBD 50 strode 0.5% higher.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

Yellen's speech at the annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., repeated themes that she had emphasized before. She said that the recent drop in the unemployment rate overstated the labor market's health. Her interpretation of jobs statistics — taking into account underemployment and a low participation rate — affirmed that she is in no hurry to raise interest rates.

  

The market's yawn suggested that the Fed's stand-pat stance was already priced into stocks.

  

With the Nasdaq up in nine of the past 11 sessions since marking an apparent bottom, individual investors might ask what they can realistically expect from the confirmed uptrend.

  

Here are a few possibilities:

  

First, there are reasons to expect the Nasdaq to continue to lead the S&P 500. The Nasdaq's advantage for the year is small, but take a look at the Stock Spotlight statistics at the top of Page B11.

  

Nasdaq issues that have made the Stock Spotlight screen have done much better than either NYSE stocks in the screen or the S&P 500 over the past 12 months.

  

Also, the Nasdaq has enjoyed sharper run-ups this year than the S&P 500 index. The last run from a mid-April bottom to a July top boosted the Nasdaq and S&P 500 about 14% and 10%, respectively.

  

Even better, the run-ups this year among top-rated stocks are leading the market, as they should. The IBD 50 rose 17% from its mid-April low to its July high.

  

How long can individual investors expect this uptrend to last?

  

This year, the two previous run-ups have been four weeks (February to March) and about 11 weeks (mid-April to July). Considering that the Nasdaq's recent consolidation lasted about five weeks, bulls are hoping for a run on the longer side.

  

A market uptrend provides the right climate for breakouts to work. Further, individual investors who use IBD's ETF Market Strategy have even more reason to care about the indexes. (For more on that, see the box on Page A16.)

  

On Friday, two more stocks with strong to fairly strong Composite Ratings either broke out or added to a recent breakout. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 means the stock is in the top 10 percent.

  

Mall-based retailer **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)), which carries a Composite Rating of 98, on Wednesday cleared a 52.17 buy point in volume 58% above average. On Thursday, the stock added 0.3% in volume 64% above average. If any doubts remained, the stock erased them. On Friday, Foot Locker gapped up for a 3% gain in volume 275% above average. The pattern is stage two.

  

**Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) gapped up out of a second-stage pattern Friday. The stock gained 13% in volume 480% above average. Keurig's Composite Rating is 91, decent but not elite.

  

Gap-up moves out of a base are considered very bullish. This year, a fair number of leaders have gapped up, including **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) in April, **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) in June and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) in July.

  

When Apple broke out April 24, its Composite Rating was 85 at the beginning of the session. Since the April 24 close, the stock has advanced 25%.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 and the S&P 500 each rose 1.7%, while the Nasdaq added 1.6%. The small cap S&P 600 matched the Nasdaq's 1.6% gain.

The stock market reversed higher Thursday amid coronavirus stimulus hopes. The Nasdaq retreated as much as 1% before closing with a modest gain. But while some top stocks are approaching new buy points, growth stocks in general lagged.




The Nasdaq underperformed with a 0.2% rise. The S&P 500 rallied 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also moved up 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 handily outperformed with a nearly 1.7% advance.


Leading growth stocks sharply lagged, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF slid 1.1%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) tumbled 8.1% and 4.3%, respectively.


Volume was modestly lower from Wednesday's session on the Nasdaq and higher on the NYSE.


Stock Market Rally Continues
----------------------------


The Nasdaq remains in a precarious situation after declining six of the last eight trading sessions. All three major indexes are attempting to find support just above their 50-day lines, logical support levels. On Thursday, indexes found some support at the [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).

The lack of a coronavirus stimulus deal continues to weigh on the stock market. But indexes reversed higher Thursday after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled progress on a stimulus deal.


Despite the recent weakness, overall stock market sentiment remains mostly positive. The Nasdaq has just one distribution day since the Sept. 30 follow-through day on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has three distribution days.


Investors should still be building exposure amid a continuing breakouts among top growth stocks. Many stock market leaders — **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) **—** could be putting the finishing touches on new bases. However, some recent breakouts aren't faring very well, indicating the need for some caution.


FANG stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-this-is-most-dangerous-four-letter-word-in-investing/) from a 557.49 buy point in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/) after a short-lived breakout attempt. Top homebuilder **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) triggered the same sell rule Thursday amid a 5% sell-off.


**Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) hit the round-trip sell signal on Wednesday. IPO leader **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) is also nearing a round-trip sell signal after erasing most of an 18% surge past a 167.26 buy point.


On the upside, IBD 50 stock **National Beverage** ([FIZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIZZ)) jumped 1.3%, extending a win streak to five sessions. The stock is about 3% above a 86.37 buy point in a cup base, following a breakout on Oct. 20.

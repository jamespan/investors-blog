Nasdaq Leads Rebound Even As Coronavirus Deaths Rise
=====================================================

Take that, coronavirus!


The numbers for this new contagious and deadly illness continue to grow. It has reportedly now claimed at least 131 lives; some news outlets have totaled the death count at 100. (The SARS epidemic of 2002-03 killed more than 700.) Bloomberg reported China's official count of 2,744 infected. An additional 30,000 residents are apparently under medical observation.




Meanwhile, the government has extended the lunar new year holiday to Feb. 2. Yet the global outbreak did not stop the Nasdaq from leading Tuesday's bargain-hunting expedition.


The composite index gained 1.4%. That reclaimed roughly half of a 2.8% sell-off over the prior two trading sessions. The Nasdaq 100 gained 1.6%, beating advances of 1% by the S&P 500, 0.8% by the S&P SmallCap 600, 0.7% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 0.6% by the Dow Jones transports.


The small cap S&P 600 hopped back above its 50-day moving average, a bullish sign.


What helped the Nasdaq, meanwhile? **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), a 2.8% winner on Tuesday, gained around 1.5% in extended-hours trading on [robust December-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-q1-2020-apple-stock/). The iPhone giant's fiscal Q1 profit of $4.99 a share rose 19% vs. a year ago. Not only did that figure smash the consensus forecast of $4.54 by 45 cents, it also scorched the highest estimate of $4.83 among all analysts surveyed by FactSet. The 19% year-over-year EPS increase also marked the biggest jump in five quarters.


Sales rose 9% to $91.82 billion and marked a third quarter in a row of top-line acceleration — from a 5% drop in the March 2019-ended fiscal second quarter to gains of 1% and 2% in Q3 and Q4 of the latest fiscal year.


Apple's net margin in the quarter rose 50 basis points to 24.2%, the highest in at least four years.



A recent all-time high of 323.33 marks a nearly 46% advance after the $1.4 trillion market-value colossus broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 221.47 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on Sept. 11.


Will The Stock Market Eclipse The Coronavirus With New Highs?

CFRA market strategist Sam Stovall, [speaking at an ETF conference in Florida](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-when-thing-going-peak-coronavirus-grips-stock-gurus/), noted that the S&P 500 rose in the one-, two- and three-month periods following the outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, MERS and the mosquito-borne Zika.


But others such as David Spika, president of GuideStone Capital Management in Dallas, believes the downside risks to the global economy are greater with coronavirus.


"China is much more populous, a much bigger economy, and more important to the global economy than in 2003," Spika told IBD by phone. His firm serves as the advisor to $15 billion in portfolios, including the GuideStone mutual funds. Spika also expressed concern about the fact that the central government is sending staff to manage the situation in Wuhan, which is a key transport hub to every region of China.

One Mild Disappointment
-----------------------


Amid Tuesday's rebound, volume cooled on both main exchanges.


In general, you'd favor major equity indexes rising in higher volume vs. the prior day, not falling.


Meanwhile, how does one monitor the intensity of profit-taking following a substantial market run? You can view it via the prism of the Market Pulse (at left), which shows four [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), or pronounced selling by large funds, in the S&P 500 over the past 25 sessions. The average decline among these four declines is nearly 0.9%.


As the Nasdaq has been leading the rally since Jan. 1, it comes as no surprise that the tech-fortified index also shows a lower distribution-day count.


All in all, this bull market still shows healthy muscle.


The Market Pulse also highlights more than a pocketful of true fundamental leaders making gains of at least 1% in above-average turnover. [In Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) was one of those.



The bedding giant broke out, surpassing an aggressive entry of 89.86 in its [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/); interpret the pattern as a [shallow cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), and you arrive at the same entry point. The [standard buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 92.43, or a dime above the pattern's prior high.

The midcap growth stock also got a few minutes' worth of discussion in [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).)


Beyond The Nasdaq: Pick Growth Stocks In These Areas
----------------------------------------------------


With the market in a confirmed uptrend since Aug. 13, growth stock pickers have likely prospered by fishing in the market's leading pools. Lately, these pools include internet content, business software, consumer spending and retail, and payments and other financial services.


But don't count out the health care sector. With the 2020 presidential election just nine months away, buy-side fund managers are mostly expecting much more volatility in 2020 than, say, the hardly-a-cloud-in-the-sky advance of 2017.


"Health care in the long term is a very important component of an investor's portfolio," Spika of GuideStone Capital Management said. "It has very visible earnings growth, and this works well in periods of market volatility."


Don't choose indiscriminately.


**Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) shows why you don't buy *before* the breakout. The Dow Jones component got hammered with a 5% drop in turnover that spiked 200% above its 50-day moving average.



The drug giant had been slowly rebounding after a big drop in July. But all it was doing was forming a new base. Demand that the stock proves it's under heavy accumulation by mutual funds, banks, pension funds and the like before you deploy hard-earned capital. Pfizer busted below its 50-day moving average on [poor results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-pfizer-earnings-q4-2019/) (Q4 earnings down 13%, sales down 9%). Both declines represented an acceleration in the rate of decline.


Headed into Tuesday's session, the [Medical sector ranked 18th among the 33 sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jan-27-2020/) tracked in the IBD stock tables for mid- and long-term price performance.

Fed Decision Wednesday
----------------------


The Federal Reserve will wrap up its first meeting on interest-rate policy Wednesday. Remarkably, the CME FedWatch survey of futures traders sees a nearly 13% chance that the U.S. central bank will actually raise interest rates by a quarter point. Last year, the Fed slashed the fed funds rate by a quarter point three times, sending the target range to 1.5%-1.75%.


Scoot out to July, and the CME reports a 43.1% chance that the Fed will cut rates by at least a quarter point.


Investors on Tuesday took some profits on U.S. Treasuries, particularly on the long-dated end. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond jumped 4 basis points to 1.65%. Yet for the month, 10-year bond yields have plummeted. They started the year at 1.88%. And now, a mild inversion on the shorter end of the yield curve has returned: 1.57% for three-month T-bills vs. 1.45% for two-year notes.

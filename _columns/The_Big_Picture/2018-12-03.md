Stock market bulls took a victory lap Monday, cheering positive developments in U.S. and China trade talks. Strong gains early for the major stock indexes faded during the day, but buyers came back into the market during the final hour of trading.




A meeting over the weekend between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping ended with the U.S. agreeing to delay for 90 days a planned increase on tariffs imposed on China-made imports valued at $200 billion per year.


Agriculture stocks were some of the day's best performers in the stock market after China agreed to buy more products from U.S. farmers. **Deere & Co.** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) soared nearly 5% to 162.21. It gapped up over a 159.40 entry.


Nasdaq Rallies But Closes Below Key Level
-----------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite ended with a gain of 1.5%. But the blemish to the gain was that the index met with some selling pressure as it approached the 7500 level. The index's 200-day moving average currently sits around 7520. The Nasdaq closed in the upper half of Monday's range, but it ended just below the 50-day moving average.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MP120318-233x300.jpg)The Dow Jones and S&P 500 each added 1.1%, closing bullishly above their 50-day moving averages. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in about 10% lower than Friday's total. Nasdaq turnover was close to Friday's.


The Nasdaq's latest [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) on Nov. 28 is looking better than the prior one. Signs of institutional selling started to appear almost immediately when the Nasdaq surged 2.6% in higher volume on Nov. 7.


Fast-forward to today and the technical health of many high-quality growth stocks looks much better than it did earlier in the month.


Merger Monday
-------------


A couple of mergers made headlines. Biotech **Tesaro** ([TSRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSRO)) vaulted more than 58% on [news it'll be acquired](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesaro-stock-glaxosmithkline-takeover/) by **GlaxoSmithKline** ([GSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSK)) for $5.1 billion.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Nexstar Media** ([NXST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXST)) [jumped nearly 7%](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/nexstar-stock-nexstar-tribune-deal/) on news it's acquiring **Tribune Media** ([TRCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRCO)) for around $4.1 billion. Tribune shares rose almost 12%.


Stock Market Winners
--------------------


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) gapped up close to a 366.85 cup-with-handle buy point but backed off. Shares closed at 358.49, up 2.3%. Auto manufacturers like Tesla were among the day's top performers after President Trump, in a tweet late Sunday night, said that China would drop tariffs on imports of American-made cars.


The risk-on trade was in full force Monday as growth stocks bounced back with vigor. Perhaps nowhere was it more evident than in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) names and IBD 50 members **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) also outperformed with gains of 3% and 5.5%, respectively. Both firms will report earnings Thursday after the close. MKM Partners on Monday reiterated a buy rating on Lululemon and lifted its price target to 177.


**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) gapped above its 50-day moving average and is only 6% off its high. **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) outperformed and is still in buy range from an entry of 68.85. The base also can be interpreted as a double bottom with a 65.92 entry.


**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) are also basing as both stocks approach recent highs.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) jumped 2.6%.


Deere was one of the few legitimate breakouts in Monday's session. Low-volume breakouts came from the likes of **Ingersoll-Rand** ([IR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IR)), **Hill-Rom Holdings** ([HRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRC)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Oil and gas stocks outperformed amid a 4% gain for U.S. crude oil futures to $52.95 a barrel. Machinery and equipment firms along with exploration and production firms were the top gainers in the oil and gas sector. **Chart Industries** ([GTLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLS)) rallied nearly 7% as it tries to reclaim its 50-day moving average. It's also trying to break out over a trend line, found by connecting the stock's recent highs.


The stock market will be closed Wednesday to honor former President George H.W. Bush, who died Friday at age 94.

  Stocks Bounce Ahead Of Key Inflation Data; 4 Market Leaders To Watch

Indexes bounced Thursday as the stock market rally attempt continues. Next, investors will shift their attention to Friday's inflation report.




Early Friday, [Wall Street expects](https://www.investors.com/news/fed-key-inflation-rate-is-set-to-fall-again-so-why-are-treasury-yields-rising-sp-500/) the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index to rise 0.5% from July amid a jump in gasoline prices. That would lift the 12-month PCE inflation rate to 3.5%, from 3.3% the prior month.


Yet Federal Reserve decision-making puts more weight on core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. The good news is that the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, the core PCE price index, is expected to show a modest 0.2% increase for August. The 12-month core inflation rate should slip to 3.9%, the lowest level since September 2021, from 4.2% in July.


The 10-year Treasury yield reversed after hitting a new long-term high Thursday, ticking lower to 4.59%.


As the stock market correction lingers, [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) **NOV** ([NOV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOV)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) are stocks to watch in [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?).


Economic Data, Earnings
-----------------------


The Labor Department's first-time jobless claims rose less than expected, up to 204,000 vs. 201,000 in the previous week. They were expected to rise to 211,000.


![MarketPulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP092823-300x297.jpg)Meanwhile, the final estimate of second-quarter GDP held steady at 2.1%. It was expected to rise to 2.3% vs. 2.1% in the second estimate. Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.8%, lower than the 1.7% estimate, a good sign for inflation.


Key earnings movers Thursday included **Micron Technologies** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)), **Jabil** ([JBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBL)) and **Jefferies** ([JEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JEF)).


Micron slid 4.4% after the [company reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mu-stock-micron-stock-micron-earnings-fiscal-q4-2023/) fiscal fourth-quarter profit and revenue that topped analyst estimates. But the company's outlook came in mixed as pricing slowly stabilizes.


CarMax plunged more than 13% on [Q2 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/carmax-stock-carmax-earnings-used-car-prices-threat/). [Jabil stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jbl-stock-jabil-earnings-q4-report/) surged almost 19%, while Jefferies shares reversed from sharp losses to rally nearly 2%.


Meanwhile, **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) reported mixed earnings results after the close Thursday. Nike shares rose nearly 2% in extended trade. NKE stock finished Thursday more than 30% off its 52-week high.

What To Do Now
--------------


A new stock market rally attempt started Wednesday with modest gains on the Nasdaq and S&P 500. That means a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) could occur as soon as Monday, the fourth day of the rally attempt.


With the stock market in a correction, IBD recommends an exposure level of 0%-20%. And now is the perfect time to create watchlists of stock market leaders.


One way to do this is by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Keep an eye on stock charts in which the line is trending upward, which means the stock is outperforming the S&P.


The RS line is in all IBD charts and [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). In addition, the [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/) includes a list of top-rated stocks with lines at new highs. MarketSmith also has the ["RS Blue Line Dot" list](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/), which screens for RS lines at new highs.


Two useful [MarketSmith lists](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) to check right now are "Breaking Out Today" and "Near Pivot." The latter shows stocks nearing buy points in bases, and the other flags stocks rising past buy points during the session.

Stock Market Leaders: Nov, Meta, Arista, Okta
---------------------------------------------



With the market still in a correction, investors should keep a watchlist of stocks that are trying to hold up in the ongoing weakness. These stocks will be forming bases during weak environments, such as these:


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock NOV bullishly regained a 20.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) during Wednesday's session, per [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Social media giant Meta Platforms continues to trace a base with a 326.20 buy point. An aggressive entry can be seen at 312.87. Shares bullishly regained their 50-day line Thursday during the session's 2.1% advance.


Arista Networks is finding support at its 50-day line. A decisive bounce would place the leader in a new buy area, though investors should hold off on purchases while the market struggles. Bullishly, the RS line remains near its highs.


Cybersecurity leader Okta is building a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a 90.73 buy point. Okta was [Wednesday's pick for IBD 50 Growth Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/okta-stock-cybersecurity-leader-forges-new-buy-point-amid-path-to-profitability/).

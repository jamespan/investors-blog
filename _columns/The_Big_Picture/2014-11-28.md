For a post-holiday session that was expected to be quiet, the oil patch made one heck of a ruckus in the stock market Friday.


The indexes' final numbers seemed to point to a calm day. The Nasdaq added 0.1%, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.3%.


Volume ran higher on a same-time basis, but was of course lower for the day. Friday was a shortened session because of the holiday.


The ruckus, though, appeared in sectors reacting to Friday's dramatic drop in oil prices.


The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil skidded 10% and Brent 3%, making losers and winners out of a number of stocks. Oil stocks plunged. Railroads, which lose to trucks when oil prices are low, also dived. Some rail stocks in the oil-shipping business were affected too.


Meanwhile, retail stocks benefited on the prospects for lower gasoline prices and more cash in the pockets of consumers. Airlines and truckers also perked up on the fuel-cost outlook.


In a way, though, none of this was much of a surprise.


WTI oil prices are 31% off their June high, which is bear-market territory for crude, and oil has been off 20% or more for weeks. The Nasdaq has risen 10% since oil's June peak, while the oil-rich NYSE composite is basically back where it was at that time in June.


For IBD-style investors, the key low on the Nasdaq was notched intraday Oct. 15. The Nasdaq has gained 17% since then.


A look at the stock market in mid-October vs. now shows how things have changed.


•In mid-October, utilities were making the most new highs. Now retail and real estate have grabbed the top spot the most times since mid-October.


•The portion of NYSE stocks above the 200-day line was 28% in mid-October. The gauge was above 50% all of November.


•In mid-October, conservative sectors such as food, utilities, insurance and office supplies held four of the top 10 slots. Now the newcomers to the top 10 include more growth-oriented sectors — chips, computers and retail.


The shift to a more aggressive leadership hasn't been fast and dramatic. Yet there appears to be a steady shift underway.


News also has been friendlier to the bulls. In recent weeks, third-quarter GDP was revised up; consumer borrowing is trending higher in America; China and the U.S. reached a pact to ax tariffs on technology goods; and the Nasdaq is now outperforming year to date every nation except India.

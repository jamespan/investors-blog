  Stock Market Withstands Fed Surprise, Hits New Highs; This Is A Sign Of Confidence

The stock market rallied on cooler inflation data Wednesday and held most gains even after the Fed trimmed its forecast for rate cuts. A smattering of stocks climbed past buy points as the market grows more confident.




Indexes opened higher after the May consumer price index was flat on the month and up a milder-than-expected 3.4% on yearly basis. Core prices, which exclude food and energy costs, were basically in line with forecasts.


The stock market held gains of more than 1% through the Fed's policy statement at 2 p.m. ET and Chair Jerome Powell's press briefing. Indexes held up even when the Fed forecast [only one rate cut this year](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cut-forecast-fed-chair-powell/).


It was impressive that the market didn't give back much gains when the Fed's "dot-plot" rate expectations went down from three rate cuts in March. Indexes did come down in late trading, after Powell concluded remarks, but still finished broadly higher.


The Nasdaq closed 1.5% higher and had been up more than 2% before it pulled back in the final half-hour of trading. The S&P 500 rose nearly 0.9% after sellers swarmed in the final 30 minutes.


Small caps, which tend to be more sensitive to interest rates, also led. The Russell 2000 rose 1.6% but halved a 3.2% morning burst. The index, nonetheless, closed back above the 50-day moving average.


But the Dow Jones Industrial Average had a tenuous hold on opening gains all day and was left teetering on its 50-day moving average. The index reversed lower to close with a 0.1% loss as eight of the 30 components fell.


Dow Underperforms Stock Market
------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP061224-186x300.jpg)Of note in the Dow, **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) closed below its 50-day moving average for a second straight day. It could have been worse for the Dow, if not for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). The stock added nearly 3% and its 10.3% two-day rally is the best since November 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Apple broke out past a 199.62 buy point Tuesday and is now extended. Preliminary volume was 193.8 million shares, the most since Dec. 17, 2021.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE from Tuesday. It was only the second day that NYSE volume is above average this month. So far in June, Nasdaq volume has run below average, despite solid index gains. Advancers led decliners by a 7-4 ratio on the Nasdaq and by 5-to-2 on the NYSE.


The IBD 50 index rose 1.5%, aided by technology **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), consumer **Hims & Hers** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)), **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) and industrials **Powell Industries** ([POWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWL)), **Aspen Aerogels** ([ASPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASPN)).


The mild consumer price index sent bond prices lower.Â The 10-year Treasury yield fell 11 basis points to 4.294%. Interest rate-sensitive stocks outperformed, including housing-related industry groups, auto dealers, regional banks and consumer lenders. Those groups climbed 4% or more Wednesday.


With Wednesday's jump to new highs, the Nasdaq was able to shed its May 16, 23 and 30 [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). The index climbed more than 5% from the close of those bearish days. The S&P 500's stalling day on May 7 also dropped off the count because 25 sessions have passed since then.


Stock Market Sees More Breakouts
--------------------------------


Perhaps most encouraging for the stock market was the number of high-rated stocks that broke out of bases Wednesday, seemingly ending a relative drought of breakouts in the past couple of weeks.


**Element Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)) broke out of a flat base after the industrial chemicals company raised its full-year earnings forecast.


Chip equipment makers **ASML Holding** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) broke out as well.


ASML broke out of a cup base with a 1,056.34 buy point, although volume was weak. Its relative strength line has a blue dot on the [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) weekly chart, denoting new highs amid the breakout. Lam jumped past a flat-base 1,007.39 buy point.


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) cleared a 194.84 buy point in heavy volume. The maker of high-resolution video displays broke above a trend line around 181 last week.


With indexes extending gains and more top stocks joining the uptrend, there's plenty of reason to continue with IBD's recommended exposure level of 80% to 100%.

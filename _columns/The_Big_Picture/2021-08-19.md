The Nasdaq and S&P 500 staged bullish upside reversals Thursday after opening with moderate losses. Despite this week's stock market volatility, top growth stocks **Mercado Libre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are near new buy points.




At the stock market open Thursday, the major stock indexes looked to extend Wednesday's losses from the release of July's Fed minutes. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 turned higher in midday trade, although off their session highs. The Nasdaq closed 0.1% higher, while the S&P 500 also moved up 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slashed losses, but still fell 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 1.2%, extending a losing streak to six sessions. The small-cap index is at its long-term 200-day moving average.


On the downside, leading growth stocks showed moderate losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 1% Thursday. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) advanced 4%, continuing its strong rebound from the 50-day moving average.


![MP081921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP081921-248x300.jpg)Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and appeared to be sharply higher on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The Nasdaq snapped a three-day losing streak Thursday, as it won a key first battle for support at the critical 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq's bullish reversal could mean the recent selling is finished, but that's not a certainty at this point. The S&P 500 halted its decline just above its 50-day line.


The market's [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count has improved so far this week despite this week's market volatility. Last week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended with distribution-day counts of five and four, respectively. The Nasdaq's July 15 distribution day was removed from the count Thursday due to the passage of time. With that, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both have three days of institutional selling in the past several weeks.


The market trend remains in a confirmed uptrend. While some leading growth stocks have suffered some chart damage, others are setting up and approaching new entries, like chip giant **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). Investors should be patiently looking for new breakouts among stock market leaders.


Stock Market Earnings: Applied Materials
----------------------------------------


**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) reported [fiscal-Q3 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amat-stock-applied-materials-blows-past-quarterly-targets/) late Thursday, beating the Street's earnings and sales estimates. The company also provided bullish guidance in the current quarter. The chip giant closed up 1.4% Thursday, ending about 12% away from a 146.10 buy point in a [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).


But shares dipped in extended trade.

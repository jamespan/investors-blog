Small caps led the U.S. stock indexes Friday, but the Nasdaq stepped down for the first time in six sessions.




 The Nasdaq fell 0.2%, while the S&P 500 inched up less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 0.4% gain. Indexes started paring gains in early afternoon trading.


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq and NYSE. [Distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) was avoided Friday because volume was insufficient on the Nasdaq.


The major indexes have avoided distribution since the Feb. 14 follow-through day, which confirmed that a market uptrend was underway. Distribution involves a loss in rising volume and is a sign of institutional selling.


At this point, institutions appear more willing to either hold or buy shares than to sell into market strength.

What History Says About Win Streaks
-----------------------------------


With the S&P 500 now up six sessions in a row, individual investors might wonder what historically has happened after a six-day thrust.


Since 1981, not including the current market, there have been five instances when the S&P 500 rose six sessions in a row.


What happened next?


Over the next three to 10 sessions, the S&P 500 typically fell 1% to 1.7%.


In a broader sense, a glance at the charts in the five instances showed the S&P 500 rising over the coming months in two cases, moving in a rolling sideways fashion in two cases, and a choppy descent in one case.


Breakouts Friday
----------------


Meanwhile, a handful of stocks broke out Friday, according to [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com)'s pattern recognition technology.

They included software firm **Mulesoft** ([MULE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MULE)), up 18%; software provider **BlackLine** ([BL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BL)), up 12.5%; network infrastructure services provider **VeriSign** ([VRSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRSN)), up 3.6%; tech outsourcer **Syntel** ([SYNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNT)), up 4.5%; and Brazil-based payment processor **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), up 4.4%.


Is Brazil Rebounding?
---------------------


Long-troubled Brazil has received good news recently. Bloomberg reported that **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are stepping up exposure in Brazil on signs of improvement. Also, Brazil finance officials expect Brazil's GDP to grow 3% in 2018.


The coming week looks like a slow time for data. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will report the minutes from its Jan. 30-31 meeting.


The U.S. market will be closed Monday for Presidents Day, and will reopen Tuesday.

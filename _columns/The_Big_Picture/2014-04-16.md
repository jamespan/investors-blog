Stocks enjoyed broad-based gains Wednesday but the number of both impressive breakouts and new highs was underwhelming.


Volume fell on both major exchanges, another indication that demand for stocks is hardly robust.


The Nasdaq composite, still rich in tech, medical and retail-oriented stocks, gained 1.3% and closed a hair below the session's high. The third straight gain boosted the index further above its rising 200-day moving average (not shown in the chart on this page).


Numerous industry groups that house Nasdaq issues acted well. Energy-Solar, Leisure-Travel Booking, Computer Software-Medical, Internet-Content and Medical-Generic Drugs all jumped more than 2% for the day.


After hours, Internet content giant **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) traded sharply lower after its first-quarter earnings fell short of the consensus view. Google saw lower ad rates and reported declining profit margin. Revenue, however, grew 19%, exceeding gains of 12% and 17% in the prior two quarters.


The S&P 500 rose nearly 1.1% and finished practically at session highs for a second straight day.


Other popular market gauges did well. The NYSE composite also made it three gains in a row, up 1%, and is just 1.5% below an all-time high of 10,669. The Dow transports rallied 1.7%.


Generally positive comments from the Federal Reserve's latest beige book showed that the economy continues to grow moderately. Specifically, "economic growth had picked up" in Chicago and "rebounded from weather-related slowdowns" in New York and Philadelphia.


Right now, you can expect institutional investors to be more interested in how companies report quarterly results and whether they revise next-quarter forecasts. A large contingent of firms will give results Thursday, including **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **PPG Industries** ([PPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PPG)) and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)).


Among these names, GE has the worst Composite Rating (a 36). However, its weekly chart shows stubborn support along its 40-week moving average. An expected 9% drop in Q1 profit is not inspiring, especially after Q4 profit growth of 20% was the best in years. The dividend yield is 3.4%.


Many leaders are carving the left side of bases. This means no buy point is in sight. Have patience. A stock should not be bought until the market follows through and leading stocks break out of complete bases in big volume.


At Tuesday's intraday low, the Nasdaq fell as much as 9.7% below its recent peak of 4371. In stock-market speak, an intermediate correction is a term used to classify those declines that exceed 10% but fall short of 20%, reserved for bear markets.


It's key to monitor sector leadership now. Auto is No. 1, with a 12.9% year-to-date gain.

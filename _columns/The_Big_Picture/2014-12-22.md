Stocks edged higher for a fourth straight session Monday, bringing a positive start to a holiday-shortened trading week.


The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to a new closing high. It's just about a point away from its Dec. 5 all-time high.


Helped by strength in chip stocks, the Nasdaq climbed 0.3%. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rallied 1.5%.


The Dow Jones industrial average outperformed with a 0.9% gain, thanks primarily to **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)). The blue-chip index also scored a fresh closing high.


The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.5% to a five-month high.


Volume on both major exchanges dropped off sharply from Friday's pace. That wasn't a surprise after quadruple witching on Friday. Still, the Nasdaq had its slowest day since Nov. 28.


Trading was also soft as the market looked ahead to Wednesday's half session and Thursday's Christmas holiday. The Christmas week tends to be the lightest or one of the lightest trading weeks of the year, because many traders take time off.


So it's a good idea to keep your powder dry at least for the remainder of what's looking to be a third triple-digit year for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Both are in their longest stretch of double-digit wins since 1995 to 1999.


Thanks to the Fed, which last week signaled that it would be patient about raising interest rates, stocks have snapped back. But without a follow-through day, the market technically remains in a correction. Investors could use this time to update watch lists to prepare for a potential shift in the market outlook.


Stocks breaking out from bases are primary targets. On Friday, **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) cleared a flat base, but it hasn't been able to close above the 238.87 buy point.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) cleared an 81.26 buy point from a flat base Monday, but volume was lackluster.


**Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) showed good action by bouncing off its 50-day line in slightly above-average volume.


Thinly traded stocks **WageWorks** ([WAGE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAGE)) and **Constant Contact** ([CTCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTCT)) also tried to break out from bases.


Turnover was huge in biotech **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)). It sold off on news that **Express Scripts** ([ESRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESRX)) dropped coverage of its hepatitis C drugs in favor of a cheaper alternative from **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)). (See story on Page A1.)


**Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) also fell in above-average trade. But both ended well off their session lows.


Biotechs weighed on the IBD 50, which fell 0.5%.

The stock market held near all-time highs Monday as modest losses reinforced a mixed prognosis for Wall Street.




The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite climbed in 16 of the past 18 weeks and are off to a roaring start for the year. It makes you wonder if the party is ready to wind down. Yet indexes show no major stress, so far.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 just had their best first two months of the year since 2019. It's also the best start for an election year since 2012, according to Dow Jones Market Data. And the Nasdaq, up more than 7% so far in 2024, had the best first two months since 2023 and its best election-year start since 2012.


From the stock market lows in October, the Nasdaq is up nearly 30% and the S&P 500 is up about 25%. Such momentum is difficult to stop, history shows.


Whenever the S&P climbs in November, December, January and February — it's happened 17 times since 1927 — the index posts above-average gains three to 12 months later, according to Ned Davis Research.


"Ten months later, which would take the market through year-end, the S&P 500 has risen 16 of 16 times by a median of 14.6%," the firm wrote in a report Monday. The report was authored by Ned Davis' chief U.S. strategist, Ed Clissold, and research analyst London Stockton.


Stock Market Performance By Market Cap
--------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP030424_2.jpg)Still, performance in 2024 has depended largely on capitalization size. Year to date, the small-cap Russell 2000 is up 2.5%. The S&P Midcap 400 is up 5.4%.


The S&P 500 is up nearly 8%, and the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF has climbed 4.1%. The Vanguard Mega Cap ETF ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)) has jumped 8.4% while MicroSectors FANG+ ([FNGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNGS)) — a proxy for FAANG and [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) — has rallied more than 14%.


On Monday, a rush of selling in the final half-hour of trading sent stocks near session lows. The Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 lost 0.1% and the Dow slipped less than 0.3%. The Russell 2000 reversed lower 0.1%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, which resulted in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the Nasdaq. That's five for the composite in the past five weeks, which suggests institutions are selling into strength.


The [IBD 50 index](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), however, outperformed with a 0.2% increase — good for another 23-month high.


3 Ways To Gauge Market Health
-----------------------------


With indexes well into four-month uptrends, investors can gauge market health with moving averages, breadth and breakouts.



The Nasdaq closed Monday more than 5% above its 50-day moving average; the S&P is nearly 5% above its 50-day line. Those gaps must be tempting sellers, although the stock market has withstood even higher gaps this year.


In terms of breadth, the advance-decline line of the NYSE is trending higher. The Nasdaq A/D line has been flat since about mid-January.


Also since mid-January, the 10-day moving average of NYSE and Nasdaq stocks at new highs has been rising. Generally, the gap has been more bullish among NYSE stocks.


The number of [52-week highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-mar-01-2024/) continues to dwarf 52-week lows. IBD's tally, which excludes stocks with EPS Ratings below 60, is at one of the most bullish levels of the past year.


In terms of breakouts, don't expect anything dramatic from giants such as **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). Those buy points came and went months ago.


The more recent breakouts include smaller institutional-quality companies. That includes techs such as **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)), **Garmin** ([GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)), **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)), **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **Sterling Infrastructure** ([STRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRL)), **JFrog** ([FROG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FROG)) and **Masco** ([MAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAS)).


Stock Market Events This Week
-----------------------------


The stock market has a few sensitive events on its calendar this week.


Wednesday and Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gives testimony to House and Senate committees. These are the types of public pronouncements that can give hints on Fed thinking and, perhaps, move financial markets.


Earnings reports from a number of important retailers are also due this week. **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)), **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)), **Gap** ([GPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPS)), **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) and others will give the stock market a broad view into consumer spending.


On Friday, the February employment report is sure to get pinned on the Fed's bulletin board.

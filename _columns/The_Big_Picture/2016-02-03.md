Numerous big-cap techs got the cold shoulder Wednesday, but the rest of the stock market appeared to piggyback the rebound in another beleaguered financial asset, crude oil.


Wednesday's general market upside, however, still presented few breakout opportunities for the disciplined growth investor. The market's daily gyrations also should give one reason to carry a cautious stance even though the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend.


The S&P 500 rallied from a steep early decline of 1.6% to finish 0.5% higher. That's a pretty positive swing, especially given that volume on the NYSE increased sharply.

A 3% rebound in crude oil futures helped not only the S&P 500 rally. The NYSE composite gained 0.9%; the Dow Jones industrials ramped 1.1% higher as it too got a boost from its commodity and industrial names, including **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), all of which rose 3% to 5%. But only 3M shows a respectable RS Rating at 72.


The Nasdaq got tagged with a third distribution day since its Jan. 26 follow-through, falling 0.3% as volume climbed. Big losses by **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) weighed on the composite index. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.5%. Granted, all three of these household tech names boast fantastic, highly profitable businesses. They've all roared higher since the bull market accelerated in 2013.


Yet today, defensive stocks seem to have the edge.


On Tuesday, four of the top six were utilities; the other two were food-related. You'd have to scour the top 20 to find true growth industries leading the way.


The Dow utility average, up 1.3% Wednesday, is scorching the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 with a year-to-date gain of 8.4%. The Nasdaq is down more than 10%; the S&P 500 is off by 6.4%.


Breakouts, the ultimate test of a rally's resilience, are still hard to find. Banking transactions expert **Jack Henry** ([JKHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKHY)), diabetes giant **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) have all round-tripped back to the latest buy points. Meanwhile, the Sector Leaders list remains scrawny, with just two names making the cut for the past several weeks. A third one showed up in today's list.


So, is there anything positive? Yes. Pessimism still prevails. The uncertainty over China's economy, Brazil, oil and the U.S. presidential election are all weighing on traders. Bullishness in the latest Investors Intelligence poll rose to 34%, still below the bears at 38.1%.

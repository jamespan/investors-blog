The stock market hit new lows in its correction Monday, but also made an impressive rebound that left indexes with their first gains in five sessions.




Index losses of more than 3% vanished and turned into moderate gains by the close. None was more impressive than the Russell 2000.


The index was off 2.8% at midday Monday and fell as much as 21.4% from its Nov. 8 peak. A decline of more than 20% is commonly understood to be a bear market, making the small-cap benchmark the first to reach that dubious distinction in the current downward cycle.


But just as that happened, the Russell 2000 made a positive price reversal. It closed 2.3% higher, the best performance by a major index Monday. That's a 5.3% swing from the day's low.

The Nasdaq composite plunged as much as 4.9% before closing 0.6% higher. The S&P 500 transformed a 4% loss into a 0.3% gain. Volume swelled on the NYSE and Nasdaq from Friday's totals, which were already inflated by the expiration of weekly and monthly stock and index options.


For the first time in five sessions, indexes did not close near session lows. Still, both the NYSE and Nasdaq are below their [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/), and IBD's market outlook remains "market in correction."


Stock Market Selling Looks Overdone
-----------------------------------


The stock market often turns just when everybody is wiping their hands clean of equities. Could this be the correction's low? One factor will be how the major indexes trade in the next several days. An attempted rally could result in a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) before the week is out.


Don't get too hopeful, though. Remember, two weeks ago the stock market appeared to be rebounding. But a few days later indexes started a new leg down.


For now, a relief rally could be in play, if not something more lasting. [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and IBD Swing Trader loaded up on leveraged index ETFs Monday afternoon.


The Cboe Market Volatility S&P 500 index [soared to the highest level since October 2020](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility). Extreme investor fear in the VIX like this can be interpreted as at least a short-term market bottom.


In another sign of extreme fear (and possible market low), the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) jumped to 1.08, the highest in at least 10 months.


Stock Market Risks In Fed, Russia, Earnings
-------------------------------------------


Getting the stock market to rebound will be difficult in a week with some potentially troublesome headlines.


On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will release its new policy statement. The Fed is taking a hawkish stance against inflation, and investors will be watching for the timing of the first interest-rate hike. The Fed also is quickly unwinding its bond purchases, saying there's no longer a need for that stimulus.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased to 1.73% after coming off early lows near 1.71%.

Microsoft shares fell below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/) for the first time since March 2020 but closed back above it.


Geopolitical pressures also have the stock market on edge. The U.S. put [hundreds of troops on standby](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nato-to-send-ships-jet-fighters-to-eastern-europe-amid-standoff-with-russia-11643026393?mod=hp_lead_pos6) for possible deployment to Eastern Europe, while NATO sends military assets to the region. Russia is threatening to invade Ukraine. The U.S. State Department [told families of U.S. diplomats in Ukraine to leave the country](https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-department-tells-families-of-u-s-diplomats-in-ukraine-to-leave-11642983133?mod=hp_lead_pos2). Some embassy staff members also were ordered to leave.


IBD 50 Also Reverses Up
-----------------------


The IBD 50, also down sharply in midday trading, rebounded to close 0.2% higher.


Although this is a premier list of growth stocks, most are in sad shape, below their 50-day or even 200-day lines. A number of new stocks bumped off weaker stocks in the IBD 50. But the new entries don't wow. **Sotera Health** ([SHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHC)), **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) and **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)) are far from offering [proper entries](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


But **Silicon Motion** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) appears to be finding support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) ahead of Thursday's earnings report.


Monday's market reversals offer some hope. So be prepared. Your watchlist should be updated with ideas offered in Investors.com, [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=icmhpbrdcstmsg|cms|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|707596&src=A00387A), [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and other resources. Stocks holding up better the past couple of weeks deserve attention; they could be the first leaders of the next market uptrend.

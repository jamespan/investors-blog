Oil Stocks Reverse Lower In Another Wide Sell-Off; Here's Why Small Caps May Win In 2022
=========================================================================================

Oil stocks got an initial pop on news that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to move into Eastern Ukraine. And early-Tuesday futures indicated Wall Street would become a bloodbath of selling after the three-day Presidents Day Weekend.




For sure, Tuesday saw another wave of broad-based declines. But an afternoon round of bargain-hunting took some sting off the overall fall.


The Nasdaq registered its fourth straight loss and its sixth in seven sessions. A 1.2% drop marks the sixth time in which the tech-heavy composite index fell 1% or more in the month of February alone. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), off 1%, came within 20 cents of taking out its year-to-date low of 334.15, set on Jan. 24.


Those two indexes' declines were in large part commensurate with other key benchmarks.


The S&P 500 lost 1%, pulling its year-to-date loss to 9.8%. At one point, the S&P 500 slid as much as 11.4% below its all-time peak of 4818. That alone signals Wall Street is in an intermediate-style correction.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.4%. That almost matched a nearly 1.5% bloodletting in the Russell 2000.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) shed 1.6%, worsening its 2022 loss to 20%.


Oil Stocks Today
----------------



Meanwhile, top oil stocks **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) (featured at length in [Friday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live)), **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) and **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) reversed badly Tuesday. All three still boast marvelous gains since Jan. 1. And Tuesday's losses probably won't put much of a dent into their swell-looking relative strength lines.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP022222-209x300.jpg)However, as highlighted in [Tuesday's IBD Live episode](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), a careful look at some of the charts of leading IBD industry groups in the oil patch indicate that this trio and other leaders may need to catch their breath.


[On MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), for instance, please go to the oil and gas drilling industry group, whose chart has the ticker symbol G1381. You could draw a mildly upward-sloping trendline from the 135.64 peak of June 23, connecting a higher high on Oct. 18 and another higher high on Feb. 16 of this year. Since then, the oil drillers have cooled off.


One could do a similar trendline analysis with G1310, which is the price-weighted index of the U.S. oil and gas exploration group.


U.S. crude oil futures added 1.4% to $92.35 a barrel.


A Contrarian View On Small Caps?
--------------------------------


Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, is still positive on U.S. equities for the year. One reason: His team believes the economy will continue to grow, even though the futures market is currently pricing in as many as six to seven hikes in short-term interest rates to the tune of a quarter point each.


Schutte also sees small caps having an edge over large caps, particularly from the vantage point of the S&P SmallCap 600. (On MarketSmith, the chart is updated every 24 hours on MarketSmith at zero-S&P6.)


According to his research, stocks in the S&P 600 are now trading at 13.5 times expected 2022 earnings. That compares favorably with the S&P 500, which trades 20 times 2022 forecasts for operating profits.


Put another way, investors in the S&P SmallCap 600 could be getting a 7.5% earnings yield vs. a 5% earnings yield for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond dipped to 1.94% on Tuesday.


"I don't see a recession in 2022. We still think inflation is transitory since it is tied largely to the effects of Covid-19 on the supply chain. As this alleviates, you'll see the rate of inflation go lower," Schutte told IBD in an interview. Northwestern Mutual has $245 billion in assets under management.


Goods Inflation Vs. Services Inflation
--------------------------------------


"You've seen goods spending up 15% since pre-pandemic, while services have declined 0.3%. But you'll see a push toward services spending, and the last two U.S. GDP reports showed this reversion in services spending," Schutte said. He added that high inflation data lately has reflected a strong buildup in inventories.


The NFIB survey of small businesses, meanwhile, shows that satisfaction over current inventory levels has grown.


Schutte also points out that the Federal Reserve has more or less shown that it actually has a third mandate: Pay attention to the stock market. He thinks the Fed will continue to act cautiously to avoid going too far in raising the cost of money to a level that would lead to a disastrous market reaction.


"The Fed's No. 1 mandate is employment and inclusive employment growth. It used to be inflation. Not anymore," Schutte said. "Fed Chair Powell has opened every public appearance with comments on job growth. This is not 1980," referring to the era in which then Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker jacked interest rates sky-high to slay raging inflation.

Market Not In Correction?
-------------------------


IBD readers may be wondering why IBD has not switched the current outlook back to "correction" in recent days. And make no mistake, there are plenty of reasons to make such a switch.


After all, the Nasdaq picked up yet another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or session of pronounced professional selling, on Tuesday. On that exchange, volume picked up 8% to 4.81 billion shares vs. Friday's rather tame levels, despite that session being one in which monthly and weekly equity and index options expired.


Clearly, since November, key indexes have settled into a near-term downtrend. This means we're hitting lower highs and lower lows. Meanwhile, breakout stocks among even the top-performing industries of the day — oil and gas, metals, agriculture — have recently shown sluggish action at best. Most of the true market leaders are well below their 50-day moving averages and need a lot of time to finish [good bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


As noted in [Friday's The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-falls-sharply-again-will-palantir-technologies-take-out-its-ipo-price/) and other stories over the past few weeks, cash is, for most investors, the best position for the portfolio. And a heavy component of cash means that the market is more or less in a correction state. But another way to view the action: Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have yet to take out the late January low in this still-nascent rally attempt.


Until this actually happens, technically the confirmed rally is still alive, albeit barely.


As noted earlier, the QQQ ETF came awfully close to taking out its Jan. 24 low.



But in contrast, the Invesco S&P Equal Weighted Index ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund would have to sink an additional 2.5% to undercut its Jan. 24 low of 148.16. Possible? Absolutely.


That ETF removes much of the bias seen within the S&P 500 caused by the huge growth of FAANG and other tech firms within that benchmark.

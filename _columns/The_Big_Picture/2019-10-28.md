S&P 500 Climbs To Record High As Microsoft, Alphabet Break Out
===============================================================

After barely missing out on a record high Friday, the S&P 500 made it official Monday, while more top-rated stocks joined the stock market uptrend.




The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to close above its previous all-time high of 3027.98, set on July 26. The index closed near session highs in its fourth consecutive gain. The S&P 500 is getting more comfortable above the psychological 3000 level and the 50-day moving average.


Breakouts for **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) gave the stock market a couple of megacap breakouts. Alphabet shares fell after the close on an earnings miss. Still, Alphabet stock traded around 1,270 in extended hours, near the 1,268.49 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of the breakout.


Microsoft broke out past the 142.47 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) on news that it [won a major Pentagon contract](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/microsoft-stock-break-out-jedi-contract-win/).

The current market uptrend has its roots in an Aug. 13 [follow-through.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) (Read [the Aug. 13 Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bulls-get-third-major-buy-signal-this-year-why/) for more details on why this flagged a potential new rally.)


The Philadelphia semiconductor index made a new high also, up 1.75%. An expanding rally in chips also is contributing to the tech-heavy Nasdaq's outperformance. Up 4.1% so far in October, it is doubling the S&P 500's monthly performance.


The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](http://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis) added 0.5%. Small caps continued a solid month for October, with the Russell 2000 up 0.9%. Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE as well.


S&P 500 Loses Distribution Days
-------------------------------


The market's push to new highs is making irrelevant some [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). On the S&P 500, the Oct. 2 and 8 distribution days are now too low from current levels to matter anymore. The same goes for the Nasdaq's Oct. 1 distribution.


IPOs are perking up after a lackluster summer for new issues. The Renaissance IPO ETF ([IPO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPO)) rose 2.7%, regaining the 50-day moving average for the first time since Aug. 8. Three stocks among its top holdings — **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)), **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) and **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) — made strong moves Monday.


**Federal Signal** ([FSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSS)) — a maker of public safety and maintenance vehicles that's been in IBD screens this month — broke out of a flat base in heavy volume. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) rose past a 140.72 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) but closed below it.


No doubt, the market uptrend is providing opportunities for growth investors. But in some ways, this is a changed stock market.


Many of the software and consumer stocks that led earlier this year are ceding leadership. During Monday trading, the Software sector ranked [No. 21 out of 33 IBD sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-oct-25-2019/). In their place, industrial, transportation and chip stocks are emerging as new leaders. Those are areas investors need to watch.


Industrial, Transportation Stocks Emerge
----------------------------------------


Look at the most successful breakouts among top-rated stocks the past few weeks, and you'll notice factories and construction companies.


**Avery** **Dennison** ([AVY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVY)), the packaging and industrial products maker, is 6% above last week's breakout at 120.75. **Universal Forest Products** ([UFPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UFPI)) vaulted nearly 20% from its earnings breakout Thursday.



Heavy equipment supplier **H&E Equipment Services** ([HEES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEES)) is nearly 20% above its 29.67 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)), another heavy equipment company, is up 7% from its 39.10 entry.


In the transportation sector, auto and RV stocks have stood out. **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) made a 20% surge from its 40.71 buy point in little more than a week. Car dealer **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) soared Wednesday after strong earnings and is up 14% from the buy point. Parts chain **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) saw shares jump 9% on last week's earnings.


Heavy-truck stocks are rolling, too. Diesel engine maker **Cummins** ([CMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMI)) and **Paccar** ([PCAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCAR)) — which makes Kenworth, Peterbilt and other heavy trucks — [are extended from breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).


A rising market is relieving investor anxiety, but this is no time for complacency. The Federal Reserve meets this week and will announce its next interest-rate move Wednesday afternoon. Investors expect a quarter-point rate cut. [On Friday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), the October jobs report is out before the market opens.


U.S. and Chinese negotiators are close to finalizing the first phase of a trade accord. Any hiccup in those talks could rattle the stock market.


The IBD 50 rose nearly 0.7% Monday. The index remained below the 50-day moving average, but its tracking Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 0.3% and closed above the same technical level.

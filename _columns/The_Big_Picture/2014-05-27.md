The Nasdaq and S&P 500 gave bullish signals Tuesday, putting the market on a confirmed uptrend.

  

The Nasdaq climbed 1.2% in higher volume. The gain was sufficiently large to make it a follow-through â€” a confirmation of a long-attempted rally started on April 15.

  

It's unusual for a follow-through to hatch so late into a rally, in this case on the 29th day. But that's no reason to disqualify it. In August 2006 a follow-through came on the 21st day of a rally, and in December 2011 it was 17 days. Both times, the market went on to make sizable advances.

  

The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and made a new high, which also acted as a confirmation that the market is in an uptrend. It closed convincingly above the 1900 level, where sellers had frustrated the index's climb earlier this spring.

  

Volume rose across the board, although it was almost a foregone conclusion after Friday's sleepy pre-holiday session.

  

Small caps, a barometer of speculative sentiment, rallied as the Russell 2000 tacked on 1.4%. Advancing stocks led decliners by about 2-to-1 on the NYSE and nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

  

With favorable signals now in place, market risk considerably diminishes. Investors should start buying stocks again, starting with a few well-picked names and with half-positions to control risk. If the market continues to climb and leading stocks keep rising from buy points, increase your exposure incrementally.

  

A number of high-rated stocks remain in buy range, and several more broke out Tuesday, so there's plenty to harvest. Check the latest IBD 50, starting today on Page B2, and other IBD features for ideas.

  

Biotechs, software and Internet stocks helped lead the market and gave the Nasdaq added fuel. Several of those were chip stocks, a sector that gleamed with breakouts.

  

**Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)) broke out of a cup with handle in volume 50% above average.

  

**OmniVision Technologies** ([OVTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OVTI)), **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) climbed above buy points too, but their trading volumes were muted. **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) behaved more sure-handedly as shares jumped 6% in more than double its normal volume.

  

In the finance sector, **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) and **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) broke out of bases but in questionable volume.

  

**WellCare Health Plans** ([WCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCG)) cleared a 24-week pattern in active trading. Its move was part of a rally in the health-insurance industry, where **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) surged 4% to a new high and **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)) broke out of a cup with handle on Friday.

  

Food stocks also helped lead the market. The sector is normally a haven in weak markets, but this time it's acquisitions stirring demand. **Pilgrim's Pride** ([PPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PPC)) made an unsolicited bid for **Hillshire Brands** ([HSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSH)), which had agreed to an offer from **Pinnacle Foods** ([PF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PF)).

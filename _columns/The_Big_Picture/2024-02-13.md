Sellers came into the stock market Tuesday, but several leading growth stocks bucked the trend and closed higher, while others pared early losses.




Sentiment was already negative in light of premarket earnings sell-offs for **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)). But losses in the stock market intensified after the [January Consumer Price Index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-data-wont-soothe-the-fed-sp-500/) showed prices up 3.1% year over year, a little above the 3% consensus. Core prices were up 3.9%, also above expectations for a 3.7% increase.


Arista gapped down but closed off lows and near its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Datadog was volatile, but the software firm closed off lows and held support at its 50-day line. However, Shopify breached its 50-day line.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite fell 2.2% intraday and quickly shaved the loss to 1.1% while holding support at the 10-day moving average. The sell-off accelerated after that, but buyers came in during the final half-hour of trading and left the Nasdaq slightly off the day's lows for a loss of 1.8%.


 


The S&P 500 gave back 1.4% and closed just below its 10-day line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held support at its 21-day line, but the blue-chip index still fell nearly 1.4% — its worst day in nearly 11 months.


Declining stocks swamped advancers on the NYSE by 11-to-1. The ratio was nearly 5-to-1 negative on the Nasdaq.

In light of Tuesday's selling, IBD's recommended invested percentage was lowered to 60%-80%. That's a signal for growth investors to start trimming back positions in some big winners or take gains outright in some slower movers. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio went from being 83.5% invested before the open to 74%-75% by the close.


The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) slumped 1.7% but held at its 50-day line.


After three days of strong gains, the Russell 2000 small-cap index slumped 4% and closed less than 1 point above its 50-day line.


Distribution Day For Nasdaq, S&P 500
------------------------------------


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE, giving both indexes a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The Jan. 24 [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) for the S&P 500 was added back to the count after being temporarily removed on Feb. 5, when the S&P 500 marked a mild distribution day.


Despite sharp losses for many growth leaders in the stock market Tuesday, sell signals were few and far between. Arista Networks and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) fell sharply below their 21-day lines early in the session. But both stocks pared losses and closed in the upper half of their intraday ranges. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) edged lower but closed near highs.


The IBD 50 index fell 2.1% Tuesday, its worst day so far this year.


Money flowed out of bonds, lifting the 10-year yield higher by 15 basis points to 4.32%. That fueled a breakout for ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury ([TBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBT)) ETF, which jumped 3.4%.

Fed funds futures traders were getting more comfortable with the Federal Reserve making its first rate cut at the May meeting. But the latest CPI data lessened those chances. Traders now think there's a 34% chance that the Fed will cut rates by at least a quarter point at the May meeting. That's down from 55% about a week ago. The current Fed funds rate is at 5.25% to 5.5%.


Homebuilders Hit Hard
---------------------


Rising interest rates aren't good for homebuilders. The group slumped around 4% after rising 2.5% to a record high Monday. Several homebuilders gave buy signals Monday, including **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) and **Green Brick Partners** ([GRBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRBK)). But all four stocks closed with losses of 3.7% to 5.1%.


**O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) was among a small group of stocks that rallied in the Nasdaq 100. The auto parts supplier is still holding in a buy zone from a 1,005.96 entry. O'Reilly is one of four stocks on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) Watchlist.



After a nice close off lows Monday, **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) outperformed with a 1.5% gain. It's making a solid bounce off its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) for the first time after a breakout from a base on Dec. 14.


Technically, the stock is in a buy zone, although new buys are riskier now even with major stock indexes still on confirmed uptrends. After strong gains for the stock market since early November, there's a large number of extended stocks out there.

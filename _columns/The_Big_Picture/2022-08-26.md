Stock Market Dives As Powell Strikes Hawkish Tone; Celsius Holds Up, But Chip Stocks Take A Beating

The stock market sold off sharply Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a brief, yet [hawkish speech](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chair-powells-speech-the-two-words-that-could-upend-the-sp-500/) at the Fed's annual gather in Jackson Hole, Wyo.




"Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time," Powell said. "The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy."


The stock market had been rallying in hopes for a soft landing for the U.S. economy. But Powell's speech reminded Wall Street that more rate hikes are on the way so that inflation doesn't stay stubbornly high. Fed funds futures traders put the chances at just over 60% that the Fed will raise its key lending rate by another 75 basis points in September. That would bring the Fed funds rate up to 3% to 3.25%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite plummeted 3.9% and the S&P 500 slumped 3.4%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index swooned 3.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 3%. Just like that, the major stock indexes looked poised for tests of their 50-day moving averages, which sit near round numbers for the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq.


All 11 S&P sectors finished lower. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) held up the best, down just 1.2%.

Still, higher volume resulted in unequivocal [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The weak action also resulted in a change in IBD's market outlook to "uptrend under pressure."


The S&P 500 fired a couple of warning shots with sizable percentage declines on Aug. 19 and 22. Growth investors should be trimming back winners or selling stocks outright that aren't working.

Breadth was decidedly weak. Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq by nearly 4-to-1. The ratio was more than 6.5-1 negative on the NYSE.


The stock market got some good news on the inflation front before the open. Inside the personal income and outlays report, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditure price index, dipped 0.1% in July, cooler than the expected 0.1% rise. Year over year, the PCE index climbed 6.3%, in line with estimates and below June's reading of 6.8%. Personal income rose 0.2% in July, lower than the 0.6% forecast.


Retail-related groups and semiconductor stocks were hit the hardest. **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) scored a breakout Thursday, but the retailer reversed sharply lower Friday. **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) suffered a similar fate after barely poking above its entry.


In the chip sector, sellers hit **Axcelis Technologies** ([ACLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACLS)) hard after a breakout from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) base Thursday. **Photronics** ([PLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAB)), **Onsemi** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) and **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) also fell hard.



[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) closed off lows after falling more than 7%.


While several Chinese stocks reversed lower after strong gains Thursday, China-based solar firm and [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) component **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) broke out over a trendline and closed near its session high, up 8%. Sentiment has improved somewhat in Chinese stocks after the U.S. and China reached an agreement that will allow U.S. audits of Chinese firms listed in the U.S.

The stock market ended the day and week lower after **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) caused what is believed to be the largest information technology outage in history. New inflation data and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) earnings are among the noteworthy events in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite fell 0.8% and suffered a weekly decline of 3.7%. This brought a six-week winning streak to a painful halt. It lost more ground on the 21-day exponential moving average and slipped closer to its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Nevertheless, the tech-heavy composite remains up more than 18% for the year so far.


The S&P 500 also suffered as it reversed 0.7%. The fact it failed to find support at the [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) is a disappointment for the bulls. The benchmark index also suffered its worst week since April amid a weekly decline of 2%. But it still holds a gain of more than 15% so far in 2024.


Decliners led advancers by less than 2 to 1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Friday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was hit the hardest out of the major indexes on the stock market, diving 0.9%. **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) fared best on the much-watched index while insurer **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and chip stock **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) lagged. Nevertheless, the Dow still squeezed out a weekly gain of 0.7%


Small caps ended off lows for the day, but the Russell 2000 still fell 0.6%. Growth stocks fared better, with the Innovator IBD 50 exchange traded fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slipping just 0.2%.


IBD is holding its recommended exposure level in the 60% to 80% range. Given the weakening technical picture, investors could consider moving to the lower end of the scale and locking in some profits.


CrowdStrike Walloped; PCE Inflation Data Due
--------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP071924.jpg)Businesses in the U.S. and beyond were affected after a program update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike caused an issue with the **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) operating system, leading to widespread tech outages. This disrupted operations for many companies, including airlines, banks and hospitals.


CrowdStrike was one of the worst performing stocks on the market, falling 11.1%. It fell away from its 50-day line but got support at the 200-day moving average. Microsoft only slipped 0.7% amid support at its 50-day moving average.


The coming week looks to be a busy one. Existing home sales figures come Tuesday, with new home sales data on Wednesday and a second-quarter GDP reading on Thursday. Friday looks to be the key day for economic data though, with the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index inflation reading set to drop. Economists see both headline PCE and core PCE rising 2.5% year over year.


A slew of important reports are also due in the [coming week as earnings season continues apace](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-tesla-servicenow-google/). Tesla, **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) are among the noteworthy firms posting quarterly results.


These Stock Market Groups Fare Best
-----------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) in mostly negative territory. Only health care and utilities, the latter a defensive area, finished positive while energy and industrials proved the weakest areas.



Once again, investors could get a deeper insight into the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by looking at the relative performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups.


Database software firms, food wholesalers, regional banks, financial software plays and auto parts retailers were among the best-performing groups.


In contrast, automakers, book publishers, fabless chip stocks such as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and semiconductor makers were among the stock market laggards.

<p>The Dow climbed 0.5% and did it with relative ease. It sprang up from the open and sailed undisturbed until a late pullback. If it rises Tuesday, the Dow will match a 12-session win streak that ended Feb. 27, 2017, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p>
<p>The industrial average — still lagging the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq in year-to-date-performance — is the current leading index. It climbed to an April 2022 high, and its July gain of nearly 3% is beating the other main indexes.</p>
<p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS" target="_blank">GS</a>) contributed 46 points to the Dow's 183-point advance. The investment bank rose for a sixth straight day. <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM" target="_blank">JPM</a>) added 2%, taking it to the highest point since February 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Chevron</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX" target="_blank">CVX</a>) added 20 points to the Dow. The oil giant gapped up 1.97% after it surprised the stock market with a <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/chevron-announces-leadership-shakeup-as-q2-profits-slip-nearly-50/">preannouncement of second-quarter earnings</a> on Sunday that beat analysts' estimates. It also said it waived the mandatory retirement age for CEO Mike Wirth, 62. And CFO Pierre Breber will retire next year.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>
<p>Chevron's news added to the energy sector's rebound. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE" target="_blank">XLE</a>) climbed 1.6% and closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since May 1. Nymex crude for September delivery rose 2.2% to $78.74 per barrel.</p>
<h2>S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Fade</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8544898" src="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP072423-244x300.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="345" srcset="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP072423-244x300.jpg 244w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP072423-768x945.jpg 768w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP072423.jpg 798w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" uia-uid="0|1">The S&amp;P 500 closed 0.4% higher but that was off its earlier pace. The Nasdaq composite almost wiped out the day's gains but finished 0.2% higher.</p>
<p>It was generally a lackluster day for growth stocks. The IShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF" target="_blank">IWF</a>) rose 0.3%.</p>
<p>The IBD 50 index fell 0.8%, and that was mainly due to three big losers. <strong>Symbotic</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYM" target="_blank">SYM</a>) and <strong>Lemonade</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMND" target="_blank">LMND</a>) slid more than 6%. <strong>Ryanair</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY" target="_blank">RYAAY</a>) gapped below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume after earnings beat views, but the airline cited higher operating costs and gave a cautious outlook.</p>
<p>The Russell 2000 rose 0.3%.</p>
<p>Volume rose on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq from Friday's levels.</p>
<p>The rebalancing of the tech-bloated Nasdaq 100 index went into effect Monday. The unusual move was designed to reduce an excessive weighting in seven major stocks that came to account for about 55% of the index.</p>
<p>The rebalance reduced that weighting to 44%, Goldman Sachs Research Chief U.S. Equity Strategist David Kostin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21qmjYfXEPs&amp;t=250s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a podcast</a>. <strong>Nvidia</strong>'s (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA" target="_blank">NVDA</a>) weighting got cut from about 7.5% to 4.5%, while <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT" target="_blank">MSFT</a>) went from 13% to 10%, Kostin said. <strong>Adobe</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE" target="_blank">ADBE</a>), <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO" target="_blank">CSCO</a>) and <strong>Qualcomm</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM" target="_blank">QCOM</a>) are some of the stock gaining exposure in the Nasdaq 100.</p>
<p>The Magnificent Seven held up well Monday. <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META" target="_blank">META</a>) dug a bit more below its 21-day exponential moving average.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA" target="_blank">TSLA</a>) reversed to the upside and closed 3.5% higher despite a downgrade from UBS. Analysts Patrick Hummel, David Lesne and Juan Perez-Carrascosa cut the EV stock to neutral from buy.</p>
<p>The recent strong share performance "fully reflects the strong demand response seen after the price cuts, as well as a solid execution in 2024," the analysts said. At the same time, they raised the price target to 270 from 220.</p>
<h2>Multiple Headlines For Stock Market</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/">earnings calendar this week</a> is one of the heaviest. The notables include <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL" target="_blank">GOOGL</a>),<strong> Visa</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V" target="_blank">V</a>) and Microsoft Tuesday; <strong>Boeing</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA" target="_blank">BA</a>), <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO" target="_blank">KO</a>), <strong>ServiceNow</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW" target="_blank">NOW</a>) on Wednesday; <strong>Mastercard</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA" target="_blank">MA</a>) and <strong>Crocs</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX" target="_blank">CROX</a>) on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the Fed funds rate by a quarter point. What is less certain is the Fed's strategy after it takes that step.</p>
<p>In economic news Monday, the S&amp;P Global Flash U.S. Composite PMI fell in July to 52.0 from 53.2 the previous month, dropping to a five-month low.</p>
<p>While the service sector continued to drive growth, manufacturers reported mainly unchanged levels of production as Q3 started.</p>
<p>"July is seeing an unwelcome combination of slower economic growth, weaker job creation, gloomier business confidence and sticky inflation,"&nbsp;Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said in the report.</p>
<p>Overall output growth across manufacturing and services is consistent with GDP expanding at an annualized quarterly rate of about 1.5% at the start of the third quarter. That's down from a 2% pace the survey indicated in the second quarter.</p>

Growth is still good. Investors reacted positively to another barrage of earnings results, and the major averages tilted toward the upside Wednesday.



The Nasdaq composite, a market laggard last week, paced Wednesday's gain with a 0.7% advance. It eclipsed three days' worth of mild losses. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, hurt by declines in the oil and media sectors.


The S&P 500's close near its session lows was disappointing, but not surprising. Since February, the large-cap index has rallied past 2100 more than eight times, only to trip and slip below that level in a matter of days. Nonetheless, volume rose on both major exchanges, exactly what bulls would like to see on an up day in the market.


The market may have gotten a boost by strength in European bourses overnight as well as a highly positive report on the U.S. service sector. The ISM nonmanufacturing index rocketed to 60.3 in July, easily the highest level this year and smashing the consensus view of 56.2.


Gaming software, travel booking, managed care and cosmetics industries helped lead the market's advance.


Also, this week's earnings reports seemed to indicate that the economy won't be terrible in the second half of the year.


**Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) has gotten its mojo back, rising 6% and 3% in back-to-back sessions of intense trading. In the second quarter, sales rose 38% to $921 million, extending a stretch of 25%-plus increases for a fourth straight quarter. The construction materials firm's results were hit by bad weather in Texas, but investors applauded the firm's bullish second-half outlook.


**Acadia Healthcare** ([ACHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACHC)) (revenue up 112%), **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) (up 50%) and **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) (up 42%) are beating the market soundly this year with superior gains in both revenue and profits. Double-to-triple-digit gains in sales look especially good in an economy that expanded just 0.6% in Q1 and rose 2.3% in Q2.


The market still punishes companies that miss forecasts. **Disney**'s ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) 9% drop came as the entertainment giant posted a 5% rise in sales to $13.1 billion, its smallest gain in eight quarters.


The gap down was a clear sell signal for new shareholders. Disney tore through its 50-day moving average in volume 10 times normal. Yet for long-term holders with stout gains, it would make sense to see if the stock holds above its 200-day line.

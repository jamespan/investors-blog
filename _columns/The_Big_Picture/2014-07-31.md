Bears Clobber Stock Indexes, But Some Leaders Holding Up
=========================================================

Stocks careened lower with few exceptions Thursday as the indexes fell hard in fast trade.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 chopped off 2.1% and 2%, respectively. The IBD 50 lost 2.5%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

The market provided few places to hide. Declining issues led advancing issues by about 9-to-1 on the NYSE and by a 5-to-1 pace on the Nasdaq.

  

The action left no doubt that funds were selling en masse.

  

Both indexes picked up a distribution day. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 punctured its 50-day moving average, closing under the line for the first time since April.

  

However, the Nasdaq continues to hold above its 50-day line, and recent support just above 4350 wasn't broached.

  

The uptrend remains under pressure, but it doesn't have much room left to maneuver.

  

Losses among leaders were too numerous to list. The Market Pulse at right lists only those leaders that fell in extremely high volume.

  

Economic news set a down tone before the open. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported planned layoffs in July hit 46,877 — the second-highest level of the year. News of Argentina defaulting on its debt added to the gloom. 

  

Perhaps the worst piece of news was from the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago. The July PMI number fell more than 10 points, its biggest drop since October 2008. Purchasing managers said they regarded the bad number as "a lull rather than the start of a new downward trend."

  

A handful of stocks managed to break out in strong volume.

  

They included software maker **OpenText** ([OTEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTEX)), chip firm **Tessera Technologies** ([TSRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSRA)) and consumer goods manufacturer **Newell Rubbermaid** ([NWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NWL)).

  

One test for any market is how breakaway moves among top-rated stocks are holding up.

  

Despite Thursday's pain, recent quality gap-ups — such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), **Polaris Industries** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) and **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) — are acting OK. Either the stock is staying within the range of the gap-up day or is declining in soft volume.

  

Individual investors holding a strong performer or two can stand pat, if they have a cushion in the stock. A sizable gain that threatens to cycle into the red should be sold.

  

After the close, **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) announced quarterly results that beat the Street's numbers on the top and bottom lines. The stock fell 2% in after-hours action.

  

**GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) delivered a double beat too, but slid after hours.

  

**Arris Group** ([ARRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRS)) also posted a double beat and plunged in extended trading.

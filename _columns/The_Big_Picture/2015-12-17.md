Stocks Pile Up Some Nasty Losses; Lower Volume Is Only Saving Grace
====================================================================

Stocks rose in the first five minutes of Thursday's session and then slid steadily south. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5%, while the Nasdaq tailgated with a 1.4% loss. The IBD 50 fell 1.1%.


Volume fell on both major U.S. exchanges.


The rare, third-day follow-through Wednesday looked somewhat hollow with Thursday's ugly price losses. Yet declining volume dulled the edge of the indexes' losses, avoiding a distribution day.


A distribution day involves a loss in rising volume, which is a sign of institutional selling. Distribution this soon after a follow-through day would've been a bad sign. Quick selling in a new rally suggests a willingness to sell into any sign of strength.


So the lower volume Thursday let the market dodge a bullet.


Ideally, though, it's best when the market plows ahead, creating regret for the quick sellers.


Although the market escaped distribution, its action was troubling.

The indexes closed near the bottom of the day's range, which is a bearish sign.


Volume, however, is painting a less-threatening, if cloudy picture. Trade on the Nasdaq stepped lower in each of the past three sessions. On the S&P 500, volume has risen and fallen on alternate days this week.


What conclusion can individual investors draw from this? The only proper conclusion to draw at this point is that a conclusion is impossible to draw.


Friday is unlikely to clear up the picture because it is a quadruple witching day, which involves the expiration of stock and index options, and stock and index futures. Higher volume is almost guaranteed.


Another sign creating nervousness about this new uptrend is the lack of quality breakouts so far. That could change, so remain watchful. At least for now, investors should wade back into stocks carefully.


One good sign that has drawn little attention is the money supply. On Wednesday, the Center for Financial Stability released the broad Divisia M4 data for November. M4 grew 4.6% year over year, the largest increase in 30 months.


Some economists have argued that the money supply offers a preview to the near-term course of the economy.


If so, then continued strong M4 numbers could point to a stronger economy in 2016.

U.S. stock indexes lost ground Thursday, as steel producers and chip-equipment makers staggered lower.


The Nasdaq pegged its loss at 0.5% after being down 1.4% earlier in the session. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average kept their losses at 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. Small caps also struggled as the Russell 2000 retreated 0.5%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MP061517-185x300.png)Recently the market has been taking an ace-backward stance. Aces such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are down 3% to 6% for the month.


Leading chip stocks such as **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are down 4% to 6%. None, however, has flashed a sell signal.


On the upside this month, banks and homebuilders are doing well.


In the bank space, **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) and **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) are up 7% to 8%. All three are forming new chart patterns.


Western Alliance is a former [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/Leaderboard/Leaders/default.aspx/Leaderboard/Leaders/default.aspx) stock that has been consolidating since early March. The stock's pattern could be seen as a somewhat sloppy double-bottom base. The potential buy point is 49.74, which the stock recently has tried to clear. Funds holding shares include T. Rowe Price New Horizons, which has an IBD rating of A+.


The bank sector ended the month of May at No. 23 among 33 sectors. Going into Thursday's session, it had jumped to No. 9.


[Homebuilders also are doing well](https://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/) this month. The building sector ended May at No. 13. Going into Thursday's session, it rose to No. 5.


Homebuilders such as **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)), **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) are up 6% to 8% this month. But small cap **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) is up 14%. Several stocks in the group are forming bases and a few have topped buy points.


How should an individual investor play this situation?


Portfolio management is the key item. IBD's probability-based approach generally advises taking profits at 20% to 25%. Losses should be cut at no worse than 8% and hopefully much sooner than that. When an investor takes profits in a winner, it's a good idea to also sell the weakest stock in the portfolio. Then, look for valid entries in stronger stocks.


Some of the banks and homebuilders mentioned above — and others in the groups — are consolidating. Those improving sectors might be a place to look for buy candidates.


Thursday's Economic News
------------------------


On the bullish side, first-time jobless claims rolled in at 237,000 which was about 3% fewer than expected.


The Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing survey for June topped expectations by about 6%. The Empire State manufacturing gauge for June struck 19.8, almost four times expectations and easily above every estimate in the range.


On the bearish side, industrial production in May was flat and shy of the consensus figure of 0.2%. The National Association of Home Builders' housing gauge for June failed to meet the consensus estimate of 70. The reading came in at 67.


Wide Angle Data View Is Stronger
--------------------------------


Overall, recent data readings have disappointed some market watchers. But the data can look different if the lens is shifted to wide angle.


For example, much hand-wringing accompanied Wednesday's retail sales for May which came in on a month-to-month basis at minus 0.3% vs. views for a 0.1% gain. Lost in the furor were the year-ago comparisons. Retail sales were 3.8% above the year-ago level.


Also, business shipments and sales to distributors were unchanged from March to April, but up 5.6% on a year-ago basis.


It's been said that everyone is entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts. However, in this economy, investors can find their own facts to match their bullish or bearish stance. What to do?


The market itself is the best guide under most circumstances. Right now, the market is having price discovery problems. The Nasdaq has traded this week mostly within Friday's wide price range, in an uncertain attempt to rebound. When that's resolved, investors will get a clearer view of the market's next major direction and composition.


The key is to stay flexible. Let go of an opinion when the market starts proving it wrong. As William O'Neil said, "The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is ... to lose the least possible when you're wrong."

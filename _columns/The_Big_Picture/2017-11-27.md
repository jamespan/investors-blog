Nasdaq Ends Win Streak; Small Caps Lead Dip; Will China Hurt Stocks?
=====================================================================

The major U.S. equity indexes moved like someone who had too much turkey on Thanksgiving. Stocks generally traded in a tight range and most leaders seemed to act sluggishly Monday.




However, selling was notable in Chinese mainland equities, which clearly impacted some American depositary receipts traded on Wall Street. Small caps and new tech darling **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) also led the downside.


The Nasdaq composite lost less than 0.2%, but not before rising enough in the morning to knock out one of its five distribution days that have taken place over the past 25 trading sessions. The Oct. 25 distribution was erased because the Nasdaq rose far enough about that day's close of 6563 to make it no longer relevant.


The Nasdaq commanded the market last week, rising nearly 1.6% in less than four full days' worth of trading. Even after Monday's drop, halting a four-session win streak, the tech-heavy composite is still up nearly 28% for the year, head and shoulders above the S&P 500 (down 1 point, up 16.2% year to date) and the Dow Jones industrial average (up 0.1%, up 19.3% YTD).


The S&P SmallCap 600 lost more than 0.5%. Small caps have lagged the tech-led Nasdaq all year.


Volume bulged on both exchanges, but only because Friday was a 3-1/2-hour trading session. Volume on the Nasdaq was clearly well below its 50-day average.



While Square is not part of either the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) or [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), it still deserves close watch as a bellwether for leading companies. Given the financial tech play's strong rally in recent months, it was definitely due for a break. The big question: Will a normal base form, or is the rally done for good?

Judging by its growth metrics and future estimates, one would lean toward the possibility of a new base. Earnings and sales estimates look very strong. Digital transactions are simply a big trend that no one should fight.


However, if more top-rated companies show big declines in heavy volume, then follow such action with meek rebounds in weak turnover, then an IBD reader has gotten a pretty clear signal that the market's character is changing.


Meanwhile, don't keep your eye off China.


While Americans enjoyed the Thanksgiving holiday, Chinese investors saw the biggest declines in the Shanghai composite in quite a while. The index fell more than 3% in the past three sessions and took out the key 50-day moving average in the process. Bloomberg has reported that the Chinese government is taking more steps to tamp down the white-hot real estate market.


"Yields on sovereign and top-rated local corporate debt have climbed amid Beijing's deleveraging campaign, which includes plans to tighten supervision of asset management products. The 10-year yield on China Development Bank debt this week exceeded 5% for the first time since 2014, while that on similar maturity government notes topped 4%," Bloomberg reported.


The Shenzhen stock exchange's benchmark, seen as a gauge of dynamic growth and tech companies, saw a couple of its companies hit the 10% decline limit, including ZTE Corp. and automaker BYD.


Back in U.S. equities, breadth was far more negative than the decline in the major indexes. On the NYSE, falling issues beat advancers by a roughly 9-5 margin. On the Nasdaq, losers beat winners by nearly 3-to-2. However, a recent jump in the Nasdaq's advance-decline line helps reaffirm the market's confirmed uptrend, which has been in place since Aug. 22.


Also on the positive side, the trend of new highs on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE is positive again after some weakness seen midmonth.


On Nov. 14 and 15, stocks making new lows on the Nasdaq exceeded new highs in IBD's screened list. But that pattern ended fast. Over the next six trading sessions through Friday, an average 185 Nasdaq issues reached 52-week or all-time highs vs. just 20 new lows each day.


Software, finance, electronics, building, chip and business services sectors have dominated the new highs list lately.

For a bull market that apparently made a record in longevity, Wall Street acted as if it hardly knew.




Yet Wednesday's action showed what's far more important than statistics and trivia: The current uptrend remains solid overall, and most leading stocks are doing all right.


After the major indexes — namely the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite — completed their 3,453rd day since the March 2009 bottom, what should IBD readers focus on with laserlike intensity today?


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MP082218-201x300.jpg)One could identify five key elements: general marketwide technicals; the chart action of breakouts and top leaders; the level of investor sentiment; valuation and interest rates; and how investors digest news on the economic and political fronts.


Element No. 1: The Market
-------------------------


But first, both the new IBD reader and the decadeslong subscriber must always first assess the daily price-and-volume action of the key benchmarks. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% in lower turnover. At 7889, the premier index for growth companies stretched its year-to-date advance to 14.2%. It's now just a stone's throw away from taking out its all-time peak of 7933.


The Nasdaq's advance by no means is a solo act.


Small-cap firms are rising. Why? Investors are looking beyond the headlines, no matter how ugly or how closely they hit home within the White House. They see a good economic climate for smaller enterprises.


The small-cap S&P 600 edged 0.2% higher to rise for a fifth straight session and etch a new all-time closing high. The Russell 2000 rose 0.3%, good for a new all-time high. At 1722, the Russell is now up 12% since Jan. 1. It's spanking the S&P 500's year-to-date performance by at least 500 basis points.


Distribution days are still slightly elevated for the S&P 500. But keep in mind that one of those five distribution days came on a stalling session Tuesday. Volume on the NYSE certainly rose Tuesday, but was well below average.


After the S&P 500 survived a test of the 2800 level on Aug. 15 and rallied 2.5% over a five-day span, the benchmark was surely in need of catching its breath.


Consider, also, the other four declines in higher turnover. None of the four exceeded 1%. The average drop: a mild 0.5%.


Market breadth keeps getting better.


The S&P 500 chart, accessible via the General Market Indicators PDF at the bottom of this article, shows a running graph of advancing stocks vs. declining stocks on the Big Board exchange. IBD calls this the "NYSE advance-decline line," and it's recently risen into new high ground. That's good for stock investors. It means the chances of making gains on breakouts or rebounds off the 50-day and 10-week moving averages are higher.


The Nasdaq's A-D line, not shown on the market indicators PDF, also climbed into new high ground this week.


Element No. 2: Stock Market Leaders
-----------------------------------


The current leadership — as seen in stock lists such as Sector Leaders, the IBD 50 and the Big Cap 20 — truly reflect a panoply of fast-growing, innovative companies in health care, software, internet commerce, mobile, retail and semiconductors. [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) currently showcases nine stocks and one earnings options play.


**Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) showed a wicked reversal after breaking out on good fiscal Q2 results. But the stock's nice run isn't necessarily over. Watch to see how the stock finishes for the week. Despite losing all of its stout gains on Wednesday, the retail play did not close too far beneath the 50-day moving average.


Element No. 3: Investor Sentiment In The Bull Market
----------------------------------------------------


Bullishness among newsletter editors edged up to 57.7%, according to the weekly survey of Investors Intelligence. That's on the high side, but it's not extreme. In other words, more than 42% of the professional crowd still believes the market will go into an intermediate correction (a 10% decline or more) or a genuine bear market.


The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) has dropped sharply in recent weeks after spiking to 1.13 on Aug. 10. Yet at 0.73, it still shows a relatively high level of optimism. The 0.73 figure means that for every 100 bullish calls traded, 73 bearish puts changed hands as well. The 0.73 reading is also still above the lows seen in mid-December.


Element No. 4: Valuation And Interest Rates
-------------------------------------------


Thomson Reuters currently shows the forward P-E ratio for the S&P 500 at 16.5 times earnings over the next 12 months. While it may be higher than historical averages, that does not sound excessive. The earnings yield of the S&P 500, roughly over 6%, still runs much higher than the yield of 2.82% for the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note.


How does one figure out the earnings yield for the S&P 500?


Yardeni Research noted on Tuesday that the consensus earnings-per-share forecast for S&P 500 companies in the 12-month forward period is $172.65 as of Aug. 16. The EPS estimate for 2019 is $178.65. Divide either of those numbers into the S&P's closing price of 2861, then multiply by 100, and you get an earnings yield of 6% to 6.2%.


[Within the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), more than half show regular price-to-earnings ratios of 40 or higher. Is that normal? Yes, given how these companies can deliver high double-digit or even triple-digit profit increases.


Element No. 5: The Economy And Politics
---------------------------------------


Data on jobs, retail sales, construction and international trade reaffirm an accelerating trend for the economy. That's good for stocks.


Some may wonder if Americans are up to their necks in debt. Research from Sadoff Investment Management in Milwaukee shows that we haven't hit a peak. Consider credit card debt. The amount of real consumer debt, using the first quarter of 2003 as a base level, is up nearly 130% compared with the first quarter of 2003. But it's still well off the peak in 2008, when consumer debt was up 150% vs. 2003 levels.


On Wednesday, the market yawned at the guilty plea of former presidential lawyer Michael Cohen and the conviction of President Trump's ex-campaign manager. The session showed investors are focusing more on the issues of trade with China and the midterm elections in November. Talks on updating or rehauling NAFTA are also key.

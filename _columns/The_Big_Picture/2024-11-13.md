  Stock Market Extends Moderating Trend; Is This A FOMO Market?

Major stock indexes were little changed Wednesday as the market's uptrend continued to moderate with a dull trend setting in. But small caps got hit hard.


The S&P 500 inched up a fraction after indexes faded in afternoon trading. It was the S&P's fourth-straight close with a move of less than 0.4%.


The Nasdaq composite wavered between gains and losses and finished nearly 0.3% lower. It had moved only about 0.1% the previous three sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1% after being up as much as 0.5%.




Small caps, however, came under concentrated fire. The Russell 2000 slid 0.9%. The 10-year Treasury yield reversed two basis points higher to 4.448%, which may have impacted small caps more than other stocks.


Volume surged on the Nasdaq. It was the most since the Sept. 20 triple-witching session and the 16th consecutive day of above-average trading. Wednesday's higher volume gave the Nasdaq its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) since clearing the slate clean last week. Volume eased on the New York Stock Exchange.


Another Rate Cut Coming?
------------------------


Indexes opened higher after the October consumer price index [met economists' forecasts](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-oct-ppi-federal-reserve-sp-500/). The cooling trend appeared to stall. But bond traders still raised bets on a quarter-point cut in interest rates next month. [Odds for such a cut](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) stood at 82% late Wednesday, up from about 59% on Tuesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP111324.jpg)Despite the stock market's moderating trend, the S&P 500 is up 4.9% this month and just had its best nine-day performance since August. The Nasdaq's 6.3% gain month-to-date is a nine-day best since September, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The fact that the stock market has hardly budged since last week's rally should be taken as a positive sign.


While indexes were relatively quiet, many high-rated stocks rose sharply in higher volume during the session, including **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)), **Paymentus** ([PAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAY)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)). Cava's winnings were pared substantially by the close.


Stock Market Sentiment Bubbling
-------------------------------


Investor optimism has bulged since last week's U.S. elections removed a big uncertainty and raised the prospects for more business-friendly policies in Washington.


The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) fell to 0.59 on Monday, the lowest — and most optimistic — reading so far this year. The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, on Wednesday fell for the sixth time in the past seven sessions. The so-called stock market fear gauge is at the lowest since July 23.


A Charles Schwab survey found that retail investors and active traders are significantly more bullish than they were in late October. A survey of Schwab clients conducted after the Nov. 7 Fed rate cut shows 56% are bullish and 15% are bearish about equities. In late October, 36% were bullish and 20% were bearish. Among active traders, 29% in the survey said they plan to add risk before the end of the year.


The Investors Intelligence Advisors Sentiment report, which tracks market newsletters, saw the number of bullish advisors climb to 60.3% from 56.7% a week ago. That level indicates a complacent market that could be in for a pullback.


"The reading remains in the high-risk danger zone above 55% for the fifth-straight week," the report said. That's the highest concentration of bulls since late July, when they exceeded 60% for seven weeks. For reference, the Nasdaq suffered a four-week correction of nearly 16% from mid-July to a bottom on Aug. 5.


The latest bears reading fell to 20.7%, from 21.7%. "That is the fewest bears since early August but a further contraction for this reading is typically seen before a major market top," the firm noted.


FOMO Tempts Investors
---------------------


Those sentiment indicators reflect a solid market but are also a symptom of fear of missing out, or FOMO. Strong stock market gains can seduce investors into piling into stocks, perhaps too late or too early.


A market uptrend is the correct time to buy or add stocks. Investor's Business Daily continues to recommend 80%-100% exposure.


After the S&P 500 had its best week of the year and the Nasdaq enjoyed its second best, investors can savor some winnings. But the downside is that the postelection, post-Fed meeting rally has left many stocks extended from buy areas.


Investors have to resist the temptation to buy stocks that are not in proper buy areas. Regardless of how well the market looks, a poorly timed trade can erase any benefit from a strong market.


Remember to focus on institutional-quality stocks. Most important, buy only when a stock climbs to a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) from a proper base, or when it finds support in a pullback to the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). A handful of stocks have formed three-weeks-tight patterns, too.


At the same time, avoid overcommitting to stocks. If a sell signal occurs, don't ignore it.

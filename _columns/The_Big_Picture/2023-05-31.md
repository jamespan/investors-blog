Stock Market Ends May On Weak Note As Nasdaq Extends Leadership; Why Dow Jones Index Might Stay A Laggard
==========================================================================================================

The stock market often likes to whipsaw investors on the final day of the month. Wednesday certainly exemplified this habit to a degree.




But what made the session even more notable? Bond traders got knocked around for a wild ride, especially among speculators on what the Federal Reserve will do two weeks from now at its meeting on interest rates.


During the first 45 minutes of the [IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), panelists noted a jump above 70% in the probability of a fourth quarter-point hike. But as [IBD reported](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-pares-loss-on-fed-comments-salesforce-ai-stock-lead-earnings-movers-late/), comments from one Federal Reserve governor, Philip Jefferson, as well as the head of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, Patrick Harker, seemed to convince Wall Street that the chances of a rate hike have come down drastically.


After the close, CME FedWatch showed the chances of a rate hike at the June 13-14 Fed meeting fall to under 35%. And at one point during the day, the probability sank to 25%.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 6 basis points to 3.63%, its third straight decline. The yield, however, edged up 18 basis points for the month of May, according to Cboe data.


Meanwhile, volume spiked in the dying minutes of trading on both main exchanges. So, the Nasdaq notched its [third distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) over the past 25 sessions. It includes Tuesday's stalling session, a rare form of professional selling.


The S&P 500 lost its April 25 distribution day, a 1.6% decline in higher volume, due to time. But sharply higher NYSE volume, coupled with the 0.6% loss Wednesday, kept the S&P 500's count still at seven, as seen in the accompanying Market Pulse table.


While Wednesday's closes in the stock market were not pretty, the gains for the month of May for big-cap techs were hardly ugly.

Stock Market Today: Keep Eyes On Nasdaq
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP053123-192x300.jpg)Let's start with the leading index this year so far. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.6% on Wednesday. After closing above the 13,000 level on Tuesday for the first time since Aug. 15, it actually made an effort to keep above the clearly important psychological level. But the market cap-weighted index ended on its back foot, clearly finishing in the lower half of Wednesday's range.


At 12,935, the Nasdaq finished the month of May up 5.8%. That's the third best monthly gain in 2023, following a 10.7% vault in January and a 6.7% reversal higher in March.


So, for tech investors, after a tawdry 2022, the first five months ought to feel a whole lot nicer. But in this tale of two equity markets, blue chips outside the tech realm have truly been mixed.


The S&P 500, a diverse representation of industries and business sectors, matched the Nasdaq's 0.6% decline Wednesday. At 4179.83, the large-cap benchmark closed May up less than 0.3%. But the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average looks a bit sorry.


Down 0.4% on Wednesday, it did get technical support at its flattened-out 200-day moving average. At 14,887, the popular Dow Jones index fell 3.5% for the month.


Take a peek inside the Dow 30, and you'll see at least seven stocks with a Relative Strength Rating of under 40. They include manufacturing giant **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), which made 10-year lows this month; pharmacy chain **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)), whose stock briefly crossed below 30 for the first time since July of 2012; and entertainment titan **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), which at 87.96 has now slumped almost 57% off its all-time peak of 203.02 set in March 2021.


Disney's 27 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) on a 12-month basis fares even better than its ghastly three-month RS Rating of 16, according to MarketSmith's Technicals panel.


Their declines underscore the point about [having excellent sell rules](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/) to shield an investor from painful portfolio losses — no matter the type of stock.

Few Smaller Issues Lead The Stock Market
----------------------------------------


Small caps, for sure, aren't providing any refuge for the despondent blue chip investor, either.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund dropped 1% on Wednesday to end May off 0.8%. That's not a terrible performance in May, but it also marked the fourth straight monthly decline for the popular gauge of smaller stocks.


For sure, the banking crisis that erupted in March, sending two coastal firms belly-up amid a tidal wave of deposit withdrawals, is certainly a key factor behind the relative underperformance of the Russell 2000.


On Wednesday, MarketWatch quoted Martin Gruenberg, chair of the FDIC, as saying the recent stresses on banks "include the effects of only a few weeks of the industry's stress that began in early March, rather than over the course of the entire quarter.


"The more lasting effects of the industry's response to that stress may not become fully apparent until second quarter results," Gruenberg added.


Why Are Dow Stocks And Small Caps Floundering?
----------------------------------------------


Those, however, aren't the only reasons.


Oil is tanking. According to Dow Jones Data, NYMEX-traded crude oil futures got striped with big losses in May, down 11.3% to $68.09 a barrel. Natural gas futures, falling 3% to $2.25 per million BTUs on Wednesday, have cratered 70% from a November 2022 peak of $7.60, according to Thinkorswim data.


Finally, copper has lost its shine amid new reports that signal weaker-than-expected recoveries in China and Europe. Indeed, many commodity stocks have languished this year so far.


These are important areas of the economy. And they're also areas in which the semiconductor and software firms are not going to invest.


Put another way: What exactly is the [N in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/innovation-stock-highs-big-shifts-define-the-n-in-can-slim/) in the stock market now? The N stands for something new, one of the most critical elements in deciding which sectors, industry groups, and individual companies to invest in. Certainly, one cannot ignore an emerging boom in [applications of artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/technology/).


It seems the AI industry will crisscross various tech industries, including semiconductors and computing hardware; networking and data center equipment and operations; software applications; and finally the realm of e-commerce.



From this point of view, some [ETFs appeared to express an optimism](https://www.investors.com/research/these-etfs-bank-on-ai-stocks-including-a-cathie-wood-fund/) for growth in this field, at least in the near term.


Just take a gander at exchange traded funds such as  Global X Robotics & AI ([BOTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOTZ)), up 9.5% for the month; iShares Expanded Tech Software ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)), a 10.6% winner this past month; and iShares Semiconductor ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)), rising 15.7%.

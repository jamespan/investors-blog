U.S. stock indexes posted solid gains Friday, after a budget blueprint was approved in the Senate on Thursday night.


The Dow Jones industrial average and the small-cap S&P 600 on Friday led with respective gains of 0.7% and 0.6%.




The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq added 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. All but the Russell 2000 hit record highs.


Volume eased on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE. Friday was an options expirations day, which usually boosts volume.


The Senate budget agreement, accomplished because of Republican unity and without a single Democratic vote, is expected to lead to changes in the tax code. The changes could make riskier investments — such as stocks — more attractive than bonds.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 2.38% Friday, the highest since July 7.

CME Group's FedWatch Tool pegged the probability of a rate hike in December at 93.1%, up from the previous day's 88.1%.


Going into Friday's session, bank stocks have led the new highs list 14 times in a little more than four weeks.


Is there anything left to buy in the bank space?


**Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) broke out Friday and remains in the 5% buy zone. The ideal entry was 53.94 and the buy zone stretches to 56.63.


During the initial Trump rally, Western Alliance rose 34% from Election Day to Dec. 8. Then Western Alliance traded in a sideways channel for months — like most of the bank stocks.


A few bank stocks are trading in handles and are close to buy points. They include **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)).



Two Groups Outperform Big Time
------------------------------


Two groups did far better than the banks last week.


According to preliminary data, the homebuilder group was No. 1 for the week, rising 8% thanks to a two-day 11% rally in **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) shares. Hospitals were close behind at 7%.


Both groups had to overcome bad news. On Wednesday, housing starts and permits missed expectations. Homebuilder stocks shrugged it off.


Meanwhile, hospital stocks rose despite President Trump's executive order on ObamaCare. When the news and stock action appear to be at odds, the individual investor is best off trusting the stock action. News can be already priced into the stock, or it can be ultimately irrelevant.

Earnings and economic reports Tuesday kept the stock market in a jovial mood, although investors now must face a new policy statement from the Federal Reserve and more earnings reports.




In a late show of investor caution, indexes gave back some gains in the final 75 minutes of trading.


The Nasdaq composite led at the close with a 0.6% increase, after being up as much as 1%. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, settling with half of its earlier gains. It made its highest close since April 4, 2022. The small-cap Russell 2000 ended practically flat.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with an 0.1% rise. That was barely enough to squeak by with its 12th consecutive daily rise, the longest win streak since February 2017.


The after-hours trading suggested a 13th gain will be difficult to obtain. Dow component **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) fell 1% after the close following [the company's earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/msft-stock-microsoft-cloud-business-boosts-q4-results/). **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) edged lower after [besting analysts' views](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-mastercard-hover-in-buy-zones-ahead-of-earnings/).


But **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), which is a big component of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, rallied more than 7% in after-hours trading after [beating second-quarter expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/googl-stock-google-earnings-news-q22023/).


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and edged lower on the NYSE from Monday's levels.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP_3x3_072523-205x300.jpg)The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 fell by one. The June 16 distribution is now too far back in time to matter for the current market analysis. That leaves the S&P and Nasdaq each with three days of higher-volume declines, which could be termed acceptable.


Earnings Movers In The Stock Market
-----------------------------------


Earnings, as usual, accounted for some of the biggest moves in the stock market Tuesday.


Airlines fell broadly, dealing a blow to what had been one of the market's leading groups.


**Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) gapped below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume after the carrier [forecast current-quarter revenue growth of 0% to 3%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alaska-air-record-revenue-stocks-1bb01637?mod=md_stockoverview_news). Shares slid nearly 10% and are back below a 51.02 buy point.


IBD's airlines industry group was the worst performer in Tuesday's stock market, down 3.6%. **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) fell 2.2%. **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) lost 3.3% and is back near its 54.05 buy point. **JetBlue** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)) fell 5.6%. Mexico-based **Volaris** ([VLRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLRS)), which also reported earnings, sold off 7.2%.


In others sectors, electrical equipment maker **Hubbell** ([HUBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBB)) tumbled 4.6%. **Hexcel** ([XHL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XHL)) gapped below the 50-day line. Fitness company **Life Time Group** ([LTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTH)) sold off more than 13%.


**RTX** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)) was the biggest loser in the S&P 500, tumbling 10.2%. The aerospace and defense company formerly called Raytheon Technologies beat Q2 estimates but [disclosed a defect in its Pratt & Whitney engines](https://www.investors.com/news/rtx-stock-raytheon-earnings-senate-debates-defense-bill/) used in Airbus A32neo planes. The problem will hurt free cash flow.


Fed Set For Another Rate Hike; What's Next?
-------------------------------------------


Most stock market traders expect the Fed to raise the fed funds rate by 25 basis points Wednesday, to a range of 5.25-5.5%. Far less certain is the outlook for future rate policy.


The U.S. economy has withstood 10 rate hikes and has avoided a recession so far. On the other hand, the manufacturing sector has weakened, and rising crude oil prices threaten to slow progress against inflation. Nymex crude rose 1.1% to $79.63, the highest level since April 18. Gasoline futures rose 1.4% to $2.8533 a gallon, the fourth-highest settle this year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Tuesday morning saw more good news on the economic front. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index climbed to a two-year high, up 6.9 points to 117.0 in July. That was better than economists expected.


"U.S. consumers are feeling happier these days," Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, noted in an analysis. "Cushioned by excess savings and a robust labor market, U.S. consumers — the biggest engine of economic growth — are holding up well."



The 10-year Treasury yield rose 5 percentage points to 3.91%.


In another bit of good news, **United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) [reached a tentative five-year labor pact](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-teamsters-reach-agreement-on-new-contract-a134c910?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1) with the Teamsters. The union's 330,000 UPS delivery drivers must still ratify the agreement, but it avoids what would have been a costly strike for U.S. supply chains and merchants. UPS stock reversed lower, closing below the 187.82 buy point.


Stock Market Internals
----------------------


Even as the Nasdaq rose, declining stocks topped advancers by a 6-to-5 ratio. Winners and losers were nearly even on the NYSE.


That doesn't necessarily disrupt a trend of broadening stock market leadership.


All 11 S&P sector indexes are up this month, but there's been a shift. Technology — which had led with a gain of nearly 40% from January to June — is lagging other sectors. Its July return is less than 3%.


The new leadership is in other sectors. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) is up more than 6%, while Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) has climbed about 5% and the utilities index is up some 4.5%.


The ratio of [52-week highs to lows](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jul-24-2023/) continues to trend bullishly.

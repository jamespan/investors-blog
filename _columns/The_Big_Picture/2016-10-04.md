  Stocks Fall As Gold, Rate-Sensitive Shares Lead Decline

Dollar- and rate-sensitive stocks led broad losses Tuesday on concerns about Brexit and interest rates, as the market extended an uneven performance.


Indexes came off session lows in the final hour, but still left the Nasdaq with a loss of 0.2%. The S&P 500 fell 0.5%. Declining stocks led winners by a 13-to-5 ratio on the NYSE and Nasdaq.


Volume increased in the major exchanges, which translated to a new [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). It was the eighth day of higher-volume selling in the S&P 500 the past few weeks â€” a number that indicates institutional investors are substantially lightening their stock holdings.


Not only is the S&P 500 burdened with distribution, but the index keeps trading below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). That line is starting to curve downward, all of which paints a delicate picture.


![mp100416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP100416-196x300.jpg)At the same time, however, the Nasdaq is holding above its 50-day line and has notched a tolerable four distribution days in the past five weeks. The Russell 2000 has traced a similar chart, as small-caps and the technology and medical sectors have made a push for leadership the past few weeks.


With indexes diverging, it's difficult to conclude that a market top is at hand. Moreover, leading stocks continue to perform satisfactorily.


The IBD 50 fell a mere 0.1% and there was little to be concerned about among the 50 stocks. **Nautilus** ([NLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NLS)) slid below its 50-day line and erased all gains from its 21.49 buy point, which is a sell signal. **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)), the only REIT in the IBD 50, fell 2.5% in lighter-than-usual volume.


Chinese stocks on the list did particularly well. **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) and **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) climbed 1.5% to nearly 11% as the technology leaders remained firm.


Tuesday's trading contributed to the S&P 500's woes as metals and utilities led Wall Street lower.


A chain of events was unleashed in Europe, where the British government set a March target date to withdraw from the European Union. Details showed the Brexit could restrict access to the European Union's single market. The British pound fell to the lowest level since 1985.


As the pound weakened, the dollar climbed, reaching a two-month high.


The benchmark yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 1.69% after Bloomberg reported that the European Central Bank will likely start tapering asset purchases to wean itself off quantitative easing.


Assets sensitive to interest rates and the dollar were among the weakest Tuesday. December-delivery gold closed down 3.3% to $1,269.70 an ounce, the biggest one-day drop since December 2013. The **SPDR Gold Trust** ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) ETF skidded 3.5% to the lowest level since June.


Mining and steel industry groups tumbled 3% to 9%. IBD's four utility industry groups fell 2% to 3%. The jump in bond yields hurt utility shares, which often act as a substitute for bonds, John Bartlett, a portfolio manager and utility analyst with New Jersey-based Reaves Asset Management, told IBD Tuesday. Such moves tend to be short-term, and the third quarter figures to be a positive one for utility earnings, he added.


Real estate investment trusts, another bloc that often moves with interest rates, were laggards as well. The property REIT industry group has dropped in six weeks from 70th to 131st (out of 197 groups) in [IBD's industry rankings](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-oct-03-2016/). Scores of stocks in those groups have been breaking below their 50-day moving averages.

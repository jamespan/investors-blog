The stock market dove Thursday after a stronger-than-expected third-quarter GDP reading, but ended off session lows. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell to its lowest level since early November. On Friday, investors will shift their attention to more inflation data, with the release of November's personal consumption expenditures figures.




Jobless Claims, Q3 GDP
----------------------


The Labor Department said Thursday that initial jobless claims rose to 216,000, below estimates for a rise to 225,000 vs. 211,000 in the prior week. Also, the Commerce Department reported another estimate of third-quarter GDP and it came in stronger than expected. This third estimate showed growth of 3.2% vs. the second estimate's 2.9%.


Early Friday, key inflation data is due out in the form of the November personal consumption expenditures price index.


[Econoday consensus expects](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) 0.2% growth vs. October. That would mark deceleration from a 0.3% increase in the prior reporting period.


Deceleration in inflation is expected year over year at 5.5% in November for the same index, vs. a 6% bump higher in October.


The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 3.66% Thursday, pausing after a four-day win streak saw the 10-year yield climb from 3.45% to 3.68%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP122222_2-261x300.jpg)On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.05% and the S&P 500 declined 1.45%. The Nasdaq dumped 2.2% while the small-cap Russell 2000 lost 1.3%.


Volume rose on both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 vs. the prior session. The increased volume results in a new distribution day on both indexes. So, the distribution count is even more elevated, a bearish sign.


IBD's stock [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains at "uptrend under pressure" following sharp losses in recent sessions. That means investors should be maintaining cautious and defensive stances, with an already reduced market exposure. IBD readers should be avoiding most breakouts, unless they occur in stocks with top-notch fundamentals and technicals.


Even so, it's best to start with a smaller position due to the tendency for breakouts to quickly fail. Meanwhile, further losses on the major stock indexes would push them below their early November lows, which are key levels to watch.


 


Instead of tuning out in this difficult market environment, investors should be using the relative strength line to find the next cycle of market leaders. Remember, the [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500 and is the blue line on every IBD chart.


If the market is down, good stocks will outperform by treading water. When the market rebounds, stocks with the best relative strength should bounce back even stronger than the market.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 1.5% Thursday as the ETF hit another new low. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), retailers **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) were rare gainers, rising 1.7% and 1.05%, respectively. Both stocks are rebounding from their 50-day moving average lines.



Energy Stocks Outperform; Chip Stocks Tumble On Micron Earnings
---------------------------------------------------------------


Energy stocks outperformed Thursday as crude oil prices continued to rebound. Dow Jones energy giant **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) declined 1.5%, but is building a flat base with a 189.78 buy point. Meanwhile, **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) is approaching a cup-with-handle's 40.09 buy point. RS lines have improved on both stocks since early December.


On the downside, chip stocks were weak after **Micron****Technology**'s ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) bearish earnings and sales results on Wednesday evening. MU stock dropped more than 3.4% after the [memory-chip maker missed estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mu-stock-micron-technology-misses-targets/) for its fiscal first quarter amid a cyclical downturn. The chip industry bellwether also predicted current-quarter results that were far below analyst views.


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) tumbled 5.6%, breaking below its 50-day line. And **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) dove more than 7% but is still above its 50-day moving average.

3 Stock Market Leaders Set Up New Buy Points: Caterpillar, Medpace, Texas Roadhouse
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Dow Jones leader **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) broke out past a flat base's 239.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) this week, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). But shares gave up that entry Thursday during the session's 1.7% slide. Bullishly, the RS line hit a new high on the breakout day, confirming the heavy equipment maker as a market leader.


Don't forget that the stock market outlook is an "uptrend under pressure," so breakouts carry additional risk.


**Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) bounced sharply from its 50-day line this week, rising for a third straight day, to 211.34. For now, the correct buy point looms at 235.82, but an earlier entry at 220.09 is also in play.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) offers a buy point at 101.85 as a result of a forming flat base. But shares have given up their 50-day line in recent sessions, which is now a key resistance area to watch. If the stock is able to regain that benchmark, then a fresh breakout attempt could be on the horizon.

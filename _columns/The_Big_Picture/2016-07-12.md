Buyers were in control again Tuesday as the market uptrend, confirmed by the S&P 500 on June 30, showed no signs of letting up.


The Nasdaq composite extended its winning streak to five sessions, rising 0.7%. It also gapped up for the third straight session and took out the 5000 level, a key technical development. The S&P 500 and Dow hit all-time highs with gains of 0.7% each. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 1.3%. The index closed above the 1200 level for the first time this year.


Advancing stocks topped decliners on both exchanges by nearly 3 to 1. The IBD 50 added 0.5%.

Tuesday's gains came in higher volume. Also, the new-high list has been expanding nicely in recent days, offering up more leadership beyond safe-haven, dividend-paying stocks. Much of the leadership has been coming from IBD 50 names. Big gainers Tuesday included **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)), **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)), **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)).


Airlines shrugged off a big jump in oil prices, focusing instead on an upbeat outlook from **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) alongside comments from **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) that said credit-card deals with **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Barclays** ([BCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCS)) would add $1.55 billion to pretax income over the next 2 1/2 years. Shares of American vaulted 11%. United soared 9%.


Oil and gas names dominated the action as benchmark West Texas intermediate crude oil for August delivery jumped nearly 5% to $46.80 a barrel. The move was helped by U.S. dollar weakness and continued supply concerns in Nigeria. Others said the rally was just an oversold bounce after oil hit a two-month low Monday.


There's a slew of stocks in the oil and gas sector showing relative strength and supporting action at their 10-week moving averages. Others are setting up for potential breakouts. Most, however, are light on fundamentals.


Among drillers, **Diamond Offshore** ([DO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DO)) and **Helmerich & Payne** ([HP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HP)) are near buy points.


Meanwhile, oil and gas producer **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) is setting up in a flat base with a 96.11 buy point. A positive element of the base is bullish support during the week ended July 1 when it reversed higher and ended near its session high in above-average volume.


**Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) is setting up in a big cup-with-handle base with a 46.79 entry, but a Composite Rating of 47 doesn't stir much excitement.


There's no question the sector is providing solid leadership in the market. At one point Tuesday, seven out of 10 oil- and gas-related industry groups -- rated by IBD based on six-month price performance -- placed in the top 20% of IBD's 197 industry group rankings.


Avoid the common pitfall of targeting a stock just because of a bullish chart. A consistent track record of earnings and sales growth, high return on equity and solid profit margin should also be in place with any stock under consideration.


The good news for growth investors is that the market is offering up plenty of other leadership in sectors that house stocks with strong fundamentals and technicals.


Software maker **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)) followed through after Monday's breakout, rising 3%.


**Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) romped to another new high despite a failed breakout. Shares rose 5%, bringing its two-session gain to 17%. The highly regarded new issue tried to clear an entry at 43.20, but a weak market wouldn't let it. It's now broken out past a 45.85 buy point.


**Insteel Industries** ([IIIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIIN)) picked up nearly 3% to 31.43. It's near the top of a cup-shaped base with a 32.21 entry.


**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) are other top-rated growth names working on sound bases.

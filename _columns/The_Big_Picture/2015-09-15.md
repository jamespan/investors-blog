Stocks staged a strong rally Tuesday ahead of the start of a critical two-day Fed meeting. Helped in part by transportation and media stocks, the S&P 500 led the way with a 1.3% pop. It recouped all of Monday's loss and then some. The Nasdaq rallied 1.1%, lifted by Internet, software and chip equipment stocks. Both indexes had their best showing since the Sept. 8 follow-through day.

  

The Dow climbed 1.4% with 29 of 30 components finishing higher. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) was the only decliner.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, matching the gain in the Nasdaq. But in a solid uptrend, small caps should outperform the major averages. The index's recent lagging action suggests that risk is not fully back on.

  

The IBD 50 climbed 1.2%. About 43 of its issues ended higher on the day.

  

Volume rose across the board from Monday's soft pace. The higher trade was nice, but turnover was still below average again. Breadth was strong, with winners beating losers by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq and NYSE.

  

Stocks climbed amid a mixed round of economic data. Retail sales rose less than expected in August, but July sales were revised higher.

  

Manufacturing activity in the New York area was far worse than expected. And industrial production was also disappointing.

  

Still, Tuesday showed constructive action ahead of Wednesday's start of the two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. But the decision on whether or not to raise rates for the first time in nine years will be out Thursday at around 2 p.m. ET. (See [Will The Fed Take A Hike? Why Yellen May Surprise You](http://news.investors.com/economy/091515-771177-federal-reserve-rate-hike-economists-investors-diverge.htm))

  

The Fed's decision comes amid an environment of improving conditions and low inflation domestically. But concerns about slowing global growth, especially in China, linger.

  

On Tuesday, the CME's FedWatch tool put the chance for a rate hike at 25%, up from 23.1% Monday.

  

While everyone is waiting on the Fed, note that a 0.25% increase would not necessarily be a bad thing. Rates would be just coming off the rock-bottom levels of many years. But Thursday's decision will at least remove a layer of uncertainty in the market. Also, it's only after a series of big rate hikes that the stock market tends to falter.

  

Some leading stocks showed strength as the market rebounded. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) retook a 39.27 buy point with gusto. It showed resilience in recent weeks by trading mostly sideways amid market volatility. But the stock fell after hours on news of a share offering.

  

Because the latest market correction was so short, there's not many buyable bases around. But it's OK to buy if a stock retakes a buy point from a prior base.

  

Investors also can look for secondary setups. **Post Holdings** ([POST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POST)) cleared a 67.50 entry from a three-weeks-tight pattern.

  

With the market already under pressure, investors should tread cautiously. Buying stocks is fine, but sell rules must be followed.

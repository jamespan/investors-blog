title: Bears Stir, But Most Breakouts Hold Firm

Bears stepped back into the picture Friday as the stock market tumbled in a conflicted fashion.




The Nasdaq lost 1.6% and the S&P 500, 0.9%. Blue chips held together a bit better as the Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.8%. Small caps dived 1.7% in the S&P 600.


Volume in the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) was what added uncertainty to the day's action. Nasdaq trade fell for a second day in a row, suggesting institutions weren't aggressively selling. But NYSE volume rose Friday, suggesting the opposite.


The S&P 500's action slapped the index with a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), a sign of institutional selling.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MP_1_110918-267x300.jpg)Ambiguity clouds the current uptrend. The Nasdaq's 2.6% pop Wednesday turned IBD's market outlook from correction to confirmed uptrend.


However, distribution soon after a follow-through day is usually bad news. Such uptrends are vulnerable to rolling over.


Also troubling was the Nasdaq's momentary drop below Tuesday's close. The composite closed with little left from Wednesday's follow-through. The S&P 500 traded under the follow-through day's low but closed above it. The Dow held above Wednesday's low.


The correction began with vertical knifing action, which can take more time to recover from than a more orderly descent.


Breakouts In The Stock Market
-----------------------------


Recent breakouts show quite a few stocks that are refusing to give up the fight.


Look at the weekly charts for telecom play **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)), lithium technology company **Livent** ([LTHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTHM)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)), **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), health-related real estate investment trust **HCP** ([HCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCP)), **Hormel Foods** ([HRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRL)), discount retailer **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Medical Properties Trust** ([MPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPW)), retail REIT **Realty Income** ([O](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=O)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and shoemaker **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)).


Meanwhile, leaders from the much ballyhooed FANG stocks plus **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) don't look so good on the charts now.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is 34% off its high. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is 16% below its high. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is 29% down. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is 17% off its high. Apple is best, only 13% down.


Where has the money that was in these hot stocks gone?


The recent breakouts that are holding together might provide part of the answer.


Also, stock groups with the [highest percentage of stocks at new highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/groups-with-highest-of-stocks-at-new-high-nov-08-2018/) offer evidence. About 50% of the soap stocks are at new highs. Insurance-broker stocks have 40% at new highs. Auto parts are at 38%. Long-term medical care is at 29%.


Altogether, the winning lineup looks more like a mix, even if the leadership has been defanged.

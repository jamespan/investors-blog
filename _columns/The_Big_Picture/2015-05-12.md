The stock market pared losses Tuesday, an encouraging move for a market still looking for more buyers.

  

The Nasdaq had been down as much as 1.2% in the early going and closed with a loss of 0.3%.

  

The S&P 500 also trimmed a sizable losses and also closed 0.3% lower.

  

Small caps performed a bit better, with the Russell 2000 dropping just 0.2%.

  

Losing stocks led winners by 6-to-5 on the NYSE and by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq.

  

Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.

  

The way that the indexes fought back and closed near session highs was positive.

  

Both gauges found support at their 50-day moving averages, another good sign for their charts.

  

But it didn't take away the market's persistent problems.

  

The indexes remain hobbled with distribution and no accumulation to compensate for it.

  

Some leading stocks continue to get punched severely for disappointing earnings reports. That's a troubling trend that wasn't so common in earlier market pullbacks.

  

On Tuesday, **Rackspace Holdings** ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)) plunged 13.5% after the cloud-computing company reported first-quarter revenue that missed estimates and gave a Q2 revenue forecast that also lagged views.

  

Granted, Rackspace isn't a top-tier leader like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) or **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). But its collapse was reminiscent of many institutional-quality stocks that sellers have punished during this earnings season.

  

The IBD 50 fell 0.5%. It has lagged the sputtering S&P 500 over the past two weeks.

  

**NewLink Genetics** ([NLNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NLNK)), which plunged 30%, contributed to the IBD 50's weakness.

  

The company said that it would continue studies on a pancreatic cancer treatment, raising fears that the drug is facing problems.

  

Some top-rated stocks are breaking out, although they are mainly small- and midcap companies.

  

On Tuesday, **Virtusa** ([VRTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTU)) (market cap of $1.3 billion) jumped out of a flat base in heavy trading after the IT consulting and outsourcing firm beat March-quarter fiscal Q4 profit expectations.

  

A global sell-off in bonds contributed to the Tuesday morning weakness in stocks. Analysts cited a possible Federal Reserve rate hike, other central bank moves and technical trading factors for the volatility in debt markets.

  

Crude oil topped $60 a barrel as the commodity continued a moderate bounce.

  

That seemed to hurt transportation stocks. The Dow transports slid 1.2%.

  

With indexes still near highs and some top stocks acting bullishly, it's tempting to wade in deeper into leaders. But today's elevated market risk can trump even the best chart action.

  

Many more stocks have sunk back near or below buy points than those that have made significant advances from breakouts.

  

Treat the market with skepticism until more evidence of institutional buying emerges.

Stock Market Sector Rotation Heats Up As Nasdaq Cools; These Sectors Jump
==========================================================================

The season of stock market sector rotation doesn't want to end â€” at least in the current quarter.




A day ago, amid trifling moves by the major indexes, the Nasdaq walked the bullish side of the street. But on Tuesday the tables turned.


Stock Market Today: Hot Sectors Tuesday
---------------------------------------


Commodity-focused companies basked in the winners' spotlight. Why? One reason: The Senate scored a deal to further boost the economy by passing a [$1 trillion deal to improve the nation's infrastructure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-up-over-150-points-as-senate-passes-infrastructure-bill-oil-prices-recover-while-steel-gets-a-boost/). Looking at IBD's analysis of 197 industry groups on [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), steel producers boasted brawny gains, up 7% on a price-weighted basis.


Next came metal products distributors. Mind you, this group is tiny. Yet its 5.3% gain still carries meaning. Materials handling and automation, oil drilling, metal ores, specialty alloy, coal, ship transport, construction equipment, and oil and gas machinery stocks also showed heft. They each rallied 2.9% or more on a price-weighted basis for the day.


Please see the price performance of all 197 industry groups at Investors.com by going to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).

Add those gains up, and it comes as no surprise that this time, the S&P 500 managed a small gain of 0.1%. It did so amid significant declines in the medical, software and semiconductor sectors of the stock market. The Russell 2000 did a tad better, up 0.2%. The small-cap gauge closed beneath its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the 21st session in a row.


The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) rose 0.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up almost 0.5%.


The distribution-day count decreased to a still-high six on the S&P 500. A small distribution day on July 6 expired on time. As noted in [Monday's Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-acts-dull-but-heres-what-these-leading-stocks-say-about-the-trend/), the distribution days counted over the rolling 25-session time frame have not shown the type of institutional selling that would warrant any change in the current outlook for stocks.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%. Yet the pullback looks normal. It does not disturb the status of its uptrend. Volume edged down nearly 3%. In other words, mutual funds, hedge funds, college endowment managers, insurers and banks didn't exactly hit the exits all at once.


Watch The Fed Talk In August
----------------------------


In the past, practically all of Wall Street's eyes have shifted to Jackson Hole, Wyo., where the annual "work-cation" meeting of leading central bankers from around the globe gather to network. Last year's in-person event turned into a virtual one due to the pandemic. But this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City announced in May its plans to proceed with a modified, in-person gathering, known as the Economic Policy Symposium, on Aug. 26 to 28.


The Federal Reserve may drop new clues about the future of monetary policy. Of course, any news from there will have serious implications for the stock market and the greater economy.


George Mateyo, chief investment officer at Cleveland-based Key Private Bank, told IBD that his team's allocation strategy toward equities has not changed since mid-January. (Read more about the strategy in this [Jan. 12 Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-today-smid-caps-make-another-big-splash-what-money-manager-is-watching/).) But after the robust monthly U.S. payrolls report issued on Friday, he thinks the Fed will have to signal clearly when it will begin tapering the monthly purchases of long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.


This new form of "quantitative easing" has helped keep interest rates ultralow, encouraging investors to seek financial assets that deliver a bigger return.


On Tuesday, the yield on the key 10-year government bond rose an additional 2 basis points to 1.34%.


Get Your Economic Antennas Up
-----------------------------


"(Fed chief) Jerome Powell has said he'd like to see further improvement in the economy. We've got that," Mateyo said. Key Private Bank manages $47.7 billion in client assets. As for the mood of Key's clients, "I think people are cautiously optimistic about things. We still see some trepidation regarding the delta variant of Covid-19 during the fall, when it's back-to-school season."


That said, Mateyo suggests that the duration of potential lockdowns to prevent the spread of this highly viral, deadly strain of coronavirus perhaps won't last as long as the initial strains that sent parts of the economy into the worst recession in decades.


In the more immediate future, get ready for another dose of inflation news.


U.S. consumer price data for July comes out early Wednesday. The [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) calls for a month-to-month increase of 0.5% vs. June. That would mark a smaller monthly increase vs. the 0.9% sprint higher in June vs. May.


Year over year, economists think the CPI index will jump 5.5%, slightly accelerating the 5.4% increase in June. Core consumer-level prices might rise 0.4% month on month.


Another Stock Market Sector Heating Up
--------------------------------------


The stock market is like a daily voting machine on the economy. And one cannot help ignore the strength in apparel makers and omni-channel retail leaders.


Just take a look at the bullish moves lately by names such as **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Dillard's** ([DDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDS)), **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) and Dow industrials stock **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). Athletic clothing titans **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)), and luxury apparel giant **Capri** ([CPRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRI)), formerly known as Michael Kors, currently act like leaders.


Some of these have a weak [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/), no doubt. When a stock has essentially been going sideways for a year, you cannot expect the rating to be in the 80s, let alone the 90s. So keep an eye on the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) and the formation of [good bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).



Target, a former member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), has now cruised 110% higher after speeding past a 126.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a large, [well-shaped cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in late July last year.


Since then, TGT etched a pair of [flat bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/), a [mild double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), and most recently a [3-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) with a 263.56 entry. This follow-on buy point, however, carries more risk given that the stock has already doubled since that terrific breakout in the summer of 2020.

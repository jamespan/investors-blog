The stock market fell Friday to cap a week of major earnings reports with moderate losses. Still, indexes stretched a multi-month advance that begs the question: How much longer will it last?




The Nasdaq composite lost 0.7%, and much of it could be blamed on **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). The online retailer tumbled more than 7% after its [second-quarter sales missed views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-on-watch-with-quarterly-earnings-due/) and the company gave a disappointing forecast for the third quarter. The stock gapped below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) in heavy volume, falling to the lowest price since June 10.


The S&P 500 fell 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and cooled on the NYSE. So, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


While the week ended on a whimper and it was a down week overall, the stock market remained in a remarkable long-term advance. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have now climbed eight of the past nine months. The S&P 500 made it six straight months of gains, the longest streak since April-September 2018.

Can Stock Market Stretch Monthly Gains?
---------------------------------------


MP073021
--------


All three indexes made record highs during the week. The stock market's extended runs raise the odds of a top with each passing month. Investors face some crosscurrents. The economic rebound still is in place, but there are signs the expansion is slowing.


Already, small caps are showing some fatigue. The small-cap rally that looked unbeatable November through February is slowing. The Russell 2000 snapped a nine-month win streak, falling 3.6% for the month. On Friday, the Russell 2000 lost 0.6%.


The five largest stocks have a heavy influence on the stock market, which is why their quarterly results weighed so much on Wall Street. Only **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) ended with a weekly gain, and at new highs.


Two Stocks Cost IBD 50
----------------------


The IBD 50 fell 1%, though much of its loss was at the hands of just two stocks.



**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) plummeted more than 18% after the social media company [missed user growth estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinterest-quarterly-results-topple-estimates-but-user-growth-misses/). The stock gapped below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. **Translate Bio** ([TBIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBIO)) plunged more than 22%, erasing practically all of its 34% July gain. There was no news about the biotech on the financial wires.


**Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) was the best-performing stock in the IBD 50. The orthodontics company rallied for a second-straight day after [second-quarter earnings and sales topped expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/algn-stock-align-technology-earnings-q2-2021/). The stock is now extended from a 629.45 buy point in a cup with handle.


It's not on the IBD 50, but **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) soared nearly 22% after the [software maker's earnings topped estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/atlassian-stock-jumps-as-earnings-beat-outlook-tops-views-amid-cloud-transition/) and the company forecast higher-than-expected subscription revenue for its fiscal 2022.


The coming week will continue to feature more earnings reports, with more than 600 companies reporting.

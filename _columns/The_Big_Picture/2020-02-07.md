title: Stock Market Dips On China Growth Fears; Fed Sees 'New Risk'

Sellers came into the stock market Friday as fears about slowing growth in China related to the coronavirus outbreak weighed on sentiment. But it was a bullish week overall for the stock market. The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials ended with weekly gains ranging from 3% to 4%.




In a semiannual report to Congress released Friday, the Federal Reserve said the coronavirus outbreak presents a "new risk" to the U.S. economy. Money flowed into bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 6 basis points to 1.58%.


Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will discuss the economy and monetary policy in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were hit the hardest, down 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 gave back 0.5% each. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than on Thursday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP020720-250x300.jpg)Before the open, Wall Street got more positive economic data when the Labor Department said [nonfarm payrolls increased 225,000 in January](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-us-economy-225000-jobs-wage-growth-dow-jones/). That was nicely above the consensus estimate of 160,000. The unemployment rate ticked higher to 3.6%, while average hourly wage growth increased 3.1%. Despite better wage growth, average weekly pay gains slowed to 2.5%, hurt by shorter workweeks.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


That the stock market was up sharply for the week shouldn't come as a big surprise.


Amid some yellow flags, the action in leading growth stocks remains solid. Sell signals have been few and far between, with many leaders holding gains after breakouts. Others are finding support at their 10-week moving averages.


Indeed, it's hard to get overly bearish on the stock market when looking at the charts of **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Also keep in mind that bullish sentiment among newsletter writers has dropped of a cliff, from 59.4% to 52.8% to 47.6%. Excessive bullish sentiment has been seen near several market tops in the past, but it's certainly not excessive now.

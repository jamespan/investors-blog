Stocks Shift To Under Pressure As Leaders Take A Beating

Stock indexes covered the gamut from flat to up to down Friday, with a barrelful of top-rated stocks taking hard hits. The Nasdaq slashed 0.6% lower, while the S&P 500 was essentially flat. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%, helped by **Nike's** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) 4% gain.

  

The IBD 50 slid 0.9%.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges. Friday was a Russell rebalancing day, which usually boosts trade.

  

Distribution again became a factor as the Nasdaq added a day while the S&P 500 dodged more technical damage. The negative action was sufficient to shift the market outlook to uptrend under pressure, which is a yellow caution light for investors.

  

Perhaps even more disturbing than the action of the indexes were the big losses Friday in strong volume among leaders.

  

A few of the day's big losers were leaders that heretofore had avoided trouble.

  

For example, **Vasco Data Security International** ([VDSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDSI)) cleared a handle on June 3 and rose nearly 25% in three weeks. On Friday, the stock dived almost 8% in heavy volume, its worst one-day loss in almost four months.

  

Illinois-based Vasco provides authentication and e-signature products and services. Computer security is a hot spot in [the current stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today).

  

Chipmaker **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)), which had risen as much as 13% from a May 18 buy point, suffered its biggest one-day loss in three months.

  

**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), which had gained as much as 18% from a June 3 buy point, slouched 5% for the week, its biggest weekly loss in three months.

  

Chips and security software, both strong groups, were among the Friday's worst performers.

  

On the upside, two stocks managed breakouts despite the market's headwinds.

  

Upscale home-furnishings provider **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) cleared a 99.09 buy point in volume 163% above average.

  

**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) topped a 114.10 entry in a flat base in twice its usual trade.

  

Buying a high-conviction stock during a pressured uptrend is OK, but caution is the predominant rule.

  

This means getting off margin, taking good profits that risk fading to mediocrity and raising cash where appropriate.

  

An investor needn't wait for an 8% loss to stop the bleeding on a struggling stock. If one is acting suspiciously, selling for a small gain or small loss is prudent.

  

In the current uptrend, which was confirmed May 14, about two dozen highly rated stocks broke out in the first four weeks afterward. Only a third rose by 10% or more above the buy point, and only Vasco crossed the 20% profit target.

  

That has left IBD-style investors with a tricky market to negotiate, although on the plus side, only **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) triggered the 8% sell rule.

  

The lesson of this uptrend appears to be to take that 10% to 15% profit while it's there because it will soon crumble.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 shed 1.6%. The Nasdaq eased 0.7%, while the S&P 500 edged down 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average also fell 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 took the smallest step back, losing 0.1% for the week.

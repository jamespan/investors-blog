With U.S.-China trade negotiations at a delicate moment, the U.S. stock market plunged Tuesday, leaving its outlook clouded.




Indexes closed near session lows. The Nasdaq composite sold off 2%, its worst day since Feb. 22. The S&P 500 slid 1.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8%, its worst loss since Jan. 3.


Selling was broad, with declining stocks over advancers by a 17-4 ratio on the NYSE and by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. All 11 S&P sectors fell. Volume rose, which gave the market a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP_050719-265x300.jpg)The number of distribution days (four on each major index) is not so bad, but the fast deterioration of the market and of some leading stocks led IBD to downgrade its market outlook Tuesday. The market uptrend is now "under pressure," which means investors must raise their defenses.


Be sure to [sell any stock that falls 7% or 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) below your purchase price. Watch out for stocks breaking below the 50-day moving average in big volume. Taking some profits is smart, especially with stocks up more than 20% from their entries. Buying stocks becomes riskier than normal, and investors need to reserve buys only for exceptional cases.


Indexes are suddenly breaking below long price trends. The S&P 500 last week fell below a trend line touching the main lows since the December market bottom. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, pierced a similar trend line this week.


For weeks, the story from Washington was that U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators were nearing an accord. But over the weekend, President Trump expressed frustration with talks and threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese imports.


Wall Street opened sharply lower Monday, but trimmed most of its losses, as if to shrug off the new trade worries. The scene was starkly different Tuesday. U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer said late Monday that [Beijing had backtracked on key commitments](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tariff-threat-china-trade-talks-dow-jones/).


The tension could last a couple more days. On Thursday, President Trump's top trade officials will meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. If China doesn't make enough concessions, the U.S. plans to escalate tariffs at midnight.


Bargain hunters didn't show up Tuesday like they did Monday.


Investors fled to safe havens. Bond prices rose, as the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased 5 basis points to 2.44%. Utilities and consumer staples were lower but showed relative strength. Gold prices and gold-producer stocks were some of the best performing assets.


The Next Key Signals For Stock Market
-------------------------------------


What's next? Wall Street figures to be on edge this week, watching the trade talks as closely as any time this year. So news could drive the market's short-term direction. There are still a lot of earnings reports left to be announced.


Absent any major headlines, indexes need to hold key levels to avoid further damage. The S&P 500 is nearing a touch of the 50-day moving average around 2855; the Nasdaq is farther off but may also hit the 50-day average. Already, the Nasdaq fell back below the 8000 level, which is significant.


Volatility spiked, which actually could be a good sign. The [CBOE Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) spiked Tuesday to levels where the market has bottomed in the past. Some of those "bottoms" were short-lived, especially during the bear market last year.


The IBD 50 fell 2.1% — not bad considering the market rout. No specific sell signals appeared on the IBD 50 stocks.


But some top leaders are wobbling. **Microchip Tech** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) is close to wiping out a 10% gain from its 91.92 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). That would trigger a sell signal. **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) remains hobbled after sliding below the 50-day line March 26.


Outside the IBD 50, Alibaba ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) closed below its 50-day line. **KLA Corp.** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) plunged below its 50-day average after reporting earnings.

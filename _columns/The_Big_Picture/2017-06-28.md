  Stocks Up; Nasdaq Shows It's Still The Leader, But One Thing Was Missing

A rebound off the 50-day moving average? Check. Good action by the true market leaders? Check. More sector participation? Check.




Yet even though U.S. equities enjoyed broad gains on Wednesday, volume fell about 5% on the Nasdaq and a bit less so on the NYSE vs. the prior session. This decline made the day on Wall Street feel less than complete, sort of like a child's birthday cake with no decorative frosting.


The Nasdaq composite heartened the bulls, rising more than 1.4% and recouping a healthy chunk of the nearly 1.9% sell-off that took place in the prior two sessions. The tech-rich index showed muscle right when it needed to, lifting above its still steadily rising 50-day moving average. Ditto for the Nasdaq 100, which rose 1.4% too.


That advance outdid a 0.9% lift for the S&P 500 and a nearly 0.7% gain for the Dow Jones industrial average. Regarding the latter, at least seven of the 30 Dow stocks rallied 1 point or more, including three financial names: **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)).


Without question, the Nasdaq remains the undisputed premier index of fast-growing companies, and its year-to-date performance proves it. The composite, at 6234, is up 15.8% since Jan. 1 vs. a 9.0% rise for the 500.


Small caps enjoyed the biggest advance on Wednesday; the Russell 2000 smartened up nearly 1.6% while the S&P SmallCap 600 gained 1.5%. Yet after a fantastic 2016, these two gauges of equities in the market value range of $5 billion and less are lagging the big-cap-centric Nasdaq.


A solid bull market is like a sturdy stool: It must have at least three strong legs. Over the past seven months, top-quality names in the internet, chip and software sectors have acted as those three legs.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MP062817-167x300.png)But lately, the market has flashed a few subtle signs that a few names in these groups are tiring. As seen in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and among those stocks formerly in these two growth screens, some of these true market leaders have cleaved their 50-day moving averages (see **Advanced Energy Industries** ([AEIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEIS)), **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)), **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO))). Some are showing more volatile, erratic action, especially so on their daily charts (eye **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY))). And a few others have stumbled soon after their breakouts.


So, the rally in banking names was a good sign for stocks, especially given the way techs sold hard earlier this week.


On IBD's [Leaderboard premium service](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/), the triple-leveraged ETF Direxion Financial Bull ([FAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAS)) posted one of the top gains within the current group of eight names, rising almost 3.8%. The highly liquid ETF, with an average dollar volume of $125 million, is on the verge of a breakout from a new cup-with-handle pattern at 49.60.


In after-hours trade Wednesday, FAS ran up even more on news that **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) is going to double its cash dividend following a successful second round of stress tests done by the Federal Reserve. Its quarterly payout of 16 cents a share translates into an annualized yield of 1.0%.


That's too low for the Wall Street and consumer lending global giant to qualify in IBD's strong-performing [Dividend Leaders screen](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/dividend-leaders-jun-28-2017/). (Access this screen by going to Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.)


All of the stocks making this screen not only have a dividend yield that is beating the S&P 500 (currently around 1.9%), but also boast very stable profits, one of the cores of a steady cash return to shareholders.



Yet Citi stands a good chance of gaining Dividend Leaders status in the future if the bank follows through on sharply boosting its dividend. The 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 10 on a scale of zero (highly steady) to 99 (highly volatile) is very good.


The stock seemed to be spinning its wheels after attempting a breakout from a 10-week flat base with a 62.63 buy point on May 25. Notice how on that day, Citi finished lower, then had yet another rendezvous with its 50-day moving average. However, the decline halted right at that intermediate-term support line, and Citi's breakout looks much better now.


At 65.18, Citi has now risen 4% past the proper entry. Not a grand gain, but see it as sort of frosting on the nice cake of gains since the former big innovator of ATMs initially broke out of a first-stage long cup with handle at 48.28 during the week ended Oct. 7 last year. Since that buy point, the advance is 35%.


Go back even a little bit earlier, and you could argue on Aug. 5, Citi had broken out of a three-month cup-with-handle base that featured a 45.13 entry, 10 cents above the handle's intraday high.


Go to [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-citigroup-inc-c.aspx), type in 'C' and hit 'Enter.' Do you see the doctor's frowning face at Citi's 75 Composite Rating and 79 for EPS? The sour face is justified. As a growth stock maven, you want to seek the very best companies in terms of earnings and sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity. But Citi, like many other banks, is a turnaround play. And the stock's 86 RS Rating is in fact something to smile about.


Keep an eye on the [biotechs](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/apple-biotechs-lead-nasdaq-rebound-5-more-leaders-are-showing-resilience/) as well. Do you remember the last time any politician has tweeted harsh words about what the drug firms are charging for livesaving medicines? And watch for upcoming results of late-stage clinical trials and the next wave of quarterly results coming in July and August.

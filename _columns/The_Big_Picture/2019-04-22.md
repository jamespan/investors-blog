Large-Cap Tech Stocks Outperform, As This FANG Leader Nears New Buy
====================================================================

The Nasdaq composite — and top growth stocks — showed solid price behavior Monday. The Nasdaq opened lower before reversing into positive territory, sharply diverging from the other major stock indexes.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined as much as 0.4% in morning trade, but closed with a 0.2% gain — a solid upside reversal. Large-cap tech stocks — represented by the Nasdaq 100 — moved up 0.3%. The Nasdaq 100 is just off a record high and already back above its previous highs set on Oct. 1.


The other major stock indexes didn't fare nearly as well. The S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher, while the Dow Jones industrials fell just under 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000, meanwhile, declined nearly 0.4% as small caps continue to diverge from the main indexes. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Thursday's levels.


Top Growth Stocks Perk Up
-------------------------



The IBD 50 gained about 0.7%, sharply outperforming the major stock indexes Monday. [Within the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), recently embattled software stocks showed a sudden surge in strength, while **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) was the IBD 50's top performer with a 6.2% gain. The advertising platform is rebounding from its 10-week line and is just 2% off its 52-week high.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP042219-236x300.jpg)Software stars **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) snapped back with advances of 4.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Veeva found support near its 10-week moving average.


Atlassian remains under its 10-week line after Thursday's more than 8% gap-down on earnings. Ideally, Atlassian will form a new base, allowing investors to buy the stock at a proper buy point. But even then, it would take at least several weeks to form a new pattern.


This FANG Stock Nears Breakout
------------------------------


FANG stocks were back in business Monday. All four FANG members outperformed the major stock indexes, led by Netflix's 4.7% gain. Netflix stock reclaimed a 371.59 cup-with-handle entry. It is also approaching a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) new 379.10 buy point.


Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is in the 5% buy range above a saucer with handle's 1,236.54 entry. Shares rose 1%.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) continues to move up the right side of a deep new base. Earnings are due out Wednesday after the stock market's close. Facebook stock moved up 1.8%.


Lastly, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//) stock **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is extended from a flat base's 1,736.51 buy point after Monday's 1.4% rise. Shares are just 8% off their 52-week high after declining as much as 36% in late December.


New Breakouts + New Stocks = New Opportunities
----------------------------------------------



Within a solid uptrend, investors should continue to see a variety of top growth stocks carry the leadership mantle. In Monday's stock market, defense supplier **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) and oil and gas equipment maker **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) cleared buy points.


Mercury rose 4.6% to close at 70.37, in the 5% buy range of a cup base's 67.95 buy point. Volume jumped nearly 200% above average.


[IPO Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) Cactus broke out today above a cup with handle's 38.78 buy point with a 4.5% move, as crude oil prices rose more than 2%. Turnover nearly doubled the average daily volume. Cactus stock is in buy range. The energy sector, in fact, was Monday's best performing as the price of crude oil rose nearly 3% to $65.70 a barrel. The Trump administration on Monday said [it won't extend waivers for any country on sanctions](https://www.investors.com/news/iran-sanctions-oil-waivers-expire-crude-oil-prices/) for importing Iranian oil.



Meanwhile, the IPO market is showing signs of strength. **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) [debuted on Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zoom-stock-ipo-trading-pinterest/), closing at 62 — more than 72% above the stock's 36 IPO price. Zoom gained 6% to hit a new high Monday.


Elsewhere, **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) hit a post-IPO high before paring gains to 2.4% at the market close. Pinterest also debuted on Thursday. While Pinterest is certainly not profitable at this point, revenue growth is strong — a common trait for many of this year's winning IPOs. For 2018, Pinterest sales grew 60% to $756 million.


Remember the key rule to investing in IPOs: Be patient and wait for an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). An IPO base is on the verge of forming for April 4 new-issue **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)). The company has two years of increasing annual earnings, a positive fundamental quality.


Be mindful of earnings season. It's the quarterly time of the year when the cream of growth stocks rises to the top. On the downside, earnings disappointments can send stocks tumbling, like Atlassian's sell-off last week.

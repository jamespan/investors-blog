  Stocks Extend Gains, But Now They Test These Critical Levels

The rally may be moderating, but Tuesday's market action showed that stocks continue to be remarkably resilient.




The market overcame an afternoon dip and closed higher, extending the major indexes' win streaks to four days. For the second day in a row, the Dow Jones industrial average led, adding 0.6%. The S&P 500 climbed more than 0.3%.


The Nasdaq composite barely escaped a loss. It ended the day with a fractional increase thanks to some late-day buying. Volume fell across the board.


The composite lagged despite strength in semiconductors, solar companies and **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)). The soda and snacks giant — one of the 10 largest components on the Nasdaq — surged 4.7% to the highest level since mid-March after second-quarter [earnings beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/pepsi-earnings-pepsico-salty-snacks-boost/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP071018-252x300.jpg)If the Nasdaq's performance was dull, the Russell 2000's was outright poor. The small-cap benchmark hit a record high at the open, then reversed lower. It closed with a loss of 0.5%. Regional banks were broadly weaker Tuesday, a key reason for the Russell's lag.


After bouncing from a pullback to their 50-day moving averages, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are moderating their gains. This is occurring just as the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell come up against prior resistance levels.


The S&P 500 is testing the June high of 2791, and on Tuesday closed slightly above it. The index also happens to be near 2800, where it met resistance in mid-March. That's been its major barrier this year: Since the February market correction, the S&P 500 has not been able to breach 2801.


The Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 also are challenging their respective June highs. It can be normal to find some weakness when indexes test important prior highs. So watch how both indexes react at their key levels this week.


A major takeaway from Tuesday was the resilience major indexes are showing even when facing formidable obstacles.


The Wall
--------


A brewing trade war with China, the EU and other trading partners threatens multiple industries and may eventually hurt the overall economy. Reports late Tuesday said [the U.S. is preparing tariffs on about $200 billion](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/trump-china-tariffs-200-billion-dow-jones-apple-boeing-tesla-fall/) worth of Chinese imports.


Portions of the yield curve among U.S. Treasury bonds are flattening some, causing worries about the broad economy. The tenor of North Korea-U.S. talks on nuclear power cooled after North Korea accused the U.S. of bullying at the negotiating table.

All those can be considered cinder blocks in the proverbial wall of worry that the stock market climbs. Such worries can lead investors astray, and the market has a history of making fools of those who ignore the major indexes and leading stocks.


Speaking of leading stocks, it was a sub-par day for the IBD 50, down 0.2%.  Chinese stocks **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) and **Huazhu Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) fell 3%.


Energy Heats Up
---------------


The energy sector stared off promising but faded. The price of oil pared gains on word that the U.S. may relax restrictions on oil purchases from Iran. Several oil stocks tried to break out but ended below buy points.


**Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) closed just below its 83.89 buy point. Volume was 30% below average, and the relative strength line did not make a new high.


**Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), **Transocean** ([RIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIG)), **SM Energy** ([SM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SM)) and **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) poked above buy points but all ended below entries. But [IBD 50 member](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Viper Energy** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) held above its buy point, even though volume was merely average.

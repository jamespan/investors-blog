  Dow Jones, Small Caps Beat Nasdaq; Which Sectors Will Rule Like Kings In 2020?

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.2% on Tuesday to notch its fourth drop of 2020. Yet, as seen in the Nasdaq's other three profit-taking sessions so far this year, it did nothing to change the overall market uptrend.




The slightly more than 0.2% loss pretty much matched the almost 0.3% backtrack by the tech-rich composite index on Friday. And it paled in comparison with a 0.8% mini-drubbing on Jan. 3, sparked by the U.S. assassination of a top Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani.


The S&P 500 edged less than 0.2% lower Tuesday, while bottom-fishing in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) shares and a 1% boost in Wall Street titan **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) helped hoist the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.1%. The real standouts on Tuesday? Small caps. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.3% and was up as much as 0.8%, notching a new 52-week high in the process.


Volume trickled less than 0.1% higher vs. Monday on the Nasdaq — up 20 million shares to 2.53 billion.


Distribution, Barely So
-----------------------


So, even if Tuesday's down day in "higher" volume met the letter of the law regarding distribution days, it surely did not satisfy the [spirit of unbridled institutional profit-taking](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) you'd expect to see in a true market sell-off.


NYSE volume rose, according to early data. But the S&P 500 did not earn a fresh distribution day since its loss did not meet the 0.2% minimum.


The Russell 2000 rallied 0.4%. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) caught its breath after a six-session run-up, sliding 0.3%.![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP_2x2_011420-190x300.jpg)


[Three companies on IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) rallied 1% or more. **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and three additional Leaders lost at least 1%.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 1.82%.


At midday, the key indexes showed a hiccup of selling on reports that the U.S. has no plans to remove any tariffs on Chinese imports until after the U.S. elections take place in November. Yet, the daily range of the Nasdaq (less than 0.8% from session low to high) and the S&P 500 (just a touch more than 0.5%) reaffirmed the day's overall mildness.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line remains in good shape since it took a real turn for the better in mid-October.


That's exactly the time when the [Oct. 15 Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-stocks-surprising-gains-market-outlook-shifts/) marked a change in the current outlook for stocks to "uptrend resumes" (the best time to buy growth stocks) from "uptrend under pressure."


Earnings Season
---------------


In the near term, the likelihood of major changes in the long-term tussle on U.S.-China trade, the U.S.-Iran conflict, and the Fed's stance on interest rates appear wafer-thin. Of course, no one can accurately predict the news each day. But for sure, the next four weeks will offer plenty of market-moving material in the form of fourth-quarter results and first quarter outlooks.


Research from Glenmede notes that the current expected Q4 drop in earnings for the S&P 500 is influenced largely by just four of the 500 components, including Boeing, **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)). Take those companies out, and the estimate improves from a 2% drop (including those firms that have in fact reported their latest quarterly results) to a 0.8% lift.


"The year 2019 was sort of a rough year for the global economy. But in Europe, we're seeing some green shoots," Michael Reynolds, investment strategy officer for the wealth management firm with $40 billion in assets managed for family offices, foundations, institutional clients and high net worth individuals, told IBD in a phone interview. And in terms of economic growth, "we think it's not only a U.S. story but a global one" for this year.

Beyond Nasdaq: Will Cyclicals Do Well?
--------------------------------------


Reynolds is closely watching results from cyclical companies. In 2019, they came back strongly after the rapid bear-market decline of Q4 2018. Cyclicals include energy, discretionary spending, industrial and materials firms.


Looking at the past five days, automaker, specialty retail, meat, RV maker, medical software, medical services, solar, enterprise software, computer hardware, wood products and database software stocks have produced the biggest gains. All of these [industry groups among the 197 tracked each day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) by IBD have rushed 4% higher or more.


Back To The Banks
-----------------



Before the open, JPMorgan reported a [30% increase in adjusted fourth-quarter profit](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/jpmorgan-earnings-citigroup-earnings-wells-fargo-earnings-q4-2019/) to $2.57 a share. That's quite a remarkable increase. It topped gains of 15% to 23% in each of the prior four quarters. Q4 revenue lifted 9% vs. a year ago. After-tax margin in the quarter rocketed 320 basis points higher to 25%.


Reynolds notes that in the banking sector, "stability is the game there in 2020." He and Jason Pride, chief investment officer in charge of private wealth at Glenmede, see the mid-single-digit earnings growth in 2019 to continue this year.


Headed into Tuesday's session, JPMorgan ranked [No. 34 in the IBD 50.](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) It pounded the S&P 500, Dow and even the Nasdaq with a 43% gain in 2019, excluding dividends.

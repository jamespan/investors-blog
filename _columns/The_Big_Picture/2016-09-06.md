The Nasdaq reached a record high Tuesday, signaling that the market is moving up after weeks of uncertain action.


The Nasdaq added 0.5%, surpassing the previous high of Aug. 23 and making a new closing high as well. Strength in internet, biotech and telecom shares gave the composite an edge.


With a major index reaching unprecedented heights, market risk has clearly lessened. For that reason, IBD's market outlook is no longer "uptrend under pressure"; the uptrend has resumed.


The S&P 500 did not make a new high but came close to one, as both indexes closed at session highs. The Russell 2000 hit a record level, too. The small-cap index has been leading the market, and the behavior of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 suggests they may now catch up to the small-cap gauge.


Volume rose on the major exchanges. Advancers led decliners by a 7-to-5 ratio on the NYSE and by 8 to 7 on the Nasdaq.


The U.S. services sector slowed to a 6-1/2-year low in August. That followed last week's reports showing a slowdown in job growth and a contraction in factory activity. None of that bothered Wall Street, which might see a lesser chance of an interest-rate hike in those economic figures.

But after a mild decline (the S&P 500 eased just two weeks), the market has shown its desire for expansion. Investors expecting a bigger decline would be foolish to fight the trend, and they should increase exposure to stocks.


But for all the bullish signs in Tuesday's trading, the market faces significant obstacles. Principally, the S&P 500 is hobbled with a half-dozen distribution days, and even the spry Nasdaq has four. That's significant institutional selling.


Investors can increase their exposure in a measured approach, buying highest-quality stocks first and adding shares as they prove themselves. Such an incremental strategy makes it easier to walk away from erroneous trades.


The IBD 50 rose 0.9%, and some of its components made enticing moves. Study these and others on the list for ideas.


**Activision-Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) broke out of bases, highlighting a strong day for digital companies.


Activision-Blizzard, the brand behind the "Call of Duty" shooter video game, cleared a 43.15 buy point in a flat base. CyberArk Shares topped its 57.67 entry. Facebook rose past the 128.43 buy point of a base-on-base pattern.


Acquisition activity stirred the market Tuesday.


**Cepheid** ([CPHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPHD)) soared nearly 53% after life-science instrument maker **Danaher** ([DHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHR)) agreed to acquire the company for $4 billion in cash, or $53 per share. **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) said it is buying two European 3D printing companies, lifting shares of U.S. 3D printer makers.

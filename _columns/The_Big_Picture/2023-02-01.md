Stocks Today Show More Lift Following Powell's Less Hawkish Stance; Is Investor Sentiment Too Bullish?
=======================================================================================================

Stocks today initially showed some bumpiness. And given that it was Fed day, investors could excuse such action. But the finish on Wednesday reaffirmed early leadership by the Nasdaq this year after a horrible performance in 2022.




The composite index held steady for the first 4-1/2 hours of trading, then swung briefly from losses to gains after the Federal Reserve, as expected, raised interest rates by a quarter point to a new target range of 4.5%-4.75%.


That marked the eighth hike by the U.S. central bank since March, when the fed funds rate got nudged up to a target of 0.25%-0.5%.


If it weren't for some last-minute profit-taking, the Nasdaq might have ended near session highs.


Yet the 2% gain in higher volume proved bullish. Wednesday's move marked a sixth subsequent follow-through since the market uptrend got confirmed on Jan. 6 with a [solid follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) by the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 saw its distribution day count fall to two; the Jan. 18 distribution day got wiped away due to recent price gains.


Stocks Today: This Bullish Trend Emerges
----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MP020123-201x300.jpg)You only need one [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) by one major index to get the signal to actively search for [strong stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) and potent breakouts. But the rallies by the Nasdaq — on Jan. 11, 20, 23, 26 and 31, all in higher turnover vs. the prior session — strongly suggest that institutions are scooping up shares almost with abandon.


The Nasdaq's rise helped paced a 1.5% advance by the Russell 2000 and a nearly 1.1% rise by the S&P 500. A measly 6-point gain by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, hurt by another sharp drop by component **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), hinted at willingness by fund managers to accumulate shares in more growth-type names while taking profits in cyclical and defensive issues.


Growth Beats Value
------------------


In index action, the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) ETF rallied almost 1.8% for its fourth gain in five sessions. That move overshadowed a 0.6% ascent by its iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) ETF counterpart.


Volume rose on both main exchanges. Overall, the heavy gains in higher turnover indicated that large investors are more anxious to deploy capital into equities.


Also, **Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)) captured a pivot among investors toward growth stocks today.


The small-cap and member of IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group thrust ahead 7.2% to a new closing high of 139.11. Volume surged 90% above the stock's 50-day average.


Shares are now well [extended past the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) after Impinj fiddled around its latest buy point of 129.12 in a new cup without handle.



That 5% buy zone ran up to 135.58. Watch for a potential pullback into the buy zone by this current [quarter-position holding within Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


The Seattle-based expert in RFID chip technology has grown sales 79%, 60%, 44%, 17%, 27% and 51% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Not surprisingly, Impinj's earnings have heated up as well. Watch for Q4 results due on Feb. 8.

Bulls Vs. Bears
---------------


Meanwhile, has investor sentiment gotten too hot? Doesn't seem so.


The [weekly bullish ratio among newsletter editors polled by Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) has no doubt risen to the highest level in more than a year. Yet at last week's peak of 46.5%, that still means the majority of these pundits think stocks today are either still in a bear market or will head into an intermediate-type correction.


Also, as noted in [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), panelists highlighted a negative cover from the latest issue of The Economist. The magazine was poking fun at **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) amid its struggle to grow the consumer side of its business. "Goldman Sags," the cover title, shows a sign of the venerable Wall Street bank melting like a Popsicle in the Los Angeles summer sun.


Yet the truth is, Goldman and other money center banks have not been crashing the way they did during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The current earnings season has seen some large lenders socking away more funds for bad loans. Yet few market observers see the banking system as facing the same type of recessionary crisis as America experienced nearly 15 years ago.


Goldman, meanwhile, has been rebounding after announcing some layoffs to reduce expenses. Shares are building an LNG-tanker-size saucer with handle with a 389.68 buy point.


More 'Disinflation' Now Than Inflation?
---------------------------------------


The progress of disinflation, or a slowing of price increases, remains "in an early stage," Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during his news conference. He added the large part of the economy outside the housing sector has not yet seen this process of disinflation.


Fed critics say the bank was too late in removing monetary stimulus from the financial system after the Covid-19 pandemic peaked. So since early 2022, the bank went on what has been the second fastest campaign in Federal Reserve history to raise the cost of money and help bring the long-term inflation rate back toward 2%.


By 2:30 p.m. ET, stocks deliberately took a bullish bent. In a session with reporters that lasted roughly 45 minutes, Powell repeated the bank's stance that the labor market is still too tight, inflation too high. Powell still worries about inflation expectations getting deeply entrenched. But he noted that the current economic cycle is a highly unusual one. Powell remarked it's "[gratifying](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-hangs-on-the-feds-decision-chip-stock-jumps/)" to see some progress on the inflation front.


It was what many felt to be a less hawkish tone by Powell compared with prior public appearances in the second half of last year. The fact is that he remains [confident in reaching 2% inflation in the long run](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-preview-powell-wont-break-s-wage-growth-eases/) without severely damaging the economy.


Beyond Stocks Today: Long Treasury Bond Yield Falls Again
---------------------------------------------------------


Here are a few more comments on the Fed meeting announcement:


* Chris Zaccarelli, CIO for Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, N.C.: "Investors appear willing to fight the Fed — one of the many aphorisms on Wall Street that seasoned traders usually heed — and they do so at their own peril. This economy is much stronger than almost everyone believed. It is going to cause the Fed to overshoot on tightening, which will ultimately prove an even bigger risk to markets down the road. But in the meantime, we are in a risk-on regime."
* Whitney Watson, deputy co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management: "For investors, the most important takeaway is that the focus in 2023 has shifted from rapidly rising inflation to slowing economic growth. We think this backdrop will see the correlation between bonds and risk assets turn less positive, or even negative."
* Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at Payden Rygel: "Our view is more in line with the U.S. central bank. We see inflation moderating this year, but not as quickly as the bond market hopes or expects."


The yield on the key 10-year Treasury bond dropped 13 basis points to 3.39%, near a year-to-date low. That's well below a perceived "terminal" interest rate of 5%-5.25% as delineated by Fed governors at the December meeting.

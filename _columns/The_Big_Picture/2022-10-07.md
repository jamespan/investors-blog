Stock Market Correction Picks Up Steam After Jobs Report; LPL Financial Still Has The Look Of A Leader
=======================================================================================================

Investors got a stern reminder that the stock market is still in a correction after the [September jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-still-too-strong-for-the-fed-dow-jones-falls/) did little to quell inflation fears.




Nonfarm payrolls increased 263,000 in September, just above the Econoday consensus of 250,000. But good news was bad news as the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% and the labor force participation rate dipped to 62.3%. The Federal Reserve wants to see some softness in the jobs market to help ease inflation pressures, but it's not getting it yet. Job growth in July and August was revised higher by a scant 11,000.


Stock Market Today
------------------


All three major stock indexes gapped down early Friday and never recovered. The Nasdaq composite slumped 3.8%; the S&P 500 lost 2.8% and the Dow Jones gave back 2.1%. Small caps also took a hit, with the Russell 2000 down 2.9%. Nasdaq volume rose, and preliminary data showed NYSE volume up from Thursday.


Declining stocks beat advancers on the NYSE by a 5.5-to-1 margin. The ratio was 4.5-to-1 negative on the Nasdaq.


The nascent rally attempt is still intact as indexes hold above their Sept. 30 lows. But the prospect of higher interest rates, a strong U.S. dollar, pressure on corporate earnings and worries about a hard landing for the economy are still major impediments for the stock market.

The jobs report increased the chances of a 75-basis-point hike at the November meeting to around 82%. Fed funds futures traders are still leaning toward a 50-basis-point hike in December, but there will be plenty of inflation data to consider between now and then, including the coming week's reports on consumer and wholesale inflation.

Chip stocks sold off, hurt by a [revenue warning](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/taiwan-semiconductor-dodges-chip-sector-weakness/) from **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) late Thursday. AMD stock plunged 14% on the news, while top chip stocks in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) like **ON Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) and **Wolfspeed** ([WOLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOLF)) fell, 8% and 5% for the pair, respectively.


Sellers hit **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)), knocking the stock back below its 50-day moving average. But **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)) showed it still has the potential to be a stock market leader with a close near highs after falling more than 5% early in the session.


What To Do Now
--------------


It's tempting to buy stocks holding up well in a weak market, but a negative market tide makes it difficult to make meaningful headway. Individual investors should still favor a heavy cash position until the stock market goes back to a confirmed uptrend.

Institutional buyers will come in from the sidelines at some point and provide the fuel for a new uptrend. But the wall of worry is daunting right now, with plenty of reasons for the market to go down and not many reasons for it to go up.


Oil and gas stocks outperformed again after a big production cut by OPEC+ earlier in the week. But be careful not to chase leaders in the sector that have rallied sharply off lows.


Top-rated oil and gas producers like **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)), **Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)), **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) might look like they're near proper entries, but all four have run up sharply in recent days and already look extended.

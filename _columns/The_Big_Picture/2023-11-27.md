The stock market came back from the Thanksgiving weekend making minor losses, all the while still keeping sellers at bay. Indexes could be cooling off after a four-week sprint.




The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell only 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite lost a measly 0.1% Monday.


Even with a backwind from falling Treasury yields, stocks were placid. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 9 basis points to 4.38%.


Other indexes also reflected a hands-off market from side to side. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) and First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) ETF eased 0.2%.


From microcaps (iShares Micro-Cap ETF ([IWC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWC))) to midcaps (SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY))) to megacaps (Vanguard Megacap ETF ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC))), there was little activity. Those indexes closed between 0.2% and 0.3% lower.


The Russell 2000 was more active, down as much as 1.2% earlier. Yet, it ended just 0.4% lower.

The S&P 500 came close to a [distribution day,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) but its decline wasn't quite enough to qualify for such a bearish signal. And while higher volume is necessary to trigger IBD's distribution days, keep in mind that Friday's half session skews this. In fact, NYSE volume was running lower at 1 p.m. ET, the time of Friday's close.


Where Stock Market Stands
-------------------------


After the best four-week run for the S&P in one year and the Nasdaq's best since January-February, buyers may be exhausted. At least they may be content to see what happens with their November trades.


While there's no clear sign the market is ready to roll over, a pause or pullback wouldn't be surprising, if nothing else to give the stock market a chance to catch its breath.


The S&P 500 is nearly 5% above its 50-day moving average, which equals the July 31 peak closing high. The Nasdaq is 5.8% above its 50-day average — the highest since the index topped in July.


The Nov. 9 distribution day was the only one of the four-week rally, and it's already been made moot by index gains since then.


What VIX Means For Stock Market
-------------------------------


The stock market's so-called fear gauge — the [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX — edged up Monday but has been unusually low. That suggests investors are complacent, although it is also a sign of a healthy bull market.



In Friday's shortened session, the VIX closed at 12.46. On Monday, it closed at 12.69. In the past five years, the index has closed at Friday's low (or lower) only 25 times, says Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.


"Simply put, U.S. options markets have put inflation worries, aggressive central bank monetary policy, geopolitical uncertainty, corporate margin pressures, and higher long-term interest rates entirely behind them. Remarkable, but true," Colas said in a Monday note. "Yes, seasonality is a factor, but that alone does not explain an abnormally low VIX. Rather, markets think they have everything figured out."


He adds that the low VIX is "not necessarily a near-term 'sell' signal in our view, but it does say everything has to go just right over the last 24 trading days left in 2023."


Retail In Stock Market's Mindset
--------------------------------


With holiday shopping in full swing, the retail sector takes on the role of a bellwether for the U.S. consumer. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and other stocks reflected [strength in online Black Friday sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-shopify-lead-e-commerce-stocks-higher-on-record-black-friday-sales/).


**Mastercard**'s ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) SpendingPulse said on Saturday [U.S. retail Black Friday sales rose 2.5%](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/us-black-friday-sales-rise-25-mastercard-spendingpulse-2023-11-25/) year over year, excluding autos.

In a good sign for brick-and-mortar retailers, visits to indoor shopping malls swelled four times the daily average visits this year, according to preliminary data from retail tracking firm Placer.ai. Traffic also soared about 160% at open-air malls and more than 400% at outlet malls.


SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) fell 0.6% Monday but held above the [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and 200-day moving averages, according to [MarketSmith charts](https://get.investors.com/marketsmith/).

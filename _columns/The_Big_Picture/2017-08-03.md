Do Diverging Stock Indexes Signal Trouble?
===========================================

Stocks sagged Thursday as the indexes continued a pattern of small moves.




The Nasdaq whittled off less than 0.4%, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average added less than 0.1%.


Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, which resulted in a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) for the composite and the S&P 500.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have gone two weeks without a daily gain of at least 0.5%. Only the Dow Jones industrial average has surpassed that yardstick. The Dow logged a 0.5% gain twice in the past 10 sessions.


Down moves haven't been much different.


The Divergence Factor
---------------------


The Dow's recent leadership isn't necessarily a good thing for the stock market. With only 30 components, the gauge doesn't say much about the overall market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP_4x3_080317.png)The Dow has outperformed the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 since July 12. A continuation of that divergence would suggest a weakening in the broader market.


As IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks," The blue chip "Dow's new high in January 1984 was accompanied by a divergence in the indexes: the broader-based more significant S&P 500 did not hit a new high. This is the reason most professionals plot the key indexes together — to make it easier to spot nonconfirmations at key turning points."


The Dow has marked a new high in each of the past seven sessions. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have failed to make a new high in each of the past five sessions.


Such divergences don't occur at every market top, but this certainly is worth watching. Keep in mind that the Dow's outperformance is largely due to strong gains by **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and to a lesser extent some other components.


Meanwhile, about 70% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported Q2 results. So, the chances for earnings-driven gains are fading.


When the last of the earnings reports are done, the market will have to look for new catalysts. There are at least four possibilities.


— President Trump is advocating a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%. A bold stroke like that would probably energize the stock market. But it isn't clear if and when Congress will take action. Also unclear is how much of the proposal would survive political maneuvers.


Some are suggesting a win on tax cuts would provide the momentum to revisit health care. But that seems like wishful thinking at this point.


— A junking of most or all of Dodd-Frank's 9,000 pages of regulations would also be a win for the stock market, and especially financials. Here again, it isn't clear if anything significant will be done.


— Light sweet crude oil prices remain a factor that could go either way. The price of oil declined about 23% from a closing high notched Feb. 23. Beginning in late March, the price of crude attempted to recover, but so far oil has only marked a pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The key area to watch is 52. If crude oil can swing above 52, it would break the lower-highs pattern.


Goldman Sachs said recently that oil companies have adapted to prices around $50 a barrel, which is good news for oil bulls if crude can make price progress from here.


Investors have two conflicting ways to look at oil. Lower prices mean more discretionary spending power for consumers. But prices that are too low hurt oil company profits, trim employment and weigh on the oil stock components of the S&P 500.


— The best cure for the stock market's choppy action since early June might be a correction. Historically, August has a good record on follow-through bottoming days. But first, a pullback is necessary.



On Thursday, breakouts were scarce among top-rated stocks.


**Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) hit new highs, but recent action doesn't look confident.


Four stocks delivered strong breakouts, but their Composite Ratings are second tier.


The four are software security provider **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), data analysis software firm **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)), telecom infrastructure company **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) and **Hyatt Hotels** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)).


Economic Data
-------------


Thursday was a good day for beating the consensus views. First-time jobless claims were less than expected; Challenger, Gray & Christmas job cuts were down from the previous month; PMI services for July topped estimates; and factory orders for June were stronger than expected.


On the down side, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing gauge for July missed views.


Coming Up
---------


On Friday, the employment situation report for July will be released. The Street expects payrolls to roll in at 178,000. The range of estimates runs from 144,000 to 220,000. In June, the number came in at 222,000.


The jobless rate is expected to tick down to 4.3% from 4.4%.

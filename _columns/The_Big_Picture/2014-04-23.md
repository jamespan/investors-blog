===============================================================

A tale of two markets continued Wednesday.

  

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.8% while the S&P 500 lost just 0.2%. Both major indexes halted their six-day winning streaks. Volume fell. The IBD 50 slipped 0.6%.

  

Gains by gold mining, airline, hospital, discount retail and various oil-related stocks rose, blunting the S&P 500's decline.

  

On the other hand, groups that hold a relatively higher weighting within the Nasdaq — including biotech, computer software and data storage — fell sharply.

  

The market's current outlook remains in a correction.

  

Unlike in 2013, the S&P 500 has been acting as the leading index so far this year while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has underperformed.

  

The comparison may not mirror the differences that Charles Dickens described between the aristocrats and the poor and oppressed in his novel "A Tale of Two Cities." Yet it's worth noting some of the diverging performances between the two indexes.

  

One, the S&P 500 is holding up above its 50-day moving average, a good tool for quickly checking the market's general direction. Meanwhile, as seen in the chart on this page, the Nasdaq has yet to rebound back above its 50-day line after sliding 9.7% from a 4371 high during a five-week correction.

  

Two, market breadth is better on the NYSE, where many components of the 500 reside. As seen in the Dow Jones industrials chart on this page, the NYSE advance-decline line has moved into new high ground. And on Wednesday, losers barely edged winners. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line had risen sharply in recent days, but down stocks swamped up stocks by more than 2-to-1 Wednesday.

  

The Nasdaq may get an early pop up Thursday. Both **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) rose in extended-hours trading after reporting Q1 results. Together, the two mega-cap techs make up 7.9% of the Nasdaq's total market value.

  

One of the day's biggest headlines was Apple's decision to split its shares 7-for-1. The conventional wisdom says stock splits make it easier for investors to purchase shares. Truth is, excessive stock splits actually harm a good stock's advance and can coincide with key sell signals seen only on a chart.

  

That said, the 10-for-1 split by **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) in May 2010 did not defuse its rally. The Chinese search engine continued to show mild declines and formed new bases before eventually peaking in the summer of 2011 at 165.96 and going into a long, deep correction.

  

On the economic front, a 14.5% drop in March new-home sales disappointed economists. Yet homebuilder stocks had already been freezing up ahead of Wednesday's news. **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) has dropped 15% from its March high after reporting a surprise 25% drop in Q1 profit Monday. Its 5% sales increase was the smallest in nine quarters.

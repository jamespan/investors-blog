U.S. stock indexes climbed steadily Thursday, as the market shifted toward what could be a changing stock leadership.




The S&P 500 tacked on 0.8%, while the Nasdaq and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.7% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.9%.


Volume slipped on the Nasdaq and the NYSE as the market continued to add to Tuesday's big gains.


On Thursday, the indexes climbed to 1.1% gains in the afternoon on news that [the U.S. might lift tariffs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-weighs-lifting-china-tariffs-to-hasten-trade-deal-calm-markets-11547754006?mod=hp_lead_pos1) while negotiations with China proceed. The report was based on anonymous sources.

Even so, the S&P 500 regained its 50-day moving average, and the Nasdaq padded its modest cushion above the line.


The small-cap Russell 2000 is also above its 50-day line.


Small Caps Lead
---------------


Since the uptrend began after the Christmas Eve closing lows, small caps have led and blue chips have lagged.


On Thursday, small cap restaurant chain **El Pollo Loco** ([LOCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOCO)) climbed above a 17.05 buy point in the first hour of trade and then fell under the entry. The stock has formed a base-on-base pattern.


Another small cap, software developer **Attunity** ([ATTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATTU)) broke out in huge volume. The stock cleared a 23.95 buy point and closed just above the 5% buy zone. Attunity was [discussed in Stock Spotlight Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/leading-stocks-big-data-firm-attunity/).


Blue chip and Dow component **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) skidded 1.2% but closed slightly above its 50-day line. JPMorgan cut its price target on Home Depot from 208 to 203.


Changing Leadership Mix
-----------------------


The current stock market uptrend is slowly changing its leadership mix. Going into Thursday's session, the energy sector led with an 8.09% gain in the first 11 sessions of 2019. Banks were second with a 6.83% pop.


Other top-performing sectors included auto, up 6.55%; finance, 6.43%; retail, 6.21%; and software, 5.85%.


The above rankings are listed by price progress alone. In IBD's sector performance — which eliminates companies with weaker fundamentals — the top sectors were media, software and food & beverage.


Trend Lines Offer Entries
-------------------------


Many stocks aren't close to forming legitimate bases, but [how an investor hunts is important](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-you-hunt-matters-in-a-new-stock-market-uptrend/) early in a market uptrend. For instance, [a trend line can offer a more aggressive entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-read-stock-chart/) in a stock consolidation.


The weekly chart of **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) shows the stock cleared a trend line this week. The relative strength line is already at a high, a bullish sign.



Bank stocks also are primed for alternative entries. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) knifed above a trend line this week. **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) is just under a trend line.


Trend lines can offer a legitimate entry into a stock when buy points are still a long way off.


Netflix Misses On Revenue
-------------------------


After hours, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) reported fourth-quarter results. Earnings topped the Street's expectations, but [revenue failed to meet the consensus view](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-earnings-q4-2018-netflix-stock/).


Guidance also was softer than analysts expected. The stock slid 4% in after-hours action.

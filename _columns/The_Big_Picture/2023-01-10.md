Stock Market Uptrend Regains Traction After Reversal, But Sellers Hit ELF Beauty, Super Micro Computer Hard
============================================================================================================

Buyers lifted the stock market Tuesday as major stock indexes closed near session highs and the Nasdaq composite extended its winning streak to three sessions.




Futures were under pressure before the opening bell, perhaps in anticipation of a hawkish tone by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at a speech in Stockholm, Sweden. But Powell's speech was mostly about central bank independence rather than the Fed's fight against inflation and specific monetary policy.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added nearly 0.6% as the blue-chip index holds above short- and longer-term moving averages.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) outperformed in the Dow Jones average today, up 1.2%, helped a bit by rising interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 3.61% just after the market close, up 10 basis points.

A slew of financial stocks report earnings early Friday, including **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)). JPM stock is near the top of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 138.76 buy point.


After reversing below its 50-day moving average Monday, the S&P 500 picked up 0.7% and closed back above the line. The index almost touched its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) before reversing higher. Preliminary data showed lower volume on the NYSE, with winners beating losers by about 2.5-to-1.


Index component **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) continued its rapid ascent, rising for the third straight session. A new consolidation shows a 173.78 entry. FSLR also has a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) in new high ground. IBD's solar group was one of the day's best performers, up nearly 4%. Besides First Solar, healthy charts in the group are tough to find.


The Nasdaq composite gained 1%. Breadth was also 2.5-to-1 positive, and volume fell. Inside the Nasdaq 100, biotech **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) outperformed, rising 3.1% in light volume. It's been getting support at the 50-day line after retesting a 188.75 buy point.


Small caps led as the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) jumped 1.5%.


The next piece of potentially market-moving economic data comes Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET with the release of the December consumer price index. Prices are expected to cool again, but will it be enough to placate the stock market? Year over year, prices are expected to be up 6.6%, down from 7.1% in November. Core prices, which exclude and food and energy costs, are seen rising 5.7%, also down slightly from 6% in November.


Soft Landing Or Hard Landing?
-----------------------------


The stock market is trying to stay optimistic about a soft landing for the economy, where growth slows but not enough to push the U.S. economy into a harsh recession. But stock indexes still have overhead supply to work through.


Even if the S&P 500 can move above Monday's high, the index's 200-day moving average just below 4,000 looms large as a potential resistance level. A bullish move above the 4,000 level would be enough to break the S&P 500 out of its downtrend and give investors good reason to increase exposure.

The Nasdaq is still below its 50- and 200-day lines. For now, an invested percentage of 20%-40% seems about right. If indexes can generally show higher-volume gains and lower-volume declines, it would bode well for the uptrend and most likely give plenty of chances to increase stock market exposure.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite confirmed a new uptrend Friday with big percentage gains in higher volume. But it's still a challenging environment for growth stocks. Just look at **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), which reversed sharply lower Monday after a breakout from a flat base Friday. Sellers hit the stock again Tuesday, and ELF broke through its 50-day line.


**Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)), a rare bright spot in the technology sector, gapped below its 50-day line, hurt by a bearish report from Spruce Point Capital.



**Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) was a bright spot, soaring nearly 6% in strong volume. It's a member of the [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) portfolio. We increased the MEDP position Tuesday after the stock moved strongly above a 219.99 alternative buy point.


Steel Producers Roll Higher
---------------------------


Steel producers had a good day, with the group up nearly 6%. In the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) surged just over 7% after jumping above its 50-day line Friday in higher volume. A six-week cup base could be in place by the end of the week with a 155.08 buy point.



Group peer **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) is also showing relative strength, but gains in the past several days have come in light volume.


**Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) and **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) also outperformed in the MarketSmith Growth 250. Both stocks have shown great follow-through after recent base breakouts.


In the early stages of a new bull market when institutional money is coming in from the sidelines, it's not hard to find stocks following through after breakouts. But FCX and SCCO are the exception, not the rule, in the current market environment where technical breakouts are generally having a tough time making headway.

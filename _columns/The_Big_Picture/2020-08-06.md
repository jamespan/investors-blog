Stock Market Rally Continues As Nasdaq Tops 11,000; Facebook, Lululemon, Mastercard Hit New Buy Zones
======================================================================================================

The stock market ended Thursday with solid gains, as the Nasdaq composite closed above the 11,000 level for the first time. The Nasdaq extended a win streak to seven sessions.




The Nasdaq moved up 1%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.6%. The S&P 500 is just off its all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.7%, or 185 points, fueled by a 3.5% gain in shares of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.1% loss. Leading growth stocks also sharply lagged, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) fell 0.4%.


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE.


Nasdaq Hits Another Record High
-------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP080620-253x300.jpg)The tech-heavy Nasdaq hit another record high Thursday, extending a win streak to seven sessions. During its seven-day win streak, the Nasdaq advanced 6.8%.


The S&P 500 — up for a fifth straight day Thursday — is down to three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), after losing two during Wednesday's solid gain. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq only has one. Light institutional selling means risk appetite remains high and investors should remain on the lookout for buying opportunities, like new breakouts and 10-week rebounds. Additionally, the positive sentiment means that stocks are better able to shrug off negative news.


Keep in mind that the Nasdaq is sharply extended from its moving averages and approaching the top end of an upper channel line that is currently priced around 11,200. Pullbacks are normal when the stock market gets extended.

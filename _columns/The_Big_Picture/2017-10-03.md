  Stocks Again Hit Record Highs; Why A Defensive Stance May Be A Good Option

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 climbed to record highs for the third day in a row Tuesday, seeming intent on stretching a pattern of small gains and pullbacks.




The Nasdaq and S&P 500 added 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4% for its second straight record high. The Russell 2000 erased minor losses to close 0.2% higher. The small-cap benchmark has made a feverish 12% run from its Aug. 18 low and may be due for a deserved break.


Volume increased slightly on the Nasdaq, while NYSE volume fell.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP100317-204x300.png)The Nasdaq is up more than 20% this year, but the Nasdaq 100 index of the largest nonfinancial companies in the composite is still not at new highs. Softness in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) and some other Nasdaq titans have contributed to the lag.


But with the market at record highs and [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) scarce, investors have a clear runway for adding shares or keeping themselves invested in stocks.


The advance-decline lines are trending upward, and the Nasdaq's is rising at an even faster pace than the composite itself the past six weeks. September, traditionally a weak month for Wall Street, saw the S&P 500 climb 1.9% and the Nasdaq nearly 1.1%, the sixth straight monthly increase for the composite.


After a summer that saw North Korea's missile threats, three devastating storms and a few more isolated shocks, the market remains unflappable.


Indexes bounced back from a few sell-offs that caused nothing worse than a 4% pullback. At the same time, the market has not rallied vigorously, which has resulted in slow progress for many of the top stocks that broke out of bases the past couple of months.


A view through longer-term optics finds a favorable backdrop: The U.S. economy is in a steady expansion, corporate earnings are improving, and interest rate policy remains accommodative.


Still, some sort of defensive posture would be smart. Since April, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have had a tendency of rising no more than a few weeks before tripping themselves. Lacking a robust market advance, many top-rated stocks have small cushions above their chart entries.


As for risks on the horizon, earnings season already starts this week, with **Yum China** ([YUMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUMC)) announcing Q3 results on Thursday and financial powerhouses **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) next week.


Following a strong Q2 for S&P 500 earnings, signs are that Q3 profits and sales again will be good. The S&P Capital IQ consensus estimate for third-quarter EPS growth is 4.8%, and the estimate for revenue growth is 5.7%.


The number of companies issuing profit warnings is slightly below the five-year average of 79, and the number of companies issuing positive EPS guidance is well above the five-year average of 27, according to a Sept. 22 FactSet report. The research firm says an unusually high number of S&P 500 companies are issuing positive revenue guidance for Q3, more than double the five-year average.


Sector rotation is helping keep the market upright.Â Homebuilders continue to make significant moves, and they're one industry to watch for opportunities. On Tuesday, **Tri Pointe Group** ([TPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPH)) clocked a ninth straight gain and poked above the 14.31 buy point of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) but closed below it.


**Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) touched a 55.85 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) and topped an alternative entry at 54.96. Lennar beat expectations with its quarterly report. **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) are other builders that have broken out in the past several days.


Mobile home and RV group, trucking, auto dealers, logistics groups have risen sharply in rankings and are other areas rotating into market leadership. In the RV industry, **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) has emerged as a winner. The stock is in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/Leaderboard/Leaders/default.aspx/Leaderboard/Leaders/default.aspx), which is outperforming the S&P 500 this year.

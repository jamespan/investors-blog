The stock market did an excellent job paring losses Thursday, but it wasn't good enough to finish positive.




The Nasdaq booked a 0.4% loss after being down as much as 1.9%. The [large-cap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/big-cap-stocks-can-be-winners/) S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 both lost 0.3%. The [blue-chip](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/blue-chip-stock-dow-dia-warren-buffett/) Dow Jones Industrial Average sliced off 0.5%.


Volume in the stock market today rose on both major exchanges.


The market lost its April 3 stalling day because of time. After 25 sessions, a stock's action is not relevant to current conditions. But the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each suffered [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) Thursday. Distribution involves selling in rising volume, which is a footprint of institutional selling.

News swirling around the U.S.-China standoff on tariffs unnerved the stock market. China reportedly backed off on previous agreements, and President Donald Trump threatened to jack up tariffs starting Friday.


Later, the indexes rebounded after Trump said he received "a beautiful letter" from Chinese leader Xi Jinping.


A delegation from China was meeting with its U.S. trade counterparts Thursday in Washington, D.C., reports said.


Blue Chips Mostly Down In Stock Market
--------------------------------------


In the blue-chip Dow Jones, losers led winners by about an 8-3 ratio. The day's biggest movers in the Dow came from the semiconductor and energy sectors.


Chipmaker **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) skidded about 5%, while integrated oil company **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) led the upside with a 3% gain.


Intel provided a disappointing three-year outlook at an analyst event. The company expects slow growth and shrinking margins.


**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) advanced after [it dropped out of a bidding war](https://www.investors.com/news/chevron-wont-raised-anadarko-bid-occidental-offer/) for **Anadarko Petroleum** ([APC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APC)). This apparently concedes victory to **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)).


The development was good news for Chevron shareholders. Anadarko must pay a $1 billion breakup fee to Chevron.


The $1 billion windfall would be about 57% of what Chevron spent on share repurchases last year. Chevron said in a [press release](https://www.chevron.com/investors/press-releases) Thursday it would use the $1 billion to increase its share repurchase rate by 25% to $5 billion.


In every war, whether it be a shooting war or a trade war, there are always those who proceed as if the war was not going on. Entertainment streamer **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) played that role Thursday. The midcap stock delivered a classic-looking breakout. The stock cleared a nearly nine-week consolidation with a 28% thrust in heavy volume.


Late Wednesday, Roku [reported quarterly results that trashed the Street's expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q1-2019-roku-stock/).


Random Notes In Stock Market
----------------------------


— The chart camp was happy Thursday as the Nasdaq reclaimed its 50-day line after an intraday violation. The S&P 500 did the same, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average remained below its 50-day line. The Dow Jones lost its 50-day line Tuesday.


— If China expects it can wait out Trump on trade in the hope that he will lose the 2020 election, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer diminished that hope Sunday. In a tweet, Schumer urged Trump to "hang tough on China, President. Don't back down. Strength is the only way to win with China."


Schumer's unspoken message to China: Don't expect an easier deal from a Democratic president.


— Some stock market observers see the current market as one approaching a crucial, game-changing pivot: If China and the U.S. hammer out a deal, the bulls will run higher. But if nothing is accomplished, the bears could make life ugly for investors. Such results are unlikely to be priced into the current market because they are just too difficult to predict.

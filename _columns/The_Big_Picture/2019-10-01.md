Bearish Stock Market Action Kicks Bulls On 1st Day Of Final Quarter; Will A Correction Begin Soon?
===================================================================================================

Call it the Wall Street equivalent of a fumble on the first drive of a prime-time NFL football game.




The major indexes looked determined to get off on the right foot during Tuesday's opening day of the fourth quarter. But news of an awful drop in domestic manufacturing activity, reported at 10 a.m. ET, pretty much gave the effect of four giant linemen on defense turning a promising morning run into negative yardage.


Then, the rest of the day saw the market bears in full control.


That's really no surprise, given IBD's [downgrade of the market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-today-see-downgrade-for-2nd-time-in-a-month-what-to-do-now/) to "uptrend under pressure" occurred just five sessions earlier, on Sept. 24.


This is the second time IBD readers have seen a negative outlook change since Aug. 14, and the fourth time since early May.


IBD's outlook also spelled "market in correction" — the most cautious outlook for growth investors — for more than three weeks from May 13 to June 6, and for a five-day string from Aug. 5 to Aug. 12.

CLOSE




After rising as much as 0.8% in the opening half hour, the Nasdaq composite flopped back below the 50-day moving average and finished down 1.1%. It could have been worse if some of the FAANG stocks didn't rally on Tuesday. The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial plays, sank 0.8%.


Worse Than Large Caps
---------------------


While the S&P 500 dropped 1.2%, smaller companies fared much worse. The S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 plunged nearly 2% each.


Volume rose on both main exchanges. That meant the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq notched a [new distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or a session of unusually strong institutional profit-taking.


Blame the bigger than usual rise in turnover in part to many investors being away on Monday for the Rosh Hashanah Jewish new year holiday. But the main reason? The Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturing activity hit 47.8 in September — under the neutral 50.0 reading, [missing the Econoday forecast of 50](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), and marking the lowest reading in a decade.


The poor economic data confirmed some Wall Street observers' biggest fears nowadays. That is, America has joined Europe in a truly global manufacturing slowdown, if not outright recession.


Is the U.S. economic expansion, now entering a record 123rd month in a row, doomed?


"Policy responses to cut rates or boost government spending could extend this expansion further still, while new technologies may eventually help bolster some corporate profits. But investors making decisions should keep a close watch on capital spending and consumer optimism," Christopher Smart, chief global strategist and head of the Barings Investment Institute, wrote in a Sept. 27 note to clients. "Confidence in a robust fourth quarter remains high, for now. Spending and savings rates continue to rise, just not as much as initially suggested."


The market's internals continued to weaken.


The S&P 500 and NYSE composite closed slightly below their 50-day moving averages. On a purely technical basis, you want to see the key benchmarks rise above their 50-day moving averages with gusto, hoisting these 50-day lines higher as well.



No such display of that right now. For the past six sessions, the Nasdaq has had as much success of popping back up above its own 50-day line as the hapless rodent in Whack-A-Mole.


On the Nasdaq, losing issues trumped winners by more than a 3-1 ratio, and nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE.


Any Good New Breakouts? A Few, Not Many
---------------------------------------



Stocks trying to break out and rush to new highs are making little if any progress. **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)), part of the now-struggling security software industry group, offers new proof.


The S&P SmallCap 600 sliced through its own 50-day line. At 929, the index has now seen its year-to-date gain shrink to just under 10%.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.9% and marked its lowest close since June 3.


What do institutional investors worry about, lately? Plenty, it seems.


A possible presidential impeachment, potential delays in the passage this fall of a USMCA landmark North American trade deal, China tariffs and weakening euro zone economies make it a tall wall of worry.


On Tuesday, while the general market itself showed expanding turnover, virtually all leading growth stocks refused to follow this plot line, showing lower volume. Yet with more economic data due this week ([see the full calendar here](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)), investors should brace for more potential declines. At the same time, news on the U.S.-China trade war could send the market sharply in either direction.



Leading stocks including **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Essent** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) face a critical test of institutional buying support at the 50-day and 10-week moving averages. Many others have already [taken out their 50-day lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) and are simply trying to bottom out in price — critical action in forming new bases.


Bearish Stock Market Action Beyond The Key Indexes
--------------------------------------------------


The importance of the weakening economic data, both in the U.S. and abroad, reverberated throughout financial markets.


The Dow Jones transportation average got mauled by the bears, losing 2.3%.


Long-dated U.S. Treasuries served as a safe haven yet again. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell to 1.65%, vs. two-year notes at 1.56%.


Gold rallied more than 1%. Copper futures, highly sensitive to the economy, fell 0.5%.

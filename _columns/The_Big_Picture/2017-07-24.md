Another quiet session for the stock market Monday saw another record high for the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100, plenty of big movers in the growth space and an equally plentiful supply of healthy chart setups.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) were nice winners in the Nasdaq 100, while [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) names **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) and **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) are all making strong cases for more upside with bullish charts.


And let's not forget about **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which is back above the 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base with a 156.75 buy point.


Indeed, a complacent market looked complacent again Monday as indexes didn't move much in either direction and volume stayed light. The Nasdaq composite added 0.4%; the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.3% and the S&P 500 eased 0.1%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index edged higher by 0.2%, and the IBD 50 outperformed nicely, up 0.9%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


The Nasdaq 100 extended its winning streak to 12 sessions, almost as impressive as Jordan Spieth shooting five under par over the final five holes to win the British Open Sunday.


The Nasdaq composite's distribution-day count fell by one as the mild June 16 decline in higher volume fell off the count due to time.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP072417.png)Despite an overall favorable environment for the bulls, it's still important to be proactive with current holdings. Give your winners room to run but be less patient with laggard performers. Giving the benefit of the doubt to laggard performers can dilute returns.


Wall Street didn't seem to mind a lowered U.S. economic growth outlook from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF cut its U.S. growth forecast for 2017 and 2018 to 2.1%, down from 2.3% for 2017 and 2.5% for 2018. The IMF cited uncertainty over the Trump administration's policies. The U.S. economy grew at a rate of 1.4% in the first quarter.


A two-day Fed meeting gets underway Tuesday with another decision on interest rates due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is expected to stand pat. According the CME Group FedWatch tool, futures traders think there's a 45% chance of one more rate hike before the end of the year.


The bull camp still has plenty working in its favor. An improving economy with tepid inflation, and a Federal Open Market Committee that is in no hurry to aggressively raise interest rates. The bears, meanwhile, keep hanging their hats on a complacent market. While, it's true that complacent markets can raise the risk level, it's not a reason alone to make bearish bets on the market.


Shares of Tesla rose 4%, good enough for a close just above the 50-day moving average. Tesla is trying to get its house in order after crashing through the support level July 5 in heavy volume.


Meanwhile, casino operator Wynn Resorts is showing good action at the 10-week moving average after a breakout in mid-March. Shares gained 3% in solid volume ahead of its earnings report Tuesday after the close.


At one point Monday, when shares were trading around 138, a weekly call option with a 139 strike price (July 28 expiration) came with a premium of around $3.30, offering a trade with maximum downside risk of 2.4%. Pre-earnings option trades like this are worth checking into occasionally because they offer low risk and potentially high reward.

IBD 50 name **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)) joined another fiber-optic rally Monday. Shares jumped 7% to 67.95, ending just above a 67.40 buy point, but note its latest structure is late stage after a big run already. Breakouts from late-stage bases tend not to have as high a success rate as breakouts from early-stage bases.


Elsewhere, **Blue Apron** ([APRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APRN)) shareholders finally got some good news Monday after several analysts initiated coverage with a buy rating. Shares jumped 13% to 7.41, but Blue Apron closed well off its session highs.


After a sharp pullback, Blue Apron could be set to rally, but overhead supply is definitely an issue. Overhead supply is selling pressure that arises when a stock starts to rally after a sharp pullback. Those who bought on the way down and are sitting on a loss sell when the stock gets back to their purchase price.


After the close, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) reported another quarter of strong top-line growth, but it wasn't good enough as shares fell nearly 3% in after-hours trading. Adjusted profit of $5.01 a share topped expectations.

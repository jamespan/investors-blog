Stocks Climb To New Highs, IBD 50 Outperforms, But Is Market Overconfident?
============================================================================

The stock market extended its December rally, sending the major indexes to new highs Monday. Growth stocks joined in an advance that now has little standing in its way.




The Nasdaq composite led with a 0.9% increase, while the S&P 500 added 0.7%. The Russell 2000 rose 0.7% as the small-cap index climbed to a 14-month high.


With a couple of weeks left in the year, the S&P 500 is on track for the best year since 2013, when it scored a 29.6% win, and could even top it. As of Monday's close, the S&P 500 was up 27.3%. The Nasdaq that year surged 38.3%, and is up 32.8% year to date.


Much of 2019's success came in the first quarter, when the Nasdaq vaulted 16.5%. To be sure, that rally came just as the market was bottoming from a brief bear market in the final three months of 2018, which skews the year's performance total.

The Federal Reserve made it clear it plans to leave interest rates unchanged for many months. Judging from the way indexes reacted, Wall Street is OK with that.


The U.S.-China trade war reached a milestone Friday, when the two nations agreed to [a preliminary deal on tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trumps-china-trade-deal-mystery-the-surprise-for-dow-jones-2020-election/). That removed a big uncertainty, though the broader issue of tariffs is unresolved.


With investors finding relief on major issues, sentiment is turning bullish â€” perhaps too bullish. The [put-call volume ratio on Friday sank](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) to an unusually low level of 0.60. That indicates the market is getting overconfident.


IBD identifies the 0.6 level as a danger zone, where a market top is possible. Yet, this is merely a caution, rather than a clear signal. The put-call ratio sank to 0.6 on June 20, and the stock market continued to rally for several weeks before it topped on July 26.


From the June 20 close at 8051, the Nasdaq still ran up 288 points to a new all-time high of 8339, up 3.6%. But then, a brief 8% decline in the Nasdaq occurred from late July to early August. The Aug. 5 short-term low of 7662 has held since then. On Monday, the put-call ratio spiked and ended at 0.84, according to early data.


Other Stock Market Signals Remain Positive
------------------------------------------


In the absence of other negative signals, investors should continue with a high level of exposure to stocks. The 50-day moving averages of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 started trending higher in mid-October. The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the major indexes are at bullish levels.


Leading stocks remain largely on good footing, which is as good a signal as you can have. Growth industries such as semiconductors, biotech and cloud software continue to recover. The IBD 50 rose 1.1% Monday, thanks to about 13 stocks that rose 1.5% or more.



Health care stocks were broadly higher on news that some Obamacare taxes, including a medical devices tax, are [set to be scrapped](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/health-care-stocks-get-boost-congress-prepares-to-cut-obamacare-taxes/). Health insurers **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) jumped 3.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Humana rose past the 355.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a long pattern.


But the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a gain of less than 0.4%, mainly due to **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). Shares of that company fell more than 4% to an Oct. 21 low on news the company may halt production of its 737 Max airliner. After the close Monday, the company confirmed reports that it will halt production of [starting in January](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-production-slowed-halted-faa-certification-slips/).


Boeing remains 26% off its high, but it is trading around a general price area where it found support earlier this year. Shares were slightly lower in extended trading following the latest news.


Close to 350 stocks made new highs Monday, and financials figured prominently. More than 80 banks made new highs, after the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 7 basis points to 1.89%. SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) and SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) rose 0.7%.

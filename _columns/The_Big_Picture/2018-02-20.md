Stocks Fade As Dow, S&P 500 Face Questions At This Key Level
=============================================================

The market's rebound has cooled off and now the market is searching for direction.




Â Bearish reversals characterized Tuesday's market after the Nasdaq composite wiped away a 0.8% midday gain to close with a loss of 0.1%. The S&P 500 erased a 0.2% increase and ended 0.6% lower. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1%, spending the entire day in the red due to an earnings-related sell-off in **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) shares.


The way indexes sputtered reminded investors of Friday, when the market also surrendered gains and closed near session lows.


After several days of rapid recovery, it's not surprising that indexes have moderated their ascent. The question is: Will they be able to keep rebounding? The S&P 500 has recovered more than half of its February loss and the Nasdaq about two-thirds of its decline.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP022018-275x300.png)How the indexes behave around the 50-day line will give some clues on the market direction; that is, whether the rebound continues or it fizzles. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 dipped back below the 50-day moving average, a ledge it gripped just last Thursday. But right now it's only a minor drop below it.


Volume fell from Friday's pace, when trading reached average or near-average levels even though volume tends to slow down the day before a three-day weekend. The decrease in volume spared the indexes from suffering the first [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) since their lows on Feb. 9.


That day sparked a rebound that not only halted the market's plunge, but offered a bottoming signal with a [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) Feb. 14. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow won back their 50-day lines last week, but only the Nasdaq remains above that key level now.


As this column noted before, when the major indexes make a steep drop below the 50-day lines, follow-throughs have a higher tendency to flop. So investors are now at a stage that requires caution.


If the market is wobbly, it hasn't shown up in many leading stocks. On the IBD 50, fewer than half of stocks were lower and just nine are below the 50-day line. A 15.5% vault by **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) certainly helped the IBD 50 on Tuesday.


Some older components have now been removed from the IBD 50 after they became damaged, such as **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) and **Ichor** ([ICHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICHR)).


But selling is not metastasizing to the point where medicine is needed. Keep watching your stocks for breaks below the 50-day line, or outsized losses that occur in a single day. Certainly, sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price.


Chips stocks led the market after **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) [made a sweetened bid](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qualcomm-raises-bid-for-nxp-could-scuttle-broadcom-takeover/) for **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)). The sector's strength helped the Nasdaq fare relatively better than the other main indexes. The new bid also bolstered Qualcomm's defense against a hostile takeover attempt from **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).


IBD's chip equipment, chipmaking and fabless chip industry groups were the No. 2, 3 and 4 top performing groups Tuesday. They climbed 2.1% to 2.6%; only the auto replacement parts industry group performed any better.


Other technology groups also led, including several software industries.

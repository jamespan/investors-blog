The stock market ended quietly mixed Thursday, but the S&P 500 posted its best first-quarter performance since 2019. Up next, Wall Street will shift its attention to a key inflation report and a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday.




Markets will be closed for the Good Friday holiday, but the Commerce Department plans to release its Personal Consumption Expenditures price index in the morning. [Fed Chair Powell said](https://www.investors.com/research/investing-action-plan/stock-market-rally-dow-jones-cintas-jefferies-financial/) the core PCE price index likely rose "well below 30 basis points" during February, putting the 12-month increase at 2.8%. Markets, once they're open Monday, would likely react if the outcome is different.


Meanwhile, Powell [will speak Friday](https://www.frbsf.org/news-and-media/events/2024/03/jerome-powell-remarks-with-kai-ryssdal-2024/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=macro_conference_2024)at the Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy Conference in a conversation moderated by Kai Ryssdal of Marketplace.


Wrapping up the first quarter of 2024 Thursday, the S&P 500 is up 10.2%, its best first-quarter gain since 2019. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 5.7% for the period, its strongest Q1 performance since 2021. And the Nasdaq is up 9.2% since Jan. 1.


S&P 500 Hits New High
---------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both rose 0.2%, as the S&P 500 hit a new high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.5%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and also appeared to be higher on the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session.

Disney shares are extended past a 112.92 cup-with-handle entry, while Verizon stock is building a cup base with a 43.21 buy point.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP032824.jpg)On the downside in blue chips, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) lost 1.1%, finishing near its recent lows and sharply below its 50- and 200-day moving averages.


Among Magnificent Seven stocks, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was the biggest loser, with a 2.3% slide. On the upside, **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) hit a new high.

What To Do Now
--------------


After Thursday's gains, the S&P 500 is right at record highs as the stock market uptrend continues to show strength. Despite the recent strength, IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60%-80%, keeping in mind that a pullback now would not be surprising.


So far, the steady uptrend has offered few chances for the formation of new bases. For example, [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list showed one new breakout stock Thursday: **Manulife Financial** ([MFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFC)). That stock moved past a 24.89 buy point.


Keep track of emerging bases with the [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Near Pivot" list. Currently, it shows only a handful of stocks. For example, **Badger Meter** ([BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)) is nearing a cup-with-handle's 164.81 buy trigger.

Breakouts To Watch: Arista, DraftKings
--------------------------------------



Among stocks to watch are **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), which are near new buy points, while recent breakouts from **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) are under pressure.


Google-parent Alphabet is rapidly nearing a consolidation's 153.78 buy point, as the stock inched higher Thursday.


And ServiceNow is about 6% away from a flat base's 815.32 entry, according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) charts. It is below its 50-day line after Wednesday's decline.


Meanwhile, DraftKings tumbled below its 46.52 buy point out of a short consolidation. Shares took a 6.8% dive Wednesday after the [NCAA said](https://www.investors.com/news/draftkings-stock-futter-tumble-ncaa-crackdown/) it wants to ban proposition bets — wagers unrelated to a game's final score — in college sports.


And Arista shares gave up their 292.66 flat-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) during Wednesday's drop. Wait for a decisive retake of that entry before considering a purchase in either faltering breakout.

Stock indexes struggled Thursday as the market had to deal with crosswinds from mixed data and news, including a plunge in **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) that put a toll particularly on the Nasdaq.




The Nasdaq flopped 1%, while the S&P 500 eased 0.3%. Blue chip Dow components rose by a 2-to-1 ratio as the index edged 0.5% higher.Â Small caps did even better as the S&P 600 climbed 1.1%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

With earnings season in high gear, companies beating analysts' estimates Thursday included **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), which fell 1.7% in fast trade; missile maker **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)), down 2.6% in heavy volume; **American Airlines Group** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)), up 4.8% in busy volume; **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), up 8% in heavy volume; and **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), off 12% in big volume.


Facebook attracted the most attention and had a big impact on the market. The company reported earnings after the close Wednesday. A [soft outlook on Q3 and Q4 revenue growth](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-facebook/) and weaker than expected Q2 revenue sent shares spinning down 19% in Thursday's session. Volume was 840% above average. The stock triggered multiple sell signals.


Facebook's weighting in the Nasdaq before the sell-off was 4.4%, and it was the main reason the Nasdaq underperformed. Facebook's impact was felt more on the Nasdaq 100, which fell 1.4%.


After Thursday's close, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) reported Q2 results. [Earnings rose to $5.07 a share](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-quarterly-earnings-report/) vs. expectations for $2.50 a share. Revenue rolled in about 1% lower than expected. The stock advanced 2% in after-hours trade.


The question now is whether Amazon can lift the indexes Friday. It's a major piece of the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Jobless Claims
--------------


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 217,000, about 1% fewer than analysts expected. The figure was roughly in line with the four-week moving average.


By most accounts, the economy is sailing along.


Durable Goods
-------------


The June uptick in durable goods orders came in at 1%, an ugly miss. Analysts expected a 3.2% gain.


Despite the miss, there were two items for the optimists to tout.


First, although the June overall percentage missed the consensus view, the gain at least ended two months of declines. In April, durable goods orders fell 1%. In May, they fell 0.3%.


Second, core capital goods, a proxy for business spending, was up 0.6% vs. views for 0.5%.


Tariffs
-------


News was quiet on the tariff front, one day after President Trump and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker reached an accord of sorts that eased trade tensions.


Though bulls would like to see the tariff issue settled and forgotten, CNBC reported a statistic that proved many companies haven't forgotten.


About a third of companies in the S&P 500 have already reported Q2 results. More than 40% mentioned the tariff issue in their reports.


Trump has made closure difficult with contradictory messages on trade. Sometimes the contradictions have come on the same day. For example, on Tuesday, Trump tweeted, "Tariffs are the greatest." Later Tuesday, he tweeted that both the U.S. and the E.U. should "drop all Tariffs, Barrier and Subsidies."


Coming Up
---------


The first take on second quarter GDP will be released before Friday's open. The Street expects 4.2% growth, a figure that was last seen in 2014.


Economists' estimates range from 3% to 4.8%.

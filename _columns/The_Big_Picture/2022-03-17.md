Stock Market Extends Gains; 5 Top Stocks To Buy And Watch In New Uptrend
=========================================================================

The stock market reversed from early losses Thursday to end with more strong gains, a day of bullish action in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's power.




**Costco** **Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)), **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) are among the top stocks to watch in the new stock market uptrend.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned up 1.2% Thursday, while the S&P 500 also ended 1.2% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite tacked on 1.3%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed, rising 1.7%.


Top growth stocks sharply outperformed the major stock indexes Thursday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 2.2%, aided by strength in commodity stocks such as **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), **Viper Energy** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) and **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP031722-300x297.jpg)The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked up to 2.19% Thursday, holding at its highest point since July 2019. U.S. oil prices rebounded Thursday, with West Texas Intermediate crude surging back above $103 a barrel.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to also be lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's news-fueled session.


Stock Market In New Uptrend
---------------------------


Following [Wednesday's follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-as-fed-chair-powell-grasps-this-challenge-these-areas-shine-brightest/) on the S&P 500, investors have the green light to raise exposure by buying top stocks breaking out past proper buy points. Use the watchlist you curated during the stock market correction. Or you can also find stock ideas by monitoring IBD's proprietary watchlists, like the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


During new market uptrends, you should gradually raise exposure in stocks, as you sync your portfolio and mindset with the stock market action. Sometimes, buying opportunities are scant on a follow-through day, especially after sustained downtrends.


But don't panic if you miss the first couple of breakouts. If the stock market uptrend is real, there will be plenty of time to buy other stocks.

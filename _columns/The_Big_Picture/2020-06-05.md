The stock market surged Friday after an "amazing" jobs report, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite soared 2.1% to hit a record high, completely recovering from the coronavirus stock market crash.




The S&P 500 advanced 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged as much as 1,057 points before closing up 829 points, or 3.2%, amid an 11.5% jump in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) shares. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 3.8% advance. But many growth stocks sharply underperformed: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 1.7%, recovering a large portion of Thursday's 1.9% decline.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Thursday's session, indicating big institutional participation in today's rally.


Nasdaq Hits Record High
-----------------------


Ahead of the stock market's open Friday, the [Labor Department](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-coronavirus-comeback-adds-2-5-million-jobs-unemployment-rate-falls-dow-jones/) said employment rose by 2.5 million in May and the jobless rate declined to 13.3%. The report was much better than economists had feared. Wall Street expected a loss of 7.7 million jobs and a 19.8% unemployment rate. The May jobs gain was the biggest one-month rise since at least 1939. The strong jobs report prompted [President Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268886111130189824) to tweet, "This is an AMAZING JOBS REPORT!"


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP060520-215x300.jpg)The Nasdaq hit its record high Friday as it easily shrugged off Thursday's downside reversal and [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The Nasdaq's May 26 stall day was removed because the index rose more than 5% from that day's closing price, reducing distribution days to just one. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also has one distribution day, from Thursday. The lack of institutional selling indicates a bullish investor mindset with the ability to shrug off bad news, as seen in recent weeks.


Among the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) found much-needed support at its 50-day moving average with a 5.7% boost. According to Leaderboard commentary, "It is now in a follow-on buy area." [A first or second rebound off the 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) offers a prime opportunity to add shares to a winning core position.


On the downside, **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) fell further below its 385.95 buy point after a lackluster breakout attempt. Shares declined 1.7% and are approaching their 50-day support level. Meanwhile, **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) tumbled 2.6% to close right above the 50-day line. Rebounds at these levels could create new buy areas.

Stocks To Watch: Applied Materials, Netflix
-------------------------------------------


**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) broke out above a 58.26 buy point in a cup with handle base, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), in a 3.5% advance. The 5% buy zone runs up to 61.17.


Volume was below average, indicating a lack of institutional demand. On the breakout day, volume should leave no doubt as to the stock's strength, rising at least 40% above average.


Stock market leader **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is finding support at its 50-day line for the second time since a breakout above a 383.11 handle entry. It is a third stock testing support.


[Netflix boasts](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netflix-inc-nflx.aspx) a 98 out of a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, placing it in the top echelon of growth stocks. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors easily gauge a stock's strengths.

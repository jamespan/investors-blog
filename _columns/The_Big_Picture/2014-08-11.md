Major Indexes Kick Off Week With Gains; IBD 50 Rises 1.3%
==========================================================

Buyers came into the stock market Monday as geopolitical concerns moved to the back burner — at least for a day.

  

The Nasdaq closed off its high but still turned in a respectable performance, rising 0.7%. The S&P 500 was less impressive with a hesitant gain of 0.3%. It closed near its low after rising 0.7% early. Volume on both exchanges fell from Friday's levels.

  

Despite the S&P 500's lackluster performance, breadth on the New York Stock Exchange was curiously strong, with advancing stocks topping decliners by nearly 3 to 1. Breadth on the Nasdaq was also solid, with winners beating losers by more than 2 to 1.

  

With the Nasdaq composite back above its 50-day moving average, the index is making a case that it's ready to start a new uptrend, but it's not a compelling case yet. It would be more compelling with renewed signs of institutional buying, but there are scant signs of it so far. The Nasdaq's four most recent price gains have all come in lighter volume.

  

Last week, the S&P 500's latest pullback reached 4%. That's the same amount that it corrected in April before resuming its uptrend. Of course, that doesn't mean an uptrend is right around the corner, but it can't be ruled out with indexes so close to their highs and technical damage scarce in leading growth stocks.

  

Potentially good news for the market is the recent price action of the IBD 50. On Monday, it rose 1.3%, nearly doubling the performance of the Nasdaq.

  

Year to date, the index of leading growth stocks has performed mostly in line with the S&P 500, but it's been showing relative strength lately. When the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recently dived below their 50-day moving averages, the IBD 50 was generally able to hold above the support level.

  

Sideways action in the IBD 50 during recent market pullbacks — not only last summer but in the second half of 2010 — eventually yielded some powerful breakouts once the market uptrend resumed.

  

Leaders up in volume were few and far between on Monday. A screen run late in Monday's session yielded eight stocks. Five of them were speculative, China-based growth names.

  

Among the highlights, small-cap **iKang Healthcare Group** ([KANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KANG)) cleared a flat base, rising 8%. It closed just above a flat-base buy point of 20.

  

IKang [went public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in April at 14. It's a provider of preventive health care solutions in China. The company shows strong growth in recent quarters and has some mutual fund sponsorship, but it's on the thin side with an average daily volume of around 250,000 shares.

  

Meanwhile, online real estate firm **Leju Holdings** ([LEJU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEJU)) padded gains after reclaiming a 12.74 cup-with-handle buy point last week. Shares rose 5%. It closed 9% above the buy point.

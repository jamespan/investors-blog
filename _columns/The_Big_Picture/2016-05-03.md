Stocks Fall As Institutional Investors Continue Selling
========================================================

Sellers crowded into the stock market Tuesday, as their presence grew more and more uncomfortable for the bulls.


The Nasdaq led with a loss of 1.1%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.9%. Small caps fared particularly badly. The Russell 2000 tumbled 1.7%, its steepest loss since March 23.


![MP050316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP050316-159x300.jpg)The Nasdaq closed back below its 50-day moving average, dashing hopes that the index would get a footing at that key level. On Monday, the Nasdaq retook the 50-day line.


For chart readers who saw that encouraging sign, Tuesday's follow-up was the equivalent of getting the carpet pulled from under them. Instead of a rebound, the Nasdaq stayed in a downward path.


There was a silver lining, however. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 held above Friday's short-term lows. So, at least the downward trend didn't get worse.


Volume increased on the major exchanges, which gave the Nasdaq and S&P 500 another distribution day, i.e, evidence that institutional investors sold shares in massive amounts.


The market's two-week-old retracement is not surprising, not after the strong advance from February lows. But now the number of distribution days (eight on the Nasdaq and seven on the S&P 500) is getting dangerous.


As The Big Picture noted last week, there's been a worrisome clustering of distribution days. Also the most recent Nasdaq distribution days have been more severe, with losses in three of the past four days ofÂ 1.2%, 0.6% and 1.1%. During the mid-April spate of distribution days, the losses ranged from 0.4% and 0.8% and there was a stall day in which the Nasdaq was actually up 0.2%.


With the outlook uncertain, investors should be limiting their exposure to stocks. Using margin is particularly risky at the moment.


Leading stocks have not enjoyed much of the fruits of the February-March rally. Big winners have been sparse. In the IBD 50, which was down 1.4% Tuesday, several stocks have made modest gains from their buy points.


**B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS))is in buy range from a 40.60 buy point after soaring 23% Friday on an earnings beat. But for every B&G there's a loser, like **Headwaters** ([HW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HW)). The stock plunged 11% Tuesday despite beating profit expectations.


**U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) is rising from support at the 50-day moving average while **Masco** ([MAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAS)), another building products company, is testing support. Those deserve a closer look, and are part of an emerging trend in construction-related stocks.


The market was weak from the start Tuesday after weaker-than-expected manufacturing data from China.


The news sparked selling in stocks and fanned demand for haven assets. Treasury bonds rose. The Dow utilities average edged higher, one of the few corners of the market to escape selling.


Commodities, feeling the weight of the China data, were mainly lower. No surprise, energy and metals stocks were the worst performing on Tuesday.

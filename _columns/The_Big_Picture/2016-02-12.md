Stocks Post Solid Gains Despite Wall Of Worry
==============================================

Stocks regained some confidence Friday as the indexes opened positive and stayed on the upside throughout the session.


The Nasdaq pounded 1.7% higher, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each drummed up 2%.


The IBD 50 also added 2%.


![MP-021616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP-021616-169x300.jpg)Volume, however, was down on both major exchanges.


Friday's lower volume, however, may have been partly tied to the looming Presidents Day holiday Monday.


Still, up days in declining volume and down days in rising volume are the opposite of what bulls like to see.


Yet, that's mostly been the trend so far this month.


The weekly chart below shows the broader market picture. The Nasdaq's last 20% correction occurred in 2011, and it eventually led to a long advance.


Note that even after the October 2011 bottom was in place it took weeks of choppy action before the Nasdaq found traction in late December.


Leaders back then making gains after breakouts included **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)), **Sturm Ruger** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)), **Whole Foods Market** ([WFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFM)), **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


Two points to consider:


First, a torrent of quality movers isn't necessary if an investor identifies the leaders quickly.


Second, many of these stocks lodged gains well above the Nasdaq's roughly 20% gain in the first three months of 2012.


Apple, for example, rose about 50% in its run. Tractor Supply rose about 30%. Whole Foods gained 30%. Monster Beverage advanced 60%. Sturm Ruger rose 79%. Visa gained 22%.


Also, note the more recent low in October 2014. This is the next level that could provide a test for the current market. The Nasdaq is about 5% above the October 2014 low.


On Friday, retail data released before the open put the market in an optimistic mood.


Sales for January rose 0.2% vs. the previous month, matching expectations, but the December figure was revised up from -0.1% to +0.2%. The revision meant that retail sales have risen for three consecutive months.


Ex gasoline, retail sales for January rose 0.4%. Because gasoline prices are falling, gasoline distorts sales figures, even when transactions at the pump aren't slowing.


Oil-related news also favored the bulls.


The number of oil rigs drilling in the U.S. dropped by 30 rigs, or 5%, for the week. Less supply could help support prices.


Rumors of OPEC production cuts persisted but remain unconfirmed.


With the market in correction, there is no reason to buy stocks.


Individual investors who have built a big cash position should keep that cash on the sidelines until this turmoil is over. If things turn truly ugly, cash will look even better.


This is the time to study IBD’s charts and the fundamentals to find potential winners for watch lists.


For now, uncertainty is the dominant tone in the market. Oil and world economies are feeding fear and doubt.


Another factor that could be creeping into the market is the doubts surrounding the U.S. presidential election. The election is now less than nine months away, and this one is particularly hard to read.


For the week, the IBD 50 lost 1.5%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 sliced off 0.6% and 0.8% respectively.

Wait one hot minute. Is the bear market already on its back foot?




Inflation is raging. The inhumane bombings by Russia at its westerly neighbor are not showing any signs of abating. Most meme stocks and past darlings of the "work from home" bull run have been pounded virtually into oblivion, still trading leagues beneath their 200-day moving average (remember **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM))?). And isn't the Federal Reserve really going to take the punch bowl away this time, with seven more quarter-point rate hikes envisioned by the end of 2022?


Market veterans know there's always something to worry about. Names of presidents, central bank chiefs and corporate managers change. But the psychological concept of a wall of worry? This never changes.


"There is still a short-term-ism to the narratives hitting the market right now," David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com, told IBD. "Regarding the Fed's future actions, it's still fluid."


Yet four sessions after the S&P 500 staged its third [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) since mid-December, investors are perhaps telegraphing the possibility that the bear market of late 2021 to early 2022 might not approach the scale of some of the biggest convulsions in stock prices in our lifetimes.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP032222--226x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite's 2% surge on Tuesday marked the fifth gain in six sessions. The tech-enriched market-weighted index also staged its seventh gain of 1% or more for the month.


Is The Bear Market Over? The Nasdaq's New Challenge
---------------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund matched the Nasdaq's advance. They outperformed the S&P 500 (up 1.1%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (up 0.7%), Russell 2000 (up 1.1%) and SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) (up 0.6%). All of these indexes, plus the Nasdaq composite, finished the day above their own [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Volume fell mildly on both exchanges. Normally, you'd prefer to see robust gains by the indexes arrive in higher turnover vs. the prior session. But you really cannot expect this to occur on each and every day after a new confirmed uptrend.


A prime test now for the Nasdaq, after falling 22.5% from its all-time peak of 16,212, lies in how it handles an overhead supply of willing sellers in the 14,000 to 16,000 price levels.


What else should you expect, however, if this new uptrend is to last at least a little longer?


Defying The Bear Market?
------------------------


One, market breadth should expand. According to ThinkOrSwim, advancers beat decliners on the Nasdaq by a nearly 5-2 ratio Tuesday. On the NYSE, winners edged losers by a more than 3-2 margin.


Stocks making new highs should rise as well.


The market is slowly making progress here. As noted in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), the Nasdaq posted on average 51 companies making a 52-week or all-time high per day in the prior three sessions. That more than doubles the daily average of 24 seen from March 11 to March 15.


(Track the expanded daily list of new 52-week highs vs. lows at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). Click on "New Highs" to see the top sectors contributing to this list.)


In a new confirmed uptrend, more growth stocks with excellent fundamentals should bust out of well-formed bases and roll into new high ground. If a stock makes new highs after digesting its gains, everyone in the stock itself is happy — except for those plying short sales.


Even though small caps made an underwhelming gain for the day, the accompanying Market Pulse highlights a small bunch of mighty mites that could produce some nice tradable rallies.


Alpha Stock
-----------



Take **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)). The member of IBD's fabless semiconductor industry has a market value of less than $2 billion. Yet it deserved the spotlight on Tuesday. Shares roared past a 59.48 buy point in a [10-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/).


True, the handle showed an unusually steep decline, much more than typically desired. But the handle served its purpose. Remaining uncommitted holders who bought at higher prices exited the stock. Notice how turnover on the stock's down days since March 7 dried up like an unused sponge. Volume picked up as the stock rallied past a [short trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) that could be drawn from the handle's high of 59.38. This offers an aggressive buy point.


When Alpha & Omega finally surpassed the base's 59.48 [traditional buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on Tuesday, volume catapulted 187% above average to 1.78 million shares, the highest in a single session so far this year.


The expert in power management chip designs has grown its earnings per share by 600%, 228%, 93% and 85% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. That's fundamental power. Sales ran up 58%, 45%, 23% and 22% over the same time frame. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) has vaulted into new high ground.


When you see stocks quickly get out of the 5% buy zone the way Alpha & Omega did Tuesday, you have to respect the fact that at least in the short term, the market is getting some of its footing back after falling into quite a heavily oversold condition caused by a bear market.



**Pacira BioSciences** ([PCRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCRX)) ($3.3 billion market value, 44.8 million shares outstanding), rental home operator **Tricon Residential** ([TCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCN)) ($4.6 billion, 272.4 million shares) and **Univar Solutions** ([UNVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNVR)) ($5.7 billion, 169.6 million shares) also represent brand-new leadership in the small-cap space.

What Is A Healthy Pullback Vs. A Serious Correction?
----------------------------------------------------


Keller, a former longtime technical analyst at Fidelity Investments, points out that the S&P 500 has essentially made no price progress since the middle of summer last year. This reflects movement away from growth stocks and into value names. As a result, energy, cyclical and financial sectors look more attractive.


"I'm often being asked, is it too late to buy 'fill in the blank' energy stock? I think they have made fairly healthy pullbacks. You have to give the benefit of the doubt on a bearish outlook on tech. It's the opposite for energy. Their charts look strong," Keller told IBD.


Keller argues a structural bear market is still in place, and it started in November. Note that IBD's own market outlook remains at "confirmed uptrend."


He acknowledges that some megacap leaders in the tech sectors are declining in normal fashion. That is, a handful of long-term leaders have found support at key levels of past price resistance. Indeed, such names usually find willing buyers at the 200-day moving average — even in a bear market.


Also, the Relative Strength Rating should remain quite high, particularly on a 12-month basis.

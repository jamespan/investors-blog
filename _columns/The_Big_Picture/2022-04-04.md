The technology and consumer sectors extended their rallies on Monday, and the Nasdaq continued to be the leading index of the new stock market uptrend.




The Nasdaq composite led Monday with a 1.9% jump. It's the fourth time the composite climbed nearly 2% since the index closed back above the 50-day moving average on March 22.


Indeed, the Nasdaq has been the leading index since the market [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) in the third week of March. It is up 15.6% from the March 14 low, outperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 10% in the same period.


Its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) is C- compared with D for the S&P 500 and D- for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The S&P tech sector and its related Communications Services sector are up 14.5% and 12.1% respectively since their March lows. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) is up more than 17%, thanks largely to the performance of **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) since mid-March.


Techs Lead Stock Market But Few Breakouts
-----------------------------------------


But remarkably few tech stocks have broken out of bases even as the sector rallies. [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s list of recent breakouts shows **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) and **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) above [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/). **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)), a chip equipment maker, is also above its chart entry. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is trading above the 176.75 buy point of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/).


Part of the problem is that tech leaders are still recovering off lows from this year's correction. **Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) have moved off lows, but both stocks are still more than 30% off their highs.


Some of the sectors that had been leading the market are now unwinding. Shipping stocks have been getting trashed after rallying on higher cargo rates. IBD's shipping transport industry group plunged nearly 7% Monday and its leaders are on the run. **Global Ship Lease** ([GSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSL)) slid 7.5%; **Matson** ([MATX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MATX)) sold off 11.5%.


Indexes took a two-day break last week, and on Friday reversed higher. That momentum carried into Monday, when the market rose into the close. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% and the Dow industrials 0.3%. Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq from Friday's totals.


Advancers beat decliners by 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq and by 6-to-5 on the NYSE.


Yield Curve Inversion Worries Stock Market
------------------------------------------


On Friday, the yield on the [two-year Treasury note climbed to 2.45%](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-unemployment-rate-slides-amid-solid-hiring-dow-jones/), surpassing the yield on the 10-year Treasury of 2.38%. That sent chills on Wall Street, because inversions of the yield curve historically have predicted recessions in the U.S. economy.


On Monday, the inversion continued, with the two-year yield at 2.426% and the 10-year at 2.409%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The Treasury yield curve is flat or inverted at multiple points, according to Tradeweb. That includes the five-year/10-year spread, which on Friday closed the most inverted since September 2000. Meanwhile, the three-month/10-year Treasury spread, which some believe to be a better recession indicator, has been getting steeper.


Keep in mind that it can take many months for a recession to hit, and the stock market has a history of rising from the initial inversion.


When the 10-year yield closed below the two-year yield Friday, it was the first time since Aug. 30, 2019, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Back then, the S&P 500 climbed 5.1% one month following the inversion. The index rose 17.2% six months after the inversion and 19.3% 12 months afterward.


In the seven times the two-year and 10-year yields have inverted since 1978, the S&P 500 rose an average of 2.2% one month later. Gains grew to 6.2% and 11.8% in the six-month and 12-month periods.


Investors expect the Fed to remain hawkish. The [CME Group FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) tool now shows a 75% chance of a 50-basis-point hike at the May Fed meeting.

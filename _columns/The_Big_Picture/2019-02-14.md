Stock indexes staged a positive reversal Thursday as the bulls stepped in to buy on the day's dip. The Nasdaq, for instance, sank 0.6% early in the afternoon and then rallied to a small gain for the day.




A positive reversal is a bullish sign. Yet, the S&P 500 suffered a [day of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which is a bearish sign.


Together, the contrary evidence combined to create a hard-to-read session.


At the close, the Nasdaq was up 0.1% and the small-cap Russell 2000 echoed that gain. The large-cap S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while Dow Jones retreated 0.4%.

The S&P 500's loss in higher volume met the definition of distribution, a sign of institutional selling.


Fights At The 200-Day Line
--------------------------


Despite the positive reversal, the bullish part of the day's action seemed only half completed.


The Nasdaq is struggling to retake its 200-day moving average, after conquering the lower 50-day line in January.


But the S&P 500 closed above its 200-day line for a third consecutive session, The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has built a nice cushion since retaking its 200-day line in late January.


Oddly, the Dow Jones is up the least this year but is in a better position — in relation to its 200-day line — than the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.


In the meantime, the small-cap Russell 2000 leads the three other indexes but remains about 3% below its 200-day line.


So far this year, the Russell 2000 is up 14%; the Nasdaq, 12%; the S&P 500, 10%; and the Dow 9%.


Software Leads
--------------


Software stocks have been among the market leaders this year. They were among the few stocks Thursday that chipped in high volume price gains. Network security software provider **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) gapped up 20% in huge volume [on outstanding Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cyberark-earnings-cybr-stock/). Business software maker **SailPoint Technolgies** ([SAIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIL)) rose 3% in heavy volume.


But cloud security software provider **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) dropped 1% in heavy volume, following up on Wednesday's 14% loss on weak guidance.


In the 30-component Dow Jones, **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) spilled 8% in heavy volume. The company offered disappointing guidance for 2019.


Among IBD's 197 stock groups, electronic consumer products, cement and international oil explorers scored good gains for the day. The price of light sweet crude oil rose 1.1%.


The day's biggest losers included heating and air conditioning, cosmetics and steel.

Stock Market Roars But Consider This Roadblock; Energy Stocks Burn Brightest
=============================================================================

The stock market snapped a losing streak with a strong rally Friday but there are still reasons for investors to be cautious.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day with a muscular 2.3% gain. Despite this pop, it ended the week with a meager 0.1% gain. The tech-heavy index has risen in three of the last four weeks and is up almost 18% so far in 2023.


The benchmark S&P 500 also jumped, powering up 1.7%. Nevertheless, it closed the week in negative territory, falling 0.8%. On the plus side, it found support at the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Gainers outnumbered decliners by more than 5-to-1 on the NYSE and about 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Volume failed to impress on both indexes. This, coupled with a lack of actionable stocks, should give investors pause for thought.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average failed to keep pace with other major indexes but still rose 1.7%. Dow component **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) took top honors after it soared nearly 5% on earnings. But **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) was a capable co-star with a 3.2% lift.


Small caps impressed on a day where embattled regional banks fought back with aplomb.


The Russell 2000 jumped 2.4%. But it was still a loser for the week and remains under its 50-day line. Growth stocks fared best of all, lifting the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) 2.8%.


Friday's rally was impressive but it was not without caveats.


It is important to stay defensive after one impressive session, especially amid a flurry of distribution days. For now at least, the stock market uptrend remains under pressure and exposure should still be limited to 20% to 40%.


Jobs Report Strong But Silver Linings Boost Hopes

Stocks rallied after the latest jobs report showed the U.S. economy added 253,000 jobs in April, higher than views for 185,000. Wages also came in hotter than expected.


But there were signs of weakness, with the prior two reports seeing a downward revision of 149,000 jobs. This brings the three-month average payroll gain to 222,000, down from 295,000.


With increasing weakness in the private services sector, most bets are on a softening labor market. â€‹And, despite stronger-than-expected data, [odds of a June interest rate hike](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) remained subdued at just 5%.


Attention will turn once again to inflation next week, with the April consumer price index (CPI) release on Wednesday.

Energy Stock Market Groups Impress
----------------------------------


All S&P 500 sectors ended the day positive. Energy and technology were the strongest performers while defensive consumer staples and utilities lagged. Shrewd investors should pay attention to relative performance of the IBD Industry Groups.


A variety of oil and gas stocks impressed, with drillers faring best of all. Foreign banks, superregional banks and automakers also outperformed.


E-commerce, telecom, medical research equipment and insurers struggled, despite the bullish posture of Friday's stock market.

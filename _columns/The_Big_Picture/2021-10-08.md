The stock market held up pretty well Friday until the final half-hour of trading as energy and financial stocks outperformed. But sellers hit several growth stocks again as the 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level since early June.




After getting turned away at its 21-day exponential moving average Thursday, the Nasdaq composite ended near its session low, falling 0.5% in lower volume on the fourth day of its rally attempt.


Selling was less intense in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. The S&P 500 eased 0.2% on the fourth day of its rally attempt and the Dow Jones fell less than 0.1% on the sixth day of its rally attempt. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.8%.

Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.


Stock Market Today
------------------


After bumping up against its 50-day moving average Thursday, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.4%. **Inspire Medical Systems** ([INSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSP)), **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) and **Sprout Social** ([SPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPT)) ended with losses of more than 5%. The IBD 50 ETF lost 0.9% for the week after slumping 8.7% the prior week.


The September employment report missed expectations handily after better-than-expected private payroll data earlier in the week from ADP. The economy created 194,000 jobs in September, well below the consensus of 475,000. But August payrolls were revised higher to 366,000 from an initially reported 235,000. Average hourly earnings were up 0.6% in September, a little hotter than expected. Year over year, average hourly earnings rose 4.6%, also above expectations.


The headline number wasn't great, but the bond market's message is that the Federal Reserve is still on track to start tapering its monthly asset purchases, possibly before the end of the year. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped for the second straight session, rising 3 basis points to 1.6%. In the past three weeks, the 10-year yield has jumped more than 20 basis points.

Inside The MarketSmith Growth 250
---------------------------------


The [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) yielded plenty of strong movers in the oil and gas sector, but many are extended past proper entries. **Magnolia Oil & Gas** ([MGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGY)) added 4.5% to 19.79. The gain from the 16.48 buy point hit 20%, putting the stock in a profit-taking zone. **Pioneer Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)), **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) and **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) were other top gainers in the sector, extending gains after recent breakouts.


U.S. crude oil futures topped the $80 per barrel level, a multiyear high, but settled at $79.35 a barrel, up 1.3%.


With major stock indexes still below their 50-day lines, the stock market is still vulnerable to more downside, but a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-look-a-lot-alike-how-to-identify-one/) could happen at any time. And stock market bulls are encouraged by the number of growth stocks that continue to show strength and support after earlier breakouts.


**Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) joined the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) watchlist Friday because its weekly chart has the appearance of a [high, tight flag](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-tesla-stock-rally-high-tight-flag-base/).

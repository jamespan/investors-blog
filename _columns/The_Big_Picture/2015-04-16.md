Stocks went nowhere Thursday and in no particular hurry.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 eased less than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the IBD 50 were even closer to flat.


Volume faded across the board.


The market uptrend remains a riddle.


Individual investors who track the market closely are asking the same question, whether they are bullish or bearish: Is this uptrend half empty or half full?


The fact that most can agree on the word "half" is reason enough to be cautious.


If an investor needs further confirmation, the heavy load of distribution days the indexes are carrying should be sufficient.


Distribution involves a significant loss in rising volume. It's the footprint of institutional selling.


Yet the market picture has had minor improvements.


Consider a few facts:


•Two weeks ago, the distribution day count was at nine for both major indexes. Now the count is six and five. Two weeks ago, the indexes showed just one day of accumulation in the previous 10 sessions. In the past 10 sessions, including Thursday, five days showed accumulation in at least one index. (Accumulation is the opposite of distribution. It points to institutional buying.)


•The percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day average price line was 60% in Thursday's IBD. That's the highest level in seven months.


•Of 18 major world markets tracked by IBD, only Brazil's benchmark exchange traded fund is down year to date. Last year, two of every three world markets lost ground. What changed? Some point to the European Union's embrace of quantitative easing. But maybe "what changed" is the wrong question. Perhaps world markets see something good further out.


•The price of light sweet crude oil appears to have settled. After plunging almost 60% to $43.58 a barrel, West Texas Intermediate has rebounded to the upper $50s. If the price of oil can hold to a tighter range, the stock market can remove one unknown.


•Daily new highs on the Nasdaq and NYSE have been rising, while new lows are falling.


•The last test only each investor can answer. During the recent shallow pullback, did you sell anything to protect gains? Whether that has led to regret or relief says something about this uptrend.


Economic reports were mixed Thursday. Housing starts in March missed views. First-time jobless claims rose unexpectedly. But the Philadelphia Fed's outlook survey topped views.

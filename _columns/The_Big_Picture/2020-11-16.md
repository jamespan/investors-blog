  Vaccine Hopes Send Dow, Small Caps To New Highs; The Nasdaq's Next Big Test

In many ways, Monday's stock market echoed last Monday's performance.




Encouraging news on a coronavirus vaccine sent indexes flying early, although the market took back some gains. The Nasdaq composite lagged, just like it did a week ago. The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 2.4% and made a new high; a week ago, it rallied 3.7%.


Transportation and oil industry groups were broadly higher. The Dow transports raced ahead 2.6%. [Leisure stocks also led](https://www.investors.com/news/airline-stocks-other-leisure-get-second-rally-in-week-coronavirus-vaccine/). But software, internet retail and some other pandemic plays were weaker.


One important difference between the two Mondays was that indexes this time saw a strong afternoon bounce. Indexes closed practically at session highs as buyers swarmed in during the closing minutes. On Nov. 9, the Nasdaq reversed lower and the S&P 500 pared gains.


If it seemed like [a reprisal of last Monday's market,](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/us-stocks-fade-after-big-coronavirus-news-a-market-rotation-underway/) that's because the scene was so similar. On that day, **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and partner **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) announced encouraging trials for their Covid-19 vaccine. Monday, it was **Moderna**'s ([MNRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNRNA)) turn to stir hopes. The company said [its vaccine was 94.5% effective in a final-phase trial](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-buy-now/). The stock jumped nearly 10% and broke out of a base with a 95.31 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


![MP111620](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP111620-211x300.jpg)The Nasdaq rose 0.8%, closing at 11,924. The composite now faces an [important test at the 12,000 level](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-sells-off-again-dow-up-will-value-stocks-beat-growth-stocks/). It got turned away at that level Sept. 2, mid-October and Nov. 9.


The S&P 500 — which added 1.2% Monday — has had its own problems around the 3550-3600 level. But the index outperformed the Nasdaq and made a new closing high.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6%. The Dow cleared September and October highs, and now tries to challenge the year's peak. It also made a new high Monday. Covid-hampered stocks including **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) led the Dow.


Advancers led decliners by 12-to-5 on the Nasdaq and better than 9-2 on the NYSE. Volume rose, which made Monday's index gains all the more significant. Rising volume on index gains is a good indication that institutional investors are buying heavily into the rally.


Stock Market Rotation Continues
-------------------------------


Hopes that the pandemic can be halted are causing cyclical and value stocks to recover, especially compared with growth stocks. IShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 0.5% while iShares Russell 1000 ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) nearly quadrupled that performance with a 1.9% leap.


Last week, the growth ETF fell 1.2% as the value fund rallied 5.7% as economically sensitive shares got the upper hand.


Much of the coronavirus economy has depended a lot on technology, so it's little wonder that the Nasdaq couldn't quite keep up.


IBD's enterprise software industry group exemplifies how quickly the stock market has cooled on coronavirus plays. The group ranked in the top 15 for much of October, but [is now No. 87](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-nov-13-2020/) for six-month relative performance among 197 industries tracked by IBD.



**Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) is 32% off its prior high and [trading well below the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-rule-is-the-stock-living-beneath-the-10-week-line/).


**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), **Bandwidth** ([BAND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAND)) and **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) also have fallen below the 10-week line.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), the general store for millions who are avoiding stores, is lagging but is still working on a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


Certainly, there are still some Covid stocks that continue to hold up. **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) and **PerkinElmer** ([PKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKI)) are [worth a look in the IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/national-beverage-stock-150-run-bubbles-buy-zone-leads-growth-stocks/).


While the stock market goes through a rotation, investors must stay on top of it. Selling your struggling leaders will be necessary. But it's just as important to watch for new opportunities. Industry groups rising fast in the past week include regional banks, airlines, staffing services and some retail. (See the IBD stock research tables at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) for big shifts in sector rankings.) As always, make sure companies have strong fundamentals, then study their charts. Many stocks rebounding from the Covid recession still have weak financials.


The IBD 50 underperformed. It rose only 0.3%, seriously behind the major indexes.

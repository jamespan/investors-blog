The stock market is extending its uptrend, and it appears to be broadening with some growth stocks now leading along with energy, financials and some cyclicals.




After a half hour of trading, U.S. indexes shook off sellers and rallied into the close. It was the fourth consecutive gain for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. All four days saw the indexes close near session highs, a good indicator for the market's advance.


The Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% as technology, internet and consumer discretionary sectors led with gains of 0.8% to 1.2%. The composite closed above 15,000 for the first time since Sept. 27.


The S&P 500 added 0.3%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lighter on the NYSE.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1%, partly due to **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)). The stock gapped down for a loss of 3% after Barclays downgraded it from overweight to equal weight and cut the price target to 175 from 210. Disney stock remains around the lows of a consolidation.


Stock Market Leadership Broadens
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP101821-255x300.jpg)The stock market came off its October lows, thanks mainly to strength in energy, financials and commodity-related stocks.


But now, multiple measuring sticks show that growth stocks are playing a role in the new uptrend, which was initiated with Thursday's [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on the Nasdaq.


The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 0.9% Monday and is up 3.5% since the eve of the follow-through. Compare that with the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)), which fell 0.3% Monday and is up 1.9% the past three sessions.


The IBD 50, a gauge of growth stocks, is outperforming. The index leapt 1.6% Monday. It's risen nearly 5% since Wednesday.


Much of the credit belongs to a handful of stocks — including some IPOs — that continue making outsize gains. **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) surged more than 12% and is extended from support at the 10-week moving average. **Cloudflare**'s ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) breathtaking 13-day advance saw the stock surge nearly 8%.


**Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) rose more than 8% and is nearing a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Four other IBD 50 stocks rose more than 4%.


Stock Market Breakouts In Growth Companies
------------------------------------------


Monday's breakouts included many growth companies.



**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which is in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-growth-stocks-how-to-spot-the-flat-base-amid-long-winding-chart-action/) and is now just above the 305.94 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). The cloud computing and enterprise software giant also holds a spot in [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/).


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) broke out past the 114.59 buy point of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/). The chip designer's earnings ramped up 63%, 189% and 250% the past few quarters.


**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) and remained in buy range from the 322.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The relative strength line made a new high, a bullish sign for the breakout. It helped overcome weak volume on the move.


Apparel retailer **Revolve Group** ([RVLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVLV)) closed above the 72.37 buy point of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Its earnings swelled 108%, 117%, 400% and 110% the past few quarters.


**Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) jumped past the 467.02 buy point of a flat base, [earning its spot back on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). But this is a [risky late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).


Light volume dulled the five breakouts, as none could muster more than 28% above-average volume.


**State Street** ([STT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STT)) broke out of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in more than double its normal volume. Shares gained 2.2% but backed off session highs. Early Monday, the investment management firm beat third-quarter expectations and said it plans to resume its stock buybacks next year.


Game Plan
---------


The stock market's backdrop is not so shiny. Clogged supply chains are hurting a number of businesses. Materials and goods shortages are one reason U.S. inflation is elevated. Labor shortfalls still hurt hospitality, travel and some industries recovering from the pandemic.


But when your team is winning, keep cheering. Investors should continue to increase their exposure to stocks, and increase it based on the success of indexes and their individual holdings. It's one thing to be cautious, but another to leave profits on the table.


The stock market opened lower Monday after gloomy headlines came out of Beijing. China's [third-quarter economic growth of 4.9%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-third-quarter-economic-growth-slows-sharply-to-4-9-11634522925?mod=article_inline) slowed sharply from the previous quarter's 7.9% growth rate and was below economists' expectations.


Yet, Asian stocks weren't bothered much. Tokyo's Nikkei fell less than 0.2%. The Shanghai composite eased 0.1% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng climbed 0.3%. On Wall Street, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) rose 0.5%. But Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF ([ASHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASHR)), which tracks mainland stocks, dropped more than 1%.

Small caps set the pace in the stock market Friday, as the major indexes lagged but still scored gains.




The Russell 2000, a small-cap gauge, jogged ahead 1%. The large-cap S&P 500 coasted 0.5%, while blue chips in the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%.


The Nasdaq fell as much as 0.7% but then reversed to a 0.3% gain for the day, closing at session highs.


Volume in the stock market was lower on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.


Bullish Breadth
---------------


Despite the moderate moves in the indexes, advancing issues led declining issues by a 2-1 ratio on both major exchanges.

In the small-cap space, many of the stocks were bouncing off deep bottoms. **BJ's Restaurants** ([BJRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJRI)) gapped up 5% but remains 33% off its high. **QuinStreet** ([QNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QNST)), a provider of marketing programs, rose 4% to close 28% off its high.


New Highs Strategy In Stock Market
----------------------------------


IBD-style investors usually avoid stocks that are far off their highs. Part of the inspiration for IBD-type investing came from studying [Jack Dreyfus](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/jack-dreyfus-brought-big-wall-street-returns-to-main-street/), who made a fortune buying stocks that hit new highs.


Fortunately, the current uptrend hasn't had to rely on junky stocks. Tech and software have been leaders and haven't yet abandoned that role.


The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) advanced 4% for the week, its best weekly gain since early January.


Another area of promise is in initial public offerings. For the week, software play **PagerDuty** ([PD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PD)) rose almost 9%; internet platform provider **Sea Limited** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)), 11%; Germany-based **Jumia Technologies** ([JMIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JMIA)), 14%; internet company **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), 21%; **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)), 2%; and financial play **UP Fintech** ([TIGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIGR)), up almost 9%.


Economic News
-------------


GDP for the first quarter came in at 3.2%, topping the consensus estimate of 2.3%.


The Coming Week
---------------


Q1 earnings season will continue with some big players reporting. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) will release results Monday. On Tuesday, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) will report.


The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday. The Street is confident that the Fed will not change interest rates.

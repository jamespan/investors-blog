U.S. stock indexes plowed higher Thursday but still remained under their 50-day moving averages.




The Dow Jones industrial average grabbed the lead role, advancing 1.2%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 followed with gains of 1% and 0.8%, respectively.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and was slightly higher the NYSE.


Technically the market still has some work to do. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and the Dow each need to retake [the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). The indexes have been below those levels for weeks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP041218-300x287.png)News on China and SyriaÂ stepped back from the spotlight Thursday. Lately, the market has been news-driven.


President Trump put Syria on the back burner when he tweeted that an attack on Syria could be "very soon or not so soon at all!"


China meanwhile denied it was backing down on trade vis-a-vis Trump. A spokesman said the cut in import tariffs on U.S. cars was only an attempt to improve China's economy.


Overlooked Factor
-----------------


One item that hasn't been much in the news but could affect stocks is the legislation to alter Dodd-Frank banking regulations.


House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said late Wednesday that scaling back Dodd-Frank will be done before he retires. Ryan announced Wednesday that he would not run for re-election.

The stumbling block for Ryan is that the Senate and the House have differing ideas on what the changes to Dodd-Frank should be. This could kill the bill and leave regulations intact.


Bank stocks have been a mixed story in 2018. The [superregional group](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-s-v-b-financial-group-sivb.aspx) is up 6% so far this year and the west/southwest banks group is up 4%. Other bank groups aren't budging much.


Focus Shifts To Earnings
------------------------


Meanwhile, the quiet news day let the market focus on earnings reports.


Among stocks reporting quarterly results:


**Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) [edged above the Street's view on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/delta-air-lines-reports-earnings-airline-stocks/) but missed slightly on revenue. The stock price rose 3% in volume 75% above average. Delta retook its 200-day moving average but fell short of the 50-day line. The stock is shaping a new base.


Financial management firm **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) [topped estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/blackrock-earnings-top-ishares-inflows/) on earnings and revenue. The stock rose 1.5% in average volume. BlackRock remains under its 50-day line as it works on a base.


**Commerce Bancshares** ([CBSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBSH)) popped more than 6%, marking a 52-week high. The stock is extended from a breakout. The bank is headquartered in Kansas City.


**Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) topped the Street's target on earnings. The midcap stock rose nearly 4%, retaking its 200-day line. Ozarks is still under its 50-day line.


Window and glass wall maker **Apogee Enterprises** ([APOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APOG)) stomped the Street's consensus earnings estimate. Profits were about 55% above expectations, according to William O'Neil + Co. data. Revenue, though, fell short. Apogee slid 9% in huge volume.


Big Day For Banks Friday
------------------------


Friday will be a big day for quarterly reports from banks.


**Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **PNC Financial Services** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)) will report before the stock market's open. Analysts have raised 2018 estimates for all four stocks.


**First Horizon National** ([FHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FHN)), a Memphis, Tenn.-based bank, and San Francisco-based **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) also will report before the open.


Two Breakouts
-------------


Breakouts were scarce Thursday, but two stocks made confident-looking moves.


**Ionogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)), a maker of portable oxygen devices, popped 2.7% in volume 37% above average. The stock ended the session in the 5% buy zone.


Casino operator **Melco Resorts** ([MLCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLCO)) knifed 6% higher in almost twice its usual volume. The stock is in the 5% buy zone.

The stock market uptrend showed more strength Tuesday as the Nasdaq composite pared a 0.9% intraday loss to 0.4% by the close.




Sentiment was negative in the technology sector early, hurt by earnings sell-offs for **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)), **Allegro MicroSystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) and **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)). MPWR found support at its 50-day moving average, but ALGM slumped below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), while RMBS gapped below its 50-day line.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher by 0.2%, buoyed by a gain of nearly 9% for **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)). After a breakout from a cup-with-handle base on July 11, CAT soared to an all-time high, helped by a 22% surge in Q2 revenue. In the company's energy and transportation segment, revenue jumped 27%, helped by strong demand for engines and turbines.


Caterpillar's strong Q2 lifted group peer **Terex** ([TEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEX)) above its short-term moving averages. After the close, the maker of construction equipment jumped nearly 5% after reporting earnings.


Another industrial stock, **Eaton Corp**. ([ETN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETN)), shot to an all-time after finding support at its 21-day line. A strong earnings report was the catalyst.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Buyers lifted the Nasdaq composite off lows as the index holds above its 10-day line. The S&P 500 traded in a tight range and eased 0.3%. Volume fell on both exchanges.

IShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) eased 0.5%, but buyers lifted the small-cap fund well off session lows.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.


Market breadth has improved dramatically in recent weeks, leaving stock market bulls feeling pretty good about the uptrend. The uptrend was confirmed all the way back on March 29 with follow-through days for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500.


The 10-year Treasury yield made a notable move, crossing above the 4% level. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 4.04%, up 8 basis points.


The gain in the 10-year yield fueled a breakout for ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury ETF ([TBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBT)). TBT moved above its recent high of 31.81, but TBT's high of 32.75 set in early March still looms large as a potential resistance level.

In [economic news](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), the ISM manufacturing index contracted again in July, but was mostly in line with expectations at 46.5. On Wednesday, the ADP Employment Report is expected to show private payrolls up 185,000 in July, well below June's 497,000. The data comes ahead of Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up 200,000, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.6%.


The Fed wants to see some softness in the labor market to help bring inflation down.


After a nice day of outperformance Monday, Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gave back 1.9%. The fund was weighed down weakness in **Symbotic** ([SYM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYM)). But a 9% decline didn't look too bad in light of Monday's earnings surge.


Movers And Shakers
------------------


**Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) also fell hard in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), despite better-than-expected earnings and revenue. The company issued a soft Q3 outlook and said full-year occupancy would be about 200 basis points lower than pre-pandemic levels. The news weighed on **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)), which slumped 4.5% and paid a visit to its 50-day line.


But selling pressure was muted in group leader **Royal Caribbean Cruises** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)). RCL eased 1.5% and held above its 10-day line. RCL joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) on May 17, when it was in the early stages of an upside breakout.

**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) was an earnings winner, up nearly 20%, after reporting [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/anet-stock-arista-earnings-q22023/) and guiding Q3 revenue above expectations. ANET stock gapped above its 50-day line and short-term moving averages and cleared a 10-week consolidation.


**United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) rallied for the third straight session and topped a 471.82 buy point after a volatile reaction to earnings last week



As always, monitor your current holdings and be on the lookout for opportunities to take partial or full profits in some of your winners. If a strong performer breaks support at the 21-day line, that's an opportunity to take at least partial profits.


That said, the uptrend is still showing a lot of strength with a relatively light distribution day count.


The only meaningful day of distribution on the Nasdaq was on July 20 when the index slumped just over 2%. Meanwhile, of the S&P 500's four distribution days, the worst percentage decline was an 0.8% drop on July 6.

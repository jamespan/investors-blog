The stock market ended the day, month and quarter on a bum note as early gains faded. Investors will now be weighing the rising risks of a government shutdown heading into next week.




The Nasdaq composite saw early gains fade badly as it ended the day up just 0.1%. The index rose for the week by a thin margin, but suffered its worst month of 2023 so far as it skidded 5.8%. The tech-heavy index has regained some ground on its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and snapped a three-week losing streak, however. It remains up just over 27% so far this year.


The S&P 500 reversed lower, falling 0.3%. Its weekly retreat of almost 1% means it has now fallen for a fourth week in a row. It also suffered its worst month of the year and lost ground on its 50-day line. It is now up just over 12% in 2023 as gains continue to melt away.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared the worst out of the major indexes, tumbling 0.5%. It has now fallen below its 200-day line, though it remains within striking distance. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was the top performer as it lifted 6.7% amid a positive response to its latest quarterly report. Insurance stock **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) was the worst laggard as a majority of components fell.


Small caps were also hit, with the Russell 2000 dropping 0.5% and losing ground on its 200-day moving average. Growth stocks fared better, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) turning in a nominal gain.


The fact that Treasury yields closed well off session lows, as they were rising again, also weighed on securities. The 10-year yield dipped 2 basis points to 4.58%, while the two-year yield also slipped 2 basis points to 5.47%. The yield curve remains inverted.


With the stock market now well in the grip of a correction, IBD is recommending investors hold market exposure in the 0%-20% range. Now is the time to assemble a robust watchlist of strong stocks so you are prepared for the start of the next uptrend.


Government Shutdown Looms Large, Raises These Risks
---------------------------------------------------


Early on in the session stocks rallied after the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index excluding food and energy rose 0.1% in August. This was below views for a 0.2% increase. Its year-over-year increase of 3.9% was in line with expectations. Consumer spending in August also rose 0.4% on a current-dollar basis, a big reduction on the previous month's 0.9% lift.

A shutdown will take effect if a bill fails to be approved by Congress and President Joe Biden by 12:01 a.m. Sunday.


While a government shutdown would be far from a surprise, there are still a number of issues that investors will have to digest. First, the publishing of federal economic data would be suspended during a shutdown, which would decrease visibility.


[Goldman Sachs estimated](https://www.gspublishing.com/content/research/en/reports/2023/09/27/445d5477-1cfc-4015-b441-932e24472720.html)  that a shutdown is likely to last two to three weeks. Friday's jobs report and the following week's September inflation report may not be released on time, both of which are potential market movers.


In addition, credit rating agency Moody's has said that a shutdown would threaten the U.S.' triple A credit rating.

This Stock Market Group Shines Amid Nike Earnings
-------------------------------------------------


A majority of the S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory. Technology and consumer discretionary fared best, while energy and financials struggled the most.

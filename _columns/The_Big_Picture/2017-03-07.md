Stocks fell Tuesday, as the market continued to creep lower in what lately has become a customary pattern of moderate price behavior.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 lost 0.3% while the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1%. Small caps lagged noticeably, with the Russell 2000 sliding 0.7%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, resulting in a new [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764).




So while the Nasdaq and S&P indexes added a distribution day, at the same time both lost the Jan. 30 distribution because it's now too dated to matter anymore.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP4-3_030717-167x300.png)Indexes had trouble finding direction all day, tumbling in the final half-hour. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed near session lows.


But they remained in the small price ranges that have characterized the market this year. So far in 2017, the Nasdaq's average daily price change is about 0.4% on the upside and 0.3% on the downside. The average price spread is 0.6%.


After six straight weeks of gains, the indexes are due for a rest, even if that win streak came in measured increases. The Nasdaq closed below its 10-day moving average back-to-back days for the first time since the end of December. So short-term support is elusive.


A pullback wouldn't necessarily be dangerous and in fact could be desirable, giving the market a chance to rest and get itself ready to push higher.


The mild number of distribution days certainly does not point to any serious selling among institutional houses.


But there's a higher risk with leading stocks than with the general market. While dozens of top-rated stocks rallied on Q4 results, many others have tanked.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) and **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) were among those leaving their mark on earnings season.


On Tuesday, **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) skidded 10% in big volume after it announced results. The sell-off caused the RV and mobile home industry group to the bottom of Tuesday's industry performance list, off 4.5%.


But homebuilders climbed after **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) [beat profit expectations and gave a rosy full-year outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/lgi-homes-soars-on-earnings-builder-stocks-show-strength/). The stock surged 13%, touching the highest level since October. The industry group was one of the 10 best.


**Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)), a small-cap homebuilder, broke out of a base-on-base pattern with a 24.17 buy point. **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM))Â and **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) are industry leaders that have already broken out of bases in the past couple of weeks. Those moves show leadership emerging in the group.


But the financial sector, one of the big leaders of the postelection market, is flagging a bit. The SPDR Financial ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) sector index ETF has given back all of the 2.9% surge it made March 1. Some of the regional banks and savings and loans that rushed to new highs are cooling off, although sell signals remain rare.


**Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) and **Tarena International** ([TEDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEDU)) broke out too. But the former pulled back after crossing a 79.57 flat-base buy point; the flat base is part of a long base-on-base pattern.


Metals, energy and retail industry groups led the market lower. The Dow transports also stood out on the losing side, shedding 1.1%.


Hospitals, generic drug companies and other medical stocks also were broadly weaker on news Monday out of Washington, D.C., that Republicans unveiled a blueprint to replace ObamaCare. Meanwhile, President Trump on Tuesday tweeted a new call to control drug prices.

The Nasdaq composite on Monday sent a strong message to stock market watchers: Look at me now, I'm the leader.


Now the question is: Will the other key equity indexes follow?


With just 10 trading sessions remaining in the year, keeping a close eye on potential divergence in action between the Nasdaq and other key benchmarks may influence future decisions on how much to allocate to the stock market as 2025 arrives.




Stock Market: Tech Stocks Feel Bullish Vibes
--------------------------------------------


On Monday, tech stocks enjoyed more bullish vibes created by a solid quarterly report from semiconductor giant **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)). The Nasdaq composite, up 1.2% to 20,173, raced high enough to knock out the Nov. 13 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) due to price gains. Thus, as the Market Pulse table illustrates, the index now has just two relevant distribution days that are on IBD's 25-session rolling count.



The Nasdaq 100 did slightly better, advancing nearly 1.5%.


As of Monday's close, the Nasdaq 100 boasted a brilliant year-to-date gain of 31.3%. The Nasdaq composite stood 34.4% higher over the same time frame, above the S&P 500's 27.3% rally.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP121624-.jpg)Numerous computer-related stocks rose sharply on Monday. [Among IBD's 197 industries](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), data storage did the best, up 5.5% on a price-weighted basis. Integrated systems, security software, internet content and computer hardware and peripheral firms also helped lead the stock market. These industry groups, as well as specialty enterprise software and fabless semiconductors, gained 2% or more.


Yet, a motley array of other industry groups also flourished, from oil-and-gas royalty trust companies to meat to cable and satellite telecom. They also helped boost the S&P 500 to a 0.4% gain. At the day's high of 6,085, the 500 is just a fractional gain of taking out its Dec. 6 peak of 6,099.


The Russell 2000 rallied 0.6%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased nearly 0.3%.


Stock Market: Strength From S&P, Nasdaq
---------------------------------------


Notice on a daily chart how the S&P 500, like the Nasdaq, is exuding strength technically. That is, since a two-day sell-off on Nov. 14 and 15 pushed the large-cap benchmark to its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), fund managers evidently saw that decline as a fresh buying opportunity.


The S&P 500 has glided higher ever since. Its 21-day and 50-day lines are rising in smooth fashion.


So, what's the problem with the stock market? A quick look at the New York Stock Exchange composite index indicates some stock market investors are joining the selling side.


The composite index, down 0.5% on Monday, notched its seventh loss in eight sessions. The index — punch in zero-NYC in [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF&_gl=1*1r3utpm*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2LjY0NTg3ODExLjE3MzM5NDk2ODAuMTczMzk0OTY3OQ..*_ga*MjA3NTg4MzU4OC4xNzM0MDY0MTIz*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNDA5OTMyOS4zLjEuMTczNDA5OTMzNi41My4wLjA.) — also tripped further below its 50-day moving average.

Three Charts to Watch
---------------------


Unlike what was discussed in the Nasdaq, the NYSE composite failed to get buying support at its 21-day exponential moving average during a sharp slide that began on Dec. 5. Now, the NYSE index has recovered nicely during prior drops through the 50-day line in late July to early August, and for just a few days from Halloween through Nov. 2. So, it's worth keeping an eye on how this index behaves in the following days.


Further, contrary to the market cap-weighted S&P 500, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund slipped 0.3% on Monday. The fund also registered its seventh loss in eight sessions. A critical test of support at the 50-day line has arisen.


A third chart to watch: the Dow Jones transportation average. Seen by some stock market observers as a barometer of the future economy, the Dow transports dropped 0.8% on Monday to 16,580. Like the NYSE composite, it took closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the second straight session.


Transport stock **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) reports earnings on Thursday. Wall Street expects little to no growth.

Airlines, The Exception Among Transport Stocks?
-----------------------------------------------


Not all transport stocks have been underperforming the major equity indexes like FedEx this year. FDX is up 12% through Monday. However, airlines such as **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) and **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) have flourished amid lower fuel costs and relatively good relations between management and industry personnel this year.



The gain by UAL has been quite shocking.


After the global carrier rolled past a 49.67 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on Sept. 12 in a [proper double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), it's really taken off. Gains have at one point exceeded 111%. United Airlines, which closed Monday at 95.48, has flown 131% higher since Jan. 1.


Delta, which cleared a [five-month cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 52.45 on Oct. 14, has pierced through the 20%-25% profit zone from the breakout point. [Selling at least some shares into strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) is a cornerstone of savvy portfolio management. DAL, at 61.05 and trading nearly 3% above its 50-day line, is up 52% for the year.


Baird On Banks And Health Care
------------------------------


At this point, with the American consumer in relatively good shape, the dollar strong vs. overseas currencies, and energy prices sharply off multiyear highs, it seems logical to pay attention to new buy opportunities within the travel space.


Todd Sohn, managing director and technical strategist at Strategas, a unit of Baird Wealth Management, suggests staying with investing themes that are working as we approach the new year.


"Financials are ranked first in our technical sector rankings. They have great absolute trends and great relative trends. Are they a little bit overbought? Yes," he noted in an interview transcript shared with IBD. "Probabilistically speaking, however, when you get strong trends and overbought conditions, you're going to want to use pullbacks to add exposure."



The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) ETF has arrived at a key juncture. Having dropped three weeks in a row, it's now testing holders at the rising 10-week moving average.


Sohn also called health care a "really interesting space. It's gone from 16% of the S&P (500) to 10% over the last two years. That is a massive drop for a significant weight. You've seen the health care sector outflows really accelerate this year as performance has been challenging. And so, I think if you're looking for a contrarian area, away from financials and some of the more cyclical areas, health care is interesting from that perspective."

Eye On Breadth
--------------


Still, keep an eye on stock market internals, which were certainly mixed on Monday.


While early data showed that advancers edged decliners by fewer than 100 issues on the Nasdaq, losers actually outpaced winners by roughly 3-to-2 on the NYSE.


The attached General Market Indicators PDF page below shows 1,393 stocks falling on the NYSE vs. 888 rising. On the Nasdaq, 1,802 rallied while 1,746 retreated. Keep an eye on the Nasdaq's advance-decline line, which is near its lowest level over the past year.


Meanwhile, watch out for leading stocks that clip their 21-day lines. A failure to hold this short-term moving average could presage more profit-taking ahead.


For short-term traders, a drop through the 21-day exponential moving average could justify taking at least partial profits. **Champion Homes** ([SKY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKY)), **Aris Water** ([ARIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARIS)) and **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) all closed below their 21-day lines in heavy volume on Monday.


Meanwhile, the yield on the key U.S. 10-year Treasury bond held steady at 4.39% Monday.

title: Stocks Rebound But Volume Cools; What The Stock Market May Focus On Next

One day after a key downgrade in the outlook for stocks, major indexes got a badly needed reprieve from the big sell-off this month. But Tuesday's rebound lacked plenty of positive traits.




One critical thing that was missing? Volume.


The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.1% after closing off session highs. It outperformed gains of 0.8% by both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bargain-hunting in a host of software, electronics, chip and consumer-product stocks appeared to account for the margin of outperformance.


IBD's enterprise software, fabless semiconductor, database software, security software and other tech groups all jumped more than 2%. (You can see the daily gains or losses of all 197 IBD industry groups by going to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.)


Meanwhile, small-cap indexes outperformed the Nasdaq. The Russell 2000 and the S&P SmallCap 600 both advanced 1.3%. That's not a surprise, given the expansive breadth of winners vs. losers on both main exchanges. Preliminary data showed that gainers beat decliners by a roughly 8-3 margin on the Nasdaq and 3-to-1 on the NYSE.

Stock Market Today: Tuesday's Internals Improve
-----------------------------------------------


On a purely technical standpoint, Tuesday's rally was disappointing in two ways. One, volume fell dramatically vs. the prior session on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Given that IBD [changed the current outlook for stocks on Monday to "market in correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/market-outlook-worsens-on-trade-war-reasons-to-treat-the-drop-more-seriously/)," the first up day in a potential new uptrend does not necessarily have to show a pickup in volume.


But a big increase in turnover in either the Nasdaq or the NYSE is a must when either the Nasdaq composite or the S&P 500 is in position to post a new [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/).


Second, the main indexes did not rise enough to challenge their respective 50-day moving averages.


A healthy market typically shows the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rising on the north side of their 50-day lines and leading the moving averages higher.


Indeed, such was the case a few weeks after the S&P 500 posted a [follow-through on Jan. 4](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). After that day's 3.4% gain in higher NYSE turnover, the large-cap benchmark needed just seven sessions to close back above its 50-day moving average. (You can track the 50-day line via a [daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) at Investors.com or by going to the General Market Indicators link at the bottom of The Big Picture.) Just a few weeks later, the S&P 500's 50-day line flattened and began to rise.


Beyond Trade Tariffs: What To Watch Next
----------------------------------------


While it will take time for the U.S. and China to sort out their trade issues, some Wall Street observers are keen to highlight the possibility that economic growth will decelerate further. Why? They say it takes time for the latest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to work their way through the economy.


UBS equity strategist Francois Trahan notes that Q1 GDP growth of 3.2% in the U.S. is "consistent with the 3%-4% range seen at the end of every tightening cycle back to the 1980s. However, in every single case a slowdown in the economy eventually ensued as interest rates began to impact GDP."


In December, the Fed raised the fed funds rate by a quarter point to a range of 2.25%-2.5%, completing a quartet of rate hikes in 2018. Yet since then, the central U.S. bank has virtually pledged no rate hikes this year. The reasons are sound. Inflation is not hitting target levels. The Fed certainly doesn't want to bump up the cost of money so much that it materially hurts the economy.


For now, the latest data still paints a bullish scenario.


The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index rose in April to 103.5, beating the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 102.4. It also jumped from 101.8 in March. On Friday, the government reported a 0.3% rise in U.S. consumer prices in April, missing views for a 0.4% gain.


Don't Ignore Top Stocks Today
-----------------------------



Will the current correction be one of the lighter garden varieties or one that aims to match the bear-market decline seen in October to December last year?


While [there are signs it could be similar to last year's correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/market-outlook-worsens-on-trade-war-reasons-to-treat-the-drop-more-seriously/), no one knows for sure. It will certainly depend on whether China and U.S. decide to suddenly walk back their aggressive policy on imports. For now, the market will focus on a potential meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump at the G-20 meeting in Japan next month.


**Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) is one example of a leading stock that is showing superior relative strength.


The innovator in data security, up nearly 6% on Tuesday, trades just 3% below its all-time high; the Nasdaq finished the day 5% below its 8176 peak. Zscaler also is within arm's length of retaking a 73.04 [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Fellow [Leaderboard stocks](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) are also demonstrating superior relative strength.

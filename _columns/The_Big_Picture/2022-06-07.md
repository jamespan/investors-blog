  Stock Market In Forgiving Mood As Indexes Reverse Higher; This Could Be The Next Big Sector

The stock market this week is showing exactly why you can never know its intentions. A day after a bearish reversal, indexes made a bullish reversal.




Indexes opened lower after **Target**'s ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) warning sent the retail sector and much of the stock market lower. But within minutes, indexes started to rebound and — after some of erratic trading — closed at session highs.


The Nasdaq, which was down as much as 1.4%, closed 0.9% higher. The S&P 500 reversed up 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%. The S&P and Nasdaq have erased last week's roughly 1% losses and the Dow is close to it.


Small caps outperformed, as the Russell 2000 jumped 1.6%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to also fall in the NYSE. That continues a trend of below-average trading since mid-May. Ideally, Tuesday's constructive action would have come in higher volume, i.e., heavy institutional buying.


Support Level Holds For Indexes
-------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP060722-230x300.jpg)There was something else to cheer besides the positive reversals. The Nasdaq, S&P and Dow dipped below the [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) early Tuesday. But indexes bounced back above those lines. Thus, the support the 21-day lines have provided since the May 26 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) held up.


The retail sector seemed doomed after Target [warned of shrinking profits](https://www.investors.com/news/target-stock-plummets-after-guidance-cut/) because it is overstocked with unwanted merchandise that will force it to offer more shopper discounts. At the same time, it also plans some price hikes due to rising costs.


But Target battled back, erasing a nearly 8% early loss to end 2.3% lower. It was certainly a better outcome than the 24.9% rout Target suffered May 18 on a weaker-than-expected earnings report. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) fell more than 2% early, but closed 0.6% higher.


**J.M. Smucker** ([SJM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SJM)) also showed investors were in a forgiving mood. The food, beverages and pet food company [beat April-quarter expectations](https://www.barrons.com/articles/j-m-smucker-earnings-recall-stock-outlook-51654605178?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D41634994139940988431829159716067847337%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1654608593), but warned that a voluntary recall of Jif peanut butter will impact full-year earnings. Still, the stock rose nearly 6% in heavy trading.


Market sentiment has been shifting for much of this volatile year. While the reasons for the market's direction sometimes are unclear, investors at least have a tradable uptrend to work with right now.


More Stocks Break Out Of Bases
------------------------------


Several stocks broke out of bases Tuesday, mainly in the industrial and energy sectors that have outperformed for much of the year.


**TimkenSteel** ([TMST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMST)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in heavy volume. **Darling Ingredients** ([DAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAR)) jumped past the 85.02 buy point of another cup with handle. **Hess Midstream** ([HESM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HESM)), **Vermillion Energy** ([VET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VET)) and **CNX Resources** ([CNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNX)) also moved above buy points, although some in weak volume.


Since the follow-through, the performance of breakouts has been mixed.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 2.9%, the best gain so far in a five-day win streak. The ETF closed above its 50-day line for the first time since April 4.


**Amphastar Pharmaceuticals** ([AMPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMPH)) and **Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) led the IBD 50 with gains of more than 10%.


Coal Stocks Next Industry Leaders?
----------------------------------


Biotech Amphastar was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) after its bullish action. Arch was one of several stocks that rallied after Jefferies upgraded them.**Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)) and **Peabody Energy** ([BTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BTU)) also rose sharply. Warrior Met is near the 41.34 buy point of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/).


As Monday's Big Picture noted, the [stock market has been moving on certain themes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-trims-gains-but-closes-higher-as-key-level-holds-for-now-this-is-markets-latest-bull-theme/), such as solar power, oil prices and food shortages. Count coal as one of the emerging trends.


The 10 year Treasury yield fell 7 basis points to 2.97%, a day after the benchmark rate poked above 3%. Certainly, easing yields give stock investors some comfort, although the correlation between yields and stock indexes is not so clear. There have been periods — such as a yield pullback from mid-February to early March — when stock indexes went mainly lower.

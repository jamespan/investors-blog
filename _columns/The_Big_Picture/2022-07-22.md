The stock market rally hit some turbulence Friday as weak earnings from **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), **Seagate Technology** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)) and **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) weighed on sentiment.




The Nasdaq composite took the biggest hit and suffered an outside day, falling 1.9%. Volume rose, resulting in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The index still had a solid week, up 3.3%.


Declining stocks beat advancers on the Nasdaq by 5 to 2.

There are still reasons to be optimistic about a tradable rally, but several high-profile [earnings reports next week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/qcom-stock-apple-surge-off-lows-ahead-of-quarterly-earnings-reports/) will likely dictate the action, including results from the remaining four [FAANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/): Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)).


And don't forget about the two-day Federal Reserve meeting where the Fed on Wednesday is widely expected to raise its key lending rate by another 75 basis points to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. Another rate hike is expected in September, although the chances for another 75-point hike have faded as the bond market weighs the possibility of a [soft landing for the U.S. economy](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-recession-us-economy-sp-500/).


Bond buyers were also active Friday, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 14 basis points to 2.77%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The ARK Innovation ETF ([ARKK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARKK)) slumped 5.5% after jumping nearly 11% over the prior three sessions. It's a good proxy to monitor the action in growth stocks along with Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which gave back 2.4%.



FFTY was weighed down by big declines for staffing firms **Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)) and **AMN Healthcare** ([AMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMN)). A potential catalyst for the selling was a revenue miss late Thursday by group peer **Robert Half International** ([RHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHI)).

The S&P 500 fell 0.9% with STX, META and GOOGL among the worst performers. Snap shares dived 39% on [weak Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-earnings-could-rattle-social-media-stocks/). META fell in sympathy, down 7.6%. Alphabet slumped 5.6%


Preliminary data showed lower volume on the NYSE. The S&P 500 notched a weekly gain of 2.5%. Losers beat winners on the NYSE by less than 2 to 1.Â Utility stocks outperformed in the stock market today, helping lift the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) to a gain of 1.4%.


Dow Jones Movers
----------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up relatively well, down just 0.4%, despite an earnings sell-off for **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)). **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) bucked the trend in the Dow Jones, helped by a healthy earnings report that showed a 31% jump in revenue.


After strong gains from the July 14 lows, indexes could use a period of sideways movement to digest recent gains.


Several [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the count Thursday, a positive for the nascent uptrend. Despite solid weekly gains for the indexes, the uptrend remains under pressure. Indexes face resistance around round numbers; 12,000 for the Nasdaq composite, 4000 for the S&P 500 and 32,000 for the Dow Jones.


Stock market bulls want to see declines coming in lower volume for the indexes with limited signs of distribution. The stock market still has a light distribution day count working in its favor.

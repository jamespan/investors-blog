Nasdaq, Small Caps Fall More Than 2% As Stock Market Begins Critical Week
==========================================================================

Bears stomped back into the stock market Monday as apprehension built for the first wave of second-quarter earnings and inflation reports coming out this week.




Indexes closed near session lows after an afternoon rebound faded. The Nasdaq composite closed 2.3% lower, the S&P 500 fell 1.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5%. Small caps also sold off, with the Russell 2000 losing 2.2%.


For the Nasdaq and S&P 500, it was the largest decline since June 28, and snapped a five-day win streak on the Nasdaq.

Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. That means both indexes avoided a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Measures of investor angst rose Monday but weren't excessive. The put-call volume ratio was near 1.0, vs. 0.84 on Friday. The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, rose 6.5% and held in its current trend.


Bond Yield Inversion Worries Stock Market
-----------------------------------------


The bond market gives some cause for concern as the yield curve inverts — a warning sign of recession. The benchmark yield on the 10 year Treasury note declined 11 basis points to 2.99% Monday, while the two-year yield fell 5 basis points to 3.068%.


"Yields for nominal notes and bonds are falling after multiple days of increases," read a report from Tradeweb. "At the same time, bill yields continue to move higher. The result is a further flattening of key Treasury spreads."


The three-month/10-year spread is at its flattest since early January 2021, Tradeweb says. The 1 year/10 year spread is the flattest or most inverted since October 2019. Both spreads are considered economic indicators. And the 2 year/10-year spread is at its most negative level since March 2007, Tradeweb added.


Wednesday before the market opens, the consumer price index for June is due out. Economists' consensus estimate is for an 8.8% jump on an annual basis and 1.1% from the previous month, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). An 8.8% increase would eclipse May's 8.6% surge in prices.


The producer price index comes out Thursday morning, and the Fed's Beige Book is released Wednesday afternoon.


Earnings Reports Also Keep Stock Market On Edge
-----------------------------------------------


If all that wasn't enough to send investors reaching for comfort food, the [first batch of second-quarter earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) are due out this week, with several major banks and big companies announcing results.


**Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) report Thursday. ETF provider **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **State Street** ([SST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SST)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and managed care provider **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) are set to report on Friday.


Banks should offer some insights on the overall economy, and UnitedHealth will be an important measuring stick for a resurging health care sector.


Analysts expect S&P 500 companies to increase earnings 4.3% in the second quarter, which would be the smallest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2020, according to FactSet. To be sure, S&P 500 companies on average tend to beat estimates, and FactSet estimates the index's Q2 EPS growth could be 9% to 12% based on historic patterns.


Still, the energy sector will skew S&P 500 second-quarter results with an outsize estimated increase of 237.6%, far higher than any other sector. Excluding the energy sector, the S&P's bottom line would drop 4.1% rather than grow 4.3%, says FactSet Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters.


Oil prices fell, but closed off session lows. Nymex crude for August delivery lost 0.7% to $104.09 per barrel.


Week Could Be Pivotal
---------------------


The week's calendar is putting investors on edge, and it could also be a pivotal week for the stock market. Surprises on economic data and company outlooks could help revive the market bounce. But disappointment could have the opposite effect.


As has been the case for much of this year, investing in stocks has to be done with one foot on the gas pedal and another on the brake. This year is proving to be a tough lesson in risk management.


Casino stocks sold off Monday after China's Macau region began a [citywide lockdown to combat a surge in Covid-19 cases](https://www.investors.com/news/casino-stocks-oil-prices-tumble-on-china-lockdowns/). The restrictions will continue for at least a week. **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) fell 6.5% and **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) lost more than 6%. **MGM Resorts International** ([MGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGM)), which has less exposure to Macau, fell 3.2%.

Stocks Wrap Up Do-Nothing Week With More Small Gains
=====================================================

Stocks inched up Friday as the indexes wrapped up a week of small moves.

  

The Nasdaq pegged a less than 0.2% gain Friday, while the S&P 500 edged up fractionally. The IBD 50 rose 0.5%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

If an investor spent the past week in the middle of nowhere with no phone or news, he or she returned to essentially the same stock market.

  

The Nasdaq suffered a stalling distribution day Thursday, but the distribution count remains low. The major indexes posted mostly tiny daily gains in quiet volume. And only six top-rated stocks broke out.

  

On Friday, **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)), a China-based online car information provider, broke out of a cup-with-handle base in strong volume. The stock has enjoyed a two-year run, and the latest base is stage eight, according to MarketSmith's pattern recognition technology.

  

Insane conviction is needed to buy an eighth-stage breakout.

  

Also breaking out Friday were gambling equipment maker **Bally Technologies** ([BYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYI)) and **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)). Both are emerging from first-stage patterns.

  

On Thursday, **Radware** ([RDWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDWR)), a small-cap company that provides application delivery and security products to cloud data centers, cleared a 10-month consolidation in huge volume. The stock is somewhat thinly traded.

  

On Wednesday, consulting firm **Maximus** ([MMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMS)) broke out of a 13-month consolidation. The stock is a bit thin also.

  

On Monday, homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) broke out, clearing a double bottom with handle in volume 38% above average. Generally, breakouts in volume less than 40% above average are suspect. However, bigger volume kicked in the next day.

  

D.R. Horton illustrates a chart situation that sometimes raises "gotcha" objections. The stock formed a double bottom, then a handle. How does an investor know to wait for the handle?

  

The objection seems well-taken only if volume is ignored. D.R. Horton showed no volume when it cleared the 22.59 buy point in the double bottom. So the middle peak of the pattern wasn't actionable. A disciplined investor would've waited and found the entry in the handle.

  

The homebuilding group is rated middle of the pack among 197 industry groups. However, since the group's low Oct. 13, the homebuilder group is up 15% vs. 9% for the S&P 500.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 rose 1.6% and the Nasdaq 1.2%. The S&P 500 added 0.3%.

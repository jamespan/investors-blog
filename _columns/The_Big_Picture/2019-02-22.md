U.S. stock indexes stayed on a bullish path Friday, as most of the key indexes extended their weekly win streaks to nine in a row.




The Nasdaq on Friday spurted 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 added 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Small caps gauged in the Russell 2000 advanced 0.9%.


Volume stepped down on the NYSE but grew on the Nasdaq, compared to the previous session.


The Nasdaq, blue chip Dow Jones and small-cap Russell 2000 each upped their weekly win streaks to nine in a row. The large-cap S&P 500 has risen in eight of the past nine weeks.


A Gentlemanly Win Streak
------------------------


In a way, the win streak has been more gentlemanly than rowdy. For instance, the Dow has two up weeks that involved gains of less than 0.2%. Other indexes also dodged a down week or two by a slim margin.

The overall market advance has been useful in another way to investors with a technical bent. During the run, the indexes have retaken their 10-week and 40-week moving averages.


Bulls would like to see the 10-week line cross above the 40-week line, but that might take some time.

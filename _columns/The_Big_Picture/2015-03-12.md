Stocks strode ahead Thursday, but volume was only slightly higher. The Nasdaq chalked up a 0.9% gain while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.3% and 1.5% respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 rose 1.8%. The IBD 50 gained 1.2%.

  

Volume was slightly up on both major exchanges.

  

The S&P 500 and the Dow retook their 50-day moving averages — positive moves, though the tests might not be over.

  

In another encouraging note, the small-cap S&P 600 is now a comfortable 3% above its 50-day line. The S&P 600, which tested but never closed below its 50-day line, has outperformed this week — losing less than the major indexes on the down days and gaining more on the up days.

  

Breakouts, though, continue to be scarce this month.

  

**Mylan** ([MYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYL)) followed through on a breakout that it began Wednesday. The stock, which crossed and then closed under the entry Wednesday, retook the buy point and held it Thursday. Volume was heavy both days.

  

**Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) brightened the retail space for a third day in a row, while **Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)) delivered a 4% pop Thursday. Volume was strong for both.

  

Credit card stocks also were strong performers for the day.

  

The Census Bureau report on retail sales for February was weaker than expected, but there was no negative reaction among retail and credit card stocks.

  

With the uptrend under pressure, this might be a good time to look at some stats:

  

•Which usually follows an uptrend under pressure — a correction or a resumed uptrend?

  

Over the past five years, a correction followed 60% of the times that the market had gone under pressure. When the pressure arrived in the first half of the year, a correction followed 65% of the time.

  

•How deep have recent pullbacks been?

  

The past five pullbacks in the Nasdaq ranged from 3.6% to 10.7%. The average was 7%. So far, the Nasdaq has dropped no more than 3.2%. The Nasdaq hasn't suffered a 20% or greater correction — the minimal definition of a bear market — since May - October 2011.

  

•How long have pullbacks been?

  

The past five pullbacks ran from two to six weeks. The average was 16 sessions. As of Thursday's close, the Nasdaq's light pullback reached eight sessions. So, if the pullback continues and proves to be of average magnitude, we're only at the halfway mark. But if it's like the smallest pullback, it would be almost over.

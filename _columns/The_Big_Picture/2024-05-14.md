Small caps outperformed in the stock market again Tuesday, but the Nasdaq composite also performed well ahead of a key reading on consumer prices Wednesday.




The Russell 2000 small-cap index led the way, up 1.1%. The Nasdaq composite wasn't far behind, rising nearly 0.8% in higher volume. The index marked an all-time closing high and came to within 12 points of its March 21 intraday high of 16,538.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 picked up 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively.


Stock Market Today
------------------


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) hit another all-time high in the Dow Jones index, but it's out of buy range after four up weeks in a row. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), on the other hand, crossed the 200 level and cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 200.94 buy point.


Volume was higher on both main exchanges, partly helped by the re-emergence of meme stocks like **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) and **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)), which jumped 60% and 32%, respectively


GameStop's 50-day average volume is nearly 12 million shares. The stock on Tuesday traded about 200 million shares. AMC, meanwhile, traded more than 600 million shares, much higher than its average daily volume of around 28 million shares.


Breadth was positive on both exchanges, with winners beating losers on the Nasdaq by nearly 2-to-1. The ratio was 2-to-1 positive on the NYSE.


The three major stock indexes are perched near all-time highs ahead of **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) earnings report next week. Results are due Wednesday after the close. HSBC on Monday hiked Nvidia's price target to 1,350, saying that the company's earnings power isn't fully priced into the stock.


Nvidia, which is trading tightly near highs in a 10-week consolidation, is expected to report another strong quarter, with adjusted profit up 474% to $5.22 a share. Revenue is expected to more than triple to $24.5 billion.


Inflation Data
--------------


The stock market shrugged off the latest reading on wholesale prices, released before the open. Producer prices in April rose 0.5% month over month, higher than the 0.3% consensus. Core prices on a year-over-year basis were up 2.4%, slightly above the 2.3% consensus. The stock market seemed to like some downward revisions to March data.


Since some PPI components feed directly into the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index — one of the Fed's preferred inflation gauges — the downward revisions [could mean that inflation wasn't quite as hot](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/ppi-cpi-inflation-april-health-care-core-pce-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/) in the first three months of the year as previously thought.

The 10-year Treasury yield didn't move much on the news. Before the PPI data was released, the yield was trading around 4.48%. Just after the stock market close, it was trading at 4.45%, down 3 basis points.

The new data comes ahead of the latest reading on consumer prices due Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. On a year-over-year basis, core prices are expected to be up 3.6%, down slightly from 3.8% in April.


What To Do Now
--------------


With Tuesday's move near new highs, the Nasdaq climbed more than 5% from its April 30 and May 1 [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). That leaves the composite with a clean sheet, but the S&P 500 still has three distribution days.


IBD's current recommended allocation remains at 40% to 60%. The rally attempt still looks fine, even though 2% gains for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on April 26 and May 3 didn't meet the qualification for follow-through days due to slightly lower volume.


Even so, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) has been increasing exposure in measured fashion. Headed into Tuesday, the Leaderboard model portfolio was just over 60% invested, not including a new short position in **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and some call options for **Toast** ([TOST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOST)) that expire Friday.


But we are paying attention to the fact that some adds to Leaderboard earlier in the month haven't made much progress. **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) looked great when it jumped past a 188.32 entry on May 3. But after three straight declines, FSLR is about 2% below our entry. **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)), which joined on May 6, is also slightly below our entry. We're giving both the benefit of the doubt for now as they test their 21-day lines.


**Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) outperformed in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com) after joining the Leaders list Friday. It's back in a buy zone after reclaiming a 148.43 buy point.


Two More Breakouts
------------------


The stock market continues to serve up some bullish charts. In the aerospace and defense group, Brazil-based **Embraer** ([ERJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERJ)) soared out of a flat base with a buy point of 27.25. The stock moved quickly and is now past the 5% [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)), meanwhile, closed near its session highs and is still in buy range after clearing a double-bottom base with a 55.09 entry.


In the chip-equipment group, **Veeco Instruments** ([VECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VECO)) pulled back close to a 37.70 buy point and is back in the 5% buy zone. Meanwhile, after a test of the 10-day moving average, **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) is back in a buy zone from a 108.04 buy point.


Stock market bulls like the fact that recent breakouts from the likes of **Howmet Aerospace** ([HWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HWM)), **Oscar Health** ([OSCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSCR)), **Constellation Energy** ([CEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEG)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) are holding well. There are plenty more, too.


Among the disappointing breakouts, **Booz Allen Hamilton** ([BAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAH)) is below the 150.59 buy point after four above-average volume price declines in the past six sessions. Keeping losses small in this case makes sense due to abnormal price action post-breakout.

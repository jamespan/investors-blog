  Nasdaq Falls In Higher Volume; This Is The Biggest Trap For Investors Right Now

The year 2024 has been pretty good for stock investors. So Wednesday's decline was not a negative, even though it resulted in a fresh instance of pronounced professional selling on the Nasdaq side of the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).




The Nasdaq's drop of nearly 0.6% in mildly higher turnover vs. Tuesday chalked up a fourth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the premier index of growth stocks over a rolling 25-session time frame.


In terms of distribution, Wednesday's Nasdaq decline proved relatively mild. In fact, the more-relevant distribution days on Feb. 13 (down 1.8%) and Feb. 20 (off 0.9%) showed bigger teeth.


Stock Market Today: A True Mix Of Industry Action
-------------------------------------------------


A less than 0.2% dip by the S&P 500, meanwhile, reflected buying demand in industry groups as diverse as scientific and measuring electronics, alternative energy, electrical power equipment, automakers, mining and construction gear and, well, diversified operations.


All of these IBD industry groups rallied 1% or more to offset big declines by coal, alcohol, tire, department store, computer hardware, managed care and oil refining stocks.


[Go to IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), housed inside the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, to see the final percentage changes for all 197 industry groups covered.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP_4x5_022824-205x300.jpg)NYSE volume, meanwhile, shrank 3% vs. the prior session. Therefore, the distribution count on the S&P 500 held at five, including the Jan. 24 stalling day, the oldest distribution day in the mix.


Declining Nasdaq stocks topped advancers by about a 12-7 ratio. On the NYSE, losers led by about 6-to-5.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down less than 0.1%; the Russell 2000 fell nearly 0.8%.


But compared with the rather sedate action by key stock market indexes on Wednesday, Thursday's move matters a whole lot more.


The stock market will greet perhaps the most important set of data points on the U.S. economy and inflation since a higher-than-expected jump in consumer prices hit Wall Street pretty hard on the chin Feb. 13.


The personal income and spending report for January arrives Thursday before the open. Perhaps more important will be the numbers highlighting personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, that mark current inflation.


[Econoday currently forecasts the PCE price index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) rising 2.4% year over year in January. Good news: If the estimate is accurate, it means inflation is cooling. In December, the PCE rose 2.6%. Core PCE is seen lifting 2.8% on a year-over-year basis in January vs. a 2.9% hike in the prior month.


Should Bond Yields Concern Stock Market Traders?
------------------------------------------------


As the chart of the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield on MarketSmith highlights, the cost of money has been rising as the prospects for a bevy of interest-rate cuts this year have plunged. Specifically, the yield, or return on long-dated government bonds, has jumped from a low of 3.78% on Dec. 27 to a February high of 4.35%, according to Cboe data. ([MarketSmith users](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) can view the chart by punching in zero-TNX.)


Put more bluntly, the fantasy among some stock market players that the Federal Reserve would cut the fed fund rates five or six times has simply imploded.


The CME FedWatch survey of bond trading activity now shows the probability of the U.S. central bank cutting rates from the current level of 5.25%-5.5% at the March 20 monetary policy meeting at 2.5%. That's practically zilch. Meanwhile, CME forecasts only a 19.4% chance of a minimum quarter-point cut at the May 1 confab and a 63.5% chance at the June 12 decision.


Of course, these probabilities can change, and there's a ton of time for stock market participants between now and June.

Avoid This Stock Market Trap
----------------------------


In the meantime, as touched upon during investor Mark Minervini's special guest appearance on [Wednesday's "IBD Live" episode](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), IBD readers may want to be extra careful in buying the latest stock market breakouts. Why? The bigger movers lately do not have first-class fundamentals and other characteristics commonly found among the biggest winners.


Consider **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)).



The lifestyle goods and apparel chain got hammered with a 12.8% drop in massive turnover. Shares almost undercut the 50-day moving average as well. The company's fiscal fourth-quarter results both impressed and disappointed. How so? Earnings growth of 47% was impressive, and it continued a long string of strong year-over-year profit increases.


But Urban's 7% jump in sales to $1.49 billion fell well short of the typical top-line growth rate you'd like to see in the best stocks. In general, seek companies growing sales at least 25% over year-ago levels.


That said, Urban Outfitters has had a pretty good run. After numerous false starts after a breakout from a cup with handle at 36.10 in November and steep drops in price, the stock cleared resistance near 38 and advanced into the [20%-25% profit zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


Taking gains on the way up in most of your stock market winners is an excellent strategy to grow wealth in the long term.


Other Late Movers
-----------------


Urban's Earnings Per Share Rating of 98 is marvelous. The SMR Rating of B is pretty good. But a daily look at the stocks that made the [downside section of Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) in recent days highlights a fairly long list of other companies that have recently tried to break out but have failed to post solid advances.



A monthly chart of URBN shows that the stock came close to surpassing a 2018 peak of 52.50. This also reflects the stock's lack of long-term outperformance.


Recent breakout traps include **CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)) and **DoubleVerify** ([DV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DV)) on Wednesday, as well as **Live Nation** ([LYV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYV)), **Teekay Tankers** ([TNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNK)) and **Intapp** ([INTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTA)) earlier in the month.


CarGurus has sank 8% for the week and dived further below the 10-week moving average, an unpleasant change in character. The online auto marketplace will need more time to possibly break out of a long base-on-base pattern and leave a potential 24.64 buy point in its rearview mirror.


A 68 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) is definitely not top class.


Deep V
------


DoubleVerify posted excellent fourth-quarter results Wednesday. Earnings soared 90% to 19 cents a share. Revenue grew 29% to $172.2 million. That exceeded gains of 22% to 28% in the prior four quarters. The New York firm's earnings estimates are grand. Wall Street sees 87% EPS growth to 77 cents this year and a 28% jump in 2025.



But the problem with DV's base: quite deep and V-shaped.


After a 38% correction from high to low, the platform for digital ads analytics needed to rally 62% off the base's low just to reach the cup's left-side high. While some leaders broke out of bases not long after a Nov. 1 follow-through day, the midcap stock was still trying to hoist itself back above the long-term 200-day moving average.


Watch to see if DoubleVerify can form a tighter pattern and jump back above 40, a stubborn resistance level stretching back to the fourth quarter of 2021.

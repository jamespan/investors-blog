title: Stocks Up In Soft Trade; This Group Wakes To Breakouts

Stock indexes advanced Friday, but the Nasdaq and S&P 500 took opposite tacks vs. their 50-day moving averages.




The Nasdaq popped 1% but couldn't retake its 50-day line. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% which was good enough to settle above its 50-day average. Meanwhile, the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average tacked on 0.4%. The Dow hasn't closed under its 50-day since May 17-18. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1.1% and found support at its 50-day line.


Volume declined on both major exchanges. It would have been much better if Friday's solid price gains had come in higher volume. Also, only a few top stocks climbed in above-average volume. That's another sign that institutional investors held back from buying heavily. The mixed signals are part of the reason the stock market's outlook remains uncertain and investors must proceed with extra caution.


The day's leader was the fiber-optics group. The gains didn't lead to breakouts, though, just some moves off the 50-day line.


Homebuilders also were winners but in a more actionable fashion. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) finally broke out after months of dawdling around a 34.64 buy point. The stock leapt 1.30 to 35.79 in strong volume.

**LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) popped 2.01 to 41.91, clearing a buy trigger at 40.57. Volume was heavy.


**Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) bounced off its 50-day line, but volume was only 19% above average. The stock rose 1.61 to 53.48. Lennar has formed an 8%-deep flat base with a 53.89 buy point. Early entry areas were added at 53.10 and 53.42. But the stock has shown indecisive action since late May.


Considering the market uptrend's pressured condition, individual investors might want to wait and see if Lennar can clear the conventional buy point at 53.89. All other things being equal, buying the clear breakout makes more sense than trying to get the cheapest price.


Other Winners
-------------


Chip stocks had a positive day, but many of the leaders or former leaders are under their 50-day moving average line.


The bank industry groups recently have shown signs of life, but they weren't doing much Friday. The money center group shifted sideways.


In the past four weeks, the top 20 price gainers among IBD's 197 industry groups included some groups that made a strong move one week and then flamed out, such as solar and biotechs.


Groups showing more disciplined action over the four weeks include homebuilders, railroads and bank money centers.


Economic News
-------------


Nonfarm payrolls trounced views, adding 222,000 jobs and topping the highest estimate in the range. The unemployment rate inched up from 4.3% to 4.4%, but that could be a sign of more people moving off the sidelines as the job outlook improves.


The labor force participation rate grew from 62.7% to 62.8%, but still remains near the lowest since Jimmy Carter was president.

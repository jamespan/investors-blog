Stocks staged a relief rally Monday amid progress in Greece's debt situation. But the market isn't out of the woods. The Nasdaq jumped 1.5% after gaining the same amount Friday. It's back above the 5000 level and its 50-day moving average. Strength in biotech and Internet stocks helped the tech-heavy index shine.

  

The S&P 500 rallied 1.1%, closing a hair below its 50-day line and the 2100 mark. Both are potential resistance levels.

  

Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 was up 1.1%.

  

Stocks put in stout gains Monday as Greek and European leaders worked out a preliminary deal. But Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras still needs to get the deal through Parliament by Wednesday. (See story on A1.)

  

Volume rose across the board from Friday's light pace. Breadth was also strong. Winners trumped losers by nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE and more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

  

A number of leading stocks had strong showings. The IBD 50 gained 1.4%. Some top-rated names even staged breakouts.

  

**EBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) broke out of its flat base with a 63.40 entry. 

  

**Jarden** ([JAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAH)) cleared the 54.67 buy point in a flat base. It announced that it would buy tableware maker Waddington Group in a deal worth $1.35 billion.

  

The market now has put in three days of gains, with two back-to-back jumps, but the outlook remains unchanged. The uptrend should still be regarded as being under pressure. This is because we're still largely in a news-driven environment.

  

Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are only about 1% off their highs, but both are still range-bound. Also, the environment remains tough for breakouts. Few stocks have been able to achieve gains of 20% to 25% from buy points. This is reason to stay guarded and not be fully invested.

  

Last week saw a trickle of earnings reports, but this week they will start coming in at a much greater pace. Big quarterly profit growth is one of the biggest driving forces of a winning stock.

  

Earnings season is also a good time to gauge how strong or weak the market is. In a strong market, a stock will tend to rise even if its earnings report is not all perfect. In a weak market, sellers pounce on the slightest miss.

  

**CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) are a few of the big companies reporting Tuesday.

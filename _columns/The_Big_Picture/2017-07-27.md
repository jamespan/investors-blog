title: Stocks Battle Back After Sharp Reversal; Amazon Misses

U.S. stock indexes started on a strong note Thursday morning but then staged an ugly reversal. Still, the indexes battled back and the S&P 500 closed fairly high in the day's range.




Wild swings took the Nasdaq up 0.6%, then down 1.6% before trimming the loss to 0.6%. It closed about the middle of the day's range. The S&P 500 dropped 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average stayed positive, adding 0.4%.


The Dow staved off a loss with strong gains from **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), up 7%; **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), up 3%; **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), up 3%; and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), up 3%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Bears and bulls each made a claim for the market's tone at different times of the session. This has been characteristic of the market for a while now. Moves up or down invite countermoves.

The June 27 and 29 distribution days on the Nasdaq were erased. However, Thursday's losses slapped on a new distribution day on the Nasdaq.


The S&P 500 has not made the sort of gains that would erase a distribution day. The large-cap index avoided distribution Thursday by keeping its loss small.


This leaves the count at two in the Nasdaq and three in the S&P 500.


The major indexes began their sharp sell-off about 12:30 p.m. ET. There was no news clearly associated with the move. A handful of stocks gave early warnings. **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) beat the Street's numbers on revenue and earnings. CEO Ajay Banga reported that Mastercard won a co-branding contract with **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)), taking the business away from **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)).


All this was worth only a rally in the first five minutes of trade. Then Mastercard's 0.9% early gain turned into a 1.5% loss at the close.


Biotechs **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) showed similar action.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, transports did the worse — airlines, trucks, logistics, shippers and airfreight scored losses of about 3% to 5%.


What triggered the trouble?


Some market watchers attributed it to valuations, another way of saying that the run-up from the Nov. 4 low has risen too far. The Nasdaq is up 27%, the S&P 500 19% and the Dow 21% from early November.


A pullback of 10% or more would probably be good for flushing out weak holders, especially if the moves entail new leadership.


The put/call volume ratio closed at 0.91, the highest in almost three weeks. The secondary indicator is useful for pegging short-term market lows, but is still significantly short of the 1.15 reading associated with market lows. The last time the ratio reached that level was 1.17 on Nov. 8 — just as an uptrend began.


After the close **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) reported quarterly results. Amazon fell 2% on an earnings miss. Starbucks fell 2% after revenues missed and earnings came in line. Also, Starbucks announced that it was closing its Teavana stores. Intel rose 3% after topping views on earnings and revenue.


Economic News
-------------


Most of the economic news Thursday was positive. Durable goods orders for June trounced expectations with a 6.5% gain vs. views for 3.5%. The prior reading was revised upward from minus 1.1% to minus 0.1%.


The Chicago Fed's national activity index for June came in at 0.13 vs. views at 0.10.


On the negative side, first-time jobless claims were almost 2% more than expected. And the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing gauge for July ticked down to 10 vs. the previous reading of 11.


The bizarre doings in Washington continued, with Republicans technically in control of both chambers of Congress and the presidency — and still unable to either form or exert their will.


This leaves a pro-business agenda in doubt, and this is getting to be an old and odd story. The market may have already priced in the mess, but Washington's woes did not keep the market from reaching record highs.


Coming Up Friday
----------------


The big item will be second-quarter GDP. The first reading on Q2 GDP will be released before the market's open. The Street's estimates range from 2.2% to 3.2% with a consensus at 2.6%.


The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge for July is expected to roll in at 93.1, the same as the previous reading. The range of estimates goes from 92 to 94.


**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) will both report quarterly results before the market's open Friday.

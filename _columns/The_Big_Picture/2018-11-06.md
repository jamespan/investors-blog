Stocks appeared uncertain at times Tuesday as Wall Street awaited results of the midterm elections and, soon after, the next Fed meeting.




Indexes opened higher but at one point erased most gains. By midafternoon trading, the Nasdaq composite slipped briefly lower. After a burst in the final 90 minutes, indexes closed higher. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%. The S&P 500 also added 0.6% and closed almost at session highs.


The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.7%. The index is already back above its 200-day moving average and aiming for the 50-day line. Small caps rose 0.6% as multiple sectors participated in the gains.

Turnover trended above average for about the past three weeks but not this week, especially on the Nasdaq. Investors appear to be watching for two major events that have market implications.


Midterm Elections And The Long-Term Impact On The Stock Market
--------------------------------------------------------------


With control of Congress at stake in Tuesday's elections, polls suggested that Democrats would take the majority of seats in the House of Representatives, while Republicans would retain control of the Senate. That would leave a mixed leadership in Capitol Hill, which may not be so bad for investors.


Over the past 60 years, [a divided Congress has meant the best stock market performance](https://www.investors.com/news/split-congress-elections-stock-market/). When the same party controls Congress, the results are also positive. But stocks don't perform as well when one party controls Congress and the other the White House, IBD found.


The market will barely have a chance to catch its breath before the next big news item arrives. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest view on interest rates. A hike in interest rates is not expected, but expectations are that another hike will occur in December.


While this week is big for headline watching, the stock market has already put in the foundations for a possible bottom.


Launching Pad?
--------------


Indexes remain above their Oct. 29 lows. As long as they stay above them, the market has a shot at a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) rally confirmation. The Nasdaq and NYSE advance-decline lines are tracking the rebound in the indexes. That indicates rising participation in the rebound.


Some breakouts have occurred and are working: **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)), **Medical Properties Trust** ([MPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPW)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)).


Both Starbucks and Repligen have recently joined [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


Trouble is, there are a lot more breakouts that are faltering among top-rated stocks. For several breakouts Tuesday, results were mixed.



**Zebra Technologies** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)) surged after the bar-code company [beat sales and profit views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zebra-technologies-q3-2018-earnings/), but the stock closed just below its 179.57 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Volume was more than triple its 50-day average, a good sign.


**Livent** ([LTHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTHM)) also sank below its 17.40 buy point. The producer of lithium compounds and [recent IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/ipo-stocks-2018/) rose above the entry after reporting earnings. **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)) soared to a new high after [results beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fabrinet-stock-earnings-guidance/) and the company raised guidance. But a 21% surge was cut by nearly half to 10.6%. Still, Fabrinet held above the 49.07 buy point in big volume.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), also [new to Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), moved modestly above a 290.40 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in flat volume. **CareTrust REIT** ([CTRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRE)), which beat profit expectations late Monday, closed above an 18.69 [correct entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy trading.


Leisure, building, retail, semiconductor and other industry groups made comfortable gains. Transportation and cyclicals such as farm machinery and basic chemicals also led.


The energy sector was one of Tuesday's weakest after the price of U.S. crude slid below $62 a barrel. From the peak of $76.90 on Oct. 4, oil prices tumbled more than 20% at Tuesday's low, which investors would typically consider a bear market. But energy stocks held up better. SPDR Energy ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 0.5%.

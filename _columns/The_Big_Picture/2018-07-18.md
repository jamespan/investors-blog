title: Transport Stocks Soar, Nasdaq Loses Little; These 5 Factors Favor The Market Bulls

On a day in which the major indexes made piecemeal moves, transportation stocks acted as the real outlier Wednesday, and in a bullish way.




One reason behind the sudden rush into transportation issues, especially on a day when crude oil made a positive reversal and rallied 1.3%: Earnings.


BothÂ **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) and **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) reported second-quarter earnings that not only beat estimates but also repeated double-digit increases.


That's the stuff of good fundamentals. Quarterly earnings are the single most important factor in the fundamentals of any growth company. It's still the [C in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


The S&P 500, Russell 2000 and Dow Jones industrial average all rose around 0.2% to 0.3%. The S&P SmallCap 600 crept a bit higher, up 0.4%. But the Dow Jones transportation average captured the day's biggest gains with a nearly 2.3% surge. At 10,702, the sector index rushed back into positive ground for 2018, up 0.8% since Jan. 1.

The Nasdaq composite gave away fractional gains in the opening minutes and fell as much as 0.4% after a little more than an hour of trading. But true to form, the leading index rebounded and nearly muscled its way back to a gain. By day's end, the tech-rich benchmark lost less than 1 point.


Volume grew on the Nasdaq. But given the tiny size of the composite's drop, it does not count as [distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). Thus, the distribution count remains at a relatively elevated level of five on the Nasdaq. The count on the S&P 500 is still low at three.


The EU antitrust body's $5 billion fine on Google for alleged anti-competitive practices with its Android mobile operating system seemed to be expected by Wall Street. In fact, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) shares, down less than 1 point, proved strong enough to hit a new high of 1,221.59, up 3.6% past a 1,178.26 [standard buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). The stock's RS line is still in new high ground, and Alphabet also is above a 1,201.59 handle entry.


The company said it will record the fine in the second quarter.


On Wall Street, transportation stocks have not been the locomotive in the current bull run lately. Think of them more as part of the caboose.


Will This Sector Improve?
-------------------------


A quick scan of the transportation sector immediately tells you why.


The airline group ranked a dismal 190th out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative performance. No wonder none of the 21 companies within the group show a Composite Rating of 90 or higher. **SkyWest** ([SKYW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKYW)) ranks best at 67. The stock has been forming an elongated double-bottom base with a 59.05 buy point.


Airfreight ranked 175th as of Tuesday's close, while railroads placed 132nd, truck transport 121st, and logistics 93rd.


Overall, the market remains in a healthy uptrend. Gains are not as big as seen in 2017, yet there are at least five reasons why an investor should still consider deploying capital in leading stocks.


One, winners edged losers on the Nasdaq by more than 200 issues, another positive. And semiconductor equipment play **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) showed the tech breakout train is still chugging along.


Two, consider the Jerome Powell factor. During a two-day conversation with Congress, the U.S. central bank chief did not rock the boat in terms of changing the current pace in raising the cost of money. But a stronger economy and evidence of higher inflation have certainly tilted the odds back toward two more quarter-point hikes in the back half of this year. That would mean the Fed funds rate would lift to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, still low by historical standards.


What Bond Markets Are Saying
----------------------------


Some market observers continue to fret about the yield curve in U.S. Treasuries.



Tradeweb reports that according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the spread in yield between the 1-year and 10-year benchmark notes "has an excellent track record in predicting recessions." The spread between the two yields is now less than 46 basis points. Tradeweb notes that it's the tightest on a closing basis since the 1-year T-bill returned to the debt market in June 2008.


Still, the overall shape of the curve is not inverted.


Three, bank stocks are not rolling over. Again, decent earnings and sales growth are helping today. Remember what happened 10 years ago? In July 2008, **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) traded more than 66% below its 2007 peak of 57. Then it kept going lower, all the way to 3 a share. Return to today, and Citi currently trades below the 200-day moving average. But at 69.85, the money center bank is just 13% below an 80.70 52-week peak. The stock is trying to carve a [saucer base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/).


The Market Leadership
---------------------


Four, stocks in leading sectors are still looking good. While software stocks aren't breaking out of new bases by the droves lately, they showed mild declines over the past month and held above key technical levels, including the 10-week moving average.



[Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), part of the enterprise software group, is hovering just underneath a 138.75 potential buy point.


IBD's top growth screens, including the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders, also indicate healthy action in the medical, business services, consumer, retail and apparel sectors. These five sectors follow No. 1-ranked software in the sector rankings, as seen in IBD's [Nasdaq + NYSE research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jul-17-2018/).


Breakouts are slowly appearing. They are appearing in groups that are not currently leading the market.


Finally, investor optimism isn't boiling yet. Bullishness among newsletter editors ramped up to 55.5%, according to the latest survey by Investors Intelligence. Bullishness rose for a second straight week, but it's still miles below the 66.7% peak hit in January ahead of an intermediate-level correction across major indexes.


The put-call volume ratio came in 0.85 Wednesday. This means that pessimism among options players is still elevated, but not at extreme levels.

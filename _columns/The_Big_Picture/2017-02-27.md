Small Caps Roar Higher As Market Eyes Trump Speech; Biotechs Outperform
========================================================================

The stock market ended Monday with modest gains, but it was a different story for small caps as the Russell 2000 added 1%.


The strong performance of the Russell also helped the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) where 18 names rose 1% or more by the close. The growth-stock index ended with a gain of 0.7%.


The Nasdaq composite added 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 picked up 0.1% each. Volume on the Nasdaq rose 11.5%. NYSE volume fell around 8%.


![MP022717](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP022717-148x300.png)The market's focus was squarely on President Trump's address to Congress Tuesday night, when more detail is expected on tax cuts, infrastructure spending, health care and border security, among other policy points.


Steel producers, aggregate makers and other infrastructure names rallied after getting beaten up pretty good last week. At that time, IBD's steel producers group dived nearly 5%, while the aggregate gave up close to 3%. Published reports last week said that an infrastructure bill could be delayed until 2018, but Trump quelled those fears Monday.


Steel stocks look a little better than the aggregate makers at this point. **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) bounced off their 50-day moving averages Monday, rising 3% each. On the aggregates side, **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) and **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) outperformed but are still below their 50-day lines.


Biotechs also outperformed. **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, rising 3% to 121.78. It's working on flat base with a conventional entry at 127.10. **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)), meanwhile, added 2% after jumping nearly 8% Friday on news it's being added to the S&P 500.


Growth investors looking for an edge in the current market are having a hard time finding one. Some bullish setups are working, while others are not. When the decision is made to buy a stock, it's always good to do it when the odds are in your favor of making money. The market remains in a confirmed uptrend, but it's still a challenging environment in which to make consistent money with growth stocks.


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) followed through nicely Monday after Friday's breakout, but other names in the IBD 50 like **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY,](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY%2C)) **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) are basically flatlining after breakouts.


That can happen when the case for a market pullback holds water, but the case for continued strength has merit, too.


The bears must like the recent talk of a complacent market and the high level of bullishness, at least among newsletter writers. Such characteristics have been seen ahead of market pullbacks in the past, but those signs don't mean a brutal bear market is right around the corner.


The bulls are encouraged by the fact that indexes continue to trade tightly and hold near highs, a sign of strength and support.


A legitimate question is if there's enough institutional money on the sidelines still waiting to come into the market? As always, price and volume in the indexes will yield clues. Look for up days in higher volume and down days in lower volume.


The Nasdaq's Jan. 20 stalling day fell off the count due to time. But at the same time the Feb. 7 stall day came back into the count. The net result was no change in the number of distribution days.


After the close, shares of **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) jumped 4% in extended trading after reporting another solid quarter of growth. Headed into earnings, the stock was still in buy range from a 1600.10 buy point.


Tuesday will see **Domino's** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) report before the open, with **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) due after the close.

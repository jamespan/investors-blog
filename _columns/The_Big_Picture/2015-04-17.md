============================================================

Fast selling clobbered the major stock indexes Friday, ratcheting up the pressure on the uptrend.

  

The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average each careened 1.5% lower, while the S&P 500 lost 1.1%. The IBD 50 fell 1.3%.

  

Volume rose across the board, fueled in part by options expirations.

  

The Nasdaq gapped down to its 50-day average, where it's now positioned to test the line for support. The S&P 500 crossed under its 50-day line and will apparently conduct its test of the line as resistance.

  

Whether an individual investor is a bull, bear or just plain chicken, this market hasn't provided any camp much consolation.

  

On Friday, doubts grew as the indexes added to an already high distribution-day count. Distribution involves a sizable drop in a index in rising volume. It is the footprint of institutional selling.

  

News outside the U.S. jangled nerves. While China's Shanghai Composite Index gapped up 2% Friday to a 32% gain over the past six weeks, it dropped almost 6% after hours.

  

China announced steps to curb margin trading and declared that it would let funds lend shares to short sellers and expand the list of stocks that can be shorted.

Meanwhile, fears that Greece would default on its debt flamed up. Some market watchers and players, including Warren Buffett, have suggested that a Greek exit from the EU might not be a bad thing.

  

The **Global X FTSE Greece 20** **ETF** ([GREK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GREK)) fell for a fifth straight session, pulling it 60% off its March 2014 high.

  

U.S. economic news was light and quiet. The consumer price index for March matched expectations; consumer sentiment for April topped views; and the leading indicators gauge for March was just under the consensus estimate.

  

In this climate, most IBD-style investors probably aren't buying many stocks. However, there are some attractive-looking charts among leaders. Stocks that keep their composure in a pressured uptrend have a shot at doing well when the pressure is removed.

  

These stocks include **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Harman International** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)).

  

Volume was subdued for all of the above stocks except for Tractor Supply, which rose.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 sagged 1.6%; the Nasdaq, 1.3%; and the S&P 500, 1%.

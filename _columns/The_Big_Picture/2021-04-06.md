Sometimes, the stock market needs to take a day to collect itself after a rapid advance, and Tuesday's session served that purpose.




The Nasdaq and S&P 500 made modest declines — not bad after a few days of solid gains. The Nasdaq fell less than 0.1%, moderating itself after rising 1.5%, 1.8% and 1.7% the previous three sessions.


The S&P 500 lost 0.1% after rising more than 1% the past two days. The index made another record high Tuesday before it ceded gains.


The stock market overcame a midday swoon, but the afternoon rebound faded. The Nasdaq closed near session lows, while the S&P 500 ended in the day's lower half. Volume fell on the Nasdaq from Monday's totals and was barely higher on the NYSE. That's another sign that institutional investors eased off the accelerator.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%. This was a bit more than the other major indexes, but also could be construed as a normal pause. After all, the Dow is up about 9% this year and made new highs Monday.


McDonald's Trying To Break Out
------------------------------


The 30 Dow components were quiet, although **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) is trying to break out of a saucer base with a 232.01 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) dipped below a 367.59 buy point of its March breakout.


Consumer stocks led much of the stock market's gains. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) rose 0.4% to a new high and passed the 173.56 buy point of a base. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) also added 0.4% and is near highs.


Retail was a big reason for the strength in consumer shares. Apparel, home furnishings, restaurants and department stores rose more than 1% as individual groups.


Health care, financials and energy were some of the weakest sectors.


Two medical equipment stocks broke out of bases. **Waters** ([WAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAT)) broke out of a cup base and closed in buy range from the 299.16 buy point. **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) rose above the 120.63 buy point of a flat base, but volume was light.


Stock Market Leadership In Construction
---------------------------------------


While consumer stocks and others benefit from easing restrictions on movement and contact, another sector has emerged as a stock market leader: housing and construction.


IBD's homebuilders industry group moved up to No. 110 out of 197 groups from No. 140 four weeks ago. The wood products industry group ranked No. 127 eight weeks ago; today, it's No. 43. In fact, [some lumber providers are now among the best-performing stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/growth-stocks-unprecedented-forest-product-commodity-pricing-has-these-lumber-stocks-soaring-should-you-invest/) as the price of lumber — a raw material for construction — soars.



Some homebuilders are breaking out of bases and rallying to new highs. Most of the 24 stocks in the group are within 5% of 52-week highs, and many of those already broke out of bases.


**Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)), which is in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), topped a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) buy point Tuesday. It has an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating, its relative strength line is at new highs and the RS Rating is a superb 93.


The bullish activity in the sector is worth watching for opportunities. The fact that the industry is leading despite rising interest rates should be considered a bullish sign.


The IBD 50 outperformed the broad market with a 0.8% increase. A mix of consumer, construction and internet stocks took the index to its fifth consecutive gain.


**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), discussed in [today's IBD 50 Stocks to Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-pinterest-pins-eyes-buy-point-800-percent-rally-coronavirus-lows/), is nearing a 90 buy point. **Wayfair** ([W](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=W)) and boat maker **MarineMax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)) rose more than 4% each.


Semiconductors were lower, a big reason the tech sector was lower Tuesday. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) fell 1.4% just as it was ready to make a new high.

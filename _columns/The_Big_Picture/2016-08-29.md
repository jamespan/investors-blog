Stocks kicked off the week with decent gains Monday in what could be a lackluster week of trading ahead of the long Labor Day weekend, although Friday's jobs report could stir some excitement.


The Dow rose 0.6%, the S&P 500 picked up 0.5% and the Nasdaq composite added 0.3%. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and large-cap biotechs like **Gilead** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Alexion** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) and **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) weighed on the Nasdaq.


![MP082916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP082916.jpg)The Russell 2000 gained 0.6% and the IBD 50 rose 0.7%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Friday's levels. The S&P 500's July 25 distribution day fell off the count because enough time has passed to make it irrelevant.


With the Fed generally feeling good about the health of the U.S. economy, and with generally solid job growth in recent months, it's hard to envision a weak jobs reading. Economists expect August nonfarm payrolls to rise by 175,000 after job growth of 255,000 in July.


It's important to remember that while a market pullback would not be a surprise now, major averages are doing nothing wrong. Tight trading near highs is not a sign of a market that looks ready to pull back. While it's true that the distribution-day count is a bit elevated with four distribution days each for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, the action in leading growth stocks has generally been fine. The vast majority are holding above their 50-day moving averages, a key support level, after recent breakouts. Some other top-rated stocks, though, haven't made much headway.


The number of bullish newsletter writers gives merit to the bear case. Last week, the bulls came in at 56.7%, up from the prior week's reading of 56.2%. Readings above 55% generally signal excessive bullishness and have come ahead of market pullbacks in the past, according to Investors Intelligence. The bull-bear spread increased to 36.5%, up slightly from 36.2%. The spread has been above 30% for five straight weeks. A spread above 40% is a warning sign. A lot of bullishness in the market is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong when it comes to timing the market.


For now, it's OK to nibble at stocks here and there. It doesn't make sense to have aggressive exposure on the long side. Renewed signs of institutional buying would help the bull case, but it's typically a low-volume time for the market so that might be a tall order. Most important, remember that the market uptrend is now under pressure.


Among the day's movers, **Allegheny Technologies** ([ATI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATI))soared 11% to 18.50 as it works on a **[cup-with-handle base](http://education.investors.com/education/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787)** with an 18.77 buy point. The stock was helped by a Deutsche Bank upgrade to buy from hold and a price-target increase to 20 from 15.


**HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) [**cleared a base**](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736314&sourceid=735787) in heavy volume, rising 2.3%. It closed well within buy range of a 31.79 flat-base entry. The pattern could also be interpreted as a big cup-with-handle base. Either way, the buy point remains the same. Earnings are due Sept. 6 after the close.


Monday's session offered up another **[breakout](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787)**, this one from **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)). The leader in the homebuilding group rose nearly 6% in solid volume. It also closed within buy range of a 36.54 buy point.


**Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) was another solid gainer, up 3.5% in heavy volume. It reclaimed its 50-day moving average as it works on a new base. Earnings are due Sept. 6 after the close.

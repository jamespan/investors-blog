title: Small Caps Add A New Wrinkle

Small caps grabbed the lead Friday morning and never let go, as the stock market enjoyed good news on the U.S. economy.




The Nasdaq inched up 0.2%, while the S&P 500 echoed the move. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 led throughout the day, advancing 0.5%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges. The S&P 500 shook off the June 29 [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) because of time. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions.


Economic news set a positive tone as July payrolls came in at 209,000, or about 40% above the consensus view. The jobless rate dropped from 4.4% to 4.3%.


The indexes rushed ahead after the opening bell but the mini-rally lasted only 20 minutes.

Building Sector Rises
---------------------


On Thursday, the building sector grabbed the No. 3 spot among 33 sectors. This is the first time the building sector made the top three this year.


Some building stocks did well.


Insulation provider **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)) broke out with a 10% gain. The base was third stage, which carries more risk than earlier bases.


Decking and fencing maker **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) popped back above a buy point it has been bobbing above and below for a few days.


**LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) advanced 2.4%, bringing the stock to as high as 19% above its 40.57 buy point. IBD research identifies a 20% to 25% gain as a profit-taking zone.


Meanwhile, price-gap moves appeared on the upside and the downside, boosting **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and new-issue **Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)) but tearing down **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), **Trivago** ([TRVG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRVG)) and **Applied Optoelectronics** ([AAOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAOI)).


Greenspan's Warning
-------------------


Former Fed chief Alan Greenspan in a CNBC interview Friday warned of a bond bubble.


Greenspan is famous for his "irrational exuberance" remark of Dec. 5, 1996. But the 1996 remarks weren't prescient. The Nasdaq fell about 8% in the 4-1/2 months after the remark. But then the Nasdaq advanced 46% off the lows.


It took more than three years for the melt-up and meltdown of 1999-2000 to appear.


In fairness to Greenspan, his remarks both then and now weren't meant as predictions.

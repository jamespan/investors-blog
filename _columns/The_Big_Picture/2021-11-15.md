The stock market might already be in its holiday mood after sleepwalking through Monday's session. Indexes made minor moves and closed flat, while leading stocks mainly fell.




The Nasdaq composite had been up as much as 0.4% but closed less than 0.1% lower. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended with minuscule losses. In a positive aspect, indexes climbed off their session lows.


Just as well, volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to also fall on the NYSE.


Small caps lagged. The Russell 2000 fell 0.5%, although the S&P MidCap 400 index rose 0.2%.


Leadership Emanates From This Stock Market Sector

Midcaps have been a sweet spot, with the index up 26.1% for the year. That's better than the Russell 2000's 21.6% gain and better than any of the major indexes. Like the Russell, the midcap index spent months in a consolidation, but the S&P 400 made new highs weeks in October, weeks before the small-cap benchmark did.


Consumer discretionary makes up more than 15% of the S&P 400, and that's been a hot sector among midcaps and the general market as well since mid-October. ([See the chart of the MidCap 400 on MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), updated once a day, by typing in the ticker symbol zero-SPMC.)


IBD 50 Lags Stock Market
------------------------


The IBD 50 underperformed, down 1.4% Monday, although its weakness rested largely on only a couple of stocks.


**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) tumbled 10.6%, piercing its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. The drop [triggered a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). CrowdStrike also fell to 14% below its 289.34 [buy point](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the cybersecurity company with an underweight rating and 247 target price. A Morgan Stanley analyst [sees signs of increased competitive and pricing pressures](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crowdstrike-stock-tumbles-on-underweight-rating-as-analyst-sees-pricing-pressure/) for CrowdStrike.



**Confluent** ([CFLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFLT)) also weighed on the IBD 50. The cloud-based data analytics company plunged more than 11% in heavy trading. The stock's drop wiped away most of the surge that greeted the Nov. 4 earnings report. **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) slid 8.5%.


Most stocks in the IBD 50 are [extended from buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/). In fact, the market today finds relatively few opportunities for immediate buys in growth stocks. Investors can look to follow-on buy areas, such as pullbacks to the 10-week moving average. But there aren't many of those setups, either.


For those with light exposure, investing in the current stock market will take some patience until more patterns emerge.


That doesn't mean investors are necessarily missing out. They should have a good set of holdings from earlier breakouts. After the strong run from October, the stock market appears to be pausing, so parking some money in cash is not a bad idea.


Stock Market Watches Retail Earnings
------------------------------------



While growth stocks were mainly quiet, **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) [broke out of a cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/news/target-stock-q3-2021-walmart-earnings/) in heavy trading. The major retailer is in buy range from the 262.61 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


The breakout could be a positive early sign ahead of earnings reports from Target and [a number of other major retailers](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/big-week-for-retail-as-walmart-home-depot-target-earnings-highlight-calendar/), including **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) Tuesday morning. Those two retail stocks also are near [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


Leadership Emerges From This Industry, Too
------------------------------------------


Also in retail, **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) reports earnings before the open Tuesday. The auto parts chain is extended after clearing resistance around 218 Oct. 18. It's one of several auto parts stocks forming a leadership niche in the market.



**LKQ** ([LKQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LKQ)) and **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) also are extended, while **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) is still in buy range from a 152.85 buy point in a [narrow flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/). According to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), 63% of the group's stocks are at 52-week highs, which speaks to the group's strength.


Copart holds a spot in the [26-member IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/).


Health care and materials were the worst S&P sectors Monday. Utilities climbed 1.3% and energy 0.8%. Oil prices fell below $80 a barrel for the first time since Nov. 5 but bounced to a small gain late Monday.


The Dow would have closed about 80 points lower had it not been for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), which rallied 5.5% and closed above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) for the first time since Aug. 16.


The aerospace company announced a series of deals for freighter aircraft. MarketWatch reported that Icelease will be the launch customer for the 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighters with an order for 11 planes. Logistics company DHL Express placed a firm order for nine more 767-300 BCF jets, and Emirates is buying two 777 Freighters.

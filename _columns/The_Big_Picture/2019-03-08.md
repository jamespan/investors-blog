The Big Picture: Stock Indexes Almost Wipe Out The Day's Losses
================================================================

Stock indexes posted a fifth consecutive loss Friday, going the entire week without a gain for the first time since September.




But the Nasdaq reversed from the losses to turn an early 1.2% dent into a 0.2% scratch. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1%, while S&P 500 fell 0.2% as they also sharply reduced losses.


Volume fell across the board.


A week comprised entirely of losing days is somewhat rare. Since 2017, it has only happened twice. The last time before Friday was the four-day Labor Day week.


Gold Outperforms Stock Indexes
------------------------------


Individual investors looking for a place to hide found their refuge Friday in gold. The iShares Gold Trust ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)) advanced 1.1%.

Two stocks in the group are basing and could be setting up for a breakout. They include **Royal Gold** ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD)), which is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 91.16 buy point; and **Franco Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)), at work on a cup-with-handle base with a 78.02 entry.


The cup with handle is a common bullish pattern.


Software Stock Breaks Out
-------------------------


Some software stocks also avoided serious scrapes. Invesco Dynamic Software ([PSJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSJ)) exchange traded fund rose 0.4%. The ETF is up 17% so far in 2019.


On Friday, **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) gapped up 16%. The small-cap company [cleared a 35.70 buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/upland-software-stock-surges-on-earnings/) after a strong earnings report. Upland's handle is easier to see on the daily chart than on the weekly chart.


The stock market's troubles Friday were blamed on weak China trade data and [a poor reading on U.S. nonfarm payrolls](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/job-growth-disappoints-wage-growth-jumps/). Only 20,000 U.S. jobs were added in February vs. the Street's consensus estimate for 175,000.


In the China report, which was reported before the U.S. jobs data, exports fell 21% and imports 5%.


Yet one strategist said the response to the weak U.S. jobs data was exaggerated.


LPL Financial's chief investment strategist John Lynch noted that "January's payroll gains were revised upward to 311K for the biggest two-month increase in jobs created in 2.5 years."


Lynch added that weather-related weakness affected the February report.


The market's loss-trimming throughout the session appeared to back Lynch's interpretation.


Is China Facing A Recession?
----------------------------


Still, that leaves bulls with the worries related to China. A recession in China could cause problems for the world economy, and the tariff war isn't helping.


Meanwhile, the building sector continued to show strength. U.S. housing starts in January surged 18.6% vs. the December revised number and 5% above the consensus estimate.

Stock Market Builds On Positive Theme, And Here's The Sector Emerging As A New Leader
======================================================================================

A rush of afternoon buying gave the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 new gains, as the session expanded a bullish picture emerging in the past few days.




For the third consecutive session, indexes saved their best work for the final hours. Closes near session highs, especially after indexes open weak, are a hallmark of a positive [stock market trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). With that, and a paucity of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), the stock market is on a positive tack, at least in the short term.


The bullish in-session action may be difficult to perceive when daily price ranges are narrow. Yet, the indexes' momentum is evident as they build on strong moves in the first week of April.


The S&P 500 added 0.3% Tuesday after a dull morning, and finished at a record high. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% and is no longer much of a laggard among indexes, sitting about 1.3% from its all-time high of 14,175.11. Volume eased by just 1% vs. the prior session on the Nasdaq and was slightly higher on the NYSE.


The S&P 500 has pulled away 5.4% above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), so it may be ready for a rest.


Stock Market Gains Uneven
-------------------------


![MP041321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP041321-284x300.jpg)Tuesday's gains certainly were patchy.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%. Small caps also underperformed, as the Russell 2000 fell 0.2% despite paring a 1.1% early afternoon loss.


On net, breadth was negative: Declining stocks led advancers on the NYSE and losers topped winners by nearly 6-5 on the Nasdaq.


[Sector rotation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-sector-rotation/) characterizes the 2021 stock market, and on Tuesday investors had to be in the right sectors to take advantage of the stock market gains.


Technology, consumer discretionary and utilities were the best performing sectors. Financials, consumer staples, industrials, materials and transports fell.


The Nasdaq led the stock market despite weakness in semiconductors. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) was off 0.2%; shares are resting just beneath new highs. Instead, the software sector rose to the occasion, giving the Nasdaq much of its strength.


Software Industry Groups Lead Stock Market
------------------------------------------


IBD's database software, cybersecurity and enterprise software industry groups were all in the top five of [197 IBD groups](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/), up 2% to 8%.



In the cybersecurity group, **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE)) and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) rose above their 50-day moving averages. After plunging 20% in February and early March, the group is 6% from new highs. That's what you call sector rotation â€” and it's positive for software.


In enterprise software, **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) is forming its [first base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/) since a breakout all the way back in June 2020, according to [MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). (Today's [options story](https://www.investors.com/research/options/how-to-trade-options-here-is-less-expensive-way-to-trade-apps-stock/) explains how a September-expiring call option offers a less expensive way to build a long position in Digital Turbine.)


Some of the stocks rising on the reopening of the economy fell Tuesday. Department stores, steelmakers, trucking and airlines ended lower.


The stock market Tuesday had a weak open as it faced some old and some new fears, namely the pandemic and inflation.


J&J Vaccine Temporarily Shelved
-------------------------------


Health officials urged states to temporarily stop giving **Johnson & Johnson**'s ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) Covid-19 vaccine after [several women developed a rare blood clotting disease](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-tumbles-as-fda-halts-covid-vaccine-use-on-blood-clotting-issue/).


J&J shares fell 1.3% after trimming a larger loss. **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)), **Pfizer**'s ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) partner in a rival vaccine, jumped 6.7%, almost to a new high. It was one of the top stocks in the IBD 50. The IBD 50 rose 0.4%.


The latest inflation reading came in higher than expected. The [consumer price index jumped 0.6% in March](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), the highest rate since 2012, and 2.6% year over year as gasoline prices shot up. And pressures appear to be building.


"We expect inflation to trend moderately higher next year, though remain largely in check," Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a report. "Upside risks are mounting, however, with supply-chain disruptions persisting and the NFIB (National Federation of Independent Business) survey ... reporting that the largest percentage of small businesses in more than 12 years raised selling prices in March."


It helped the stock market that government bond yields on the long-duration end of the market fell on the news. The 10-year Treasury note fell 5 basis points to 1.62%. The rapid climb in yields has eased this month.

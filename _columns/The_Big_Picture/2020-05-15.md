Stock Market Muscles Higher; Why Growth And Defensive Stocks Lead Today
========================================================================

A muscular stock market climbs a wall of worry. That old Wall Street adage proved itself yet again Friday.




Friday's stock market filled the early morning sky with dark, cumulonimbus clouds. U.S. retail sales collapsed 16.4% vs. the prior month, thundering down past the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). The U.S. government's Bureau of Industry and Security announced plans "to protect U.S. national security by restricting Huawei's ability to use U.S. technology and software to design and manufacture its semiconductors abroad."


Yet large funds took advantage of the opening weakness to back up the truck.


The Nasdaq composite transformed a 1.4% sell-off into a gain of nearly 0.8%. At 9014, the tech-weighted index also finished above the key psychological level of 9000 for the fourth time in six sessions. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, the small-cap S&P 600 was up 1.3%. Volume rose.


Indeed, strong finishes on Thursday and Friday were not enough to wipe all declines for the week. And some weekly declines were deep. The S&P SmallCap 600 dropped more than 7%, forfeiting gains from the prior two weeks. The S&P 500 lost 2.3% for the week, the Nasdaq nearly 1.2%.

S&P 500 And Stock Market Outlook
--------------------------------


But in the meantime, sideways motion by the S&P 500 would not be a terrible thing. Sideways drift after a huge 34% jump off the March lows may indicate stocks haven't rebounded too fast. Please see a weekly chart of the S&P 500 for additional perspective. The index has finished five straight weeks above its 10-week moving average, a line that is showing signs of flattening.


Meanwhile, strong action by some leaders after their bullish breakaway gaps reaffirms how 2020 is a year for stock pickers.


Just take a gander at strong gains by the likes of **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)). Chegg, a [Leaderboard play](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) that was helping to revolutionize online education well before coronavirus put a padlock on schools' front gates, has catapulted 48% above a 45 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in two weeks.


The amount of shares sold short, relative to Chegg's 50-day average volume, plummeted to zero on April 30 vs. 7.7 days worth of shares on April 15, according to analysis from IBD sister company William O'Neil + Co.

Are Stock Market Bears Lingering?
---------------------------------


"Investors who are speculating in S&P 500 futures are indicating they're overwhelmingly expecting another fall in stocks, as they are short the most contracts since October 2015," Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, wrote in a Friday note to clients.


Another lode of evidence that investors are worried? Gold stocks.


The Latest Sector Rotation
--------------------------


[Topping the IBD stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-may-14-2020/) is the Mining sector. Heading into Friday's trade, gold and silver mining plays ranked 1st out of 33 sectors in terms of mid- and long-term performance. Mining began Friday's session up 11% for the year. Only Telecom (up 5.7%), Software (11.7%) and Auto (8.5%) also post gains since Jan. 1 on a price-weighted basis.

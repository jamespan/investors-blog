U.S. stock indexes reversed late in Friday's session, rubbing out the red to finish modestly up.


The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, while the S&P 500 added 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average eked out a near-flat gain to notch its 11th up day in a row.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The Dow's 11-session streak has developed a light profile. The first five days in the streak involved gains of 0.5% to 0.7%. The past six sessions involved only one such increase.

Stalling days are not counted the same as distribution days are, and their provisional status and formula can bring them on and off the count as circumstances change.


Right now, the stock market is carrying a moderate load of distribution.


During the past week, leaders showed more signs of weakness than the indexes did.


Also, some of the reactions appeared disproportionate to the quarterly results.


For example, biotech **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)) beat the Street's consensus view on earnings by a solid 14%, but missed on revenue. The stock dropped 13% for the week.


Mobile technologies provider **InterDigital** ([IDCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDCC)) topped earnings views by a penny a share and surpassed revenue estimates by 4%. Guidance, though, was weak. The stock plunged 14% for the week.


Extreme reactions can make everybody nervous.


Economic news was mixed Friday. New-home sales in January came in 4% under expectations. But the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge reached 96.3 vs. views for 96.


For the week, the Nasdaq rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 popped 0.7%. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 1%.


**Coming up:** Durable goods orders for January will be reported Monday before the market's open. The previous report missed forecasts, coming in at -0.4% vs. views for +2.6%.


On Tuesday, the second take on Q4 GDP will be reported. The first reading pegged growth at 1.9%. In five of the past seven cases, the second number involved an upward revision.

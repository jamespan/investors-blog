Nasdaq Spearheads Rebound, Volume Rises; IBD 50 Jumps 1.5%

The stock market's rebound showed a bit more oomph Wednesday. While the S&P 500 almost sat out the rally, other indexes showed that investor demand for equities remains decent. The S&P 500's 0.3% rebound wiped away Tuesday's small losses, but barely so. A broad decline in oil and metals stocks weighed on the large-cap gauge.

  

Not for the Nasdaq composite, however, as the leading market index gained almost 0.8% on the back of strong buying in the medical and biotech patch. Other tech, retail and consumer stocks also joined the upside nicely.

  

Volume rose on both main exchanges, another sign that institutional demand picked up.

  

The Nasdaq composite now stands ahead 4.5% for the year; the S&P 500 is up only 1.1%. The IBD 50 is up 12.8% since Jan. 1.

  

The Nasdaq's March 3 decline in higher volume fell off the distribution count due to time. So, as seen in the Market Pulse table, the Nasdaq now has seven distribution days vs. eight for the S&P 500.

  

Strong gains in the Chinese equity markets, more evidence that the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise the cost of money for U.S. banks, and news of more merger activity in the oil and gas, and drug industries gave bulls more reasons to cheer the market on.

  

The market's technicals are looking better.

  

A sound bull market, a confirmed uptrend or even an uptrend under pressure must give investors opportunities to buy stocks that break out or are preparing to do so.

  

IBD's new-high list indicates that opportunities exist.

  

In the past five sessions through Tuesday, on average 85 stocks screened on the Nasdaq made 52-week or all-time highs. When a stock breaks out, it should showcase the strength to hit new highs. An average of just 26 stocks made new lows each day. That's not a lot of companies reaching new high ground. But it's still a good ratio. 

  

Check out the Nasdaq's daily chart on Page B2. There have been three instances in which the Nasdaq briefly undercut the key 50-day moving average, which itself is rising, but closed above the key support line. That's strength.

  

Finally, see the NYSE advance-decline line on the S&P 500 chart, also on B2. It's lurched into new high ground.

  

If the market holds tight for a while, or a key index thrusts into new high ground, the market conditions for buying stocks further improve. Until then, though, it's smart to be selective about new stocks, to not chase leaders, to cut losses short, and to have some cash in the portfolio.

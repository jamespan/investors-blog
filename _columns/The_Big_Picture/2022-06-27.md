The days after a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) are just as important as the follow-through day itself, which means the stock market is now in the proving grounds of a new uptrend.




Like any good test pilot, investors should proceed with caution this week.


Big gains Friday in higher volume resulted in a rally confirmation for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The signal [changed IBD's market outlook to "confirmed uptrend"](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gains-pace-as-these-hopes-rise-casino-stocks-hit-the-jackpot/) and freed investors to increase their exposure.


As always, this needs to be a measured exercise. Investors should make partial buys and add to them if the stocks hold up. It's a good idea to decide ahead of time when you'll sell, such as [setting a 7% maximum loss on any trade](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).

On Monday, the stock market came back from the bullish week with uncertainty. Opening gains vanished quickly, and the major indexes vacillated. The Nasdaq composite gave back 0.7%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.2%.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed with a 2.5% gain. A mix of health care and energy stocks provided most of the index's strength.


Small caps also outpaced the major indexes. The Russell 2000 rose 0.3%.


What To Watch In Stock Market This Week
---------------------------------------


The success of a follow-through often is decided within the first several days that follow it. A [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) this week, for instance, would be a bad sign. If the S&P 500 or Nasdaq undercut Friday's lows, that also would be bad.


It's also an important time to make some initial trades, if the uptrend lasts.


The IBD 50 suddenly has a lot more stocks in bases. Monday's list contained at least 17 stocks in double bottoms, cups with handle, flat bases and other sound chart patterns.



Many of those bases are in medical stocks. **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)), **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)) and **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) are some of those bases. Their [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) are making new highs, too.


**Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)) topped a handle buy point of 98.84 but in light volume.


Medical Stocks Lead Stock Market
--------------------------------


Health care is, in fact, the favored sector right now. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) has reduced June's loss to about 2%, making it the month's best S&P sector ETF.


But a bona fide stock market uptrend should be broader. Health care is less than 15% of the S&P 500.


Another reason for being reluctant investors now is the [quality of the follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/) itself. Russell index rebalancing caused volume to explode in the final minutes of Friday's trading. Without this once-a-year event, market volume might have been lower and we would still have no follow-through in the books.


Growth stocks have taken a severe hit that could take much longer to repair. If we use car wrecks as an illustration, these aren't scratches; the damage is to the front ends and even the frames.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down more than 26% year to date. It's on pace for the worst first half of a year in its history, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Russell 2000 is off 21%, which also makes it a historically bad first six months.


Stock Market Faces Economic Hurdles
-----------------------------------


And don't forget the challenging economic backdrop. Some economists now believe a recession is possible as inflation eats into consumer spending power and raises production costs.


No wonder, multiple follow-throughs in December, January, March and May have failed.


The silver lining is that interest-rate expectations are coming down.


Late last week, fed fund futures implied more than 350 basis points of tightening for 2022, a report from UBS economists said Monday. By the close on Friday, this had fallen to around 330 basis points.


"Markets also started to price in rate cuts from the Fed in the middle of next year," the economists wrote. "A perception that markets may have gone too far in anticipating aggressive Fed rate rises was also reflected in a fall in the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield, from around 3.24% at the start of the week to 3.06% at the end." 


On Monday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed 7 basis points to 3.19%.

The stock market slid Tuesday, quickly deflating whatever bullish sentiment the prior day's rally had built. The Nasdaq skidded 1.3%. The composite lagged the main indexes, despite a good day for one of its top components. **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) jumped 4% as Wall Street applauded its [reorganization plan.](http://news.investors.com/technology/081115-766021-google-stock-rises-after-restructuring-announced.htm?ref=HPLNews) Google's class A and C shares together account for nearly 5% of the Nasdaq's total market value.

  

The S&P 500 slid 1%. The sum of index losses and higher volume totaled up to a new distribution day. That made eight distribution days on the S&P, which leaves little doubt that the market remains under pressure.

  

China surprised the market after it announced a currency devaluation. The lower yuan is aimed at shoring up China's economy but has other ramifications, including lifting the dollar and other major currencies.

  

European bourses sold off as well. The German DAX plunged 2.7%, the Paris CAC 1.9% and London's FTSE 100 1.1%.

  

Utilities and real estate investment trusts were among the best-performing U.S. stocks, reflecting a risk-off sentiment. But airlines, homebuilders and refiners were up about 1% or more, helped in part by lower crude oil.

  

Tuesday's losses left the main indexes testing familiar levels of support. For the S&P 500, the 200-day moving average has become a key signpost. The Nasdaq looks to the 5,000 level, which has had better luck acting as a floor than the 50-day moving average. Those intermediate-term price indicators have not been much of a gauge for the market this summer.

  

The put/call volume ratio rose above 1.0 Tuesday. It signals investor angst and is close to the peak levels at which the market has bottomed many times before.

  

Of more concern right now is the small-cap space.

  

The Russell 2000 fell 0.9% and is now about 6.5% below its prior high. That's considerably weaker than the Nasdaq (off 3%) and the S&P 500 (2%).

  

The Russell 2000 components can be more speculative. But they are also an important indicator of growth, because the fastest-growing companies tend to be in that grouping.

  

Sixteen of the IBD 50 companies fall into the sub-$4.7 billion market capitalization of the Russell 2000 members.

  

The market remains volatile and driven by headlines, still unsure of what direction to take. The big stock moves these days are due to earnings or buyouts.

  

In some ways, it would be easier if the market were in a clear correction. At least then, investors would know to simply get out of stocks and wait for better days.

  

The IBD 50 fell 1.3%, based on preliminary calculations. Its worst performer undoubtedly was **Zebra Technologies** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)), which plunged 24% in huge volume after the company missed Q2 profit expectations.

  

But aside from that implosion, few IBD 50 charts showed any substantial weakness. Most held in their patterns.

  

Medicals make up a big portion of the IBD 50, and some of them were down more than 2%, including **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)), **Alexion** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) and **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)).

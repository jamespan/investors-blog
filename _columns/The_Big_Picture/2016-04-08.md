Bulls Find Little To Cheer Friday; Nasdaq Stuck Under 200-Day Line

Stocks on Friday began with a gain but ended lame, as the Nasdaq again closed under a key support line.


The Nasdaq limped to a gain of less than 0.1% after being up as much as 0.9%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. The IBD 50 added 0.2%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


The Nasdaq closed under its 200-day moving average line, although it is still modestly above the 40-week line as seen on a weekly chart.


Leaders didn't give bulls much to cheer Friday, but a few stocks showed strength.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) gapped up for the second time in four weeks, putting the stock above the 5% buy range. The first gap-up was 17% from a low area in the base. Friday's gap-up was about 3.5% and triggered off recent 52-week highs.


Both gap-ups came in heavy volume.


![MP_040816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP_040816.jpg)Individual investors who bought Ulta Beauty’s March 11 breakout could've gotten in near the ideal buy point. The stock is now 6% above a 188.58 buy point.


Ulta Beauty will join the S&P 500 at the close of trade April 15.


**Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) rose 1.3% in strong volume but closed low in the day's range. The stock is battling to retake its 200-day line.


Other stocks showing promise included **Beacon Roofing** ([BECN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BECN)). The stock broke out, initially clearing a 42.43 buy point in strong volume. However, as the session progressed, volume faded to 27% above average.


Beacon is the second-largest distributor of both residential and non-residential roofing materials in the U.S. and Canada. Since October, the company has made six acquisitions.


On the downside, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) slouched almost 3% in volume 37% above average. Facebook is reportedly seeing decreased personal sharing on its flagship social network, according to Bloomberg News.


However, recent negative action in the stock has only succeeded in adding a handle, which can be constructive. This could provide a new entry at 117.09.


Action in the market Friday could've been much worse, if not for energy stocks. The NYSE Energy Sector Index rose 2.5%, boosting the NYSE composite to a 0.7% gain.


Yet, action might've been better if not for some bad news. About a half-hour after the open, data showed wholesale inventories for February fell more than expected, and the revisions from January were recalibrated downward.


The February drop in inventories was the worst since May 2013 and could signal trouble for the U.S. economy.


However, if that’s the message, the stock market isn't getting it. The Nasdaq is still up 15% from its Feb. 11 intraday low and hasn’t pulled back more than 2%-3% anytime since, despite carrying six distribution days.


For the week, the IBD 50 was nearly flat, down less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq dropped 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow fell 1.2% each. The small-cap S&P 600 slid 2.3%, according to preliminary data.


The first-quarter earnings season will get underway Monday with aluminum producer **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)).


On Tuesday companies reporting include, railroad **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) and construction supplies chain **Fastenal** ([FAST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAST)). On Wednesday, **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and home furnishings chain **Pier 1 Imports** ([PIR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PIR)) will report.


Thursday’s lineup includes **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)).

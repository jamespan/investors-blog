The major indexes cut early losses Thursday to practically negligible size, a sort of victory for a stock market uptrend that remains under pressure.


The Nasdaq composite whittled a morning drop of nearly 0.6% to close less than 0.1% lower for the day. Ditto for the S&P 500 (down 0.1%) and the Russell 2000 (off 0.2%). Sharp losses by **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) offset a rousing 9% gain by **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), sending the Dow Jones industrials down 0.2%.


![mp102016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP102016-217x300.png)Volume climbed on the Nasdaq, but the small size of the index's decline eliminated the chance that Thursday would mark a new day of [distribution](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). Big Board turnover was practically flat.


The Nasdaq continues to fumble in its attempts to rally above the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 remains locked in a tight range. Meanwhile, the breakout mill is still rather quiet.


True, **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) have broken out. That's good.


But the new-high list has lacked vibrancy. Consider Tuesday's session, when the Nasdaq rallied nearly 0.9%: Just 43 Nasdaq stocks made IBD's new-high screen that day vs. 35 new lows. When the market is really strong, expect new highs on both exchanges to climb well past 100 or 200 each.


Some of the leading industry groups are not furnishing good prospects for now. IBD's biotech group is ranked 21st among 197 industry groups, but just seven of its stocks boast a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.


Among these seven, **Biospecifics Technologies** ([BSTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSTC)) perhaps looks the healthiest, but it's superthin (average daily volume of 65,000 shares) and still basing.


**Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) is building a bottoming base; **Supernus Pharmaceuticals** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)), **Amphastar Pharmaceuticals** ([AMPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMPH)) and **China Biologic** ([CBPO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBPO)) are all treading below their 50-day lines.



As if the outcome of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election weren't cloudy enough, Republican nominee Donald Trump further muddied the waters Wednesday night by implying that he would not necessarily concede the election results if Hillary Clinton got more electoral college votes.


Theoretically, such a decision could delay who would assume the Oval Office.


The market seems not too concerned for now. Stocks are still near all-time highs. Few leading stocks, as seen in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), are breaking down. Economic data remain sanguine for the most part.


What investors really should care about is the sort of situation that occurred after the 1980 presidential election. As we saw back then, as well as in the years 1990, 1998 and 2008, the institutions tend to vote with their feet when they see the prospects of a recession on the horizon.


Back in November 1980, Ronald Reagan crushed Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter. At one of the debates, Reagan delivered a hammer blow by squarely asking the broadcast audience whether they were better off now than they were four years earlier. Clearly, most Americans felt they were not.


On Nov. 5, 1980, the market burst higher, a day after the landslide victory. Later that month, the S&P 500 gained more ground and reached as high as 141.96. However, the economy was skating on super-thin ice amid a backdrop of raging inflation (12.5% a year), the creation of a new windfall-profits tax, slumping auto sales, and almost unbelievably high interest rates (the prime rate was at an all-time high of 21.5%).


Then Reagan got shot in an assassination attempt by a deranged John Hinckley Jr. in March 1981. The Gipper survived. But the economy went into a recession that lasted until the third quarter of 1982, after Paul Volcker and the Federal Reserve jacked up the discount rate to kill inflation. The S&P 500 went from 141 in November 1980 to 110 in Sept. 28, 1981 — a 22% decline, meeting the definition of a bear market.


So, don't worry too much about Hillary or The Donald. Keep your eyes and ears wide open for the dreadful footsteps of Mr. Recession. The market will see it first.

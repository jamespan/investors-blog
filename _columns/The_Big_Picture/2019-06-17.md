  Why The Stock Market Is Not Moving Wildly, For Now

The Nasdaq composite led the stock market higher Monday, but a late fade was a reminder that the major indexes continue trying to find a well-defined path.




Strength in biotech and some technology stocks helped the Nasdaq to a 0.6% increase. The composite had been up as much as 0.9%.


**Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) agreed to acquire biotech company **Array BioPharma** ([ARRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRY)), an [$11.4 billion deal](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-company-array-acquired-pfizer-deal-cancer-treatments/) that heated up investor interest in the industry. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) jumped 2.9%, its best day since Jan. 7.


Semiconductor stocks weighed on the Nasdaq, after [Goldman Sachs warned of more weakness](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/software-stocks-most-overvalued-goldman-sachs-says/) in the sector. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.6%.


The Nasdaq, meanwhile, continued meet resistance at its 50-day moving average. The index closed slightly below the line, just like it has for several days. The S&P 500 is holding above its 50-day line (drawn in red in [all IBD daily charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY)), and added 0.1% after it cut about two-thirds of its gain.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also edged up 0.1% and small caps outperformed, as the Russell 2000 climbed almost 0.7%.


Buyers Show Hesitation
----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP061719-300x291.jpg)For the fourth or fifth time in the past six sessions, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed in the lower half of their daily price ranges. That indicates hesitation among buyers, and it's a trend to watch.


Indexes have been mainly horizontal for six days now. On the plus side, the market is holding on to the gains made since the June 3 low, refusing to give up the territory conquered so far.


An optimistic chart reader would see a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) forming in the indexes. Of course, chart patterns don't work on indexes as well as they do with individual stocks.


While the market has flattened since the June 7 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), the flip side is that indexes have yet to mark the first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) of the new cycle. Indexes have stalled a few times, but not enough to register distribution.


The sideways action seems to reflect the market's wait for the Federal Reserve's policy statement on Wednesday. The Fed is not expected to change interest rates this month, but its leanings will be closely scrutinized. Investors expect a quarter-point rate cut at the July meeting and a smaller chance of another cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.


Stock Market Still In A Confirmed Uptrend
-----------------------------------------


The [June 7 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), questionable as it was, is still in force and signaling a market uptrend.


Leading stocks also are stuck in neutral, judging from the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). The index — up 0.5% Monday — climbed less than 0.3% last week. Stock picking is at a premium, with few components showing much vigor in the past several days.


Real estate investment trusts **MGM Growth Properties** ([MGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGP)) and cannabis-related **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) rallied. Both hold a spot [in the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full).


In retail, **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) showed relative strength. On Monday, **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) closed above its 179.60 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy volume. It is the newest growth stock to join [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


It would be nice to see some market internals improve.


The Accumulation/Distribution ratings of the major indexes remain at the lowest-possible E, just like they were before the follow-through.


The Nasdaq advance-decline line is lagging the index, although the NYSE A-D line is near highs. The ratios of new highs to new lows on the Nasdaq and NYSE are mixed.

Stock Market Roars Back To Life Amid New Fed Hopes; These Stocks Shine Brightest
=================================================================================

After a lackluster start Friday, embattled stocks roared back to life amid rising hopes the Federal Reserve will moderate the pace of interest rate hikes.




Blue chip stocks excelled, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising most of the major indexes. It closed up 2.5% as stocks in general enjoyed their best week since June. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) were among the top performers here.


But the other indexes were certainly no slouches. The Nasdaq composite turned in a 2.3% gain for the day and ended the week up 5.2%. It clambered a hair above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It still sits well below the key 50-day moving average, though, a potential resistance area to watch.


The S&P 500 notched a 2.4% gain and rose nearly 4.8% for the week. The index has made a more decisive move above the 21-day line and is just 3.4% below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


The Russell 2000 small-cap index also impressed with a 2.2% advance while the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) vaulted 2.9%.

Volume rose on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq. Breadth was not outstanding, advancers outnumbering decliners about 2-1 on both exchanges.


Nevertheless, gains in price and volume were enough to spark a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.


IBD has also changed its stock market outlook back to "confirmed uptrend," though caveats apply.


Given this is likely a bear market rally, risk remains elevated. It is not the time to aggressively jump back in to stocks with both feet, but to take a measured approach.


Exposure should be limited to a maximum of 20% for most investors. Aggressive investors should stay below 40% exposure until the market begins to prove itself.


While there are some growth stocks forming sound chart patterns, it is a relatively modest number. If this rally does indeed advance, more setups should emerge.

Fed Hopes Spark Stock Market Outlook Change
-------------------------------------------


Stocks rallied on a [Wall Street Journal report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-set-to-raise-rates-by-0-75-point-and-debate-size-of-future-hikes-11666356757?mod=hp_lead_pos2) that said some Federal Reserve officials are worried about overtightening.


Once again, hopes grew that the Federal Open Market Committee, led by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, may take their foot off the gas.


The odds for another 75-basis-point hike at the December meeting fell from a 75% chance Thursday to 50-50 Friday.


This saw an early spike in the 10-year Treasury yield reverse, with the keenly watched metric closing a smidgen lower.


But given this is a headline-driven market, this could rapidly change. A slew of negative economic data could soon douse the latest bout of enthusiasm.


These Stocks Flex Muscles
-------------------------


The daily performance of the industry groups is always one of the most important market gauges for [CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Periodicals, steel producers, metal miners, alcoholic beverage plays and mining machinery stocks were among the strongest areas.


On the downside, hospitals, internet content plays, newspapers and super-regional banks were among the worst groups. The latter group was hampered by the performance of Silicon Valley Bank parent **SVB Financial Group** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)), which plunged 24% after it lowered its 2022 guidance.

The stock market suffered a double whammy Monday: Some leaders took it on the chin, and the main indexes slid.

  

At the close, the Nasdaq dropped 0.8% for its biggest setback since June 12. Losses in leading industry groups such as biotech, software and solar energy weighed on the tech-heavy index. The S&P 500 lost 0.4%.

  

Small caps were hard hit, as the Russell 2000 dropped 1.8%. That's its biggest loss since a 1.9% drop April 25.

  

Losers beat winners by about 4 to 1 on the Nasdaq and more than 2 to 1 on the NYSE.

  

The IBD 50 slumped 1.6%, with 48 of its components falling. **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) and **Emerge Energy Services** ([EMES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMES)) were the only gainers.

  

**GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)) tumbled 8% in more than triple its average volume. The stock triggered a sell signal by wiping out a double-digit gain past a 28.99 buy point. It had rallied as much as 12% past the 28.99 trigger.

  

**KapStone Paper & Packaging** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)) has turned an 8% gain past a 32.02 entry from a cup-with-handle into a 5% loss. **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) reversed lower in heavy trade and closed just below its 156.44 buy point from a cup-with-handle base.

  

**King Digital Entertainment** ([KING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KING)), which is not an IBD 50 stock, rallied early on an analyst upgrade but reversed lower and is now nearly 4% below a 21.49 buy point .

  

All of those stocks had broken out in strong volume, but even that bullish action has been no guarantee of success.

  

Investors have to follow sell rules if a trade doesn't work out. But relatively few leading stocks have triggered sell signals so far.

  

Volume, of course, rose across the board from Thursday's half-session. Even though it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, the higher volume marked a distribution day for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. (The market closed at 1 p.m. ET Thursday and was shut all of Friday.)

  

A distribution day, which involves a loss in volume higher than the prior session, points to institutional selling. A cluster of distribution days in a few weeks can derail a market uptrend. Volume was also higher on the Nasdaq, compared with Wednesday's levels.

  

Still, the distribution count is not yet at levels that warrant concern. Also, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 continue to trend within upward-sloping price channels.

  

Earnings season will start Tuesday with aluminum producer **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) reporting after the close. The season tends to cause jitters in the market.

  

Biotech **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) is expected to deliver a 224% pop in its second-quarter earnings. Triple-digit gains are also seen for online retailer **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) and drugmaker **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)).

Small caps led the stock market Friday as the other indexes remained stuck in a narrow range.




The small-cap S&P 600 rose 0.7% while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were barely above flat. The Nasdaq finished just under flat.


Investors had a few news-related worries on the table but nothing that the bulls couldn't handle.


Hurricane Florence struck the North Carolina coast, but the obvious short-term trades were already reversing.

Before the apparent profit-taking, Generac rose four sessions in a row, clearing a flat base on Monday.


**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) also fell for a third session in a row, pulling 2% off its high. Previously, the home-repair retailer had advanced in six of seven sessions.


Trying to profit from short-term phenomena in the stock market, such as storms, requires extraordinary timing on entries and exits.


IBD-style investors generally prefer earnings-driven gains over news-driven moves.


Earnings can be the rock-solid factor that sustains a stock's run quarter after quarter.


News can seldom do that, unless the news pertains to a long-term change from either inventions or innovations.


On Friday, news commanded attention in the stock market.


Trade Jitters
-------------


Trade concerns created jitters after a report that President Trump told aides Thursday to proceed with $200 billion in tariffs on China. The report was based on anonymous sources and generated more ripples than waves in the stock market.


Meanwhile, the U.S. and Canada ended the week with no apparent progress on tariffs.


In the small-cap camp, stocks showing bullish action included S&P 600 members **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), up 8% in huge volume; prepaid debit card provider **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)), up 5% in strong volume; and drone maker **AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)), up 4% in fast trade.


Of the three, Dave & Buster's was the only move that was earnings driven.


Companies Set To Report
-----------------------


The lineup of companies reporting has shrunk.


In the coming week, firms reporting will include **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) on Monday; **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) and **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) on Wednesday; and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) on Thursday.

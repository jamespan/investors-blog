The major stock indexes fell modestly Thursday, as the stock market continues to search for a bullish signal to confirm a new uptrend.


Blue chips on the Dow 30 edged lower, holding right at the long-term 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 declined 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.6%.




Volume fell on the Nasdaq, but edged higher on the New York Stock Exchange compared with Wednesday's session.


Four of the 11 S&P 500 sectors moved higher, with utilities and energy pacing the winners. The materials and consumer staples sectors were the biggest decliners on the session.


In economic news Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department said that initial jobless claims for the week ended March 15 came in at 223,000. Economists had estimated 225,000 claims, according to Econoday.


Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales in February came in at 4.26 million vs. 4.09 million in January. That was well ahead of estimates for 3.95 million, Econoday figures show.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


Inside the Dow Jones 30, **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) rallied 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively.


On the Dow's downside, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) were among the worst performers Thursday, with losses of 3.6% and 1.6%, respectively. Nike jumped in extended trading after the company's earnings report.


In the Nasdaq 100, **PDD Holdings** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) jumped 4% and 3.3%, respectively, making them the best stocks of the day. Meanwhile, **Microchip** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) tumbled 6.5%.


Four of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended the day lower, as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) exchange traded fund lost 0.2%. Notably, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) is trying to find much-needed support at the 200-day line.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) declined 0.9%, seeing resistance at the 200-day line, a key level to watch. Investor's Business Daily's [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) had a number of big losers on the session, including **ACM Research** ([ACMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACMR)), which sold off 5.9%.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MP032025.jpg)


Despite the recent gains on the major stock indexes, the stock market has yet to trigger a confirmation of a new market uptrend. Due to the missing follow-through day, IBD's recommended exposure level stays at 0%-20%. That's a sure sign that caution continues to be the prudent choice, which is a key element of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/).


Investors should wait for the rally attempt to confirm itself with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), which could happen anytime now, before putting more capital to work.


Instead, [investors should be creating new watchlists](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) with stocks that are holding up best in the current stock market correction. These could be some of the next uptrend's market leaders. However, many previous leaders are in the early stages of forming new bases, so it will take time for new leadership to materialize.


An easy way to identify market leaders is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/)to gauge an individual stock's relative performance. A rising relative strength line shows a stock is outperforming the S&P 500, while a downtrending line shows the reverse.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured two new stocks Thursday, which makes sense given the heavy losses on the major stock indexes in recent weeks. But the Near Pivot list has grown to 16 ideas, a sign that an expanding number are poised for a potential move higher. Look for that number to continue to swell in the coming weeks if the market rally attempt is able to confirm a new uptrend.

Stocks Market Leaders To Watch: Bowhead, LandBridge, Veeva
----------------------------------------------------------


Now is not the time to be raising exposure in growth stocks. Doing so would be fighting the current stock market trend. Instead, keep an eye on market leaders holding up and even rallying above buy points and into new highs, including **Bowhead Specialty** ([BOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOW)), **LandBridge** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).



Insurance leader Bowhead Specialty is breaking out past a 37.81 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a cup base, with a 3.5% rally Thursday, according to [IBD MarketSurge pattern recognition](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). The RS line triggered the blue dot signal, a bullish indicator of market leadership.


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) LandBridge is in the 5% buy zone above a 76.22 buy point in a double bottom. Its RS line hit a new high this week.



Finally, Veeva Systems is tracing a cup with handle that has a 247.62 buy point. Shares are 5% away from their entry.

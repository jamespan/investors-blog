Another day in the new year, another profit-taking session in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).




The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 1.2% on Wednesday, for sure a considerable amount amid the two-month-long confirmed uptrend. The sell-off marked a fourth straight drop. Yet considering how the tech-enriched index rallied 43.4% in 2023, regular IBD readers of this column would likely agree that such a pullback is unsurprising.


Still, the decline in stocks today adds to a prior three-day decline that totaled 2.2%.


The S&P 500 lost 0.8%. Perhaps more importantly, the large-cap index slumped pretty much all session long and finished near the bottom of the day's range. The Dow Jones Industrial Average matched the 500's drop.


Stocks Today: Broad Selling
---------------------------


Small caps got hurt even more.



The S&P SmallCap 600 perhaps does not get as much attention as, say, the Russell 2000. Yet both indexes on Wednesday definitely deserved note. The former streaked 2.7% lower to 1275. In doing so, the S&P 600 ate into a bullish gap-up that took place on Dec. 14, when the index roasted bearish traders with a 2.9% move higher. The Russell 2000, meanwhile, fell almost 2.7% for its fourth straight dip.


Was the action in stocks today an admission among some institutions that, nope, the Federal Reserve isn't quite ready to take a buzz saw to its monolithic gesture of raising interest rates to the highest level in more than two decades?


Volume was mixed. It rose on the NYSE vs. Tuesday's full-day session, but edged lower on the Nasdaq.

Outlook Shift
-------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP010324-240x300.jpg)As a result, the Market Pulse after the action in stocks today reflects a cluster of four [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 — four bouts of unusually strong profit taking by fund managers — in the space of just nine trading sessions.


To be frank, no one individual distribution day has proved overwhelmingly strong.


To be more specific, the S&P 500's distribution days namely are a 1.5% fall on Dec. 20; a 0.3% edge lower on Dec. 29; a 0.6% dip on Tuesday; and Wednesday's 0.8% session of profit-taking. The average drop among these four declines comes to 0.8%. Not severe.


Yet, the bullish investor might have expected a pullback to be much milder than what's been observed since the end of December.


[On a MarketSmith chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), one can plot a [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on both individual stocks and indexes. IBD research has recently found that at least in the short run, leaders in the market are exhibiting positive momentum when they remain on the upper side of their 21-day lines. But on Wednesday, the Nasdaq, S&P 600, Russell 2000 and S&P MidCap 400 all clipped their 21-day lines for the first time since early November.


Granted, the market is still only a few percentage points off its December peaks.


Yet leading stocks are also cutting below the 21-day exponential moving average, and thus giving back a more-than-reasonable chunk of their gains from recent breakouts. A break below the 21-day line serves as a timely place to consider taking at least partial gains.


As a result, the IBD outlook suggests trimming portfolio exposure in stocks today to a range of 60%-80%, down from 80%-100%.


The S&P 500, at 4704, is a 12-point decline away from potentially piercing its own 21-day line.

Expedient Selling?
------------------


Take a gander at **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)).



The travel booking firm dropped 2.5% in accelerating volume for its fourth decline in six sessions. At 144.99, Expedia has dropped 7% below its 2023 high of 155.84.


Notice on a daily chart how the large-cap consumer spending play had really busted loose after breaking out of an unusual-looking base with a 122.59 buy point. Indeed, the base had elements of a double bottom; hence, one could justify a lower entry point at 111.47, or when the stock took out the Sept. 5 high.


Before this current downturn, Expedia rallied a bit more than 25% from the 122.59 entry. Why is this noteworthy? Readers should never ignore a cardinal sell rule to take profits often on the way up in a stock, not when it's threatening a round trip of gains.


Expedia wasn't alone in undercutting its 21-day line. **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)) slashed through its 21-day average on Tuesday. In the MarketSmith Growth 250, **Masco** ([MAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAS)) dropped 3.5% in heavy turnover and cut its 21-day line as well. Its gain from a breakout past a cup with handle at 60.29 is now less than 9%. New IPO **Oddity Tech** ([ODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODD)) hasn't really broken out. But the cosmetics firm, down 7.7%, closed beneath its 21-day exponential line for the first time since early November.


**Vertex** ([VERX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VERX)), the [IBD Stock Of The Day feature](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) on Wednesday, suffered a nasty reversal. An early gain of 6.3% withered into a 3.7% drop in heavy turnover. The member of IBD's Financial Software industry group undercut its 21-day and 50-day lines.


After the move in stocks today, the stock market perhaps is making an adjustment after galloping higher on the likelihood that short-term interest rates will come down in 2024. Question is, by how much?


Following a stronger than expected report on job openings and labor turnover for November, the probability of a quarter-point in the fed funds rate at the upcoming March 20 meeting fell to nearly 71%, down from 90% a week earlier. The fed funds currently sits at a range of 5.25%-5.5%.


Beyond Stocks Today: Fed Minutes Hurt More Than Help?
-----------------------------------------------------


Minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting on interest rates did not seem to make much of a dent in today's action.


Jeffrey Roach, LPL Financial's chief economist, gave the minutes a "slightly hawkish" hue. Why? Members of the interest rate policy committee "see downside risk to the job market, putting more focus on the upcoming labor market," he wrote in an email sent to IBD.


"Many committee members confess the elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook. Markets hate uncertainty, but for now, they seem to be living with that reality," Roach added.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond tested the 4% level before easing to 3.90%, off 3 basis points. It began the year 2023 at 3.88%.


The key jobs report arrives on Friday. The [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) calls for nonfarm payrolls to rise on net by 158,000 jobs in December. That's down from a 199,000-job gain in November. Economists see the jobless rate ticking up to 3.8% from 3.7%. They see average hourly worker earnings up 3.9% year over year, a slight deceleration from 4% growth in the prior month.


Charley Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis, argued that the Fed meeting's minutes "were another attempt by the Fed to walk back some of the overly-dovish interpretation of the December FOMC meeting. The Fed really "let the cat out of the bag" at the last meeting when officials' median forecast for policy rates showed 75 basis points of rate cuts in 2024."


The December release by the Fed of its summary of economic projections indicated that the U.S. central bank felt comfortable with the possibility of taking the fed funds rate down by a total three quarters of a percentage point in 2024 to a range of 4.5%-4.75%. However, CME FedWatch's survey of bond traders has shown expectations of a larger cut in the cost of money.


Oil Up Big, Gold Cools Off
--------------------------



In other markets outside stocks today, gold sank nearly 1.2% to $2,049 an ounce on the Comex. Gold ended 2023 at $2,071.80, up 13.2%.


Crude oil futures jumped nearly 3.9% to $73.12 a barrel, halting a four-session slump.


**Teekay Tankers** ([TNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNK)) drove 4.2% higher to 53.53 in accelerating volume. The tanker company is close to retaking a 54.11 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [six-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/).

The stock market closed mixed Tuesday as it continued its quest for direction.


The Nasdaq fell slightly more than 0.2%. Some chip and Internet stocks performed poorly, weighing down the composite.


The Nasdaq seems to have developed an allergy to 5000. This week marked the third time in less than two months that the index got turned away trying to conquer that milestone.


It's too early to tell if the Nasdaq will keep having problems at that key level. For now at least, it seems to just have stubbed its toe rather than fractured an ankle.


The S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The energy sector led as crude oil continued to rebound, adding nearly 3%. Metal, machinery, heavy construction and other cyclical stocks also climbed, which served the S&P 500 well.


Volume rose, which meant the Nasdaq's loss got marked as a distribution day. That's seven distribution days in the past few weeks for the composite â€” a lot of higher-volume declines for an index to manage. The S&P 500 is not faring much better as it nurses six distribution days of its own.


Coupled with the resistance that the Nasdaq is hitting, there's reason for guarded trading.


But it was hard, if not impossible, to paint Tuesday as a day of massive institutional selling. After all, the S&P rose in higher volume. The Nasdaq's loss was small and the index closed in the upper half of its daily price range. The small-cap Russell 2000 was down just a fraction.


Most leading stocks continue to handle themselves just fine, even though most breakouts in the past few weeks are yielding just a few percentage points in profit. Fast gainers such as **Apogee Enterprises** ([APOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APOG)) are rare. Then again, most of the big gains tend to occur in the initial weeks after a follow-through. The most recent was on Jan. 8.


The IBD 50 fell 0.4%, but most leaders hardly made a wrinkle on their charts.


Volume was lower for most of them, suggesting that institutional investors continue to have at least a lukewarm affection for growth leaders.


A few did encounter serious selling, however.


Small cap **Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)) tumbled 6% in more than double its average volume. The China-based financial management firm held above the 25.70 buy point of an irregular base.


Mid-cap **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) slid 3% in active trading and has fallen as much as 11% below a 78.15 buy point. It broke out March 18.


Some leading industry groups also fared poorly, such as airlines and restaurants.


In fact, the retail sector was generally weak after the March retail sales report showed a 0.9% increase. It was the first increase since November but slightly below economists' forecasts.


This is a key week for earnings reports, and the focal point for Wall Street.


Railroads tumbled Tuesday after**Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)) late Monday gave a weak outlook for its Q1 earnings. But **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) rose after the close as the company beat estimates, raised its dividend and set a new stock buyback program.


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) also jumped in extended trading. The chipmaker met lowered Q1 estimates. Revenue missed expectations but gross profit margins were strong.

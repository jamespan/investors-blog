Stocks Cede Early Gains As Iraq Moves To Front Burner
======================================================

When the market's in a correction, it's typical to see a strong open morph into a weak close. That's exactly what happened Thursday as stocks erased early gains.


The market got off to a decent start, cheered by an unexpected drop in weekly jobless claims. But that data point was offset by news that the U.S. was considering air strikes in Iraq.


The Nasdaq rose 0.6% early but got turned away at its 50-day moving average. It closed 0.5% lower, along with the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed a hair above its 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 gave up 0.6%, making the lowest close since May 23. Nasdaq volume came in slightly higher than Wednesday's total. NYSE volume fell.


Breadth was poor on the Nasdaq as declining stocks outnumbered advancers by nearly 2-to-1. On the NYSE, decliners only had a slight edge over advancers.


The IBD 50 held up relatively well, falling 0.4%.


In economic news, weekly jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week to 289,000. Economists expected a small rise to 305,000. The four-week moving average sank to 293,500, the lowest since 2006 and an indication that the U.S. economy will see continued solid payroll growth. In July, the economy added more than 200,000 jobs for the sixth straight month.


Stability in job growth and recent news that the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 4% in the second quarter is good news, but it also means the Fed could move to raise interest rates sooner than expected. That's a trouble spot for the market, along with unrest in Ukraine and the Middle East.


It doesn't make sense putting new money to work when the market's in a correction. Bulls, however, can take some comfort in the fact that damage to market-leading growth stocks has been limited to this point.


Look at current leaders like **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Polaris Industries** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)), **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), for example, and you wouldn't think there's anything wrong with the market.


But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have clearly lost some steam, trading below their 50-day moving averages amid increasing signs of institutional selling.


Solar stocks rallied as a group Thursday ahead of **SolarCity**'s ([SCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCTY)) earnings report after the close. Shares moved higher in the after-hours session after it reported a smaller-than-expected loss and another quarter of strong sales growth. Despite the fact it's not profitable yet, SolarCity has been a solid performer since its IPO in December 2012 at 8 a share.


The stock cleared the 76.16 buy point of a cup-with-handle base Thursday, but the base was deeper than normal.

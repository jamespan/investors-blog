Stocks Rise Despite Fed's Worries On Trade, Yield Curve
========================================================

U.S. stocks indexes logged strong gains Thursday, despite cautious commentary in the Federal Reserve's minutes that could have sunk the stock market.




The Nasdaq rose 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each added 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 advanced 1.2%.


Volume in the stock market rose sharply on the NYSE and Nasdaq, which was not surprising after Tuesday's half session. Trade was below average on both exchanges Thursday.


Post-holiday trade is usually quiet.

The old news was twofold — tariffs and the yield curve.


U.S. tariffs on China are expected to go into effect at 12:01 Friday, and China has vowed to respond quickly. Those concerns grabbed some attention Thursday.


The stock market has had plenty of time to mull the tariff factor.


President Trump's tariff policy has depressed the stock market since Trump threatened to slap tariffs on washing machines and solar panels Jan. 22. Apart from the protectionists in the Trump administration, there's little conviction that tariffs can lead to anything good.


The Federal Reserve's release of the minutes from its June 12-13 meeting confirmed the tariff worries.


Tariffs Curb Capital Spending
-----------------------------


The Fed said business executives have "expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions."

Some districts reported either a scaling back or delays in capital-spending plans "as a result of uncertainty over trade policy," according to the minutes.


Meanwhile, the stock market also has been struggling with fears surrounding a flattening yield curve.


Minutes from the meeting showed the Fed spent some time discussing the yield curve. Participants said it's important "to continue to monitor the slope of the yield curve, given the historical regularity that an inverted yield curve has indicated an increased risk of recession."


Other members said the yield curve is "only one among many considerations" when shaping Fed policy.


A flattening yield curve means short-term yields aren't much different from long-term yields. Banks generally find it difficult to make money in such situations. If the spread is either too narrow or inverted, there's no incentive to make loans. Without a healthy increase in loans, an economy can sag into recession.


Persistent Pressure On Stock Market
-----------------------------------


Where does all this leave individual investors?


IBD's market outlook of "under pressure" pretty much says it all.


The trade disputes threaten the stock market's outlook. Without a settlement on that, the market can only lurch from headline to headline.


Stocks staged few breakouts Thursday and most were among less than elite stocks.


For investors who have recently taken profits on a stock, there's no compelling reason to put the money immediately into a new stock. The IBD approach to investing is to buy the best stocks at the best times. Current market conditions aren't the best.


Letting the cash position rise a bit might be prudent. If buys are made, they should be entered as test positions.


Economic Reports
----------------


The Institute for Supply Management's services gauge for June rolled in at 59.1%, topping the consensus view for 58.3.


On Friday, the nonfarm payrolls data for June will be released before the stock market's open. The Street's consensus estimate is that roughly 200,000 jobs were added. The jobless rate is expected to remain at 3.8%.

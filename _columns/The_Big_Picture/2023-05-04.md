The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the stock market lower Thursday, as the [banking crisis escalated](https://www.investors.com/news/pacwest-bancorp-explores-options-including-potential-sale-investors-hit-panic-button/) with sell-offs in regional banks **PacWest** ([PACW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PACW)) and **Western Alliance** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)). **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) climbed on strong earnings after the close Thursday. And, up next, the April jobs report is due out ahead of the market open.




Beverly Hills, Calif.-based PacWest, a heavily battered regional bank, is [weighing strategic options](https://www.investors.com/news/pacwest-bancorp-explores-options-including-potential-sale-investors-hit-panic-button/), including a possible sale of the company, Bloomberg reported late Wednesday. PacWest has been working with a financial advisor and mulling a breakup or capital raise, according to sources familiar with the matter. PACW stock crashed 50%.


Meanwhile, Western Alliance dived 38% Thursday after unconfirmed reports from the Financial Times that the Phoenix-based bank hired advisors to explore strategic options, including selling part or all of its business. In a statement following publication, Western Alliance called the Financial Times story "categorically false in all respects."


SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) sold off 5.5% to hit its lowest level since September 2020. Regional banks **First Horizon** ([FHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FHN)) and **Zions Bancorporation** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)) crumbled 33% and 12%, respectively. Dow Jones banking giant **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) fell 1.3%. Intraday, the stock hit the [7%-8% loss-rule trigger](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 141.88 buy point.


Apple earnings topped analyst estimates late Thursday, sparking a 1% gain in extended trade. The company also announced an additional $90 billion share buyback plan and raised its quarterly dividend to 24 cents a share.

Jobs Report, Earnings Movers
----------------------------


Due out Friday morning, Wall Street expects the Labor Department's April jobs report to show nonfarm payroll gains of 178,000, down from March's 236,000. Average hourly earnings in April are expected to rise 0.3% on the month for a year-over-year rate of 4.2%. And April's unemployment rate is expected to rise to 3.6%, per Econoday estimates.


Key earnings movers Thursday included **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)).


[Etsy reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/etsy-earnings-etsy-stock-q12023/) first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped analyst estimates, while the company's revenue outlook came in below expectations. ETSY stock dived 6.5%, ending nearly 40% off its 52-week high.


Wireless-chip leader Qualcomm [met expectations for earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qcom-stock-qualcomm-outlook-misses-views/) as it beat views for sales in its fiscal second quarter. However, it guided below Wall Street's targets for the current period. QCOM stock tumbled 5.5%.


E-commerce firm [Shopify topped analyst estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shop-stock-surges-shopify-earnings-sells-logistics-business/). SHOP stock surged nearly 24%, breaking out past a cup-with-handle's 49.96 buy point.


Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Drops
-----------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 0.9%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dropped 0.5%. All three extended losing streaks to four sessions. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1.2%, hitting its lowest level since March 24.


Volume dropped on the Nasdaq, but rose on the NYSE vs. the prior session. That added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to the S&P 500, taking its count to four. The Nasdaq's count remains at five.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 1.2%, falling further below its 50-day line. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), medical leader **Lantheus** ([LNTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNTH)) bounced back to new highs after finding support at the 10-week line. Shares surged 15% on quarterly earnings.


The stock market volatility is a major reason to remain on the defensive instead of aggressively buying breakout stocks. This means new buys should only be on stocks with top-notch fundamentals and technicals, and profit-taking should be a priority in your winners. IBD's recommended exposure in stocks remains at 20% to 40% of your portfolio.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Agnico, HubSpot
----------------------------------------------



Gold miner Agnico-Eagle Mines is breaking out past a 59.63 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The 5% buy area tops out at 62.61. Meanwhile, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF ([GDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDX)) is an [IBD SwingTrader pick.](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader)


Agnico-Eagle is the world's third-largest gold producer, with mines in Canada, Australia, Finland and Mexico. It also has exploration and development projects in those countries and the U.S.


[In late April](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/gold-stock-worlds-no-3-gold-miner-beats-q1-expectations-nears-nears-key-level/), Agnico beat first-quarter expectations, as a sharp increase in earnings snapped a streak of declining profits. The Canadian miner reported adjusted earnings of 58 cents per share, above the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of 49 cents. That's an 87% increase over last year's 31-cent per share profit.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock HubSpot soared 7.4% Thursday on [strong Q1 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hubs-stock-hubspot-earnings-q12023/). The earnings gap up displays an alternate entry near 455.68, the high of the first 5-minute bar during Thursday's action.

Q1 profit growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, up 122%. Revenue increased 27% to $501.6 million.



Uber At Buy Point
-----------------


Uber finished Thursday just below a 37.68 cup-base buy point following Wednesday's breakout move. Bullishly, Uber stock's relative strength line is at new highs, confirming the stock is a big outperformer during the recent weak stock market action.


On Tuesday, Uber reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates, while bookings came in above expectations. [Uber reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/uber-stock-uber-earnings-q12023/) a loss of 8 cents per share on revenue of $8.8 billion. Sales climbed 29% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, analysts expected Uber to report a loss of 9 cents on revenue of $8.7 billion.

Bill O'Neil, [founder and longtime chair of Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), liked to remark, "You can't kiss all the babies." He was referring to an investor's chances of picking every single leader in a [confirmed market uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-dont-try-to-forecast-the-market-do-this-instead/).




Could there be a corollary tied to the major equity indexes?


Specifically, did Wednesday's action by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite show that one area of the stock market cannot go up all the time?


Perhaps. Nonetheless, the session upheld the bullish nature of a market following the Nasdaq's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) last Thursday.


Netflix Falls: No Impact On The Dow Jones
-----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP102021-204x300.jpg)Third-quarter results are streaming into Wall Street, and a pullback by the likes of [FAANG stock and video streaming giant **Netflix**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-netflix-beats-subscriber-target-guides-higher/) ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), the 11th largest company by market value on the Nasdaq, following its third-quarter report helped dash the Nasdaq's bid to rally a sixth day in a row. Yet a 7-point loss, or less than 0.1%, to 15,121 creates a hardly noticeable blemish on a blistering rally that has seen the index climb as much as 4.9% over the past week.


Stocks in the semiconductor sector fell mildly on the whole; the iShares Semiconductor ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) ETF edged 0.2% lower. That follows a five-day 6.5% run since the Oct. 12 close.


Notice on a [daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily) how the Nasdaq composite, Netflix and chip ETF all sit above their respective [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Netflix is also testing support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) after coasting past resistance around 560 within a long [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).


Meanwhile, the rest of the stock market outperformed.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% and etched an all-time high of 35,669. Yet its gain took a back seat to sterling moves by the Russell 2000 (up 0.6%) and SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) (up 0.8%).


The large-cap S&P 500 floated 0.4% higher and almost reached a fresh closing high. A 5.3% gain by the index since the Sept. 30 close triumphs modestly over a 4.7% advance by the Nasdaq.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.


Three Bullish Traits In The Stock Market
----------------------------------------


Indeed, breadth in the stock market today continues to improve. See this as one of three bullish factors for the nascent uptrend after the September slide.


[MarketSmith users](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) can type in "GMIAA" to see the NYSE advance-decline line. Through Tuesday, this line hit a six-week high. The more stocks rising vs. stocks falling, the better. "GMIAB" shows a weaker A-D line for the Nasdaq. But in a bullish note, it has for now ended a series of lower highs and lower lows since mid-June.


You can also see the NYSE and Nasdaq advance-decline lines within the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite charts on the General Market Indicators link at the bottom of every Big Picture article.


Second bullish factor? The picture of new highs is getting more populated.


Stocks in the finance, bank, retail and energy sectors have dominated IBD's [New Highs list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-19-2021/) lately. You can see this list each day at IBD Data Tables.


Bank Breakout Bonanza
---------------------


Since the Oct. 14 follow-through, IBD counted 193 NYSE-listed stocks making all-time or 52-week highs on Oct. 15, 126 on Monday and 122 on Tuesday. These numbers compare favorably with 20, 34 and 17 new lows, respectively.



Check out **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)). The super-regional bank jumped 3.4% in healthy turnover Wednesday. That hoisted the stock above a [shelf pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-shelf-pattern-and-why-it-is-perfect-pyramiding-tool-in-growth-stocks/) with an 85.45 follow-on entry point. Comerica, which reported a 28% jump in Q3 profit on a 4% top-line increase, has rallied 14% since clearing a 76.11 entry in a base that displays the [elements of a double bottom with a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/).


The third and final bullish factor? Investor optimism is not running amok. Bullishness among newsletter editors polled each week by Investors Intelligence, a contrarian indicator, stands at 43.2%. This means a high majority of pundits think stocks should be in an intermediate correction or a bear market. Meanwhile, the [Cboe Volatility index has plummeted](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility). But low readings have not necessarily pointed to major market tops.


On Sept. 20, the VIX spiked to a four-month high of 28.79. On that day, IBD's current outlook stood at "uptrend under pressure." Eight trading sessions and plenty of distribution days later, the market rolled over and the outlook darkened to "market in correction" on Sept. 30.


Industry Analysis: Most Vulnerable Areas In Retailing
-----------------------------------------------------


In a new report, S&P Global Market Intelligence analyzed the probability of debt default by retailers. It found home furnishings, including furniture and flooring, "was the retail sector with the highest median market signal one-year probability of default at 8.9% as of Oct. 14.


That stands quite above the average default probability of 4.6% among 238 retailing companies surveyed. Apparel retail also stands on the higher end at 6.7%; department stores, specialty stores and leisure products hold a lower-than-average risk at 4.3%, 3.5% and 2.6%, respectively. Home improvement and footwear firms showed the lowest default probability at 1% and 0.3%, respectively.


Of course, default risk has implications for equity investors, not just bondholders.

Target This Stock
-----------------



Placer.ai, a research firm focusing on foot traffic in brick and mortar stores, notes that **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) has been seeing a nice jump in visits in recent weeks following its "Target Deal Days" sales event from Oct. 10-12.


Placer.ai notes this is a big price markdown event that echoes Amazon Prime Day. It helped Target achieve its goal of increasing midweek visits during a typically sluggish month for shopping between the summer back-to-school shopping period and the Christmas holiday spending binge.


"Monday, October 11th appears to be the brand's best day in terms of visits, with foot traffic up 6.9% on that day compared to the previous five Mondays' average," Placer.ai wrote in a report to clients.


Target, a [former winner on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and a bellwether for U.S. consumer spending, has recently rebounded back above its critical 10-week moving average. A [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) is under construction. The company is slated to report fiscal third-quarter results on Nov. 17.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Target's 92 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) is not shabby.

title: Stocks Learn An Old Lesson After Five-Minute Rally

Stocks taught investors an old lesson Friday, one so obvious that it's easily forgotten.




The lesson is this: If a trader needs a reason to understand what happened in the stock market, stick with the most basic explanation. The stock market fell because there were more sellers with money than buyers with money.


It doesn't get any more basic than that.


Technically inclined investors like to get out their fine-point pens and draw the narrowest and most sophisticated distinctions. But we'd all be better off working with crayons.

What was the crayon-drawn picture Friday?


It went like this: In the first five minutes of trade, the indexes rose. Bulls were convinced a profitable day was ahead, and who could blame them?


But that five-minute rally was pretty much all the bulls had in their crayon box.


The Nasdaq dropped 1.5%; the S&P 500, 0.7%; the Dow, 0.3%; and the small-cap S&P 600, 1.7%.


Yet the stock market had plenty of reasons to rise. Second-quarter GDP growth was the best since 2014. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) delivered an astounding earnings beat. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge topped views. None of those factors proved useful.


Look To The Charts
------------------


Where does the investor go from here?


Look to the charts. A company can mislead. An analyst can be deluded. But the chart never lies.


On the daily and weekly charts, the indexes don't look too troubling.


The S&P 500 is holding above its 50-day and 200-day lines. The 2,800 price level appears to have emerged as support. There haven't been any up or down weeks in heavy volume in the past four weeks.


The Nasdaq looks more likely to test its 50-day line. The index is only 1% above its 50-day line. The past four weeks haven't featured heavy weekly volume. The June 21 distribution day expired.


FANG At Half Strength
---------------------


Yet, recent selling in the elite stocks has left the FANGs at half strength. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are 20% and 16% off their highs.


Those are just some of the leaders that have come under intense selling. **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) was the latest with Friday's 20.5% plunge. **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) broke below support at the 10-week line after months of gains. While that doesn't necessarily suggest a market top, it does indicate a sector rotation is unfolding.


Losses Friday were broadly based. Losers led winners by a 13-2 ratio among industry groups.

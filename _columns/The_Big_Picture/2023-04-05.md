  Bad Day For Bulls; Where Have All The Buyers Gone?

Stock market indexes fell for a second day Wednesday, continuing a pullback driven by weak jobs data and rising commodity prices. Big Tech, which led the market in recent weeks, got sold aggressively. The holiday-shortened trading week isn't helping at all, with March nonfarm payrolls scheduled for Friday, when most world markets are closed for the long Easter weekend.




Nasdaq 100 trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) shed 1% but it felt like more, with widely held tech stocks losing ground. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) said it will "eliminate a small number of corporate jobs" on Tuesday, joining the crowd of tech companies dumping unneeded talent.


Wednesday volume was mixed, with the Nasdaq spiking higher while S&P stocks enjoyed relatively benign rotation into defensive instruments. NYSE volume fell.


The 10-year Treasury bond yield continued to fall as recession fears outweighed inflation paranoia, dropping to 3.28%. This marks the lowest low since September.


Longer-term bonds traded higher, lifting the iShares 20+ year bond ETF ([TLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLT)) toward resistance at 110 going back to December. A breakout will mount the 200-day moving average.


Stock Market Rally Struggles Ahead Of Earnings
----------------------------------------------


Hundreds of banks will report quarterly earnings and updated guidance in the next two weeks, starting with Dow Jones component **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) on April 14.Â  Many investors will be reluctant to add to exposure until they are confident this volatile group isn't headed into a "contagion event."


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session marginally higher, outperforming other market groups. Question is, can a small basket of megacaps sustain a stock market rally for long?


The Nasdaq 100 fell more than 1%, weighed down by an exodus from Big Tech plays that ![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MP040523-229x300.jpg)dominated March's bullish price action. The S&P 500 posted limited losses, underpinned by strong performance in defensive instruments, including **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)), and Dow Jones component **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)).


The Russell 2000 small-cap index also performed badly as regional banks slumped, dropping 1%. The S&P Regional Bank ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) slid 1% as well, bouncing along March lows and threatening to break down to 2.5-year lows.


The broad market remains in a "confirmed uptrend," with major indexes trading above their 200-day moving averages after bullish follow-through days. Volume on this week's pullback shows orderly distribution, at least so far, an encouraging sign.


Even so, there are good reasons to exercise strict risk management skills when analyzing potential exposure.


Commodities Heat Up; Gold Holds $2,000; Crude Oil Holds $80
-----------------------------------------------------------


Is this the start of a commodities supercycle?


S&P Global says that commodity supercycles are rare, with the last confirmed event between 2003 and 2007. That was when China embarked on a massive urbanization program, building cities out of farmland. Steel, copper and other metals went crazy during that period but settled back to Mother Earth in the last decade.


Crude oil surged above $80 this week after OPEC cut production output more than expected. Gold took notice and mounted the psychological $2,000 level. However, steel decided not to follow, dropping the VanEck steel ETF ([SLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLX)) nearly 7% in the last three sessions.


Commodity watchers are stuck in an odd position. Will we head into an era of rising natural resources or will it be selective, favoring just a few key markets?


A broad-based commodity bull market will have a horrific impact on inflation, forcing prices higher even though demand may be lower. In turn, that would raise the specter of "stagflation," in which consumers pay higher prices at the same time that economic conditions weaken.


Stock Market Movers & Shakers
-----------------------------



Dow Jones component **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) surged nearly 4.5% after cutting a deal to settle thousands of baby powder claims. The company will send an entire division into bankruptcy and pay $8.9 billion in a court-approved settlement on cancer allegations. The settlement should relieve a ton of overhead pressure for the iconic health care giant.

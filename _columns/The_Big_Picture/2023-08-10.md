The stock market finished sharply off its early highs Thursday, after the major stock indexes jumped on a cooler-than-expected inflation reading. More inflation data is out Friday, with the morning release of the producer price index.




As the stock market continues to pull back from this year's highs, new [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **Expro** ([XPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPRO)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **SLB** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) are flashing buy signals.


Ahead of Thursday's stock market open, [July consumer prices](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-rise-in-july-federal-reserve-policy/) rose 0.2% vs. the prior month. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, climbed 0.2% from June. Both matched Wall Street forecasts.


The overall annual CPI inflation rate increased to 3.2% vs. June's 3%. That year-over-year increase reflected flat prices in July 2022 vs. June 2022. Core CPI inflation came in at 4.7%. Wall Street had forecast an unchanged 4.8%.


U.S. Treasury yields jumped Thursday, with the 10-year yield settling at 4.08%.

Stock Market Earnings: Alibaba, Disney Jump
-------------------------------------------


On Thursday, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) were key earnings movers.


[Alibaba shares](https://www.investors.com/research/alibaba-stock-buy-now/) rallied 4.6%. [Disney stock](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-dow-jones-giant-battles-content-costs-streaming-struggles-with-earnings-due/) jumped 4.9% after the company posted mixed results for fiscal Q3 late Wednesday as it struggles with slowed streaming growth and high content costs.


[Trade Desk](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ttd-stock-trade-desk-earnins-q22023/) broke down below its 50-day line, with a 4.7% slide. Finally, Yeti surged more than 17%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 0.2%. In the Dow 30, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) climbed 1.2%, as the chip giant continues to build a cup with handle with a 37.19 buy point.


The S&P 500 edged higher, while the Nasdaq composite moved up 0.1% Thursday. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.4%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE from the prior session.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.7% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Amphastar Pharmaceuticals** ([AMPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMPH)) plunged 14% on its quarterly earnings. Shares fell through their 50-day line, a sell signal.


With heavy doses of institutional selling — the Nasdaq has seven [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) and the S&P 500 has four — IBD recommends a 60%-80% exposure range. Instead of aggressively buying breakouts in this stock market environment, investors should be focused on protecting gains and looking for leading stocks that are holding up the best.


The July 6 distribution day on the S&P was removed from the count because it is too far back in time to be relevant any longer.


Thursday's fading action — the Nasdaq had been up as much as 1.6% — certainly was bearish even if it did not technically result in a distribution day. The Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 are testing their 50-day moving averages, and how indexes behave at that level will be important to watch.


In another key test for the market, the Dow is holding above its 21-day exponential moving average.

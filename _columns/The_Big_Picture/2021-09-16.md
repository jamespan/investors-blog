The stock market mostly recovered from early losses Thursday, as the Nasdaq reversed higher. Amid an unexpected jump in August retail sales, top retail stocks **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)), **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and **Revolve** ([RVLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVLV)) rose to or near buy zones.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The stock market opened lower Thursday despite stronger-than-expected [U.S. retail sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-surprise-amid-strong-online-sales-amazon-stock-near-buy-point/) in August that rose 0.7%, defying estimates for a 0.8% decline per [Econoday estimates.](https://us.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.asp?fid=523152&cust=us&year=2021&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) After a spring surge fueled by stimulus, retail sales had slowed in part due to consumers spending more on entertainment and travel. Now some of that money may be moving back to retail.


Meanwhile, the latest report on jobless claims showed [initial unemployment claims](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-09-16-2021-11631736316) rise to 332,000 last week from a pandemic low of 312,000 a week earlier, worse than Econoday estimates for 315,000 claims.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP091621-263x300.jpg)The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.1% after erasing early losses of nearly 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 cut losses to 0.2% apiece. The Dow remains below its 50-day moving average. The small-cap Russell 2000 inched lower, closing just above its 50-day line.


Volume dropped sharply on the Nasdaq and appeared to fall slightly on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers.


With a still-modest amount of institutional selling, investors should remain confident in the current uptrend. Look for top stocks passing buy points in big volume with the expectation that the indexes continue to rebound. The stock market's current action is normal, as discussed in [Wednesday's The Big Picture.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rebounds-broadly-as-this-sector-builds-on-its-leadership/)


Top Growth Stocks Outperform
----------------------------


Leading growth stocks showed solid gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 2% and made a new closing high. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) rallied 2.7% Thursday. The top apparel stock found strong support at its 50-day moving average last week and is now at new highs.


Elsewhere among top growth stocks, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is finding support at the 10-week moving average. Late Tuesday, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 11% to 62 cents a share. The tech giant also announced a $60 billion stock buyback program.


**Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) climbed 5.7%, moving out of buy range past a 26.04 buy point in a cup with handle. Lastly, **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) again hit the [20%-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) from a 111.84 entry in a cup with handle.

  Dow Jones, Nasdaq Fall Amid Earnings Volatility; Here's One New Reason Why Stocks May Go Higher

The major indexes dropped mostly in unison Tuesday. But small caps showed an unusually strong spine for a change. Since it's earnings season, IBD readers likely expected volatility on an individual stock-to-stock basis.




They also got a big dose of volatile price swings at the industry-group level as well.


Yet a relatively high level of angst suggests that the market may still have the firepower to add to this year's decent gains.


The Nasdaq composite paced the decline, down 0.7%. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average less than 0.2%. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) sank 1.3%. But the Russell 2000 edged up nearly 0.1%, thanks in part to gains by energy, financial and real estate plays.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP102219-218x300.jpg)Volume climbed on both main exchanges. Thus, these two key benchmarks added yet another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or session of serious profit taking by banks, insurers, hedge funds, mutual funds and corporate investment divisions.


Despite this high count of distribution days, the Nasdaq, at 8104, sits just 2.8% below its all-time peak of 8339. The S&P 500, finishing the day at 2996, still has not shown the strength necessary to crack through the technical ceiling near 3020. Yet large caps are not rolling over and succumbing to the bears.


Always Look Under The Hood
--------------------------


The number of industry groups that rose or fell 1% or more may surprise you.


According to initial data, at least 38 industries — nearly 20% of the 197 industries that IBD tracks every day via [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) — rose 1% or more. And the number of groups that fell 1% or more? Also 38. Looking at the biggest advancers, they included beaten down industries. Think department stores, steel producers, managed care and coal.



The U.S., Canadian and international oil and gas exploration companies rallied 1.8% to 2% as a group, on a price-weighted basis.


We're still in the thick of sector rotation.


Two of the worst performing industry groups include stocks that regular IBD readers would instantly know: credit card payments and processing, and the enterprise software group. The former dropped 2.4% (again, on a preliminary basis), the latter sank 3.5%.


**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), part of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders), fell nearly 5% in heavy trade. The financial services titan is now probing the lows of its current base.


Enterprise Software Stocks Pounded Again
----------------------------------------


Big drops by former stock market leaders **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) (down 7.5% on Tuesday), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) (down 5.3%, falling further below its 50-day line) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) (off 5%, then plunging 16% more after hours on news that [CEO John Donahoe is leaving the firm](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/servicenow-stock-plunges-donahoe-ceo-nike/)) highlight just how tough the third and fourth quarters have been for the business software group.


The first two quarters likely made shareholders in these dynamic, fast-growing companies sing their favorite songs in the shower. Nowadays, these stocks are literally getting hosed by sellers.


Notice that in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-paycom-software-inc-payc.aspx), headed into Tuesday's session, Paycom shows robust ratings, including a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and a 90 for [Relative Strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/). Yet it's critical for all IBD-style investors to buy a stock based on the stock market health, company fundamentals and technicals, and to sell based on technicals.


In the art of the sale of shares, the RS Rating carries little relevance. Keep in mind that this score tracks 12-month performance. Since most growth stocks take an escalator on the way up and an elevator on the way down, stock-chart analysis to determine when to take profits is the proper step.



Oklahoma City-based Paycom issued a [true sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) for short-term investors on Sept. 9. The stock dropped more than 8% and sliced through its rising 50-day moving average. Volume doubled its usual level. Sept. 10 showed no bounce, as the expert in human resources software sank another 7.6%.


Beyond Dow Jones
----------------


Lower-than-forecast results by the likes of Dow Jones Industrial Average components **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), plus the increasing likelihood that embattled British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will have to delay the Brexit process, contributed to the day's losses.


Indeed, the onslaught of negative financial media headlines continues to keep Wall Street on edge. Have you heard the saying from legendary investor Sir John Templeton? He said that bull markets are born of pessimism, rise on skepticism, and die of euphoria.


The psychological market indicators tracked by IBD do not point to euphoria yet.


On Tuesday, the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) showed a reading of 0.82. This means that for every 100 bullish calls traded, 82 bearish puts traded hands. That's well above this year's low of 0.60, set on June 20. The [level of bullishness among newsletter editors](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) surveyed each week by Investors Intelligence is nowhere close to giddy levels, either.

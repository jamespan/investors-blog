Stocks capped an unusually strong month of November with declines among most market indexes on Wednesday. Volume grew.


The session reaffirmed how November could be called the Month of Giant Rotation.


![mp113016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP113016-489x1024.png)On Wednesday, oil-related shares raced higher as a surprising agreement among OPEC nations to reduce their output sent crude oil prices spiking more than 8%. (*Read more about OPEC's decision and its impact on certain industry groups within the energy sector in today's [Sector Leaders column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/opec-vs-history-did-the-future-for-oil-just-grow-brighter/).*) Banks advanced sharply again.


But in the same spirit of rotation, large-cap techs got dinged, giving back more of their fat gains over the past few years.


The heavy selling in techs, from semiconductors to software to e-commerce, sent the Nasdaq composite falling 1% on Wednesday.


The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, lost 1.3%.


The S&P 500 slipped less than 0.3%. Small caps behaved more in step with their large-cap brethren, as the S&P SmallCap 600 eased 0.3% and the Russell 2000 0.4%.


Those declines, however, masked another fun session for bank shareholders.


Lenders big and small continued their bullish ways as the market judged that President-elect Donald Trump's choices to head the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments would be good in countering heavy financial sector regulation imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted during the Obama administration.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) jumped more than 1.5% to 80.17, expanding its gain to 23% since the megacap financial play broke out of a cup with handle at 65.08 on Aug. 5. The nearly 10-week pattern was actually part of a much bigger bottoming-style base pattern.


  **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and many other banks have also done well since breaking out of their own bottoming bases, many of which are best viewed on a weekly chart.
Higher volume on both main exchanges meant that the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 chalked up another distribution day, or session of intense professional selling.


Yet the overall count, as seen in the Market Pulse table, stays the same because the Oct. 25 distribution day on both indexes fell on time. Once a distribution day gets 25 days old, it's viewed as irrelevant.


Technically speaking, not everything in Wednesday's session was dark and dreary.


For starters, the NYSE composite rose nearly 0.2%. Second, while losing stocks certainly exceeded winners on both major exchanges, upside volume topped downside turnover on the Big Board.


Thirdly, the raw new-highs list again showed more than 200 stocks on both the Nasdaq and NYSE. Again, banking, energy and other cyclical industries dominated the new high list. (For a screened version of stocks making 52-week or all-time highs, go to the New High List by clicking on [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) within the "Stock Lists" section of Investors.com.)


While the distribution-day count on the Nasdaq is still unfavorably high, keep in mind that Monday's distribution day is suspect since it compared Monday's full session of trading against Friday's half-day session. And the Nasdaq's stalling day on Tuesday, the first such session in a long while, did not see the heavy turnover one would normally see when the market is about to make a major top.


So despite the messiness of sector rotation and an unusually high distribution count on the Nasdaq, the market heads into December in a confirmed uptrend for now.


While the huge jump in crude oil prices may cause some observers to fret about how it could impact consumer spending, Wednesday's news on the economic front showed positive vibes. The ADP private sector job survey showed a much bigger rise in payrolls in November than expected; personal income in the U.S. rose 0.6% in October, also beating the Econoday forecast for a 0.4% jump. Consumer spending rose 0.3%, missing views for a rather lofty 0.5% increase.


Despite Wednesday's sharp decline, the Nasdaq still gained 2.6% for the month, powered by strong buying in the wake of Trump's Nov. 8 election upset win over Hillary Clinton.


The S&P 500 rose 3.4% for the month. The Dow Jones industrials, virtually flat on Wednesday, rallied 5.4%.


Top groups for the month included steel producers (up more than 37% in November), metal ores and oil drilling (up 23%), heavy construction (up 22%), superregional banks (22%) and life insurance (20%).


Rate-sensitive utility stocks had a terrible November. The Dow Jones utility average, down 3.3% on Wednesday, slumped 6.3% for the month as long-duration Treasury bond yields soared ahead of a widely expected hike in interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets on Dec. 13-14.

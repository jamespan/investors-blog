Indexes ended the last trading day of the year on a down note, but investors might take solace in knowing Friday's relatively minor slip-up was not enough to distract from sensational stock market returns in 2023. Now, as the clock turns to 2024, market watchers will kick off the New Year by poring over new reports from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Labor Department.




The Nasdaq composite ended Friday down 0.6% but got support at the 10-day moving average. The tech-heavy index closed higher for the ninth week in a row and booked a stunning yearly gain of 43.4%. This was its best annual lift since 2003.


The S&P 500 also gave up ground, falling 0.3% in the year's final session. But it also rose for a ninth week in succession and sits above its short-term and [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). The benchmark index turned in an impressive gain of 24.2% for 2023.


Finally, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held up best out of the major indexes on Friday despite a 0.1% dip. Its yearly gain of 13.7% was less impressive though. Insurance giant **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) performed best while **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were among the laggards.


Decliners outnumbered advancers on Friday by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq added a distribution day.


Small caps gave up some of the stout recent gains, with the Russell 2000 ending the session down 1.5%. Growth stocks also got slapped by the bears, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1%.

Fed Minutes, Jobs Report Await
------------------------------


A notable feature of 2023's outperformance was the tremendous returns of stocks in the so-called Magnificent Seven group. Investors undoubtedly would like to see the stock market rally broaden out in the coming year.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP122923.jpg)Key to this will be the Fed cutting interest rates. Investors undoubtedly will scour Fed minutes due in the coming week as they look for clues to future policy direction. The data is set to be released on Wednesday.


Meanwhile, a battery of jobs data also is scheduled for the first week of 2024. Openings are expected to drop when the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports on the job environment Wednesday, while an ADP employment review is expected Thursday.


The main event comes Friday, though, when the Labor Department releases its employment report for December. The jobless rate is seen rising by 0.1% to 3.8%.


It is a quiet week for earnings, though. **Lamb Weston** ([LW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LW)) and **Simply Good Foods** ([SMPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMPL)) are among the noteworthy names delivering quarterly updates.


These Stock Market Areas Shine Brightest
----------------------------------------


Nearly all the [S&P 500 sectors closed lower Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Only the defensive consumer staples and health care areas closed in the green while real estate and consumer discretionary were the worst laggards.


The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a more granular view of how equities performed on the [stock market today.](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)

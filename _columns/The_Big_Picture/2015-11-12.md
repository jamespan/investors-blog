Stocks staggered further south Thursday, as the S&P 500 lost its 200-day line and the major indexes fell for a sixth time in seven sessions. The Nasdaq retreated 1.2%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 led the way down with a 2% dive.

  

The IBD 50 slouched 1.6%.

  

Volume rose on both main exchanges, helped by an easy comparison vs. Veterans Day.

  

New lows outnumbered new highs for the third straight session, a depressing development for the bulls.

  

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 closed under its 200-day moving average line for the first time in three weeks. The Nasdaq remains above its 200-day line but has cut the cushion roughly in half. Both remain above their 50-day lines.

  

Normally the 200-day line is below the 50-day line, and that persistent reversal of roles is one reason to be cautious.

  

The day's action was bad enough to slap both indexes with distribution. The sizable losses in rising volume normally point to institutional selling. However, given the easy volume comparison, the call is less certain.

  

So far, the distribution level is manageable, but it wouldn't take much to change that picture.

  

News lacked clarity Thursday, leaving bears and bulls free to interpret meaning as they wish. Three items drew attention:

  

•First-time jobless claims were 4% higher than expected but unchanged from the previous week.

  

•The price of oil fell about 3% as supplies rose for a seventh consecutive week. While bulls might see this as a potential driver for consumer spending, the bears regard it as a sign of weak demand.

  

•Richmond Federal Reserve president Jeffrey Lacker, a voting member of the Fed, said in a Wednesday night interview that he couldn't predict what his colleagues will do but said data have "strengthened the case for raising rates."

  

Lacker has been pushing for higher rates for six months.

  

Several other Fed officials also hinted at a rate hike.

  

Another factor that could affect the market in weeks to come is share buybacks. Company repurchases have been a driver of the bull market. And according to a Goldman Sachs study, November is historically the No. 1 month for share buybacks, while December is tied for third place.

  

So the so-called Santa Claus rally might still be coming.

  

On Thursday, though, there were more givebacks than gifts apparent in the market. Two stocks — **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)) — broke out in strong volume but then reversed to close under their buy points.

  Stocks Bounce, But These Factors Weigh On Hopes For A Bottom

Stocks bounced Monday, giving the market some hope that its sell-off might be at least pausing, if not ending.




The S&P 500 looked bearish at midday, when the index fell below its 50-day moving average. But a wave of afternoon buying sent the S&P 500 off its lows and into the highs of the day. The index closed nearly unchanged and back above its 50-day line.


With the index so far passing a test of support, the market has something to build on. But consider that merely a good first step. The market still has a lot to show before it can snap out of its funk. Indexes remain under pressure, making it hard for investors to make gains.

On Monday, the Nasdaq fell 0.7% in lower volume. It is now 2% below its 50-day line. A decline of nearly 6% since the Aug. 30 peak is the largest since a 10.9% correction in February and the start of March.


Technology stocks — the core of the Nasdaq — have been [particularly hard hit](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/software-stocks-salesforce-servicenow/) and were among Monday's weakest. Nine of the 10 worst industry groups were computer groups, and many other tech groups were in the bottom 40 of 197 groups.


The tech sector's lag is one reason to hold off on getting reinvested in stocks. It's been a constant source of leadership.


Small caps are another asset class that should perform better if the broad market is to sustain a rebound. But the Russell 2000 bounced from its 200-day moving average, an encouraging move. The Russell lost 0.2% after paring losses and now will try to climb from this long-term support level.


Another reason for skepticism is in the market's mood. The put-call volume ratio has risen lately but not to the heights that mark market lows. That suggests the market is not done selling off.

The Cboe Market Volatility index, however, did trigger a bottoming signal. The VIX, as it's better known, spiked more than 20% above its 10-day moving average. That signal has marked a number of market lows, as [IBD's Psychological Market Indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) show.


Perhaps no other indicator is as important as leading stocks, and that's another area of concern. The Big Picture [cautioned about a week ago](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/leading-stocks-small-caps-slide-reasons-investors-cautious/) that a sudden slide in many leading stocks was a caution sign. Today, the IBD 50 remains hobbled. It tumbled 1.9% and didn't pare losses like the indexes did.


Nearly half the 50 stocks fell 2% or more, including three that slid 5% or more: **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)), **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)). No surprise, most of the weakest leaders were software stocks.


Market Overall Still Favorable
------------------------------


The market's backdrop remains favorable, with the U.S. economy still humming, unemployment at a 49-year low, consumer confidence high and corporate profits still reaping the benefits of a big tax cut.


The downside is that the Federal Reserve seems set on raising interest rates to keep the expansion from overheating. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week sounded hawkish on the economy, which fueled expectations that 2019 may bring even more rate hikes.


The bond market was closed for Columbus Day on Monday, but rising yields remained a talking point on Wall Street. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note last week [surged to a seven-year high](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/5-reasons-treasury-yields-rising-stocks-sliding/). It wasn't just the elevation of the yield, but the rate of climb that rattled investors. The yield surged about 17 basis points in three days last week, accelerating an upward trend from mid-August.


Some industry groups that would normally fall during rising interest rates led the market, including utilities, homebuilders and real estate investment trusts. Utilities and REITs compete with bonds for yield investors. But they are also defensive groups, just like the other leading sectors Monday. The SPDR Consumer Staples ETF ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) climbed 1.4%; the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF ([SDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SDY)) added 0.7%.


Banking and financials also were higher, apparently rising on a decompression of the yield curve.

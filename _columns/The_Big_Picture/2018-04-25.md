The Nasdaq recovered nicely Wednesday after dropping 1.1% intraday. But growth investors weren't a happy bunch as several top-rated growth names and China stocks faced more selling pressure.




The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 ended modestly higher, up about 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite eased less than 0.1%. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) underperformed, falling 0.8%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Tuesday's levels.


The Dow Jones Transportation Average, helped by strength in railroad stocks, outperformed with a 1% gain.


The S&P 500 came to within 4 points of its 200-day moving average, currently around 2,609. Investors were fearful early, but at its worst level Wednesday, the put-call volume ratio was at 0.99. That's where it closed Tuesday. It ended at 0.94 Wednesday. Extreme readings of 1.15 or higher, where investors are buying a lot more bearish puts than calls, have been seen at market bottoms in the past.

More Weakness Ahead For Nasdaq?
-------------------------------


The Nasdaq's April 10 [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) day had legs for a while, but the April 10 intraday low was taken out Tuesday. According to IBD research, that raises the odds that the Nasdaq's intraday low of 6805 (the low of the most recent rally attempt) will eventually get taken out.


When the lows of prior follow-through days have been undercut in the past, the low of the rally attempt was undercut 39% of the time in five days, 49% of the time in 10 days, and 68% of the time in 21 days.


Technology stocks could get a lift Thursday after **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) reported strong earnings after the close. Shares of Facebook were up more than 6% in after-hours trading. PowerShares QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, jumped 0.9% in late trading.


China Stocks Pressured
----------------------


[China stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) lagged badly as **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)), **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) ended with losses ranging from 3% to nearly 5%.


So where was the strength in the market? Inside the Dow, leadership came from **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). Shares jumped 4%, helped by a strong earnings report and bullish outlook. Boeing's rebound came after a wild session Tuesday that saw the stock dive below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume.


Inside the Nasdaq 100, **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) was a top gainer, also on solid earnings. It's still below the 50-day line, however, after getting resistance there last week. Strong earnings from Texas Instruments wasn't much help to the chip sector as a whole. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index edged lower by 0.1% as it battles for support at the 200-day moving average.


IBD 50 component **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) showed impressive price action, reversing higher above the 50-day line. Shares rose 0.8% to 293.20 in heavy volume. Earnings are due Monday after the close. The medical-sector leader recently flashed a sell signal when it fell more than 8% from a 304.38 buy point. Fundamentals are still outstanding at Abiomed, but its latest breakout was from a late-stage base.


Integra LifeSciences Breaks Out
-------------------------------


Wednesday's session delivered one breakout. **Integra Lifesciences** ([IART](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IART)) vaulted nearly 8% to 58.98. It cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 58.27 entry. Wall Street was enthusiastic about a 49% jump in quarterly profit. Sales growth was also impressive, rising 38% to $357.1 million.


Breakouts can always be found, even in wobbly markets. Their success rate is mixed, however, especially when [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) start to crop up in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The distribution day count remains low for both indexes, but the weakness in institutional-quality growth stock, including the [FAANG](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) names and leading software stocks, can't be ignored.


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) gapped up powerfully last week on strong Q1 results, but after four declines in the past five session, it's now below a conventional entry of 452.10.


Other breakouts are holding up OK, particularly in the oil and gas space. **Wildhorse Resource Development** ([WRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WRD)), **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)), **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)), **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) and **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) have been stubborn about giving back recent gains.

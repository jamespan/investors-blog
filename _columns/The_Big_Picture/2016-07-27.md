The bulls took in a one-man-band performance of sorts Wednesday, courtesy of the Nasdaq Composite's nearly 0.6% advance. Other key indexes ended virtually flat.


Across the market overall, the tone of the market remained positive.


Dow 30 component **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), while not a market leader in the current uptrend, nevertheless showed its heft in the stock market following better-than-expected results released late Tuesday. Its 6.5% jump to 102.95 came in volume more than 150% above usual levels. Clearly, it was the iPhone maker's best day of the year in terms of price and volume action. Yet it still faces two tasks: 1) climbing back above resistance at the 200-day moving average and 2) rebounding even further to complete a base.

Meanwhile, amid fresh data showing an unexpectedly large build in weekly U.S. crude oil inventories, the global commodity slid more than 2% to a three-month low. That depressed oil exploration and related companies' shares, which in turn weighed on indexes such as the S&P 500 (down 0.1%) and the Dow Jones industrial average (down a fraction).


Breadth was in fact negative on the NYSE, where losing issues nipped winners by a nearly 8-to-7 margin. But keep in mind that in addition to the oil patch, stocks from defensive sectors such as dairy, meat and alcohol also fell.


On the Nasdaq, winners beat losers 4-to-3.


This rally clearly is not the sole domain of the megacap techs. Looking at the IBD 50, smaller, younger companies with eye-popping growth include **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) (No. 5 in the IBD 50); China's online video game leader **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) (No. 3), also a member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx); pharmaceutical marketing software expert **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) (No. 8), also in IBD Leaderboard; data networking appliance firm **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)) (No. 11); and broadband communications chip designer **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) (No. 12).


MaxLinear, a small cap at $1.4 billion, may be of particular interest to IBD subscribers because its current record of outstanding EPS and revenue growth (5-year rates of 79% and 33%, respectively), high ROE (39% in 2015 and no long-term debt) and other fundamentals match those of past huge winners in their early runs, including **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) in the early 1990s and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) in the latter half of the 1980s.


Wednesday's announcement by the Federal Reserve that it will not move on interest rates seemed almost a nonevent as the news, hitting the wires at 2 p.m. ET, failed to draw much market reaction. Indeed, equity trading desks are focused on corporate earnings results, and there are reasons to cheer. After the close on Wednesday, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) followed Apple's surprise with another quarter of big profit and revenue growth.


From a bird's-eye view, the earnings picture continues to look less bad. S&P Global Market Intelligence analysts note that the estimated drop in S&P 500 firms' earnings in Q2 is now likely to drop 3% vs. a year ago. At the beginning the month, the decline was estimated at -5%. A higher ratio of positive surprises is accounting for the improved results.


The energy sector is chiefly responsible for the overall profit drop. As of Wednesday, S&P Global reported that the energy subsector within the S&P 500 is likely to see an 80% plunge in profits to $1.05 a share.


On the other hand, consumer discretionary firms are on track to see an 11.7% boost to earnings, followed by industrials (up 11%), health care (up 4.7%) and utilities (up 3%).


At this point, it's easy to become complacent. Don't.


Even though the market is at or near all-time highs, the savvy investor knows that paper gains are nothing more than that. Locking in at least some gains, even as a stock keeps rising, helps you raise some cash and weather any future pullbacks.


The bullish view among newsletter pundits, as tracked by Investors Intelligence, remains high at above 52%. Yet as this column has noted in the past, bullishness can remain elevated for an extended period before the market shows real signs of a pullback.


Heavy institutional selling, an important indicator of the market's health, remains sparse. The S&P 500's three distribution days have been mild: -0.7% on July 5, -0.4% on July 21, and -0.3% on July 25. As seen in the Market Pulse, the Nasdaq has logged just two sessions of intense professional selling since the market flashed a rare Day 3 follow-through on June 30.

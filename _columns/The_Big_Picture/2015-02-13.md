Stocks percolated in lower volume Friday but ended with a nice splash to close high in the day's price range.


The Nasdaq grabbed an 0.7% gain, while the S&P 500 took the smaller 0.4% portion. The IBD 50 added 0.3%.


The day's signature move came in the final two hours as the indexes rose without interruption.


Volume slowed on the eve of the three-day weekend. Trade resumes Tuesday after the Presidents Day holiday Monday.


The S&P 500 closed at a new high, escaping at least temporarily the trading range where it has been stuck for more than two months. The Nasdaq is holding above a similar trading range.


The indexes have not built enough of a cushion to suggest that they have shattered the old resistance.


Media outlets on Friday made a big deal out of the S&P 500 reaching another all-time high. But the honk means little.


A more relevant accomplishment would be an aggressive break above the indexes' recent trading ranges. Without that, the market is just shuffling nearly in place like someone in bad need of a dancing lesson.


Still, there are some bullish signs in this uptrend:


•New highs are smothering the new lows.


•The Dow Jones utility average has sank 5% so far this month, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have risen about 6% and 5%, respectively. If money is leaving conservative vehicles, it could be a bullish move.


•The NYSE advance-decline line is rising.


While none of this is enough to crack open a bottle of August 1982 Super Cycle Champagne, it is at least encouraging.


Breakouts were missing among top stocks Friday, but some top-rated stocks showed good action.


Network security firm **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) broke out of a double-bottom base Thursday. The stock gapped up Friday for a 15% gain in huge volume. Such a move creates regret for those who missed the breakout, but the bulls know that this type of big gain is exactly what is needed to draw money into growth stocks.


**Vasco Data Security International** ([VDSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDSI)), another stock in the computer security group, leapt 11% in heavy volume. It's still working on a somewhat sloppy consolidation. Vasco is about 7% below a possible early entry at 29.84.


Meanwhile, laggard groups such as oil, steel and metals were once again strong performers Friday. The day's biggest losers included utilities and tobacco, both defensive groups.

Stock Market Hit By Late-Session Selling; Tesla Bucks Trend, Surges Past Buy Point
===================================================================================

For a good part of Wednesday' session, the stock market didn't move much. The bulls — watching the Nasdaq composite for a breakout over the 12,000 level and the Dow for a breakout over 30,000 — liked the price action just fine. But a wave of selling hit the stock market during the final 30 minutes of trading, resulting in a distribution day for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500.




After modest declines in lower volume Tuesday, volume picked up the pace Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 fell 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.8%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index hit another all-time high but reversed lower for a loss of 1.3%.


Declining stocks on the Nasdaq outnumbered advancers by about 3-to-2. On the NYSE, decliners beat advancers by more than 2-to-1


Sentiment turned negative in afternoon trading after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said New York City schools would move to remote learning to combat rising coronavirus cases.


Coronavirus Conundrum
---------------------


The stock market continues to grapple with two big issues. The likelihood of several vaccines in 2021 is good news, but the rapid spread of Covid-19 is sparking worries of more shutdowns across the U.S. and what impact that will have on the U.S. economy.


Financials and transports outperformed for a good part of the session, but both sectors eventually got dragged down with the broad market.

Top-rated growth stocks generally watched the action from the sidelines with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) down 1.1%.


**Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) has one of the better looking charts in the IBD 50. The REIT has been holding gains well after gapping up to an all-time high on Nov. 5. If it can close Friday within 1.5% of last week's close, a three-weeks-tight pattern would be in place. The pattern is good to see after a breakout because it's a sign of strength and support and can often lead to higher prices.


Elsewhere, **Anaplan** ([PLAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAN)) followed through after Tuesday's breakout from a cup-with-handle base. Anaplan, which reports results next week, is tracked in the enterprise software group, which slumped 6.1% last week and is up 1.6% so far this week.


Bullish Sentiment Rises Again
-----------------------------


While market technicals are generally positive, the latest Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed another rise in bullish sentiment.


The bulls rose to 59.6% from a prior reading of 59.2% and a reading of 53.6% before that. The bullish percentage was 61.5% in early September just before a sharp market pullback.


The bears dropped to 18.2% from 19.4% a week ago and 20.6% the week before that. Low bearish ratings do not suggest strong rally potential. The bears were at 16.4% on Sept. 1, just ahead of a sharp pullback for the market. The bears were at 41.7% in late March just before follow-through days for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in early April.


The survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms. In other words, when sentiment is overly bullish, it's time to be bearish — and vice versa.


Market Complacency
------------------


Meanwhile, there's complacency in the market, judging from the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall). On Wednesday, it came in at 0.58, compared to 0.62 Tuesday and 0.59 Monday. Low readings like this indicate unusually low levels of bearish bets among options investors.


It's another contrarian indicator, so declines below 60 can be regarded as reason to be guarded about the market. Readings below 60 coincided with market peaks in September and October.


It's been a tricky environment for growth investors lately amid a recent rotation into beaten down areas of the stock market like financial stocks, oil and gas stocks and airline stocks. Growth screens like the [MarketSmith 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) and IBD 50 are yielding limited prospects at best. It's OK to stay patient and let the setups come to you.



Expectations were high for **Target**'s ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) earnings, and the retailer didn't disappoint for a second straight quarter. Target joined [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Wednesday when it cleared a short consolidation with a 167.52 buy point. The breakout came after a nice test of the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/).


The **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) position was increased on Leaderboard when the stock topped a 466 entry. Shares jumped 10% to 486.64, helped by a Morgan Stanley upgrade to overweight from equal weight and raised price target to 540 from 360.


**Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) performed well after the company priced an offering of 28.7 million shares at 125. It's common for a stock to trade down to its offering price, but Pinduoduo recovered off lows and closed mostly flat at 132.38.

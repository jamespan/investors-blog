  Stock Market Fights Back After Fed Chief Powell Hints At Bigger Balance Sheet

Another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve Wednesday initially brought sellers into the stock market as Wall Street got another reminder that the Fed remains divided when it comes to further rate cuts. But stock market bulls won another battle as the Nasdaq composite recouped a good chunk of a 1.2% intraday loss.




Sentiment turned positive after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the [Fed could start to expand its balance sheet](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-cut-fed-meeting-sends-mixed-signals-dow-jones/) by buying bonds, a form of quantitative easing.


The Fed lowered its key lending rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Despite the initial negative stock market reaction, policymakers turned slightly more dovish. At the June meeting, none of the 17 members expected the federal funds rate to fall below the 1.75%-2% range through 2021. Now, seven out of 17 members expect the benchmark rate to hit 1.5%-1.75% this year.

After the statement, the odds for an October cut rose to 45%. The 10-year Treasury yield was down 5 basis points to 1.75% ahead of the statement. As of 4 p.m. ET, the 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 1.79%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite fell as much as 1.2% but recovered for a loss of just 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.1% after erasing losses, and the S&P 500 rose less than 0.1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Tuesday.


Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.6%. The small-cap index underperformed even as [bank stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansach/) rallied. The heaviest weighted sector in iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) is financial services at around 16.5%. The industrials, technology and health care sectors weigh around 15% each.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The stock market's still-bullish technical picture is helped by a light [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, and a U.S. economy that's holding its own. The factory sector has weakened some, but the jobless rate continues to sit near a 50-year low, and consumer spending still looks good.


The Federal Open Market Committee raised its 2019 GDP growth forecast to 2.2%, with growth estimates ranging from 1.8% to 2% through 2022.


Wednesday's session yielded one bullish breakout. Tech services firm **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)) gapped up over a 120.92 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) early in the session but backed off highs. Shares were strong on news [the company is joining the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cdw-stock-breaks-out-on-move-to-sp500-index/).



With the stock market in a confirmed uptrend, it's still good strategy to focus on stocks with solid fundamentals and bullish charts. Targeting base breakouts is fine, but looking for stocks finding support at their 10-week lines for the first time after a breakout is also sound strategy. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) is a good example.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) was an early drag on the S&P 500, but the stock recovered nicely after slumping more than 5% at session lows. Weak revenue guidance offset strong earnings and sales growth. **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), meanwhile crashed 13% after the company reported [weak earnings and lowered its earnings outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/fedex-stock-buy-point-fedex-earnings-q1-2020/) for its current fiscal year 2020. Last month, FedEx said it was ending its ground delivery contract with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


FedEx also weighed on the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which slumped 1.2%.


Homebuilders Rise
-----------------


Homebuilders outperformed before the Fed statement — and after. Several homebuilders have stellar [IBD Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) but are extended past proper buy points. **M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) is a good example, but it could be poised for a first test of the 10-week moving average after a bullish breakout. A first test of the 10-week line after a breakout is a good opportunity to add shares to a current position, or to buy a stock lightly for the first time.


**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) is another candidate for a test of the 10-week line, while **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)) is still in buy range after reclaiming a 28.87 buy point last week.


Headed into Wednesday, IBD's building sector ranked No. 2 out of 33 sectors ranked by IBD based on a combination of fundamental and technical factors.

Elsewhere, **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) helped lift IBD's chip-equipment group to a gain of around 0.8%. Shares rose 3.5% to 157.98. But it's well extended from a 123.53 handle entry. Top stocks in the group that are still breakout candidates include **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), but they're riskier because the true leaders in the group have already broken out.


Roku Slammed Again
------------------


On the downside, sellers were in **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) again after shares plummeted 13% last week. Shares plunged nearly 14% Wednesday after **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) unveiled [competitive streaming services](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-comcast-expand-streaming-wars-roku-stock-dives/).

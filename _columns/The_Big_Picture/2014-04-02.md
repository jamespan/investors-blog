Stocks behaved decently Wednesday, a day after the S&P 500 stretched to a new closing high and the market went back into uptrend mode.

  

The day's light gains belied strength among transportation-related issues and high-growth stocks. One also cannot ignore ADP's nice report on private-sector job growth. The 191,000-job jolt in March actually missed views, yet it was the best report so far in 2014.

  

The IBD 50 gained 0.3%, following Tuesday's 2.5% vault. As seen in today's Market Pulse, more leadership-quality stocks advanced in heavy volume than those that fell.

  

The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, good enough for a fourth straight gain. The S&P 500 was slightly better, up 0.3%. Nasdaq volume grew; NYSE trade fell.

  

Perhaps more important, both of these marquee indexes finished well in the upper half of the day's trading range.

  

New IBD readers will want to pay close attention to these details, as marked on the large daily charts on this page. The horizontal hash mark in each high-low price bar is significant information: A high close indicates bullish support among the institutional crowd. A low close may often indicate a large contingent of sellers.

  

Here's another interesting development: As the market went from "Confirmed uptrend" to "Uptrend under pressure" on March 13 and finally "Correction" on March 26, the Nasdaq stumbled below its 50-day moving average. But the recent market strength made this dip below the crucial support line a brief one, as was observed in late January and early February.

  

Strong markets feature a series of higher highs and higher lows. That's exactly what the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have been doing since a follow-through took place the day after Thanksgiving in 2012. A steady rally from here would not only take the Nasdaq to a new multiyear high, but also likely chip away at the still-heavy load of distribution days. (See the Market Pulse table.)

  

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq's Feb. 26 distribution day — a rare stalling session — fell off the count due to time.

  

Sector rotation continued. The Dow transport average gained 0.7%, expanding its year-to-date advance to 4%.

  

As the industry groups table below shows, auto, railroad and air-travel stocks are thriving. Transport-Equipment Manufacturing ranks No. 5 out of 197 industry groups and boasts a 20% rise since Jan. 1. **Greenbrier** ([GBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBX)) (98 Composite Rating), one of the stocks listed in the Market Pulse, rose 0.74 to 47.71 in double average trade. The tank-car-maker moved past a 47.43 [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/advanced-buying-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=APA1BQ8) follow-on entry point.

=====================================================================================

The stock market ended the week on a positive note Friday, as the Nasdaq composite inched closer to new highs. Top stocks **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) are in buy zones after breakouts.




The Nasdaq modestly outperformed, rising 0.4% and ending at session highs. The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrials inched higher. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.1% and is just shy of record highs.


Leading growth stocks outperformed Friday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up nearly 0.6%. No. 2 [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) advanced 3.7%, moving further above a 35.25 buy point in a deep cup base.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE compared with Thursday's figures.

Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![MP061021](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP061021-1-246x300.jpg)The tech-heavy Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 are on the verge of hitting new highs, just one week after [IBD upgraded](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-on-lukewarm-jobs-data-falling-rates-docusign-soars-on-earnings/) the market outlook to a confirmed uptrend. The Nasdaq closed at its highest price since April 29 as it capped a four-week win streak. It is moving above resistance around the 14,000 level, though it has yet to decisively clear that level.


The S&P 500 hit a new high on Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is about 2% away from its own all-time highs.


With the [stock market health](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) more positive, investors should continue to be on the lookout for buying opportunities. But stay disciplined. Keep new positions small until the new confirmed uptrend proves its mettle. Focus on top growth stocks that are breaking out above correct buy points in heavy volume. They could be some of the market's leaders if the indexes continue to move higher.

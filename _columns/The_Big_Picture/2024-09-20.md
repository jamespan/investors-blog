The stock market broadly fell Friday, but major indexes ended the week with strong gains thanks to the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut. Now fresh inflation data and some noteworthy earnings reports loom.




The Nasdaq composite fared worst among the major indexes Friday, falling 0.4% and adding a distribution day. But it posted a solid weekly increase of 1.5% and a monthly lift of 1.3% thus far. The tech-heavy index sits comfortably above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and its year-to-date gain now sits at 19.6%.


The S&P 500 dipped 0.2%, but it was fractionally too low to count as a distribution day. The benchmark index notched a weekly rise of 1.4% and it, too, is now positive for the month. The index is sitting pretty above its short-term and major moving averages and also shows a 19.6% move higher thus far this year.


Decliners led advancers led by nearly 2-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was heavier on the stock market amid triple witching.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high after rising 0.1% Friday. Its weekly gain came in at 1.6%. The blue-chip index got aid from a 6.8% jump by **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), which rallied on news of a change in chief executives. Also, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) popped 3.3% [after the Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/qualcomm-approached-intel-about-a-takeover-in-recent-days-fa114f9d) that **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) approached the chip giant about a possible takeover.


Small caps were mauled by the bears, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.1%. Still, it was not enough to stop it posting weekly gain of 2.2% though. Growth stocks fared better. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund inched up 0.1% Friday. It now is back above its major moving averages thanks to a weekly gain of 3.7%.


Fed Cut Aids Stock Market, PCE Inflation Data Next
--------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP092024.jpg)Stocks got a big boost when the Fed moved to slash rates a half point on Wednesday. But Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman, the lone voice of dissent on the bumper cut, issued a statement Friday where she said that "we have not yet achieved our inflation goal" and that the move could be seen as a "premature declaration of victory."


Whether she is correct or not will become clearer on Friday, when Personal Consumption Expenditures index data for August is released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Headline PCE is seen rising 2.5% year over year while core PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is expected to post an annualized rise of 2.6%.


Other notable economic data due in the coming week includes the latest consumer confidence reading, which drops Tuesday. Also on the agenda are new-home sales data for August, which comes Wednesday, and revised second-quarter GDP data on Thursday.


A few noteworthy [earnings reports loom in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/costco-stock-earnings-kb-home/). These include **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) and **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)).

FedEx Hurts This Group
----------------------


A majority of the [S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Utilities, a defensive area, outperformed by a large margin. Materials and industrials were the worst laggards on the stock market.



Once again, the relative performance of the 197 IBD industry groups gave investors a deeper insight into the action on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Alternative energy stocks, electric utilities, oil-and-gas realty trusts, computer hardware firms, and cable and satellite telecom plays were among the best performers.


Conversely, drugstores, chip equipment and manufacturing stocks, and trucking firms plays all lagged.


The airfreight group fared worst of all, dragged down by a post-earnings plunge by **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)). It flashed sell signals by gapping below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

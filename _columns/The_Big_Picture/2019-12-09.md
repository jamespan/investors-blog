title: Stock Market Reverses Lower, Takes A Punch Relatively Well

The Nasdaq composite reversed lower Monday, a negative outcome for the day but nothing to disrupt a stock market uptrend that continues to please most investors.




Indexes closed at session lows after the air went out of a minor advance early on. The Nasdaq was up less than 0.3% after the open; it closed 0.4% lower. The S&P 500 behaved similarly and ended with a 0.3% loss.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.4%. The Russell 2000 lost 0.3%, still holding near 14-month highs.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which gave the composite another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). That's No. 6 since early November, and it is a sign that institutional investors are taking profits ahead of the year end. Who can blame them? The Nasdaq is up nearly 30% for the year and the S&P 500 25.1%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP_6x4_120919-260x300.jpg)Monday's trading bars were pretty narrow. If the stock market is falling, better that it happens in restrained fashion.


Distribution has picked up, but the stock market remains structurally sound. Indexes are back near record highs after last week's two-day sell-off.


Other indicators are favorable, at least in the short term. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line on Monday made a 14-month high. The NYSE's advance-decline line has been trending higher for most of the year.


Nearly a week ago, the [CBOE Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) spiked to a level that typically marks a stock market bottom. That near-term low in the key equity indexes is holding.


Historically, a Santa Claus rally unfolds in the last week of December, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. So far this month, indexes are sputtering. The Nasdaq is down 0.4% and the S&P 500 is off 0.2% in December. Perhaps that's normal after three straight months of gains.


Two Stock Market Risks
----------------------


It's always possible the Grinch will show up Sunday, too. That's when new [tariffs are set to take effect on Chinese imports](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-trump-big-decision-do-nothing-will-dow-jones-care/). The stock market — which has climbed on optimistic signs on trade — could react badly. There's been a back-and-forth on trade lately, with China making some overtures.


Even if the market gets through the tariff deadline in good shape, another potential speed bump looms Wednesday. That's when the Federal Reserve will wrap up a meeting and announce its latest monetary policy. Nearly every investor expects the Fed to leave rates unchanged, according to [CME Group's FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html). Indeed, the Fed on Oct. 30 cut interest rates by a quarter point but indicated no more cuts are planned.


Friday's superb jobs report was a sign the economy does not need stimulus, even as manufacturing slows.


IBD 50 Lags Stock Market
------------------------


Leading stocks are another way to measure the market's tone, and those equities are still performing satisfactorily. The IBD 50 fell 0.7%, a larger drop than any major index. Much of the lag can be blamed on **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)). The maker of equipment for cosmetic and other medical procedures plunged nearly 10%. That kind of move is often a typical day for this volatile new issue.



There was a clear consumer bent in the market. Retail, consumer staples and consumer discretionary were among the few S&P sectors that rose Monday. Health care, industrials, utilities, financials and technology declined 0.3% to 0.7%.


Semiconductor stocks contributed to the tech sector's weakness. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) and other chip ETFs are holding above their 50-day moving averages after pulling back to those levels.


With the stock market pausing, there were no standout breakouts Monday. Software leader **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) poked above the 310.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) but could not close above the entry. Volume was limp, and [Adobe's earnings report, due in three days,](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stocks-to-watch-stock-market-rally-continues-adobe-spotify/) made a purchase Monday riskier than normal.

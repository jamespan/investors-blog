Nasdaq, S&P 500 Hit Record Highs As Apple Breakout Fades; Amazon, Atlassian, Twitter Report Earnings
=====================================================================================================

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 set record highs Thursday, as Apple stock tried to break out past a new buy point but faded. After the close, tech leaders **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) reported earnings in the latest of many major reports this week.




The Nasdaq set record highs at the start of a volatile session that saw the composite reverse sharply lower before closing modestly higher Thursday. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials both gained 0.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.4%.


Leading growth stocks sharply underperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 0.7% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 20-ranked **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)) soared over 13% on earnings and broke out of a new base. Century is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock.


Volume ended higher on the Nasdaq and NYSE compared with Thursday's figures.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![MP042921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP042921-221x300.jpg)The Nasdaq started cutting early gains and reversing lower, as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped. But the tech-heavy composite was able to battle back in afternoon trade as Treasury yields backed off from session highs. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 hit a new high amid the day's strong gains.


The overall [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains modest. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both have three days of higher-volume declines.


With modest levels of institutional selling, investors should remain focused on buying stocks breaking out past [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Remember to keep an eye out for when companies are reporting earnings. Buying breakouts ahead of earnings is dangerous. For example, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) broke out past a 560.89 entry in a cup with handle on Tuesday. Shares gapped down over 8% Thursday following the [company's earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/servicenow-stock-servicenow-now-earnings-q12021/), triggering the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).



Stocks To Watch: Apple, Generac, Tesla
--------------------------------------


Dow Jones leader **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) staged a breakout attempt past a cup with handle's 135.63 buy point, but was unable to hold its gains. Shares jumped as much as 2.6% before closing with a 0.1% loss following the company's blowout earnings results late Wednesday.


A potential flaw is the stock's weak [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). Ideally, the RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day or shortly thereafter. But Apple's RS line is far from its old highs, indicating significant stock market underperformance.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) regained its key 50-day line Thursday amid a nearly 7% gain in the wake of the company's earnings. Shares are approaching a 342.38 buy point in a cup with handle. The base, as Leaderboard analysis notes, is a riskier late-stage pattern. And the relative strength line is trending lower.


EV giant **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) broke down through its key 50-day moving average, skidding 2.5% Thursday and falling for a third straight day since its earnings announcement.


A cup with handle continues to form with a 780.89 buy point, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), but the stock's recent weakness is concerning.

Stock Market Earnings: Amazon, Atlassian, Twitter
-------------------------------------------------


After the close Thursday, tech giants Amazon and Twitter, along with software leader Atlassian, reported their quarterly results.


Amazon jumped about 4% in overnight trade Thursday following the [company's strong results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-jumps-on-solid-earnings-beat-amzn/). Amazon reported adjusted earnings of 15.79 a share on revenue of $108.5 billion. Analysts expected Amazon to report earnings of $9.54 a share on revenue of $104.5 billion, according to FactSet.


The FANG stock leader ended Thursday in buy range above a [cup base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) 3,434.10 buy point.


Atlassian advanced over 2% after the close in the wake of the company's better-than-expected fiscal-Q3 results. Shares are adding a handle to a double bottom, moving the buy point to 245.03.


Social media giant Twitter plunged nearly 9% after the close Thursday. [Twitter barely beat](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-drops-on-earnings-report-twtr/) analyst estimates and gave revenue guidance that fell short.

Nasdaq Rules Again In Mixed Day; These Techs Are Leaking Losses
================================================================

Stocks frittered away a promising start on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 failed to climb back above a key price level. Yet it's still a good year for stockpickers.


You could affirm this just by looking at the year-to-date performance of the two major indexes, the Nasdaq composite (up 0.2% on Wednesday, up 8.9% year to date) and the S&P 500 (down 0.2%, up just 4.4% since Jan. 1).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP041917-161x300.png)Another reason? Scan the IBD 50, and you'll still see handfuls of excellent-quality stocks that are either forming new bases or extending their uptrends. Indeed, few names within the IBD 50 and the IBD Big Cap 20 are having trouble like the S&P 500 in holding above the key 50-day moving average.


**Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) (Sector Leader), **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) (new on Leaderboard), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) (signal of re-emerging strength in Latin America), **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)) (solid earnings and revenue turnaround) and **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) (meets the [N in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) in the restaurant industry) all exemplify certain aspects of the economy that are doing well.


Part of the job of the CAN SLIM investor is to find the true No. 1 company in a dynamic field.


So an investment in something like **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), down 5% in huge volume on another disappointing quarter of shrinking revenue, is not only proof that stocks with low P-E ratios don't necessarily turn out to be great plays. It also represents a double loss. By buying a laggard and former big market leader like Big Blue (now with an E Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a Composite Rating below 50), you lose the opportunity to focus on a true leader today.


Prior to Wednesday's sharp sell-off, IBM showed a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.5 (170.05 divided by $13.60 in earnings per share over the prior four quarters). That ratio is 37% below the 20 P-E ratio of the entire S&P 500. And yet seasoned growth investors know that what may look cheap may turn out to be pricey.


IBM's profit grew 1% to $2.38 a share in the first quarter. In the year-ago quarter, earnings sank 19%. When was the last time the computer hardware and services giant had a CAN SLIM-style quarter? Earnings-wise, you have to go back the second quarter of 2014, when EPS jumped 35%. But revenue dropped 4% in the same time frame.


For this reason, it's imperative for investors who want to succeed in growth stocks to demand that a stock's EPS Rating be at least 80 or higher. IBM's EPS rank has slouched to a 46; in other words, 53% of all companies in IBD's database show stronger profit growth.


While the S&P 500 lost a distribution day due to time, the Nasdaq likely picked up yet another stalling session as it closed well in the lower half of the day's range. But based on IBD rules, the stalling day does not get added to the count until we see more standard declines of 0.2% or more than stall days.


On the Nasdaq, the biggest distribution day over the past 25 sessions is the 2.1% shellacking on March 21. The next biggest sell-off was a 0.6% drop in higher turnover on April 5, followed by a 0.2% decline on April 11. The two other distribution days that make up the total of five were stalling sessions, on March 17 and 24.


As seen in the "What's The Market Trend?" page (see the link at the bottom of the story), the Accumulation/Distribution Rating for the S&P 500 has now fallen to a D, a negative for the market. But the Nasdaq shows a B-.


The megacap Dow Jones industrials had been right in the middle with a neutral C grade, but after Wednesday's action, it's fallen to a D+.


While the major indexes struggled, it wasn't exactly a great day for so-called defensive issues.


The Dow utility average fell 0.5%, mainly due to IBM's woes. Gold mining shares plunged 2.7% as a group. In the energy patch, oilfield service, oil drilling and oil exploration stocks all tanked  on reports that OPEC isn't yet ready to commit to expanding its agreement to cut output beyond June.


Fiber-optic gear companies continue to get hammered on news that China demand may in fact be fading. **Finisar** ([FNSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNSR)), which flashed a sell signal as early as March 10 with a big gap-down below its 50-day moving average in huge trade, fell 9% to 21.75 in nearly quadruple normal volume. The maker of equipment for local-area and wide-area fiber-optic networks is now 40% below a 36.85 52-week high.


The Dow transports rose 0.5% but are still down since Jan. 1.

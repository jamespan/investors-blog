Stocks shot higher Wednesday to end a five-day slide. But one big up day doesn't translate into a change in trend.

  

The Nasdaq composite paced the rebound with a 1.3% gain, its biggest since Dec. 18.

  

While volume dropped vs. Tuesday's level, it was above average. The index's close virtually at session highs also hinted at some serious buying by the market's big players.

  

Strong gains by biotech, restaurant, security software, apparel, hospital, homebuilder and leisure-related stocks also helped fuel gains in the S&P 500, which rose nearly 1.2%.

  

Small caps rose in lockstep with the big caps; the Russell 2000 climbed almost 1.3%.

  

The market's gains, while broad, recouped only a small portion of meaty losses that began Dec. 30. Yet the action by leading growth stocks was encouraging.

  

The IBD 50 jumped 2.7%.

  

A big rally in February-expiring light sweet crude oil futures may have calmed the nerves of some equity traders, but that was just one piece of the day's generally positive news landscape.

  

A stronger than expected ADP private sector jobs report helped give stocks a bullish open.

  

Later in the day, the Federal Reserve's minutes from its December meeting indicated that the central bank is more concerned about how crude oil's sharp decline will impact inflation and how unstable overseas economies could weigh on America's growth.

  

The quality of today's sector leadership should give astute readers fresh chances to find new breakouts if institutional appetite for stocks returns.

  

Within the IBD stock research tables, the chips, computer, medical, retail and dividend-rich real estate sectors rank within the top 10 among 33 sectors.

  

Even the No. 1-ranked Miscellaneous sector reflects the good vibes of an American economy that appears ready to continue growing at a decent pace. In Wednesday's IBD, that sector's top-rated stock, **Packaging Corp. of America** ([PKG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKG)), is rising steadily, up since breaking out past 71.04.

  

The psychology of the herd remains mixed.

  

The put-call volume ratio has spiked above the critical 1.15 level twice in recent weeks. (See the graph below the Nasdaq chart on Page B2.) When puts exceed calls by a sharp margin, it indicates an unusual jump in investor fear.

  

Yet bullishness has yet to come down significantly since the Market Pulse put the market outlook at correction on Monday. See the bulls-bears graphs on Page B11 in today's paper.

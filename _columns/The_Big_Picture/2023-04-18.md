The stock market didn't move much Tuesday, but the session served up more chart breakouts and several top growth stocks scored solid gains beneath the surface.




Defense contractor **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) delivered an [earnings breakout](https://www.investors.com/news/lmt-stock-eyes-breakout-as-lockheed-martin-tops-earnings-forecasts/) but closed off highs, while retailer **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and topped the 100 level in higher volume.


FND led another strong session for homebuilders and other stocks in the building sector. In the homebuilder group, **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) rallied for the sixth time in seven sessions. Volume finally picked up the pace after several below-average volume days. IBD's homebuilding group was one of the day's top performers, rising more than 2%.


**Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)), a provider of insulation installation services, jumped to the top of a seven week consolidation, rising more than 5% in heavy volume.


**Marriott** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)), **Hyatt** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) and **Hilton** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)) stayed in rally mode and led the lodging group to a gain of nearly 2%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite briefly topped its March 31 high, rising as much as 0.7% intraday. But the gain faded to a loss of less than 0.1% by the close. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1. Volume rose slightly.


Despite some selling in the Nasdaq, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) held up well, helped by an HSBC upgrade to buy and big price target hike to 355 from 175. Nvidia is one of 13 stocks in the [Leaderboard model portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com), which is currently about 76% invested.

**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) was a solid gainer on the Nasdaq, up more than 3% to 143.75. It barely topped a shallow cup base with a 143.60 entry ahead of its April 27 earnings report.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also was barely lower despite an [earnings sell-off](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-of-america-goldman-sachs-to-report-earnings-morgan-stanley-on-deck/) for **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)).


The S&P 500 edged higher by 0.1% despite broad-based weakness in regional banks like **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)), **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) and **Zions Bancorp** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)). The S&P 500 came to within 26 points of its Feb. 2 high. Losers beat winners on the NYSE by about 8-to-7. Volume was slightly lower.


According to Dow Jones Market Data, the last time the three major stock indexes moved less than 0.1% on the same trading day was Nov. 15, 2021.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) lagged with a loss of 0.4%, weighed down by double-digit percentage declines in several speculative biotech stocks.


Stocks To Watch
---------------


The stock market uptrend still looks fine amid a relative light [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Of the Nasdaq's three distribution days, only one showed a decline of more than 1%. There haven't been any on the S&P 500 since the March 29 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in confirmed uptrends, it's perfectly fine to put money to work in some potential leaders. But finding heavy-volume movers has been difficult, with many stocks clearing buy points in light volume.


An invested percentage of 40% to 60% still makes sense, but if you're getting good feedback from new buys, exposure could be raised a little more. Always keep positions small to start. Look to increase them if new buys make progress from your entries.

Stocks to watch includeÂ **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)), which gapped up near the top of a nine-week cup base that shows a buy point at 21.72.


**Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) cleared a trendline inside an early-stage consolidation. The stock closed near highs, up nearly 7% in strong volume. Despite Mobileye's volatile price swings, the new issue still has the look of an emerging leader poised to break out from an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).



The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) marked its second straight heavy-volume price gain, rising 2%. Besides DKNG and MBLY, **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) and **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) also outperformed in the IBD 50 with gains of 4.9% and 4.8%, respectively.


Interest Rates
--------------


With Q1 earnings season underway, interest rates have moved to the back burner. The 1o-year Treasury yield was trading slightly lower to around 3.58% just after 4:30 p.m. ET. The yield has rallied sharply after a hitting a low of around 3.25% on April 6. But the stock market seems to be growing more comfortable with the fact that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its aggressive rate-hike campaign.


As it stands now, the CME FedWatch tool fully expects another quarter-point hike at the May meeting, with traders expecting a pause in June and leaning toward a continued pause in July.

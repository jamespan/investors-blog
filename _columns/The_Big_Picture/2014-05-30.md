Stocks trotted to a mixed finish Friday as the new uptrend continued to avoid hard shots.

  

The Nasdaq slipped 0.1%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The IBD 50 lost 0.8%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

The absence of bearish action during the week gave the bulls cause for hope. A distribution day — a significant loss in a major index in rising volume — soon after a follow-through day is often fatal to a new rally.

  

Staying alive is the first rule for any uptrend, and so far the indexes are holding firm.

  

However, encouraging signs don't come with guarantees.

  

While the bears have failed to deliver any harm to the uptrend confirmed Tuesday, the bulls still face a question: Can this market deliver a decent a post-May rally?

  

Recent history would seem to offer a qualified yes.

  

In the past 10 years, there have been three May follow-through days during a bull market. Two of the three led to playable rallies (2004-05), and one failed immediately (2011).

  

Testing an uptrend with a buy or two is standard procedure. However, an investor needs to see quality stocks breaking out.

  

On Friday, top-rated stocks weren't cooperating. They offered no breakouts in fast trade.

  

**PPG Industries** ([PPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PPG)), a maker of paints and coatings, popped past a 201.69 buy point near midday but then retreated back under the entry. Volume was weak.

  

Earlier in the week, there were some decent breakouts. So far, the better-looking action is from technology-oriented stocks.

  

Chipmaker **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) is 3% above a 47.57 entry. Firewall software and appliances provider **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is 3% past a 72.70 buy point.

  

Both stocks are in 5% buy zones.

  

Image sensor and chip designer **OmniVision Technologies** ([OVTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OVTI)) spent Wednesday and Thursday in the 5% buy zone. On Friday, the stock leapt 12% in huge volume as it became too extended to buy.

  

Other stocks show promise.

  

**Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) is climbing the right side of a cup base. The low of the base undercut a previous base, resetting the base count. 

  

**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) also is working on the right side of a pattern.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 gained 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively. The IBD 50 added 0.5%.

  

Among industry groups, Priceline's 7% weekly gain paced Leisure-Travel's 6% pop for the week. Food-Meat Products rose 5%, thanks to 9% and 5% gains by **Sanderson Farms** ([SAFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAFM)) and **Hormel Foods** ([HRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRL)), respectively.

  

Economic news on Friday was disappointing. Personal income and spending fell short of views. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey also missed. But the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index topped expectations.

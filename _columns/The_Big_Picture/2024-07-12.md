  Stock Market Gets Another Boost By Small Caps; Why The Rally Turned Wacky

Students of the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) might agree that the past two sessions were among the wackiest in recent memory. Yet both stocks and the major indexes continued to reaffirm a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-marks-this-bullish-shift-after-fed-chief-powells-decision-to-leave-rates-unchanged/) that has now lasted more than eight months.




Why "wacky?" One word explains it all: rotation.


On Friday, the bulls could breathe a sigh of relief that equities of most sizes and shapes gained ground. The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all rose 0.5% to 0.6%. Volume fell.


Considering the sharp losses for both the Nasdaq and the 500 on Thursday, the rebound signaled that fund managers immediately took advantage of that dip to buy shares.


The Dow Jones industrials, meanwhile, did not fall sharply on Thursday. On Friday, its third-straight advance pushed the blue chip average by nearly 1.8% over that period. At 40,000.90, the Dow closed above 40,000 for only the second time ever.


Yet where are the institutions — namely mutual funds and ETFs, hedge funds, large advisors, college endowments and pension plans — truly loading up the truck? Small caps.


The Russell 2000, which blasted 3.6% higher on Thursday, jumped an additional 1.1%. The small-cap benchmark not only gapped higher at the open for a second day in a row, it rallied at least 1% for the third straight session. The Russell 2000's 6% gain for the week sent the index up almost 6% for the year.


Despite some June inflation numbers at the wholesale level that topped the Econoday forecast, investors also deployed fresh capital into long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds. The yield on the key 10-year government bond fell 8 basis points to 4.18%, the lowest rate since late March, according to Cboe data.


Improvement In Stock Market Breadth
-----------------------------------


Despite the Nasdaq's sharp sell-off on Thursday, what made that session wacky was the enormous improvement in market breadth.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP071224.jpg)[On MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF), for instance, 893 stocks rose in heavy volume that day. That's a sign of institutional accumulation. Meanwhile, 144 stocks declined in above-average turnover. Yet [Thursday's session](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/sp500-nasdaq-cpi-magnificent-seven-stocks/) cast fresh attention on how the Magnificent Seven stocks' performance had been warping the action seen in the major equity indexes.


On Friday, the stock market saw the same type of action below the surface. Breadth was positive among stocks experiencing heavy volume —  743 up vs. 59 down, according to early data on the homepage of MarketSurge.


Later in the day, [MarketSurge's homepage](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) showed 394 stocks up in big volume, and 75 down in outsized turnover.


Meanwhile, at least 12 stocks made MarketSurge's automated breakout screen over the past two sessions, while as many as 75 names traded near a buy point (or pivot point).


In the broader stock market, advancers exceeded decliners on the Nasdaq by a 5-2 margin, early data showed. On the New York Stock Exchange, winners topped losers 3-to-1. Please see the [General Market Indicators Charts page](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI_071224.pdf), found as a PDF at the bottom of each day's Big Picture column, to see the final numbers.


Small Caps Grow Bullish Horns
-----------------------------



Over the past five months, small caps seemed to frustrate investors. Decent gains quickly melted into disappointing losses. Yet a weekly chart highlights a serious change in character. At 2,148, the Russell made its highest weekly close since the week ended Jan. 14, 2022.


Rotation is one of the essential nutrients for healthy stock market rallies. One sector, after going on a bullish run, passes the proverbial baton to another sector.


IBD also slices the market into [33 distinct industrial sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jul-12-2024/). So, what's been sprinting lately?


[Inside IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), you can track changes in the rankings of these 33 sectors in terms of medium to long-term price performance. As of Friday's close, [Computer held the top spot](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jul-12-2024/), as it has done for most of 2024 and is up 78% since Jan. 1. Chips ranks No. 2 and has staged a 50% pole vault in value so far in 2024. Without question, computer and chip stocks have served as a beacon of interest in the development of AI.



One member of the Computer sector, **Agilysys** ([AGYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGYS)), rallied 3.8% this past week to 106.84. It also broke out of a narrow six-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/) showing a 104.84 proper buy point. Thus [it's in the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/).


Agilysys, which markets proprietary hardware and software systems to a range of clients, has revved up its profits. Earnings dipped 14% in the second quarter of 2023 to 18 cents a share, then rose 4%, 35% and 23% in the next three quarters. Analysts see second-quarter earnings accelerating 42% to 26 cents a share on a 15% boost in sales to $64.5 million.


Agilysys sits squarely in small-cap land. It has a market value of $2.93 billion with 27.5 million shares outstanding. [According to MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF), nearly one out of every four shares are owned by management.

Watch These Stock Market Sectors In July
----------------------------------------


However, new sectors have been moving up IBD's rankings. Take the Savings & Loans sector, [which as of Friday jumped to No. 5](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jul-12-2024/) despite a weak year-to-date gain of 4.3%.


Within the S&L sector, **Axos Financial** ([AX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AX)) (market cap $3.5 billion, average daily volume 630,000 shares) stands out.


The Las Vegas-based lender holds an excellent 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and boasts impressive quarterly results. Earnings rose 34%, 19%, 16% and 44% on a year-over-year basis as revenue climbed 23%, 18%, 55% and 27%. Revenue over the past four quarters topped $1.1 billion.


Axos carries extra risk for stock investors due to its unusually big price swings week to week. For now, the stock is trying to clear a [flawed V-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/) with a 63 buy point.



Not far behind the S&Ls group? Banks, which finished the week at No. 9 among 33 IBD sectors. Again, this sector's year-to-date rise of 9% seems modest compared with its tech and consumer-oriented peers. But the [banks sector](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jul-12-2024/) also has at least two dozen stocks that score a 90 Composite Rating or higher.


The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) exchange traded fund soared 8.7% for the week. That was the ETF's best weekly advance since it bolted 12.2% for the week ended Nov. 3, 2023. After that big week, the fund romped higher in four of the next six weeks.


This past week, KRE also rushed past a [trendline entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trendlines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) on its weekly chart near 50.50.

More Sectors To Watch
---------------------


Manufacturing, health care and utility sectors also might try to steal Big Tech's yearlong thunder.


The Health Care Select Sector ETF ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) barreled 2.7% higher for the week. It's trying to smash through months-long upside resistance at 148.



Granted, XLV does not serve as a useful barometer of small caps in the health care space. The top 10 holdings are chiefly large- and megacap pharmaceutical makers.


[Friday's Inside The IBD 50 column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/health-care-stocks-ibd-50/), however, pinpoints some emerging medical and health-care innovators with market caps well below $10 billion. They include **Intra-Cellular Therapies** ([ITCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITCI)), **TG Therapeutics** ([TGTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGTX)) and **TransMedics Group** ([TMDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMDX)), a pioneer in extending the lifespan of living organs for transplant surgeries.


Keep in mind that small and micro-cap stocks can trade in hyper-volatile fashion. This means [spotting the correct entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) carries even greater importance.


Further, as artificial intelligence-focused data centers grow, [so does the need for electricity](https://www.investors.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-data-centers-demand-nuclear-energy/). Hence, the 4.2% weekly gain by the Dow Jones utility average deserves notice too.


[A weekly chart on MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) (ticker symbol zero-DJU) shows that the Dow utility's strong gain quickly wiped away a month's worth of losses.

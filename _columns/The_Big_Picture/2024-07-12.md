  Stock Market Attracts More Buyers While Small Caps Keep Shining Brighter

Students of the stock market might agree that the past two sessions were among the wackiest in recent memory. Yet both stocks and the major indexes continued to reaffirm a confirmed uptrend that has now lasted more than eight months.




Why "wacky?" One word explains it all: rotation.


On Friday, the bulls could breathe a sigh of relief that equities of most sizes and shapes gained ground. The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all rose 0.5% to 0.6%. Considering the sharp losses for both indexes on Thursday, the rebound signaled that fund managers immediately took advantage of that dip to buy shares.


Yet where are they truly loading up the truck? Small caps. The Russell 2000, which blasted 3.6% higher on Thursday, jumped an additional 1.1%. The small-cap benchmark not only gapped higher at the open for a second day in a row, it rallied at least 1% for the third straight session.


Improvement In Stock Market Breadth
-----------------------------------


Despite the Nasdaq's sharp sell-off on Thursday, what made the session wacky was the enormous improvement in market breadth.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP071224.jpg)On MarketSurge, for instance, 893 stocks rose in heavy volume that day. That's a sign of institutional accumulation. Meanwhile, 144 stocks declined in above-average turnover. Yet Thursday's session cast fresh attention on how the Magnificent Seven stocks' performance had been warping the action seen in the major equity indexes.


On Friday, the stock market saw the same type of action below the surface. Breadth was positive among stocks experiencing heavy volume —  743 up vs. 59 down, according to early data on the homepage of MarketSurge.


Later in the day, [MarketSurge's homepage](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) showed 392 stocks up in big volume, and 75 down in outsized turnover.


Meanwhile, at least 12 stocks made MarketSurge's automated breakout screen over the past two sessions, while a total 75 names were near a buy point.


In the broader stock market, advancers exceeded decliners on the Nasdaq by a 5-2 margin, early data showed. On the New York Stock Exchange, winners topped losers 3-to-1.


Small Caps Grow Bullish Horns
-----------------------------


Over the past five months, small caps seemed to frustrate investors. Decent gains quickly melted into disappointing losses. Yet a weekly chart highlights a serious change in character. At 2,148, the Russell made its highest weekly close since the week ended Jan. 14, 2022.


Rotation is one of the essential nutrients for durable stock market rallies. One sector, after going on a bullish run, passes the proverbial baton to another sector. IBD slices the market into 33 distinct industrial sectors. So, what's been sprinting lately?

Watch These Stock Market Sectors In July
----------------------------------------


The banking sector is one. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) exchange traded fund soared 8.7% for the week. That was the ETF's best weekly advance since it bolted 12.2% for the week ended Nov. 3, 2023. After that big week, the fund romped higher in four of the next six weeks.



Manufacturing, health care and utility sectors also might try to steal tech's yearlong thunder.


The Health Care Select Sector ETF ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) barreled 2.7% higher for the week. It's trying to smash through months-long upside resistance at 148.



Further, as artificial intelligence data centers grow, so does the need for electricity. Hence, the 4.2% weekly gain by the Dow Jones utility average deserves notice too.


A weekly chart shows that the Dow utility's strong gain quickly wiped away a month's worth of losses.

A bullish jobs report wasn't much help to the stock market Friday, but buyers came in late, helping the Nasdaq composite make another stand at its 200-day moving average.




The Nasdaq composite gapped down and fell 4.2% intraday but pared its loss to 1.9%. The S&P 500 gave back 1.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose from Thursday's levels. On the NYSE, declining stocks outnumbered advancers by 17-to-4. Nasdaq decliners outnumbered advancers by more than 7-to-2.


There was a lot to like about [Friday's jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-273000-new-jobs-fed-rate-cuts-coming-dow-jones-dives-on-coronavirus/). Nonfarm payrolls increased 273,000, well above the consensus estimate of 177,000. December and January growth was revised higher.

It remains to be seen if the U.S. economy is headed for a recession, but the bond market is clearly concerned. The 10-year Treasury yield plunged another 15 basis points to 0.76%. At the start of year, it was around 1.92%.


Indeed, it's hard to see the stock market firming up if bond yields continue to plunge, and the 10-year yield did rally well off lows Friday after breaching 0.7%.


The Federal Reserve's next meeting is scheduled for March 17 and 18, and another rate cut is on the table.


Stock Market Rally Still Intact
-------------------------------


There was some fear in the market Friday, with the put-call volume ratio hitting an elevated reading of 1.23. Excessive fear has been seen at market bottoms in the past. The put-call ratio hit 1.26 Feb. 28.


In terms of the rally attempt for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, it's still intact because both indexes are still holding above their Feb. 28 lows. But a lot of technical damage has been done to the market, which will likely take some time to repair. It's also the story being told by charts of leading growth stocks.


A weak market eventually takes the highest-quality stocks down with it, and that was on full display in the MarketSmith Growth 250 Friday. Some of the worst percentage decliners were **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), **Bill.com** ([BILL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILL)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) and **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)).


The good news is that new leaders will emerge at some point. And those staying engaged during the market correction have the best chance of finding them.


China-based stocks like **Bilibili** ([BILI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILI)) and **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) are worth monitoring due to still-bullish charts.

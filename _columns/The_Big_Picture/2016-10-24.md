Several merger announcements, and perhaps some optimism ahead of the busiest week yet of earnings, fueled a solid gain for the Nasdaq composite Monday. The Dow and S&P 500 also ended higher, but gains were more muted.


The Nasdaq 100 made an all-time closing high, up 1.2%. Volume fell across the board.


The Nasdaq rose 1%, helped in part by strength in **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)).


Microsoft rose again after gapping up Friday on strong earnings. Shares rose 2% Monday in heavy volume. Amazon added 2%, also in fast trade. Baidu gained 2% as it works on a [cup-with-handle base](http://education.investors.com/education/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787) with a 197.90 buy point. Amazon and Baidu report earnings Thursday after the close.


Microsoft is among a select group of stocks that have been extending or holding gains after recent gaps up in price. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) are two other recent examples.


![mp102416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP102416-185x300.png)The S&P 500 couldn't keep up with the Nasdaq, rising 0.5%. It was weighed down by weakness in oil and gas names. The benchmark index hit a session high of 2155, just south of its 50-day moving average around 2160. The 50-day line has been a resistance level in the past six weeks. The Dow, Russell 2000 and NYSE Composite are also below their 50-day lines.


Breadth was just OK as advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 on both major exchanges.


Chip stocks outperformed. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) hit another all-time high, rising nearly 5%, while **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) added 2% to 176.59. Broadcom closed just above an early flat-base entry of 176.


**RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)), featured in the [Sector Leaders](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/quiet-leaders-in-software-sector-ellie-mae-realpage-proofpoint/) column over the weekend, jumped 6% to 27.55. It cleared a flat base with a 26.54 entry.


Growth stocks were in favor again as the IBD 50 rose 1.1%. Nearly half the names on the list outperformed the Nasdaq's 1% gain.


**Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) jumped 5% to 52.44 in heavy volume. It's still in buy range from an early 51.56 flat-base buy point.


**New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) tried to clear a 48.51 flat-base entry but came up short. Shares still rose 3.5% to 48.43. New Oriental Earnings are due Tuesday before the open.

Clearly, growth stocks are looking much better. Many have been rising in solid volume. Couple this with the fact that the [distribution-day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) count has been shrinking, and you've got a market that's acting well enough, but it is mixed. The Nasdaq is the healthiest index at this point as it approaches all-time highs. Other stock indexes are challenged as they sit below their 50-day lines, but investors' attention should be focused on Nasdaq-listed names that are working. And there are plenty to consider.


Oil gave up the $50 level Monday, falling more than 2%, but recovered for a loss of just 0.7% to $50.52 a barrel. The oil market was spooked early after Iraq said it should be exempt from planned output cuts at next month's OPEC meeting.


Bonds weakened Monday, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield 3 basis points to 1.76%.


In merger news, **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) announced plans to buy **Time Warner** ([TWX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWX)) for $85.4 billion, valuing Time Warner at $107.50 a share. After surging 12.5% last week after news of a potential deal surfaced, shares of Time Warner lost 3% to 86.74. That's nowhere near the deal price, and it's the market's way of saying it has concerns the acquisition will pass regulatory muster.


Elsewhere, **Rockwell Collins** ([COL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COL)) announced plans to buy **B/E Aerospace** ([BEAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAV)) for $6.4 billion. Rockwell Collins shed 6% while B/E Aerospace surged 16%.


Meanwhile, **Toronto Dominion Bank** ([TD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TD)) struck a deal to buy privately held Scottrade for around $4 billion. TD Bank will pay $1.3 billion for Scottrade's banking unit. **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) is buying Scottrade's brokerage unit for $2.7 billion.

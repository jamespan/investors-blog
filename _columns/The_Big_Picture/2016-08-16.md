Stocks Fall As Indexes See More Institutional Selling
======================================================

There was no new record high in the stock market Tuesday, as the indexes fell broadly.


The Nasdaq, which had made all-time closing highs in five of the previous seven sessions, fell 0.7%. The S&P 500 lost 0.5%. Both closed at session lows on a day when losers topped winners by a more than 11-to-5 ratio across the board.


Despite the drop, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remained in upward price trajectories that now date more than seven weeks. But what made Tuesday's losses more serious was the increase in volume. It was the fifth time in the past few weeks that trading levels indicated heavy selling by funds, banks and other institutional players.


The indexes are not looking stressed. But remember, distribution can emerge while market is still going up. The insidious danger in stocks is that institutional investors often will start selling before the market peaks. Investors are not helpless, however, because a buildup of distribution can warn them to pare their exposure.

Today's market has done well in a month when it tends to lag. Historically, August is one of the worst months in the market, with an average gain for the S&P 500 of less than 0.01%, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.


Psychological indicators show no major top is imminent. There's a widening gulf of bulls and bears (54.3% to 20.9%) among stock advisors, but it's hard to draw a conclusion from this contrarian indicator.


On another level -- the market's leading stocks -- there's evidence that some winners have run their course.


The IBD 50, down 1% Tuesday, finds few examples of trouble. But in the absence of sell signals, about a dozen stocks have climbed more than 20% from latest breakouts. That's the typical advance before leading stocks start to form new bases.


Those reaching 20% gains from breakouts are **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Cardtronics** ([CATM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CATM)), **Shutterstock** ([SSTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSTK)), **Masimo** ([MASI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MASI)), **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)), **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), **Veeva** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)).


And **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **MarketAxess** ([MKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKTX)) have outstanding gains.


Chinese stocks have been some of the most robust performers lately, but several of their charts showed erratic action Tuesday. **China Lodging Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) traded wildly; **Yirendai** ([YRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YRD)) made a bearish reversal; **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) followed up Monday's breakout with a price spread of nearly 15%, closing a few cents lower.


In highlights Tuesday, energy stocks had a good day as crude prices climbed nearly 2% to the best level in more than a month.


New York Fed President William Dudley said another interest-rate hike is approaching and could occur as soon as September. That boosted banking stocks and sparked selling in the rate-sensitive utilities.


Hospitals led a broad retreat in medical stocks. **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)) said it is exiting from ObamaCare programs in all but four states because of high losses.

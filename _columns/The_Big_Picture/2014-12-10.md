The sensational plunge in light sweet crude oil prices to nearly $60 a barrel shook confidence among equity investors Wednesday. Yet volume didn't run rampant across the stock market.

  

Most leaders fell hard, but big volume was largely absent.

  

The IBD 50 lost 1.8%. The Nasdaq fell 1.7% in quieter trade.

  

The S&P 500 slid 1.6% in higher volume, extending its loss over the past three sessions to 2.4%.

  

Although the large-cap index is just 2.6% below an all-time high of 2079, it's now marked a third distribution day in the past eight sessions. In each of those distribution days, the decline was heavy, 0.7% or more.

  

The S&P 500's Nov. 4 distribution fell off the count due to time. That kept the distribution-day count at three. Yet, due to a pronounced change in the market's character, the current outlook in IBD's Market Pulse was downgraded to "Uptrend under pressure" from "Confirmed uptrend."

  

Readers can treat the change like a yellow traffic light on a busy street. Caution on new buys is highly warranted. And gains in stocks should be taken before the investment becomes a total loss.

  

**Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) offers a current example. Those who bought the stock at the 244.59 handle buy point in the summer were justified in exiting the stock after a 19% advance shriveled to zero by late September.

  

Shareholders who had bought at lower prices could have held on. But this past week, the electric-car firm has threatened to wipe away all gains from an alternative shakeout+3 buy point at 202.32.

  

Market breadth was poor Wednesday. Losers outflanked winners on the NYSE by nearly 5 to 1. As seen on the S&P 500 chart on Page B2, the NYSE's advance-decline line failed to make new high ground as the S&P 500 hit new highs, a curious divergence.

  

A big drop in crude oil prices hasn't always triggered dramatic declines in the stock market. But both have fallen sharply in tandem in numerous occasions. The bear markets in 2000-to-2002 and 2008 show a positive correlation between the two.

  

Collapsing oil prices usually reflect flagging demand. This time, though, it's likely driven more by a supply glut. The drop in oil and gasoline prices means a lot for airlines, retailers and chemicals firms. But heavy hits taken by oil and gas exploration, drilling and related stocks will likely continue to weigh on the market indexes.

  

Among the worst performers so far this year, IBD's Oil & Gas Drilling group is down 42% while the U.S. Exploration and Production firms are off 32%.

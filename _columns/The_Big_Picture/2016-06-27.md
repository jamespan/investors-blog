Stock Hemorrhage Continues As Market Outlook Worsens
=====================================================

The stock market added to its misery Monday, signaling that a correction has taken hold.


The Nasdaq plunged 2.4% and the S&P 500 1.8%. Both indexes are now below their long-term 200-day moving averages and have undercut their May lows. The composite is about 8% below its June 6 peak of 4,980, the best mark of 2016, and is 12% down from its all-time peak, set last July.


The two-day rout has been worse than other two-day sell-offs that occurred during the market slide of January and February.


With the Nasdaq falling more than 6% in two sessions and the S&P 500 down more than 5%, the sheer scale of selling leaves little doubt that the stock market is now in a correction. That dour situation is now reflected in the IBD Market Pulse, and it means investors must change their strategy.


![MP062716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP062716-177x300.jpg)First, buying stocks during a correction is extremely risky. Few leading stocks can break out successfully, so it's best to keep as much cash in portfolios as possible. Second, remember that taking profits is sound advice because winnings tend to thin out quickly when the market is in decline.


Investors may choose to hold their best-performing stocks in a correction, but they must guard profits jealously. It's not a time to be patient with stocks, so consider cutting losses extra short. If a stock is not acting well, there's no need to wait for a typical 7% or 8% loss to trigger a sell signal.


The IBD 50 skidded 2.3% Monday, so there was practically no refuge in the best-rated stocks.


It's impossible to know how far down the market will go, which is the main reason for shifting to cash. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have crashed through possible support levels, and the next ones are murky.


Some type of dead-cat bounce is possible now, with the put/call volume ratio hitting levels of extreme fear. The VIX index is also elevated; however, it hasn't reached the peaks that helped mark the January and February market lows.


Volume fell Monday. That was expected, following a Friday that saw panic selling and the annual rebalancing of Russell indexes. Those considerations aside, volume was above average and mostly on the sell side Monday.


Financials, chipmakers and European stocks were under siege. Major banks in particular continued to sell off as investors sought to distance themselves from exposure to Brexit-related damage. **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) fell more than 3%. European banks **UBS Group** ([UBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBS)), **Royal Bank of Scotland** ([RBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBS)) and **HSBC** ([HSBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSBC)) fell sharply for a second straight day.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index plummeted 4%. Energy, cyclicals and other technology industry groups were at the bottom, too.


About the only bright spot was in utilities. Providers of electricity, water and gas did their job as purveyors of safety. The Dow utility average climbed 1.6%.

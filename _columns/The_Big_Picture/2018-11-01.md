Call the stock market's move Thursday the Hail Mary pass that turned out to be just another off-the-fingertips incompletion.




The stock market had a chance for a rare, three-day [follow-through bottoming signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), but volume fell off sharply in the final 15 minutes of trade.


Final Nasdaq volume was nearly 8% lower than Wednesday's pace.


Conclusion: The market is telling the bulls that it's just not ready to risk much at this juncture.


The Nasdaq rose 1.8%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each added 1.1%. Small caps led with a 2% pop in the S&P 600.

China Trade News
----------------


News on China appeared to fire up the U.S. indexes, but an after-hours earnings release from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) did little.


Market watchers credited a morning tweet from President Donald Trump with easing the market's fears on trade. Trump wrote that he had "a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade. Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina."


The two-day Group of 20 summit will be held Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.


Apple Results
-------------


Later, Apple reported after the close [quarterly and fiscal full-year results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-q4-2018-earnings/). Apple's 2018 fiscal year ended in September. Earnings and revenue both topped the Street's consensus view, but iPhone sales missed estimates.


Apple shares fell 7% in after-hours trade. Extended trade doesn't always match up with the next day's full session. Market watchers will be watching the reaction in Friday's session.


Apple had held up well so far in the market correction. The stock was only 5% off its Oct. 3 high at Thursday's close. But the bellwether stock figures to impact the broad market. Shares of Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), the ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100, were off 1.4% in extended trading.


Starbucks Roars
---------------


In other post-closing-bell reports, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) roared 9% higher. Starbucks topped the Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines. Same-store sales also beat views, coming in at 3% vs. estimates for 2.2%.


Starbucks is the second-largest restaurant stock by market cap â€” behind only **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)).


What To Do
----------


With the market still in correction, individual investors should keep to cash while building a short-term watch list. The short-term list should be stocks the investor would buy if the market uptrend returned and the stock broke out.


Breakouts Thursday included **Medical Properties Trust** ([MPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPW)), life sciences products provider **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) and a few thinly traded stocks.


Here are seven stocks that recently either broke out or came close to a breakout: **QuinnStreet** ([QNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QNST)), **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Monro** ([MNRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNRO)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) and the **New York Times** ([NYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NYT)).


New Highs Tally Improves
------------------------


Daily new lows have outnumbered new highs on a regular basis in this market correction. Thursday was no different. But according to preliminary data, new highs reached the highest level since IBD turned its market outlook to correction.

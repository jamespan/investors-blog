Stocks Take Trump's Fed Pick In Stride; Apple Up Late On Earnings

U.S. stock indexes struggled Thursday, and hardly moved when President Trump nominated Jerome Powell to be the next Federal Reserve chairman.




The Nasdaq closed just under the break-even line, while the S&P 500 ended just above break even. The Dow Jones industrial average and the small-cap Russell 2000 each gained 0.3%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The Powell pick was expected, but Trump's mercurial nature seldom lets expectations become easy to hold. The calm reaction of the stock market was a good sign.

The Dow has outperformed the major indexes over the past eight weeks, up about 8% vs. about 5.5% for the Nasdaq and 5% for the S&P 500. The Russell 2000 rose about 7% in the same period.


For industry groups over the past eight weeks, plastics, oil drillers, chip equipment, superregional banks and homebuilders have scored the best gains.


Retail has been the main laggard.


GOP Plan Burns Homebuilders
---------------------------


Homebuilders were under pressure Thursday because of some details in the Republican tax plan.


The plan would cap the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000, down from $1 million.



The high-end homebuilder stocks took the hardest hits. For example, **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) stabbed 6% lower. **MDC Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)) dropped 12%. Both closed low in the day's range.


Builders in the mid- to low-end of the housing market — whose customers would not be affected as much by the lower deduction — did better. **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) lost 2% and closed moderately off the day's low, and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) slipped 0.2% and closed high in the day's range.


Corporate Tax Cut
-----------------


Other aspects of the Republican tax plan include cutting the corporate tax from 35% to 20%. The plan would also eliminate for individuals the deduction for state and local taxes — effectively a tax increase.


That last proposal is expected to hit people in high-tax blue states, most of whom did not vote for Trump in the 2016 election.


While the Republican tax plan was creating turbulence, it is neither clear that the bill will pass nor is it clear what the bill will contain in its final version.


Market watchers have learned not to trust the political viability of Republican proposals. Despite holding the House, Senate and presidency, the Republicans have not been able to unite to achieve much of anything.


Change has mainly come from Trump's executive orders.


Stock Breakouts
---------------


Breakouts Thursday included payment processor **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)); insurers **Allstate** ([ALL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALL)) and **Hanover Insurance** ([THG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THG)); restaurant chain **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)); property REIT **Equinix** ([EQIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQIX)); and dealership chain **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)). All reported earnings late Wednesday or Thursday.


Stocks setting up in cup-with-handle patterns include some bank stocks: **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)). Key is No. 5 in its superregional group in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-keycorp-key.aspx) at Investors.com. Goldman Sachs is [No. 9 among money centers](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-goldman-sachs-group-inc-gs.aspx). And [Northern Trust is No. 4](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-northern-trust-corp-ntrs.aspx) in the superregional group.


Apple Earnings
--------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reported quarterly results after the market's close. Apple beat on the top and bottom lines. The stock rose 3% in after-hours trade.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims rolled in at 229,000 which was under the consensus view for 235,000.


Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported planned job cuts of 29,831 in October, below the prior month's 32,346. Through October, the year-to-date figure was the lowest since 1997. Retailers have announced the most layoffs this year.


Coming Up
---------


On Friday, the nonfarm payrolls data for October and jobless rate will be released. Two service sector indexes for October will be reported, plus factory orders for September.

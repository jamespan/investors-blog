Stocks marked a weak close Monday, reversing lower in higher volume, as Wall Street weighed more stimulus news out of China alongside weaker-than-expected economic data on the home front.


In the final trading day of February, the S&P 500 lost 0.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq gave up 0.7%.


The IBD 50 held up better than the broad market, falling just 0.3%, as names like **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)), **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) and **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) outperformed.


![MP-030116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP-030116-177x300.jpg)After the Nasdaq stalled Friday (heavy volume with little price progress), the index marked its second distribution day in a row. The S&P 500’s higher-volume decline was its first since the Nasdaq’s Feb. 17 follow-through.


After two straight closes above its 50-day moving average, the S&P 500 closed below the level Tuesday. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, crossed above its 10-week moving average Tuesday but ended below it. Both levels are important resistance areas to watch.


News of additional stimulus measures out of China to spur more lending by banks didn’t do much to help U.S. markets. But weaker-than-expected economic data might have.


Pending home sales unexpectedly fell in January while the Chicago PMI, a gauge of manufacturing activity, came in at 47.6, below the consensus estimate of 52.9.


The market might still have a defensive tone, but non-defensive areas of the market have been perking up. For example, as of Friday's close, three semiconductor-related industry groups ranked inside the top 25 of IBD's 197 industry group rankings.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), with a Composite Rating of 99, is back above its 10-week moving average as it works on a cup-shaped base. It’s only 7% off its 52-week high. The graphics-chip company shows three straight quarters of accelerating sales growth.


Meanwhile, **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) followed through after Friday’s bullish gap-up. Share rose nearly 2% in heavy volume. It’s still in a buy range from a 114.36 buy point.


Top-rated growth stocks are acting better than they have for some time, but many still are spinning their wheels, not able to make much progress. Some exposure to stocks is warranted, but a 100% bullish stance is not.

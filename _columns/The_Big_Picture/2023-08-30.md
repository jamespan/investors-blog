  Stock Market Adds Gains After New Confirmed Uptrend; This Market Pro Thinks Magnificent Seven Stocks Aren't Pricey

The stock market on Wednesday performed decently, one day after confirming a new uptrend with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-powers-higher-on-jolts-data-unlocks-this-key-shift-apple-stock/). Gains proved fairly broad. But the next crucial test arrives on Thursday.




That test comes in the form of fresh data on U.S. inflation. Namely, the PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price index, a favorite of the Federal Reserve, hits the wires before the market opens Thursday.


[According to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), forecasts are for the PCE to rise 0.2% in July vs. the prior month and go up 3.3% year over year. Core PCE, meanwhile, is seen increasing 0.2% month on month and 4.2% year over year.


As IBD readers well know, the U.S. central bank's chief, Jerome Powell, made it clear during his speech at a meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week that he and fellow members of the interest rate policy committee are firmly working toward returning inflation back to a long-term rate of 2%.


Stock Market Today: Will New Data Worry The Fed?
------------------------------------------------


Bond and equity trading desks will also watch the July personal income and spending numbers and weekly jobless claims closely early Thursday, as well as the monthly nonfarm payrolls report early Friday.


On Wednesday, the CME Group's FedWatch showed 11.5% probability of a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Sept. 20 Fed meeting and a 46.1% chance of at least a quarter-point jump in the fed funds rate (to a target range of 5.5%-5.75%) at the Nov. 1 meeting. Three Fed meetings remain this year.



Going back to the stock market, the Nasdaq composite's 0.5% advance led the day's upside. It slightly outmatches rises of 0.4% by the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500. Also, the Nasdaq's close at 14,019 pushed the index to a close back above 14,000 for the first time since Aug. 1.


Back on Aug. 1, IBD labeled the market as in a confirmed uptrend, just as it is today. However, the very next session on Aug. 2, the outlook got a downgrade to "uptrend under pressure."


At that time, the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) had risen to five each on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, considered the two most important barometers of the stock market.


Since Wednesday, however, marks the second day of a new confirmed uptrend, it would not take as much pronounced institutional selling — what IBD calls distribution days — to put the fledgling rally at serious risk of failure.

Stock Market Internals: Better?
-------------------------------




Nonetheless, the stock market is showing better technicals in tandem with the earliest signal for investors that a tradable advance is underway.


Also, equal-weighted versions of the key indexes are showing better action. For instance, Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) rose 0.3% on Wednesday for its fourth straight gain. RSP also reclaimed its 50-day moving average Wednesday.


This comes after the exchange traded fund, noted frequently on the daily [IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/), made a healthy 6.3% pullback from its 2023 peak of 155.77 on July 27.


But does the stock market show room for improvement? Definitely.


MarketSmith's "Daily Market Indicators" daily chart, which has the ticker symbol "NYEXG," notes that the 10-day moving average of stocks is making new highs on the NYSE at 26 vs. the 10-day average of 66 issues hitting new lows.


For those selecting stocks that are breaking out of bases and jetting into new highs, you'd really like to see these numbers flip.


The Nasdaq's 10-day average of new highs vs. new lows is also setting a bearish tone for now. (Go to "NASDQ" to track these figures.)


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq showed a 10-day moving average of 32 52-week or all-time highs and 195 new lows.


Also on Wednesday, the stock market saw more than 400 stocks rise on the Nasdaq vs. those that fell, early data showed. Thinkorswim showed 1,840 companies up on the Big Board and 1,136 down.

Blue Chip Update
----------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged just 0.1% higher. Solid gains by the likes of **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) ([also up sharply on Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-q32023/) issued after hours), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and three more Dow Jones stocks offset losses of 1 point or more by four other components of the 30-stock blue chip average.


Elsewhere, the Dow Jones transportation average rose almost 0.5%.


Looking at the top-performing industry groups of the day, the six groups that rallied 2% or more actually did not hail from the tech sector. They included specialty consumer products (up 2.7%), diversified operations (up 2.3%), long-term medical care (a tiny industry group, but still up 2.2%), food preparation (up 2.1%) and medical software (up 2%).


The defensive Dow utility index failed to join Wednesday's rally. Instead, it sank 0.3%. The Dow utilities are clearly underperforming growth stocks this year, down 8.8% since Jan. 1.


Institutions, meanwhile, jumped back into long-term government bonds. The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note saw its yield fall 4 basis points to 4.11%.

Are The Magnificent Seven Too Expensive?
----------------------------------------


Robert Maltbie, president and founder of small- and micro-cap research firm Singular Research, thinks many investors misunderstand the potential for further upside among the so-called "Magnificent Seven" technology stocks that make up nearly 40% of the Nasdaq's total market value. Why?


Maltbie analyzed the PEG ratio of the megacap techs, which looks at price-to-earnings ratios vs. estimated growth in earnings over the next 12 months.


Without question, these companies show on average a trailing 12-month P-E ratio of 45 times earnings. That's high. But divide that by an EPS growth estimate of 25% overall to get a PEG ratio of 1.8.


That's actually lower than the S&P 500's current PEG ratio of 2.75. (That's a historical P-E ratio of 16.5 times earnings divided by the long-term earnings-per-share growth rate of 6%).


So, a lower PEG ratio may entice institutional investors to consider establishing new positions in the Mag 7 companies or continue to build positions in them.


"All of this talk of overvaluation (in the stock market) is difficult due to the skew caused by the Magnificent Seven," Maltbie, who is also managing partner of Millennium Asset Management in Los Angeles, told IBD. "You separate that out, and the P-E ratio for the S&P 500 becomes 14 times earnings vs. 18, 19 times earnings as is commonly known."

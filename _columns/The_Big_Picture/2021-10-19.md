Investors in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) face another big load of quarterly results this week, and Tuesday's session illustrated a mixed reaction. But the major indexes mostly displayed bullish action.




And that's what you want to see just days after [Thursday's follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-powers-up-these-four-top-growth-stocks-in-or-near-buy-zones/).


The large caps ruled the roost. While the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite each rose 0.7%, titanic-size techs did a touch better. The Nasdaq 100-linked Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund advanced 0.8%, taking its quarter-to-date gain to a stout 4.9%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, seeing four of its 30 components down 1 point or more, trailed a bit. Yet its nearly 0.6% gain still outdistanced a 0.4% rise for the Russell 2000 and a 0.3% bump up by the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ETF.


Volume heated up on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and cooled on the NYSE, early data showed.


Stocks Today: Is The Rally Going Global?
----------------------------------------


U.S. equities aren't the only ones rising around the world, lately.



Following strong gains in China stock exchanges overnight, the X Trackers Harvest CSI 300 China ([ASHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASHR)) ETF barreled 2.3% higher for the day. It notched a nearly six-week high.


Are Chinese equities bottoming out? Nobody knows, but if one were to apply the [follow-through concept](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to Chinese index ETFs, it certainly appears ASHR posted a Day 8 follow-through on Sept. 30. That day, the fund rallied 1.4% in higher turnover vs. the prior day.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP102921-203x300.jpg)SPDR S&P China ([GXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GXC)), a 2.6% winner on Tuesday, jumped 2.2% in heavier volume on Oct. 13. One perhaps could note that as a seventh-day follow-through as well.


[Monday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-pads-gains-as-these-growth-stocks-break-out-broaden-uptrend/) highlighted a subtle yet important clue about how fund managers have gotten greedy in stocks today.


Take a close look at the prior four sessions by the Nasdaq composite. You'll see that each day since Oct. 13, the tech-enriched index closed at or very near its session high. Strong closes point to strong demand for stocks.


And how about Tuesday's session? No different.


A daily chart also shows a gap between Monday's intraday high of 15,026 and Tuesday's intraday low of 15,049. Such gaps are bullish.


Blue Chip Earnings News
-----------------------


On the Dow Jones' side, health care juggernaut **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) rallied nicely. Its 3.75-point gain, or up 2.3%, marked one of the stock's biggest single-day advances so far in 2021. Double-digit quarterly growth (18% EPS, 11% revenue) provided the impetus.



But JNJ's gain got offset by a 1.68-point, 1.2% drop by fellow Dow Jones component **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)). The personal care and cleaning products behemoth gapped down at the open and fell as much as 2.5% before trimming losses.


P&G's 1% dip in Q3 profit and 5% increase in sales just doesn't cut it for practitioners of [CAN SLIM investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Both stocks show a lagging [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/): a 40 for JNJ and a 42 for PG do not point to market outperformance.

Seek True Growth
----------------


Those who want to outperform the market know that selecting stocks today with outsized earnings and sales growth matters. This is why stocklists such as [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) tend to showcase companies that deliver bottom-line growth in the 25% range or higher, quarter after quarter.


Many of the companies highlighted in the accompanying Market Pulse table display superior fundamentals.


For mega-sized companies — think those with market values north of $100 billion — growth in the high teens can also be attractive for mutual funds, banks, insurers and the like to invest for the long haul, supporting strong advances.


The pullback in the market since early September offered a great opportunity for many current big winners to go into significant corrections and form new bases. The more stocks you see reclaiming their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) on their daily charts, the better. Such activity usually comes after bottoming action, in which buyers and sellers hit some form of equilibrium.


And [good breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) highlight the balance quickly shifting to net buyers.

The stock market stayed in rally mode Tuesday as the Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq marked fresh highs, ending with gains of around 0.2%. Data showed higher volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq for the second straight session.




**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) outperformed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, rising 1.3%. [New data from Apptopia](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-rises-disneyplus-streaming-service-app-hits-15-million-downloads/) showed that the Disney+ app is averaging roughly a million daily downloads since the streaming service went live two weeks ago.


The Russell 2000 picked up 0.1% after Monday's 2.1% gain in higher volume. Monday's bullish move qualified as a breakout for the small-cap index.


On Monday, a 2.3% gain for VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) and a 2.5% gain for iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) led the Nasdaq. Both exchange traded funds fared well again Tuesday. After falling 0.8% in the morning, SMH pared its loss to 0.3%. IBB, meanwhile, edged higher after Monday's breakout over a 116.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP112619-226x300.jpg)Another exchange traded fund, Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), is setting up for a possible breakout. It outpaced the broad market again Tuesday, rising 1%, as it sits just below a 35.45 handle buy point. So far this week, the IBD 50-tracking ETF is up 2%, doubling the S&P 500's performance.


VIX Near Late-July Low
----------------------


The S&P 500's Oct. 22 distribution day fell off the count Tuesday due to time. A low [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) and overall positive action in leading growth stocks are two major stock market positives. But the CBOE volatility index (often called the VIX) is still indicating a complacent stock market as it plumbs its late-July low of 11.69. The low came just ahead of a 6.8% pullback for the S&P 500.


But a low VIX reading by itself is not a signal to start raising cash. That signal will come when leading growth stocks start to fall in heavy volume and distribution days start to appear more frequently in the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Neither is happening now.

CLOSE




And market technicals are still a bullish. Consider that a 4% pullback for the Nasdaq composite would simply bring it down to its 10-week moving average, which happens to correspond pretty close to its last breakout area. A 3% pullback for the S&P 500 would take it down to its 10-week, also close to its last breakout area.


Stock Market Gainers
--------------------


It's always nice when the stock market serves up new buys on a silver platter, and that's been happening in spades lately. In fact, there are currently 21 stocks in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com), the most in a long time.



More breakouts emerged Tuesday from the likes of **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) and **Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)).


FleetCor moved from the Leaders watch list to the Leaders list when it cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 304.75 entry. It was a solid breakout, but base breakouts for Burlington Stores and Dick's Sporting Goods were even more powerful.


Burlington raced past a 209.46 buy point, while Dick's Sporting Goods gapped up over a 41.63 entry. Both companies reported earnings Tuesday. Axon continued its post-earnings move, up another 3.5%. It's still in buy range from a 75.03 buy point.

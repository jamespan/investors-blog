U.S. stock indexes Thursday delivered their best price gains since Nov. 7, when a new uptrend was confirmed in the stock market.




The Nasdaq Thursday popped 1.7%, while the S&P 500 rose 1.1%. Small caps kept pace with a 1.4% advance on the Russell 2000. Blue chips were mostly up as the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.8%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


Overall, stock market action has been indefinite and sloppy this month.


So far in November, the Nasdaq has shaved off 1%, while the S&P 500, Dow and S&P 600 have added 1% each.


As new uptrends go, this one seems to be on life support, though it isn't clear who or what is doing the supporting.

Bulls pinned their hopes on **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), even while the indexes were still in correction. For a while, that looked like a good call. At the start of November, Apple was only 6% off its high.


But Apple has dropped nearly 13% this month and is now about 18% off its high.


Many market watchers regard Apple as a market proxy or even a good stock for riding out a pullback.


Dash that hope for now.


Best Performers
---------------


The best-performing stock groups in November have included retail and wholesale car parts, up 9%; specialty retail, up 8%; drugstores, 7%; and soap, 6%.


Aggressive growth investors aren't excited by those kinds of stocks. For aggressive investors, this is a good time to calm down and work on a watch list.


On a year-to-date basis, the stock market's picture is more clear than November's view. The Nasdaq is up about 5% and the other indexes are up about 2%.


IBD's Leaderboard, though, is up 20.7% for the year, trouncing the major indexes.


Breakouts among quality stocks were nonexistent Thursday, but there were top-rated stocks approaching buy points.


They included railroad operator **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)), about 5% off its high; drugmaker **Eli Lilly & Co.** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), 3%; **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)), 7% off; **Automatic Data Processing** ([ADP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADP)), 4%; **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), 1%; **FactSet** ([FDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDS)), 3%; and **Berkshire Hathaway Class B** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)), 2%.


Warren Buffett's Moves
----------------------


Berkshire made news Thursday with its 13-F report disclosing changes in its holdings in Q3. Warren Buffett's moves naturally attract attention.


New positions for the Buffett team included **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and Brazilian play **Stone** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)).


Stocks it added to included Apple, **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)).


Berkshire's stake in **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) was reduced, and a small stake in **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) was sold in its entirety.

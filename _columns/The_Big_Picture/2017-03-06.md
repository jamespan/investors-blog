The stock market woke up a bit cranky Monday, but it was in a better mood by the close as major stock indexes pared early losses.


News that North Korea fired four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan fueled investor angst in the morning.


The Dow Jones industrial average held up the best, falling just 0.2%. It's still waging a battle at the 21,000 level after gapping above it last week. The S&P 500 gave up 0.3% after getting turned away at the 2400 level, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.4%, trimming a 0.7% intraday loss. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) held up well, falling just 0.2%.

The Russell 2000 lagged, falling 0.7%. Will continued weakness in small caps ultimately usher the market into a pullback that everyone seems to be calling for? It's too early to say but certainly it's possible. Keep in mind the index has the most to give back after a big 2016 that saw the Russell 2000 rise 19% compared withÂ a nearly 10% gain for the S&P 500.


Selling was stiff in many IBD industry groups, include department stores, miners, steel and airline stocks.


Airlines got hit on two fronts after **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) issued weak operating guidance. In addition, the Trump administration released revamped travel restrictions that call for a 90-day ban on U.S. entry for new visa seekers from six majority-Muslim nations, excluding Iraq.


Homebuilders outperformed ahead of **LGI Homes**' ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) earnings report Tuesday before the open. LGI has been trending lower since September, but a trio of homebuilders are near buy points after breakouts: **D.R Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)).


IBD's biotech group lost some ground Monday but overall continues to look good. Despite a middling RS Rating and a lagging RS line, **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) is setting up in a well-contoured flat base with a 127.10 buy point. It already topped a 122.49 alternate entry. 


The bull market that started in March 2009, confirmed March 12 when the S&P 500 soared 4% in higher volume, is approaching its eight-year anniversary. The bears are calling it a bull market that's on its last leg, while the bulls maintain it's still a good environment for corporate earnings thanks to an improving economy with low inflation and an accommodative Fed.


Someone will eventually win the argument, but for now, the risk level remains elevated for individual investors. But an elevated risk level doesn't mean a 100% cash position is warranted. Not by any means. It does mean that profits should be protected if a top-performing stock in your portfolio starts to come under heavy selling pressure.


Those with a nice gain in **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), for example, should be out of the stock by now after Nvidia started to show topping action in late December. That's when it rose to 100% above its 200-day moving average and also cleared an upper channel line, found by connecting the stock's recent highs on the weekly chart. Shares reversed hard on Dec. 28, falling nearly 7%. Volume was the heaviest for a down day in many months, an unequivocal sign of institutional selling.


Meanwhile, growth screens aren't exactly teeming with actionable prospects. There's a lot of extended stocks out there, with many breakouts or instances of support coming in lackluster volume.


Volume was heavy in **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) early Monday after shares got an upgrade from UBS to buy from neutral. UBS said the company's Q1 subscriber targets look conservative. Shares rose 2% but volume ended up being only average. Netflix is seeking support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout over a 129.39 buy point.

Sellers maintained a tight grip in the stock market Wednesday as the major indexes posted moderate to heavy losses across the board and the latest polls suggested that Donald Trump has rebounded into a dead heat for the White House with Hillary Clinton.


Volume was mixed, though.


The Nasdaq composite fell 0.9% and ended practically at session lows. At 5097.56, the tech-heavy index briefly and barely undercut its Sept. 12 low. Profit-taking in the "FANG" stocks and other big-cap techs remained intense despite their reports of strong earnings and revenue increases.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), a NYSE-listed stock, behaved the same way on Wednesday as some other tech giants. Despite reporting better than expected Q3 earnings growth (up 39%) and another solid revenue increase (+47%), the positive surprise was not good enough. The Chinese e-commerce facilitator and megacap stock swung from an early 2.9% gain on Wednesday to finish down 2.6% at 98.51. Volume more than doubled usual levels. The stock also got rejected at its 50-day moving average.


![mp110216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP110216-176x300.png)What should you do when stocks do bad things after good news?


The savvy investor knows that the market conditions are not friendly to those who wish to buy new breakouts or pullbacks to the 50-day moving average. A heavy dose of caution and a sizable wad of cash in your portfolio remain the best strategy in the near term.


The S&P 500 was not far behind the Nasdaq, dropping nearly 0.7%. For now, the large-cap index still holds a thin cushion above its still-rising 200-day moving average. (See it via an [IBD stock chart.](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY))


NYSE turnover was slightly lower, but it's sort of a moot point considering that the large-cap gauge is already saddled with eight distribution days, or sessions of heavy professional selling.


The Nasdaq, however, saw volume increase, and so the distribution count rose to nine over the past 25 sessions, the highest since mid-May, when IBD's outlook also was at "market under pressure."


While seven straight down days is not pleasant for the bulls, the nature of the current decline differs from the last time the market went into an extended slump. From Dec. 30 to Jan. 11, the Nasdaq fell for eight sessions in a row. At the Jan. 11 intraday low, the Nasdaq had dropped as much as 12.6% from its 52-week high.


That's the kind of decline that ushers in a true market correction. Indeed, the Nasdaq continued to sink. By the time the market bottomed out on Feb. 11, the Nasdaq slid to 4209, down 19.5% from its 5231 all-time peak set on July 20 last year. That's about as close as you can get to an official bear-market decline.


Fast-forward to today, the same index has so far fallen 4.6% from its new all-time peak of 5342. At most, such a decline would be called a mini-correction.


Small caps are telling a different story lately, however. The Russell 2000, down 1.1% on Tuesday, lopped off another 1.3% on Wednesday and is now 8% below its 52-week high. It would only take a few more similar sell-offs for the small-cap universe to be in what's typically called an intermediate-level correction.


Meanwhile, the market internals continue to deteriorate. Far fewer stocks are making new highs lately. Gains from recent breakouts have either been modest or disappearing. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been falling for more than five straight weeks. The NYSE's line also peaked roughly five weeks ago. (Please see the NYSE advance-decline line, within the S&P 500's daily chart on the General Market page, via the link at the bottom of this article.)


While no one expected the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to raise short-term interest rates, it still appeared to keep the door open for a potential increase at its final meeting of the year, on Dec. 13-14. In its policy statement, the U.S. central bank acknowledged that "inflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year" but still sees it falling short of its 2% longer-run target.


At the same time, the Fed wants to wait "for some further evidence" that the case for raising the cost of money is justified. Given that Wednesday's ADP private sector job report for October badly missed Wall Street's views (147,000 net new jobs vs. an estimated 170,000, according to Econoday), all eyes will be fixed on Friday's payrolls report, which includes public sector employment.


Investor psychology remains somewhat pessimistic, which is good for bull markets. Bullishness among newsletter editors polled by Investors Intelligence fell to 41.7% this week, down sharply from 47.1% in the prior week. Bears edged up to 24.3% from 23.1%. The remainder, or 34%, see the market going into an intermediate correction. Too many bulls typically means there are no more people willing to invest at current prices.


And as seen in IBD's [Psychological Market Indicators](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) section at Investors.com (look under the Market Trend on the main navigation bar), the put-call volume ratio has jumped sharply above 1.15, a level historically seen when the market tends to rebound from an oversold state.

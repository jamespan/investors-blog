In the early going Tuesday, the stock market felt like the calm before the storm as indexes traded in a tight range with manageable losses. But it didn't take long for sellers to gain the upper hand ahead of an important policy statement from the Federal Reserve due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.




After two straight closes near session highs, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied off lows again. But both indexes undercut their Friday lows, falling 1.1% and 1%, respectively. The Nasdaq composite held above Friday's low but closed in the bottom half of the day's range, falling nearly 1%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and preliminary data showed NYSE volume coming in a tad lower than Monday.


Breadth was slightly negative on the Nasdaq Monday when the index rallied 0.8%. It was negative again Tuesday, with losers beating winners by about 2.5-to-1. On the NYSE, the ratio was nearly 5-to-1 negative.


Stock Market Eyes Fed Decision
------------------------------


[Fed funds futures traders](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) are expecting the Fed to raise its key lending rate by 75 basis points Wednesday to a range of 3% to 3.25%. They're also leaning toward another 75-basis-point hike at the November meeting, although there will be a lot of economic data to parse before then.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP092022-245x300.jpg)The Fed has to raise interest rates to fight inflation. But the stock market's fear right now is that if the Fed is too aggressive with rate hikes, it could throw the U.S. economy into a prolonged recession. Corporate earnings would also suffer as a result. The Fed, and stock market bulls, are holding out hope for a soft landing for the U.S. economy. But the stock market isn't convinced.


**Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) late Monday warned that Q3 supply chain costs would be $1 billion higher than initial expectations. The news comes on the heels of warnings last month from **Micron** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), as well as **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) late last week.

The 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 3.56% just after the stock market close, up 7 basis points. The yield hit a high of 3.6%, its highest level since April 2011.


Amid expectations for a hawkish statement, the stock market may not like what the Fed has to say Wednesday. A tradable rally could ultimately lift the Nasdaq back to the 12,000 level. But it's still a market under distribution, so a trip to the June lows could also be in the cards.


The stock market still has weak sentiment working in its favor. According to the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers, bullish sentiment dropped off a cliff two weeks ago to 29.7%. It increased last week to 32.4%, but that's still a relatively small percentage of bulls. Bullish sentiment was at 30.1% in March 2020 just ahead of a big stock market rally.


But the number of actionable stock setups remains in short supply as institutions generally watch from the sidelines. This makes it tough to make money on the long side.


Stocks To Watch
---------------


Right when it looked like oil and gas stocks were ready to provide some market leadership, many leading stocks in the sector have fallen back to test support levels. **Comstock Resources** ([CRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRK)) soared to a new high last week, but two straight heavy-volume price declines have brought the stock down to its nearly converged 10-day and 21-day moving averages.



**Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) looked ready to clear a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) last week, but sellers have knocked the stock down to its 50-day line.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), sellers hit **Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) for the fourth straight session after the oil and gas producer climbed above a 33.60 buy point last week. It's still holding above the 50-day line.


But a few stock market leaders like **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), **Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) and **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)) continue to show strength and support after bullish price gains. If these leaders start to buckle, it would be an ominous sign.


3 Financials To Watch
---------------------



Meanwhile, financial stocks like **Raymond James** ([RJF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RJF)), **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)) and **M&T Bank** ([MTB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTB)) have [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) near highs.


LPLA has been moving sideways above its 10-week moving average after clearing a 15-week consolidation in early August. Raymond James Financial is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 111.51 buy point. Meanwhile, a flat base for M&T shows a 193.52 entry.

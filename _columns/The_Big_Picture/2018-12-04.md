Stocks Plunge On Yield-Curve Shift, Forcing Change In Stock Market Outlook
===========================================================================

Once in a while, a significant development in the government debt markets makes an extraordinary impact on stocks. IBD readers might remember Tuesday as such a day.




On Tuesday, the U.S. government bond arena caused quite a buzz on Wall Street. A [section of the yield curve showed a slight inversion](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/treasury-yield-curve-inverts-dow-jones-dives/), namely between relatively short-duration two- and three-year notes and the relatively longer five-year note. At one point in the session, a 2.78% yield on the five-year note dropped under a 2.80% yield on the shorter two-year note. In other words, it made less sense for investors to hold the longer-dated bond for a specific return.


Meanwhile, other areas of the Treasury yield curve showed more extreme flattening action. And this development spooked investors.


Small caps got throttled by sellers on Tuesday, as the Russell 2000 fell 4.4%. The S&P SmallCap 600 dropped 4.6% and posted its lowest price close since Oct. 24. Large caps fell less, yet provided little if any comfort. The S&P 500 sank 3.2%, while the Nasdaq composite lost 3.8%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MP_1x1_120418-201x300.jpg)The broad and deep sell-off, combined with a shortage of fresh breakouts by high-quality growth stocks, triggered a downgrade in the current outlook for the U.S. stock market to "uptrend under pressure." This means IBD readers should be ready to sell more positions to raise cash and [avoid round trips in their winners](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/). New buys warrant extra caution.


High Volatility In Stocks Returns
---------------------------------


Just four days ago, on Nov. 28, a [solid follow-through by the Nasdaq composite](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-cheers-powell-remarks-bottoming-signal/) prompted a change to "confirmed uptrend" after equities spent a little more than a week in correction mode.


At 7158, the Nasdaq composite now stands 12% below its 8133 peak. Such a level indeed is tantamount to a market that is in an intermediate correction.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped 3.5%. At 30.40, the ETF is now down 8% since the start of the year after a 34% rally in 2017.


Indeed, few growth stocks are showing the type of mettle that project collaboration software firm **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), showcased in the [latest Sector Leaders column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/top-software-stock-atlassian-sector-leader/), reveals in its chart. Atlassian, trading 12% off its high, is building the right side of a [potential new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Volume rose on both major exchanges. On the Nasdaq, the increase was tiny. Was it related to the fact that the U.S. stock markets will close Wednesday in honor of the late former president George H.W. Bush? Hard to know. Yet even if the Nasdaq's turnover had fallen from Monday's session, the size of the declines and the willingness among institutions to sell a wide range of growth and cyclical stocks gave a strong clue that not everyone on the Street is a buyer with conviction.



Meanwhile, Tuesday's slippery slide follows a failure by both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to show strength around the key 50-day moving average. Just a day earlier, the former finished below its 50-day moving average and the latter closed above its 50-day line. Now, both are back below the 50-day.


The market seemed to drop on other news as well. President Donald Trump noted that he is a "Tariff Man" if the U.S. and China cannot continue progress on free trade within the next 90 days. Investors are closely watching developments of whether the U.K. can pass a Brexit deal through Parliament, including the possibility of a no-deal exit from the European Union and a new election.


This Sector Can't Catch A Break Yet
-----------------------------------


Banks of all colors and stripes fell hard. If you looked at the weekly charts of the biggest firms — from **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), to a large array of regional lenders — it would paint a pretty dismal picture of the future. All of these are trading anywhere from 18% to 33% below their 52-week highs. In other words, don't expect these names or most of their peers to join the market leadership anytime soon.


No doubt, interest-rate margins are likely getting squeezed in recent weeks for the banking sector. The spread between three-month bills and 10-year notes has narrowed sharply now, to around 50 basis points. It was more than a full percentage point (102 basis points) on Jan. 1. The 10-year fell to as low as 2.88% or 2.89%, the lowest since around Sept. 7. Look at the latest yields of the benchmark two-year and 10-year notes, and the spread has been squashed to around 12 basis points.


One Institutional Money Manager's View On Treasuries
----------------------------------------------------


"While this is not an indicator of an immediate recession, it does signal that the U.S. economy is in the later stage of the business cycle," Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, told IBD in an email in regard to the slight inversion in the two- to three-year and five-year section of the yield curve.


"With regards to an inverted Treasury yield curve signaling a recession, the Fed believes a more appropriate indicator would be the spread between three-month Treasury Bills and 10-year Treasury notes," Ripley added. "Thus, while the inversion between the two-year and five-year point of the Treasury curve is notable, the spread between three-month Treasury bills and the 10-year U.S. Treasury is still 50 basis points, and it could be many months before we see that point of the curve invert."


Defensive Sectors Edge Higher
-----------------------------


The Dow Jones utility average stood out on the upside, gaining nearly 0.2%.


Gold and silver mining stocks also bucked the drop as futures in the underlying precious metals rose.

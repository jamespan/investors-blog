  Stock Market Falls Ahead Of Fed, Earnings, Jobs Risks This Week; A Hopeful Sign From History

An eagerly-awaited Fed meeting, January's nonfarm payrolls report and Q4 tech earnings have converged into a treacherous week for the stock market. Indexes stalled Monday, trying to digest the new challenges.




The Nasdaq composite — and tech stocks — led the way down with a 2% tumble. On Friday, the composite closed above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) for the first time in more than a year. On Monday, that conquest proved short-lived as it closed right back below the line.


The S&P 500 fell 1.3% but is holding above the 4,000 level and its own 200-day average.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.8%. Resistance around 34,000 looks more apparent after Monday's decline. But the Dow remains above its 50- and 200-day lines, leaving it in better shape than other indexes. The IBD 50 index fell 2.2%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq by nearly 20% and moderately less in the NYSE. That signaled restraint in institutional selling orders. It also meant the stock market avoided another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Indexes have crossed important barriers this month.


IBD has raised its recommended exposure as resistance levels have broken, now lifting to the current 60%-80%. But indexes don't have much room above support levels and must now hold their newly-conquered beachheads.


This week is fraught with risk that could push stock back into the water. But if the stock market can pass those tests, investors should prepare to raise exposure.


Big Tests For Stock Market
--------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP013023-238x300.jpg)The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and will release the next policy statement Wednesday afternoon. The [consensus among traders](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) is for a quarter-point rate hike.


Wall Street is worrying about what comes next.


Will inflation hawks prevail or will the Fed indicate its ready to halt rate hikes? The tone could set the stock market's course for the rest of the week.


While nearly 900 companies are reporting earnings this week, a handful of pillar names stand out. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) posts results Tuesday.


In what could be called Super Thursday, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) announce after the close. Those three companies account for roughly one-fourth of the Nasdaq's total weighting.


**Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) [report this week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), all with the potential for ripple effects.


Friday's January employment report caps off a volatile week.


Economists [expect the labor market to cool](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559258&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top), with a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 3.6% and job gains of 185,000. Better-than-expected numbers could tell the Fed to keep raising rates.

Homebuilders Fall In Heavy Volume
---------------------------------


Homebuilders were broadly lower Monday. **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)), **M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)), **Taylor Morrison** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) and **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) were among the stocks down in heavy volume.


There were no sell signals in the group, But after weeks of showing strength, the high volume selling threatens to disrupt the industry's leadership.



Breakouts for **Now** ([DNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNOW)), **SPX Technologies** ([SPXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPXC)) and **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)) fizzled. **Academy Sports & Outdoors** ([ASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASO)) closed above its 56.73 buy point from a cup with handle. Volume was weak, however.


Historical Pattern Favors Stocks
--------------------------------


Is there a bright side for the stock market?


Yes, at least in a historical pattern. The Nasdaq is on pace to end the month with a gain of about 9% and the S&P 500 is up 4.6%, with just one day left in January.


Research by Yale Hirsch and the Stock Trader's Almanac found the market will follow S&P 500 January performance. In other words, when the S&P rises in January, the index will more likely end the year higher. The indicator is right 72% of the time.


The January Barometer, as the Almanac calls it, tracked this tendency back more than 70 years, to 1950.

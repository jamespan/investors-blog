Small Caps Edge Up In Mixed Trading; Here's Why The Dow Jones Industrial Average Is Now Down In 2023
=====================================================================================================

Small caps edged ahead in a truly mixed session on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 0.3%, pushing further into negative territory for the year.




In a sense, Wall Street's activity reflected the mixture of views expressed among leaders of the U.S. central bank during its latest meeting on how much more monetary tightening is necessary to trim inflation.


The Russell 2000 recouped just a small fraction of Tuesday's 3% shellacking. Yet its 0.3% rebound proved the biggest among the major indexes.


Dow Jones Industrial Average Today
----------------------------------


The S&P 500 traded in a fairly tight range of around 1% during the session before finishing down less than 0.2%. The 500 briefly flirted with its rising 50-day moving average on Wednesday and closed above it for the 23rd session in a row.


Some sector indexes did worse. The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.6%, while the Dow utilities closed off almost 0.5%.


Breadth was slightly negative on the Nasdaq, according to early data. But on the NYSE, winners edged out losers by more than 250 issues.


Plus, as the Market Pulse table shows, positive action among current leaders in the stock market today bent toward smaller issues.

Revenge Of The Small Caps
-------------------------


**NerdWallet** ([NRDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NRDS)), up in five of the past seven sessions and rising in 13 of the past 16 trading days, weighs in at $1.4 billion with 74 million shares outstanding.


**Orion Engineered Carbons** ([OEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OEC)), which has galloped past the 20%-to-25% profit-taking zone after clearing a 19.47 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/), holds a market value of $1.5 billion amid 61 million shares outstanding.


On the other spectrum of the stock market, you've got 30 blue chips that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. At 33,045, the popular gauge is now down 0.3% for the year. Why has the index lost all of its decent January gains and more?


Keep in mind that as a price-weighted average, the Dow Jones industrials get swayed more by member companies that trade north of 100 per share. So, a lower-priced stock that moves up or down much more on a percentage basis tends to have less impact.


The most expensive stock on the Dow Jones now?


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) is the costliest. It finished Wednesday down nearly 0.5% at 489.41. A daily chart shows how the stock has been caught in a mini-downtrend since losing support at the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) on Jan. 4. The 50-day moving average, meanwhile, has slumped below the longer-term 200-day line.


High-Priced Names In The Dow Jones Today
----------------------------------------



**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), the second most expensive stock on the Dow Jones by share price, has formed a [new cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). However, the stock is now trying to hold support at the 50-day line. The relative strength line has a long way to go to potentially eclipse the peak in November since the new base began taking shape. And **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), which plunged 7% and took out its 200-day moving average following lackluster January-quarter results, made an unsatisfying rebound on Wednesday, up only 0.3%.


HD shows a feeble [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) of 37 and the stock has fallen 6.2% since Jan. 1.


[According to MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), the median RS Rating among the 30 Dow Jones stocks is 46; that's as appetizing as eating cold spaghetti or limp udon noodles while sitting on a windswept park bench in winter. Just five of the 30 blue chips hold an RS score of 80 or higher; they include **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)). However, two of the four have fallen through the 10-week moving average, generally a no-no among leading stocks.



AmEx is crafting a long [saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-predict-breakout-with-saucer-with-handle-base-chart-pattern-amazon/) that shows a 182.25 entry point.


Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) mustered only a 0.1% rebound. That was enough to stop a three-session slide. But the midcap index lost 3.2% over that sell-off. MDY is handily outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a 7.3% gain year to date.


Still, the meek rebound following recent heavy losses should not be surprising, given the recent spate of institutional-quality sell-offs racked up by the key averages in recent weeks. Wednesday's overall weak action corresponds with an uptrend newly under significant selling pressure.

The Future Of Interest Rates
----------------------------



On Wednesday, market observers awaited the minutes from the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting on interest rate policy. They were keen to tease out more details on exactly how many more Federal Reserve officials believe the bank should resume a pace of raising interest rates at a pace of 50 basis points (half a percentage point) instead of slowing to 25 basis points per meeting.


All in all, they discovered that the majority felt strongly about sticking with the smaller bumps higher while watching to see whether future economic data reflected any success in bringing inflation closer to an ultimate long-term target of 2%.


After the minutes hit the news wires at around 2 p.m. ET, the major indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, stayed mostly rangebound. This indicated that both Wall Street and the central bank itself want to see more evidence of either inflation coming down sharply or gradually. The rate of increases will mostly likely determine whether the "terminal rate" is still well above the current fed funds target range of 4.5%-4.75% or relatively close.


Thus, [Friday's PCE report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), a key component of the monthly report on personal income and spending, gains even more importance in the policy debate.


What Bond Traders Think Now
---------------------------


"The main takeaway is that the Fed is determined to free up some slack in the labor market, to ensure that inflation doesn't get entrenched at its current high level," Bill Adams, chief economist at Dallas-based Comerica Bank, wrote in a note sent to IBD.


"The economy might return to a more normal degree of job market slack by an increase in labor supply, by say, increases in labor market participation of older workers, caregivers, or higher immigration — that's a soft landing," Adams wrote. "Or the the supply side might disappoint and they would have to slow the economy enough to free up labor market slack without a meaningful further increase in labor supply — that's a hard landing. But either way, a less-tight job market is their aim."


Adams added that Comerica sees three more quarter-point rate hikes in the federal funds target rate during the March, May and June meetings, then keep it there through the end of the year. That would lift fed funds to 5.25%-5.5%.


The latest CME Group Fed Watch survey shows a 73% probability of a quarter-point hike at the March 22 meeting, a 72% chance of a third quarter-point rise at the May 3 FOMC gathering, and a roughly 75% likelihood of at least another 25-basis-point jump at the June 14 meeting. All in all, this points to a target rate of 5.25%-5% by early summer.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond fell 3 basis points to 3.92% after hitting a year-to-date high of 3.96% on Tuesday.

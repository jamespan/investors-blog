Stock Uptrend Comes Under Pressure; Reactions Get Nasty
========================================================

Stocks ran into a bout of vicious selling Friday, as the bulls failed to put up much of a fight.


The Nasdaq severed 3.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 chopped off 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively.


The IBD 50 flopped 4%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell on the NYSE.


The day's action constituted distribution on the Nasdaq, but the S&P 500 escaped because of lower volume.

Still, the negativity was sufficient to shift IBD's market outlook to uptrend under pressure.


With the uptrend under pressure, caution becomes important. Do not let losses run beyond 8%. Sell before a winner turns into a losing position. Take profits where appropriate.


If this sounds suspiciously like the advice for a market correction, well consider the number of quality breakouts that have occurred since the Nasdaq's Jan. 20 low.


Of about a dozen and a half breakouts among stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or better, not one was above its 5% buy zone, as of Friday's close.


Until that situation changes, there isn't anything for a disciplined growth investor to buy.


The tone of the market is getting nasty. Extreme selling reactions are becoming too common.


Visualization company **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) careened 49% Friday after cutting its forecast for Q1 and the full year.


**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) stormed 44% lower Friday on a weak revenue forecast.


**Lions Gate Entertainment** ([LGF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGF)) slid 27% after missing on the top and bottom lines.


When a stock loses a quarter to half of its value on one day's bad news, the market is making a sick joke of pricing discovery.


The previous session's action also showed extreme sell-offs.


Upscale apparel marketer **Ralph Lauren** ([RL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RL)) dropped 22% after missing on revenue and slashing its outlook.


Retailer **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) slid 19% on weak guidance.


Dividend stocks are outperforming growth stocks for now. However, growth investors should resist the temptation to switch strategies. Cash is safer than chasing yields.


Oil explorer **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) illustrated the risks. On Dec. 10, CEO Ryan Lance called the dividend "the highest priority use of our cash." On Thursday, the company slashed the quarterly payout from 74 cents a share to 25 cents a share. The stock dropped more than 8% Thursday and about 7% Friday.


For the week, the IBD 50 plunged 6.5%; the Nasdaq, 5.4%; and the S&P 500, 3.1%.

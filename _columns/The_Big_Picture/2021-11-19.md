  Dow Jones Slips, But Surging Tech Stocks Boost Nasdaq To A New High

A tech stock resurgence boosted the Nasdaq to a new high Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out the week with a loss. Covid-related worries are resurfacing again, hitting some sectors.




On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.4% to deliver its first close above the 16,000 level. The S&P 500 edged 0.1% lower, while the Dow Jones industrials gave up more than 0.7%.


Information technology and utilities were among the few sectors leading the S&P 500. Energy, down 4%, was the biggest loser as European countries' lockdowns sent oil prices lower. Light sweet crude prices fell nearly 4% to about $76 a barrel. Financials, real estate and health care also lagged.


Coronavirus cases have spiked again in parts of the U.S. and Europe. In Europe, stocks fell broadly after [Austria ordered lockdowns](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-surge-prompts-renewed-lockdown-in-parts-of-europe-11637267293?mod=article_inline) and other countries appeared ready to follow suit.

Tech Stocks To Watch
--------------------


They include **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).


Adobe cleared the 659.29 buy point of a cup with handle during the week. The stock pulled back after breaking out Nov. 4, but didn't trigger a sell signal. It's now slightly extended from the entry. The [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock's latest pattern is third stage, which means gains may be smaller than from earlier bases.


Atlassian, up 85% this year, is trading near record highs as it advances along its 50-day moving average. Salesforce is extended from a 275.32 cup-with-handle entry.


The global chip shortage is boosting demand, fueling big gains in chip stocks. **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) surged nearly 8% Friday, retaking its 200-day line for the first time since August. It also marked the stock's biggest percentage gain this year.


Evercore ISI on Friday added Micron to its "top picks" list as memory industry trends improve, [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-stock-heads-for-best-day-in-a-year-after-its-dubbed-a-top-pick-at-evercoreit-is-game-on-for-memory-11637338382) reported.


On the biotech front, **BioMarin Pharmaceutical** ([BMRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMRN)) soared 10% to a 10-month high after winning Food and Drug Administration approval for its [dwarfism treatment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biomarin-stock-surges-why-its-next-launch-could-be-among-its-biggest/) in children as young as 5.


What To Do Now
--------------


The stock market's performance was mostly positive Friday, as the Nasdaq finally got past resistance at the 16,000 level. The S&P 500, which continues to hit resistance near 4,700, closed with a minor loss. But the Dow and the small-cap Russell 2000 fell about 0.8% each.


Institutional selling remains low, with one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq and three for the S&P 500.


So investors can still buy leading growth stocks that break out of sound bases. But be aware that many are becoming extended.


Three notable tech giants breaking out during the week included Adobe, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). Apple remains in buy range up to 160.93. Amazon is also in buy range, which tops out at 3,785.83.


The IBD 50 has seen some volatile action among leaders such as Roblox, **SiTime** ([SITM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SITM)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)). But these are all extended, leaving fewer new breakouts to buy.


Among growth stocks, the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) made a new high, outpacing the growth-focused Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which fell 0.6%.

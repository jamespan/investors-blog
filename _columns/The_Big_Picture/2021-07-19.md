Stock Market Falls Hard, Bonds Rise Amid Economic Worries; DocuSign, Nvidia Show Strength
==========================================================================================

The stock market fell sharply Monday, hurt by another big drop in the 10-year Treasury yield, which plunged 11 basis points to 1.18%, its lowest level since February.




The stock market didn't like it when the 10-year yield surged past 1.75% in March. At the time, the bond market was worried about inflation. Now, the focus has shifted from inflation to the underlying health of the U.S. economy and the prospects for a slowdown.


Airlines and cruise operators fell hard, weighed down by concern over further travel restrictions as a result of the spreading delta coronavirus variant.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite closed off lows after falling 1.7% early. The index fell 1.1%, but the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) fared better and closed near its session high. It lost just 0.8%, buoyed by strength in Nasdaq 100 stocks like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)).


![MP071921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP071921-228x300.jpg)Nvidia came down to its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) and found support ahead of its 4-for-1 stock split Tuesday. DocuSign is getting support at its 21-day exponential moving average. Both stocks are members of [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


The S&P 500 gave back 1.6% and is currently testing support at its 50-day moving average. The 50-day line had been a support level ever since the index confirmed a new uptrend in early November with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gapped below its 50-day moving average, falling 2.1%. Eight components fell 3% or more, including **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)), which looked poised to clear a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) last week. Dividend-paying stocks had a tough day, with the iShares Select Dividend ETF ([DVY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVY)) down 2.2% in huge volume.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) officially entered an intermediate-term correction by falling more than 10% off its high. The iShares Transportation Average ETF ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) is also in an intermediate-term correction. The Russell 2000 ETF slipped 1.4% as it nears a test of its 200-day moving average. The transportation ETF closed near its session high but still lost 1.7%.



Volume rose from Friday's levels, resulting in another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. IBD on Friday lowered its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure," which calls for greater caution with stocks.


Yellow Flags Were Out There
---------------------------


It was a harsh day of selling Monday, but the selling shouldn't have come as a big surprise because yellow flags have been out there for a while. Breadth had been weakening for a while on the Nasdaq, and bullish sentiment has been at extreme levels for two weeks in row (above 60%) , according to the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers. It's a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.


Couple that with a frothy IPO market, plus the fact that the Nasdaq 100 was getting extended from its 50-day line, and some selling was to be expected.


Breadth was weak again in the stock market Monday, with losers beating winners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1. Losers trounced winners on the NYSE by around 5-to-1.



If you own growth stocks like DocuSign, **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)) and **Workiva** ([WK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WK)), there's no reason to sell â€” not as all three hold support at their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). But it is the time to be playing defense and getting rid of lackluster performers.


If profits are dwindling in some nice winners, start by taking partial profits. If you do decide to nibble at a stock that's acting well, have an exit strategy in case the stock market weakens further.


Above all else, keep a watchlist of stocks holding up well that could be ready to take advantage of newfound stock market strength. **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) reversed higher above the 400 level as it forms a cup-with-handle base.


IBD 50 Outperforms
------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped 2.9% but recovered for a gain of 0.1%. The IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks got a lift from another big day for **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), which jumped 9.5%. **Bill.com** ([BILL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILL)) and **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) reversed higher above their 21-day lines, up 3.6% and 2.8% respectively.

Oil and gas stocks sold off after OPEC and a Russia-led group of big producers agreed to increase production by 400,000 barrels a day each month through the end of 2022. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures settled at $66.42 a barrel, down 7.5%.


Some of the worst performers in the [MarketSmith 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) were oil and gas producers like **Laredo Petroleum** ([LPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPI)), **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) and **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)).


All three stocks fell hard last week and closed below their 10-week moving averages.

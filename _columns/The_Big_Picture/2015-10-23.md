Stocks caught a fast ride Friday, with the Nasdaq speeding past two expected areas of resistance as if they were nothing. The Nasdaq popped 2.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively.

  

The IBD 50 lagged with a 0.7% gain.

  

Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell on the NYSE.

  

Just about every good thing that could've happened Friday did happen to the bulls' satisfaction. Consider:

  

•Strong quarterly reports from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) after Thursday's close hinted at big gains Friday. All three stocks delivered, gapping up in heavy volume.

  

•The Nasdaq and S&P 500 retook their 200-day moving averages, and the Nasdaq's gap-up boosted it above the 5,000 level as well. The 5,000 level represents potential resistance because the Nasdaq fought a battle there from March to August.

  

A fight at the 5,000 area could still develop in the coming week because the Nasdaq has only a small cushion above that level.

  

•Daily combined new highs crossed above 200 for the first time since early August.

  

•The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for October topped the Street's consensus number. This lessened some of the recent worry surrounding weak manufacturing data.

  

•Breakouts have been fairly steady. On Friday, stocks breaking out included Alphabet (both A and C shares); tech services provider **Luxoft** ([LXFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LXFT)); and auto-parts store chain **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)).

  

•The Oct. 6 distribution day fell off the Nasdaq's count because of price gains, which is the best way to erase distribution.

  

•China announced an interest-rate cut Friday, lifting hopes for the world economy. This followed Thursday's remarks from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi that suggested more stimulus was coming.

  

While all this made for a nice gift package for the bulls, the bears still have a few things in their favor.

  

Chief among them is uncertainty and tentativeness from the Federal Reserve.

  

The Fed will meet Tuesday and Wednesday. An interest rate hike isn't expected, but the October huddle will be the last before December's meeting.

  

Dozens of earnings report are due out in the coming week — another potential risk.

  

At this juncture, three weeks after the Oct. 2 follow-through confirmed that an uptrend was underway, IBD-style investors should have considerable exposure. An individual investor could be sitting on some decent gains by now.

  

Being in a position to let the winners run is the ideal situation. But investors should keep watch on the charts.

  

Sell signals are found on the charts. The fundamentals are more relevant to buying than selling.

  

Be ready to sell — either to take profits at 20% to 25% because most stocks begin to consolidate after such a run, or to limit losses to 8% and under. Keeping losses small is crucial to sound portfolio management.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq chalked up a 3% gain; the Dow, 2.5%; the S&P 500, 2.1%; the small-cap S&P 600, 0.7%; and the IBD 50, 0.1%.

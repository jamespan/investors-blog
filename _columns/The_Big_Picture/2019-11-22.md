Mild gains on Friday failed to wipe away weekly losses for major equity indexes. However, the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) improved, as an Oct. 18 decline in higher volume on the S&P 500 expired on time.




Neither the White House nor the Chinese government offered substantive news defusing a Thursday Reuters report that a trade deal could be delayed until early 2020. But after rising six weeks in a row, accumulating a 5.7% gain in the process, the S&P 500 lost a skimpy 0.3% for the week. The Nasdaq composite, up 7.6% in the prior seven weeks, also lost 0.3%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell less than 0.3% Friday, down 0.7% for the week.


With less than six full weeks of trading left in 2019, let's consider seven reasons why Wall Street may keep its bullish direction.


**Reason 1:** [Breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) are working. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) has risen 5% past a 142.47 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)), [a half position on IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), has rallied 15% from its buy point. Other stocks posting double-digit gains since moving past buy points, including surges off the 10-week moving average? Check out **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)).

**Reason 2:** [Sharp-looking chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) are forming and more breakouts are occurring. **Cornerstone OnDemand** ([CSOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSOD)) cleared a [cup-with-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 60.40. **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)) and [recent IBD Live showcase](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=icmhpbrdcstmsg|cms|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|707596&src=A00387A) **Axon** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)) are constructing [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) is near a 323.30 entry.


Stocks Today And The Overall Market Picture
-------------------------------------------


**Reason 3:** Market internals look bullish. Over the five sessions through Thursday, the ratio of stocks marking new highs (626) vs. new lows (291) exceeded 2-to-1. The Nasdaq has finished the week above its 50-day moving average seven weeks straight. Meanwhile, defensive utilities have lagged. The Dow Jones utility average has slumped 3.1% for the quarter.


One small concern? The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has dipped for more than two weeks. That does not break a long-term uptrend, though.


**Reason 4:** Investor sentiment is not overly giddy. The [Investor Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter pundits](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) shows a 57.2% bullish ratio. That's certainly elevated, but not quite at the 60%-plus levels in recent years that presaged a significant market correction. On Friday, the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) hit 0.8.


Stocks Today: Inflation, Interest Rates Benefit Equities
--------------------------------------------------------


**Reason 5:** Inflation and the cost of money remain tame. In IBD Weekly, the Reuters-Jefferies CRB broad index of commodities shows less than a 7% gain year to date. That severely lags the major averages. The yield curve has improved. Ten-year U.S. Treasuries yield a skimpy 1.77%.


**Reason 6**: Economic data keeps a bullish tint. The Philly Fed manufacturing survey for November crushed the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) (10.4 actual vs. 7 estimate). The Leading Economic Indicators index fell 0.1% in October, vs. views for a 0.2% drop.


**Reason 7:** The earnings picture remains bright. Ed Yardeni Research sees a 5.5% pickup in profits for S&P 500 firms in 2020 and a 5.2% gain in 2021. Even the banking sector looks decent. Analysts on consensus see Q4 profit at **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) up 16% to $2.30 a share, then cooling in Q1 (flat), Q2 (down 5%) and Q3 (up 2%) in 2020.


[In the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), the median Q4 EPS estimate calls for a 20.5% rise year-over-year.

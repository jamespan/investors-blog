The Nasdaq composite led a powerful retort to stock market bears Wednesday, posting its best day in more than five months. Notably, most of the gains came before the Federal Reserve suggested an interest-rate cut might be in the cards for September.




The Nasdaq jumped 2.6%. It was its best single-day performance since the index surged 3% on Feb. 22. But the Nasdaq still faces a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average.


Late Tuesday, a Nasdaq rally seemed like a fantasy after **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) slid on [softer growth for its Azure](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-ai-chip-stocks-diverge-on-capex-report/) cloud computing business. Microsoft shares fell more than 3% in extended trading but ended up losing only 1.1% by the end of Wednesday's regular session.


Other major stocks more than offset Microsoft's loss. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) soared nearly 13% after Morgan Stanley [named it a top pick](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-2/). The chip designer's market cap swelled by $326.9 billion on the stock market Wednesday, the largest one-day increase in history, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rebounded nearly 5%, while **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) climbed more than 3%. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) rose 2.5% ahead of its earnings report and added more than 4% in extended trading.


After closing just below the 50-day moving average Tuesday, the S&P 500 jumped right back above that crucial line, as well as the 5,500 level.


Surely, major index gains in higher volume are a sign that institutional investors are devouring as much stock as they can. It was interesting that the Nasdaq had already climbed more than 2.5% before the Fed headlines started to roll in.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP073124.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2%, extending its outperformance for the month. It jumped 4.4% in July, beating the S&P 500's 1.1% gain. The Nasdaq closed the month with a loss of nearly 0.8%.


The Russell 2000 added more than 10% for July. *(An earlier version of this story incorrectly said the Russell rose 0.5%  in July.)*


Stock Market Outlook Improves
-----------------------------


Wednesday's index action was persuasive. Thus, IBD raised its recommended exposure level from a range of 40%-60% to a range of 60%-80%.


That means investors should relax their guard some, and buy carefully selected stocks at [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/). Keep in mind, this is not the most bullish recommended exposure, so remain vigilant for sell signals.


The stock market often has moved in a dichotomy in which growth lags when value rises, and vice versa. That leaves the chance of an unexpected turn.


The Dow and S&P 500 have moved in opposite directions 41 times so far this year, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That's the most days the two indexes have diverged ever recorded in that time frame. The indexes should surpass the prior full-year record of 45 days made back in 2000.


If Wednesday was the day the stock market got back on track with its uptrend, there weren't many breakouts among top-rated stocks.


**Johnson Controls** ([JCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCI)) faded badly after topping a 74.23 buy point following its earnings report. **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)), **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) and **Teva Pharmaceuticals** ([TEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEVA)) had limp action around buy points. Investment management firm **Carlyle Group** ([CG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CG)), however, held above its 48.52 buy point.


While the record on July breakouts is mixed, some leaders are in follow-on buy areas, such as **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)).


Oddly, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) had climbed as much as 1.8% but closed only 0.1% higher.


Fed Gives Stock Market Bulls More To Cheer
------------------------------------------


The Fed gave a nod to an interest-rate cut in its [policy statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240731a.htm) and in Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press briefing.


Powell said [a rate cut in September](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-powell-september-fed-rate-cut-sp-500/) "could be on the table." While he added that economic data will determine the final outcome, the panel discussed a rate cut in its meeting.


Powell's details emboldened stock market bulls even more, although much of the post-announcement rally faded by the close.


Job gains have moderated, the committee said in its statement. At the June meeting, labor market gains had "remained strong." In another hint it is less concerned about inflation, the Fed said inflation goals "continue to move into better balance." In June, the view was that goals had moved "toward better balance."


The 10-year Treasury yield was volatile after the Fed news. Late Wednesday, it was at 4.107% — down three basis points.


Market Details
--------------


At least for a day, the stock market reversed some recent trends.


Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)), which had slid about 12% since July 10, led the market with a 3.7% increase. The PHLX Semiconductor Index rebounded 7% after losing about 12% in a two-week rout.


Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) jumped 1.6%. The communications services index regained its 50-day line as it climbed 1.2%. But financials, which rose more than 6% in July, fell 0.3%.


The energy sector rose 0.4%. The price of West Texas intermediate crude rose 4.3% to $77.91 per barrel. Brent crude climbed 2.7%. The prospect of a potential conflict between Israel and its enemies grew after [leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas were killed](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/two-enemies-of-israel-are-killed-and-the-mideast-tilts-on-the-brink-of-wider-war-8545bae9?mod=hp_lead_pos1).

  Stock Market Sells Off Broadly; Amazon, Apple Report Earnings After The Bell

The stock market tumbled Thursday, erasing the bulk of Wednesday's Federal Reserve-fueled gains. Weak economic data hurt stocks, and up next Wall Street braces for Friday's July jobs report.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 1.2%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 2.3%.Â The small-cap Russell 2000 index tumbled 3%, its worst day since Feb. 13.


Within the 11 S&P 500 sectors, the defensive utilities and real estate sectors were the best performers, while technology, energy and consumer discretionary fell sharply.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That gave the Nasdaq and S&P 500 new [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for respective totals of five and eight in the past several weeks. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE.


Early Friday, the Labor Department's July jobs report comes at another pivotal time for the stock market, as the S&P 500 hangs on the edge of its 50-day moving average. The report is expected to show that the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs last month, per Econoday. That's down from June's 206,000 additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.


The report follows economic data Thursday that showed some weakness. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher until about 10 a.m. ET, when the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index came out. The index slid to 46.8% in July, the fourth straight month of decline. Other data also pointed to a softer economy.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) reported their quarterly results late Thursday, sparking mixed reactions. Apple shares edged higher in extended trading, while Amazon stock declined 6%. Stock market futures were squarely lower.

In the Dow Jones index, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) were among the biggest losers Thursday, with declines of 6.5% and 4.2%. They contributed 177 points of the Dow's 494-point loss.


The Dow made its lowest close since July 25 but held above the 21-day exponential moving average.


[Six of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended lower. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) was the sole winner, jumping nearly 5% after the [company's strong Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-q2-earnings-instagram/). Shares regained their 50-day moving average as the stock recovers from a tumble below a 514.01 cup-with-handle entry that caused a sell signal.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) declined 2.7% Thursday, to its lowest level since late April. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Trinity Industries** ([TRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRN)) shot to new highs following strong earnings. Shares are extended beyond a 32 flat-base buy point.


What To Do Now
--------------


Heavy losses Thursday poured cold water on Wednesday's rally, which marked another change in character for the stock market as [the Fed suggested](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-nasdaq-sp500-dow-jones-powell/) an interest-rate cut in September.


While the Nasdaq is back below its 50-day line, the S&P 500 held right at that critical juncture. IBD held its recommended exposure level at 60%-80%.


But Thursday was an expectation breaker that should keep IBD investors on the cautious side, near 60% exposure. Following Wednesday's strong gains, investors would have expected more upside or perhaps a modest loss. Instead, the major stock indexes fell sharply in higher volume than Wednesday's gains.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list had only three stocks Thursday, which makes sense given the stock market weakness. Notably, **Clearwater Analytics** ([CWAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CWAN)) gapped above a 21.89 buy point to hit a new high. There were only two names on the Near Pivot list, suggesting that buying opportunities are drying up.

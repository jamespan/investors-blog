Stock Market Bears Dominate Ahead Of Key Inflation Report; Don't Fall Into This Bull Trap
==========================================================================================

The stock market expressed mild fear on Tuesday. All of the key indexes fell ahead of another [critical inflation report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) due before the open on Wednesday.




Yet the day's relatively broad decline did not change the overall picture for investors amid a stock market uptrend under pressure.


That picture, without a doubt, still looks rocky for both bulls and bears. Hence, to prevent one's portfolio from getting banged up by day-to-day fluctuations, keeping a healthy wad of it in cash remains a very sensible step.


While the Nasdaq fared worst on Tuesday, down 0.6%, it seems to have had more to give back in recent days.  The Nasdaq 100 gave back almost 0.7% after rising a combined 2.4% in the prior two sessions.


The S&P 500 fell nearly 0.5%, while the laggard Dow Jones Industrial Average edged only 0.2% lower. None of these daily changes affected the relative performance year to date.


At 12,179, the Nasdaq commands this derby with a 16.3% advance. That's more than twice the 7.3% lift seen in the S&P 500. The Dow, at 33,561, is up a paltry 1.2%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP050923-208x300.jpg)Volume cooled modestly on the Nasdaq. But on the NYSE, turnover edged higher. This price-and-volume interaction handed the S&P 500 a fifth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) over the past 25 sessions.


As time passes this week and next, the potential rises for as many as five distribution days to get wiped off the count in the Market Pulse.


These sessions of intense professional selling can also exit the count when the indexes rise at least 5% from the closing value of a given distribution day.


However, given the pedestrian manner in which the major indexes are moving, especially since the end of March, it seems more likely for the distribution-day count to shrink to more comfortable levels due to the rule of time, not price progress.


As to be expected, breadth on both major exchanges turned negative. Early data showed falling stocks outrunning rising ones by a nearly 3-2 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, decliners beat gainers by around 4 to 3.


Will This Metric Turn Even A Tad Bullish?
-----------------------------------------


New highs, meanwhile, remain muted. However, on Monday, [a total 121 companies notched 52-week or all-time highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-may-08-2023/) on the Nasdaq and NYSE. And this total exceeded the 90 lows that made IBD's screen in IBD Data Tables.


Please go to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), then click on the [New High List](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-may-09-2023/), to see the daily new highs vs. new lows data each day.


On Tuesday,  77 Nasdaq-listed companies made new highs but 121 posted new lows. On the NYSE side, 45 stocks hit new highs and 56 at new lows.  The Building sector led the new highs list with 11 issues, followed by Medical at 10, and Retail at 4.


Technically, the Nasdaq is having a decent showing through the first four months of the year. From its October low of 10,088, the composite index has rallied almost 22%. Yet it's made no price progress for 13 straight weeks.


Other stock market indexes, of course, do not look as bullish.


It's Still The Nasdaq Show
--------------------------


The Russell 2000, weighed down by hundreds of smaller banks, lost 0.3% on Tuesday. It finished in the upper half of the day's range. That's good. But as the daily chart shows, the Russell remains pinned below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and its 50- and 200-day lines.



That's quite the opposite of healthy technical action.


Meanwhile, an equal-weighted view of the large-cap indexes highly suggests that most index investors are not feeling much love so far in 2023.



The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), off 0.4% on Tuesday, holds merely a 0.7% gain year to date. That severely trails a 10% rise by First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)).


Is April Inflation Raging?
--------------------------


Expect more lively action at the Wednesday open. [According to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), Wall Street sees U.S. consumer prices rising 0.4% in April vs. the prior month, jumping from a 0.1% gain in March. Year over year, the consumer price index is expected to rise 5%, or unchanged from March. Meanwhile, core prices are seen rising 0.4% month on month and 5.5% year over year. These numbers exclude food and energy inputs.


For now, bond traders see a substantial chance that, due to lingering inflation deemed too hot by the Federal Reserve, interest rates will get a fourth quarter-point hike in June. CME notes the probability of this happening at 21%. Right now, the fed funds rate sits at a 5%-5.25% range.


On Wednesday, the key 10-year Treasury note yield finished flat at 3.52%. The U.S. dollar continues to trade mildly lower since Jan. 1.

Avoid This Stock Market Trap
----------------------------


In the meantime, if you've done your homework by using IBD screens and charts to land a great stock or two, you also likely know that pullbacks to either the [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) or the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) may offer a second or third chance to add shares. There's perhaps no greater feeling — especially in a strong stock market rally — than adding a little bit more money into a true market leader, and seeing your gains compound sharply.



However, **GE HealthCare** ([GEHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEHC)) demonstrates the reason why one should not chase a stock after it's tested such key levels twice already.


After clearing an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) at 66.38 in January, GEHC zoomed to new highs and an 11% profit in just seven sessions. On Feb. 13, the GE spinoff made its first test of support at the 21-day exponential moving average. For aggressive investors, given that no 50-day moving average was being drawn at that time, this test of the 21-day line could have served as a follow-on entry point.


GEHC's second test of the 21-day line took place over a roughly two-week period in March. Again, it was another great follow-on entry. But when shares gapped down sharply on April 25 following Q1 results, this third test turned out more as a turning point in the balance of supply and demand. On Tuesday, GEHC sank another 4% in above-average volume and closed deeply below its 50-day line.


Was the initial hot run by GEHC a value-inspired move? Perhaps. The company's record of growth in recent quarters is not outstanding.


Earnings fell 21%, 23%, 5%, 4% and 11% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. Revenue grew 2%, 2%, 6%, 8% and 8%. The company has a market value of $34.7 billion vs. trailing 12-month sales of $18.7 billion.


A 149% Gain From Its 2022 Low
-----------------------------



A careful look at midcap consumer spending play **Inter Parfums** ([IPAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPAR)) also reveals the vital lesson that the third time is not always a charm — at least when it comes to buying on pullbacks.

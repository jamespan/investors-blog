Stocks finished mixed in a volatile session Monday that saw the main indexes erase sharp losses.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average led the comeback with a 0.5% gain. But this is not the index that ought to be leading if the market is to make a serious advance.

  

The S&P 500 mustered a 0.3% gain as it defended its 50-day moving average.

  

The Nasdaq closed fractionally lower. Its heavyweights such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) again took heat, but **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) extended their win streaks.

  

Even though the Nasdaq ended a touch in the red, it had been off by 1.5% at Monday's low. The Nasdaq also closed in the upper half of its intraday range. It had risen 0.9% at its session high.

  

Volume grew sharply from Friday's pace and was above average on both major exchanges. NYSE winners edged losers by 16-to-15. But decliners beat advancers by 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.

  

Monday was a volatile session, despite a round of positive news. **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) showed renewed interest in buying English drugmaker **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)). **Forest Laboratories** ([FRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRX)) offered to buy **Furiex Pharmaceuticals** ([FURX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FURX)) in a $1.5 billion deal.

  

Also, pending home sales for March rose for the first time since June and came in sharply above expectations.

  

It's not a good thing when the major indexes can't hold gains in light of good news. But at least the day's action showed that buyers were willing to battle back.

  

Leading stocks, however, stumbled. The IBD 50 dropped 1.2%, extending Friday's 2.8% slide. Chinese issues were among the hardest hit. 

  

**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and **Qihoo 360 Technology Group** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)) slumped 7% and 5%, respectively. Both closed below their 200-day moving averages.

  

Casino operators **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) and **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) both slumped in more than twice their average volume.

  

Leaders up in volume were few, but **Alliance Fiber Optic Products** ([AFOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFOP)) hit a six-month high in fast trade. The stock was No. 13 in Monday's IBD 50.

  

**Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)) even staged a breakout. It blew past a 172.37 buy point from a cup-without-handle base in nearly four times its average trade. Reuters reported that **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) was preparing to make a bid for the Irish drugmaker.

  

With the market still in a correction, this is not the time to be buying stocks. This is the time to reduce equity exposure. Let the market tell you when to get back in by way of a follow-through signal.

  

While Monday was a wild session, investors can expect volatility to pick up in an event-filled week. Tuesday marks the start of a two-day Fed meeting, and the April jobs report will be out Friday. Also, a barrage of earnings reports will continue to roll in.

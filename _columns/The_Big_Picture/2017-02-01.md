**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) still counts.


Sure, it's not 2004, when the Steve Jobs-led Apple busted out of a base after the market bottomed for good in March 2003. It's 2017, and the Tim Cook-led Apple is a gigantic blue chip, with a $686 billion market cap. Lately, the Silicon Valley stalwart and Dow 30 component is growing its quarterly cash payout (up 29% over the long term) to shareholders faster than its earnings or sales (EPS up 2%, revenue up 3% in the December-ended fiscal first quarter).


Yet Apple helped make the difference for the major indexes during Wednesday's choppy market session.


![mp020117](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP020117-192x300.png)The market opened sharply higher, but quickly backpedaled hard enough to send the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average into lightly negative territory. But portfolio managers resumed a fresh round of buying in the afternoon, sending the Nasdaq to a 0.5% gain on top of January's impressive 4%-plus liftoff.


The S&P 500 and the Dow inched higher. The Russell 2000 and S&P SmallCap 600 ended fractionally lower.


Heavy declines in specialty enterprise software, foreign telecom, water and gas utility, and steel stocks offset big strides by a rather motley crew of industries that included metal ores, newspapers, fabless semiconductors, transport gear, medical services, steel alloys and meat products.


In the price-weighted Dow 30, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) all fell one point or more, offsetting a seven-point leap for Apple that stretched gains for investors who bought at a [118.12 cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stocks-down-but-more-techs-move-up-should-apple-stay-on-your-watch-list/) to more than 8%.


Apple's gain from a Sept. 14 buy point at 110.33, an initial cup with handle nestled within a [long, deep bottoming base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/), is now almost 17%.


 The iPhone and iPad maker, rewarded for a fiscal Q1 report that slammed the brakes on three straight quarters of earnings declines, carries nearly 7% of the Nasdaq's total market value.

Volume rose on the Nasdaq and decline on the NYSE.


A surge in Apple's turnover to 112 million shares — the highest since the Sept. 14 initial breakout out of a long bottoming base pattern — also made a big impact in the 193 million-share increase in overall volume on the all-electronic Nasdaq marketplace.


While investors are laser-focused on quarterly sales, earnings and future outlooks, they are certainly keeping at least one eye on what the Federal Reserve is thinking. No one, including traders of fed funds rate futures, expected any move on interest rates, and rightly so.


Equities didn't react much following the [Fed's announcement](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-holds-rates-steady-with-eyes-on-trump-agenda/) around 2 p.m. ET that there would be no change in the rate that the central bank charges Wall Street firms and other giant lenders for overnight cash infusions. However, in its statement, the Fed gave a subtle hint that it's more confident that inflation is reaching its 2% target rate, which means that a plan to hike interest rates three times this year may gain more force.


In its Dec. 14 statement following a quarter-point bump up in the fed funds rate, the Fed noted that inflation "is expected to rise to 2% over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further." But in Wednesday's press release, the central bank changed the wording to simply say that "inflation will rise to 2% over the medium term."


That's the biggest sign of confidence on prices by the Fed in quite a while.


Higher interest rates may benefit not only banks' profit margins but also reward savers.


The market's choppiness and uncertainty are unlikely to vanish anytime soon given President Trump's forceful actions and head-turning statements, within and outside Twitterdom, on a large number of key issues. Despite a higher-than-normal distribution-day count, earnings news and economic data appear to support the general view that stocks, despite being at above-average valuations, have room to grow.


Wednesday's [ADP survey](http://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) showed private sector jobs rising much faster than expected in January, while the ISM manufacturing survey indicated that U.S. factories expanded their operations last month.


"Our economy is developing liftoff power so that it is no longer heavily dependent upon life support from the Federal Reserve," Sadoff Investment Management of Milwaukee, Wis., wrote in its monthly comment to clients. "As business conditions improve the Fed will very gradually lift interest rates."

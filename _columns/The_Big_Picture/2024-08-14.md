  After Bullish Signal, Stocks Already Tested As These Indexes Face Potential Resistance

A day after making a bullish signal, the stock market followed up with gains in most indexes Wednesday as new inflation data boosted the case for interest-rate cuts.




The S&P 500 added 0.4% but faces a test of resistance at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The index closed almost exactly at the line.


In a similar test of resistance, the Russell 2000 performed poorly. The small-cap benchmark reversed lower after topping its 50-day line and closed 0.5% lower.


Other market gauges testing their 50-day lines include the S&P MidCap 400, iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Market ([ITOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITOT)) and Vanguard Megacap ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)) exchange traded fund. That means a cross section of the market is either on the edge of a pullback or poised to extend gains.


The Nasdaq composite erased losses in the final minutes of stock market action and eked out a minimal gain, extending a win streak to five days. The index is making a technical test of its own, this one at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Google, Megacaps Hurt The Nasdaq
--------------------------------


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) was a drag on the Nasdaq — and the S&P 500 to a lesser extent — as shares slid 2.3%. Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Justice Department is [considering breaking up the company](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-13/doj-considers-seeking-google-goog-breakup-after-major-antitrust-win?sref=FwsjHXQj) after a court ruled on Aug. 5 that Google acts as a monopoly in the online search market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP081424.jpg)Other megacaps also hurt the Nasdaq. Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) fell 0.7%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the stock market with a 0.6% increase and closed back above the 40,000 mark.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Tuesday's levels. Advancers topped decliners by about a 7-5 ratio on the NYSE. But losers topped winners by nearly the same ratio on the Nasdaq exchange, according to FactSet.


Breadth is improving by some measures. The NYSE advance-decline line is back above its 10-day moving average and has moved basically sideways since mid-July. The Nasdaq A-D line is still trending lower, however.


Stock Market Uptrend Already Tested
-----------------------------------


Wednesday's market seemed like a proper day-after response to Tuesday's rally, which triggered a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dow-jones-sp500-nasdaq-inflation-starbucks-chipotle/). That opened up investors to higher stock exposure of 20%-40%.


Yet the new market uptrend is already being tested as some indexes come up against potential resistance levels.


Tuesday's follow-through came at kind of an inconvenient time for the stock market. Up 6.5% from its Aug. 5 low, the S&P is at the point where some moderation or even a pullback would be entirely normal. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have just made their best five-day rallies since late October-early November, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Keep in mind that the early-August market sell-off marked [an unusually sharp break](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-vertical-violation/), the type that has signaled long slumps in the stock market. While indexes have rebounded, their [Accumulation/Distribution Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) remain at E or D-.


Stock Market Reacts To CPI
--------------------------


The consumer price index for July [rose less than 3% on an annual basis](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-fed-rate-cut-sp-500/) and 0.2% from June, while core inflation was the lowest since April 2021. The data followed another encouraging producer price index on Tuesday that motivated stock buyers.


Many strategists told IBD the latest data all but assures an interest-rate cut of at least 25 basis points next month. That's even if housing costs remained a cloud.


"The relay race to Fed cuts is on!" said Lindsay Rosner, Head of Multi-Sector Fixed Income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. "Today's CPI print of a rounded 0.2% cleared the way for a 25 bp (basis point) cut in September while not completely shutting the door on the chance of a 50 bp cut."


How The PCE Will Be Affected
----------------------------


The combination of the CPI with PPI data suggests that core inflation measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, should rise 0.1% to 0.2% month over month, noted Brian Rose, senior U.S. economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.


"The inflation data has been good enough to allow the Fed to start cutting rates in September, but does not give them a reason to cut aggressively," Rose added.


He went on to say: "The decision whether to cut by 50 basis points instead of the usual 25 bps may come down to the August labor report (Sept. 6). Tomorrow's retail sales data for July is another critical release, as in our view the main downside risk to our base case scenario of a soft landing is a pullback in consumer spending."


Bond traders are [betting more on a quarter-point rate cut](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html), with odds at 63.5%. The odds for a half-point cut stand at 36.5%.

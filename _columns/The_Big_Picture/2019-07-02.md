The stock market rally continued Tuesday, finishing the day with modest gains, as the major stock indexes tread within striking distance of fresh record highs. Crude oil prices, meanwhile, slid more than 4% amid fears of a slowing global economy.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the trading session with a 0.2% gain. The other major stock indexes fared a bit better. The S&P 500 gained 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 69 points, or 0.3%. All three major indexes closed at the highs of the day, a constructive sign. The S&P 500 and Dow marked record closing highs.


But the small-cap Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.6% decline. Small caps often are viewed as higher-risk investments, and their weak performance undercut the positive close in the major indexes.

[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) outperformed the major stock indexes with a 0.3% advance amid sharply mixed action on the list. Strength in software names offset weakness in the chip, retail and energy stocks.


Current Stock Market Rally
--------------------------


The current stock market rally powered up Monday and added more Tuesday. The stock market appears poised to notch new highs. How far the market will rise and how long the uptrend will last are popular questions to ask. But the reality is no one knows, which is why IBD interprets — as opposed to predicts — the stock market action.


While indexes are nearing record highs, they are around levels where they met sellers in the past. The 2950 level is one to watch for the S&P 500. For the Nasdaq, 8176 is the price to watch.


During a confirmed stock market uptrend, investors should be buying top stocks as they break out past proper buy points. Keep an eye on the market leadership. The names that led the last market uptrend may not be the same leaders for the current uptrend.


Chip Stocks Weaken
------------------



Chip stocks were particularly weak Tuesday. Graphics-chip maker **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) declined 2.4% after it announced new gaming chips to compete with [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)). AMD shares reversed from early losses to close up 0.1% and are holding above a 30.05 buy point in a flat base. Shares are squarely in buy range after a [sharp pullback.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-growth-stocks-what-to-do-after-breakout-pullback/)


**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) lost 1.7% to snap a four-day winning streak that added to the stock's right recovery. With that, Broadcom is forming a cup base with a buy point at 323.30.


IBD 50 chip stock **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) fell nearly 3%. The 5G leader is moving up the right side of a cup base after finding much-needed support around its 200-day line back in mid-May.


Top Growth Stocks Mixed
-----------------------


IBD 50 growth stocks were sharply mixed with leading software names some of the top performers on the IBD 50. China-based **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) gained 2.5%, further propelling the stock above a 49.20 buy point in a cup base. Shares are extended.


**Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) moved up 2.6%, 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.


On the downside, retailers **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) fell 2.6% and 0.8%, respectively. Energy stock **ProPetro** ([PUMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PUMP)), meanwhile, slid over 3% on weak oil prices.


The energy sector was Tuesday's weakest. West Texas intermediate crude slid 4.4% to $56.50 a barrel on concerns about global demand. Those worries overshadowed OPEC plans to extend production cuts for nine months.


Stocks Nears Buy Points: Amarin, Keysight, Lululemon
----------------------------------------------------



With the stock market rally gaining steam, continue to look for leading stocks with strong [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Investors use the RS line to find stocks that are beating the general market and can be potential stock market winners.


Recent [IBD 50 Stock To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-keysight-technologies/) **Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) broke out past a 93.87 buy point in a cup base on Monday. But the stock closed below the buy point, indicating a lack of strong institutional demand at new highs. After Tuesday's 2.1% drop, shares are just under the buy point.



Retail leader **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is just above a 179.60 buy point, as the result of a flat-base formation. Bullishly, the stock's RS line hit a new high in the wake of the stock's move past the buy point in mid-June.


Lastly, [Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/amarin-stock-biotech-company-raises-guide-fda-mulls-high-triglycerides-treatment/), **Amarin** ([AMRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMRN)), surged over 16% on huge turnover, as it nears a 23.35 buy point in a cup with handle. Amarin was added to [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) Tuesday morning.


Wednesday's trading session will be a half day, closing at 1 p.m. ET ahead of [the July 4th holiday.](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-holidays-2019-when-is-the-stock-market-open-july-3-july-4/) The stock market will be closed Thursday.

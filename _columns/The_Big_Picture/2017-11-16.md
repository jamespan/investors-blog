Small Caps, Nasdaq Lead As This Index Makes Bullish Move
=========================================================

U.S. stock indexes galloped ahead Thursday, but mixed volume left a dash of doubt in an otherwise cheerful session.




The Nasdaq advanced 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average popped 0.8% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1.6% as it clambered back above the 50-day moving average with energy.


Volume in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) rose narrowly on the Nasdaq, but preliminary data showed it lower on the NYSE.


Ideally, bulls prefer to see unquestionably strong volume when an index rides higher.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MP111617.png)The Nasdaq scored a new high, while the other indexes held back.


The new high, a bullish sign, combined with the Nasdaq's seven [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-a-stock-market-top/), a bearish sign, make for an odd picture.


Bears could rightly point out that the distribution count can't be ignored, and that a stock market top often forms over many months.


Bulls might counter that nothing has changed in the market's overall action. So far this year, steady gains — interrupted by small pullbacks — have been the story.


What reason do investors have to think that has changed?


If there is potential for change in the market's tone, Thursday's session suggested that tax cuts might play a role.


On Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a package that includes cutting the corporate tax from 35% to 20%.


Also in the House package is an item that would force investors to use FIFO accounting (first in, first out) when selling shares. This could hurt individual investors, who would lose the choice to select the accounting method they prefer.


The U.S. Senate is still groping with a tax plan of its own. A committee vote is expected Friday and a vote of the full Senate could come as soon as just after Thanksgiving.


Apple Ends Losing Streak
------------------------


On Thursday, Apple ended a five-session losing streak with a 1.2% gain. Apple is just above the 5% buy zone from a 160.97 buy point.


Meanwhile, the FANG stocks were up without exception. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) rose 0.9%; **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), 0.9%; **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), 1.8%; and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), 1.2%.


Apple and the FANG stocks have outperformed the indexes so far this year.


A couple of former growth stock leaders also did well Thursday. **Wal-Mart Stores** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) leapt 11%, while **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) jumped 5%.


Cisco hit its highest level since February 2001. In the past, Cisco has retreated when its stock price reached the high 20s and low 30s.

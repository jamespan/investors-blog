  Stock Market Soars As U.S. Avoids Default, Jobs Report Impresses; These Stocks Surge

The stock market rallied furiously as the Senate passage of the debt-ceiling bill and a strong jobs report tickled investors' fancies. An improvement in market breadth strengthens the hand of bulls.




The Nasdaq composite was one of the weaker indexes for a change, rising 1.1% for the day. It turned in a gain of 2% for the week. The tech-heavy index has risen for six weeks in a row, its longest streak since 2020. With the index up more than 27% in 2023 and well clear of its moving averages it could be time for it to catch its breath.


The S&P 500 popped 1.5%. It closed with a weekly gain of almost 2% and is now up 12% so far in 2023. If it can work to close the gap on the Nasdaq it will add weight to bullish sentiment.


Advancers outnumbered decliners by almost 6-to-1 on the NYSE and just shy of 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was little changed from Thursday, though. The S&P and Nasdaq each lost a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to index gains.


The biggest criticism of the current stock market uptrend has been a lack of breadth. But a meaty 2.2% gain for the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) highlighted broadening participation. It managed to retake its [50-day and 200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) in one fell swoop.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP060223-272x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average also punched through the 50-day moving line as it rose 2.1%, its best gain since January. **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) was the biggest Dow star as it soared 8.8%, its best day in more than three years.


Small caps added further weight to the broadening uptrend, with the Russell 2000 surging 3.6% for the day. It has managed to squeeze out a gain of nearly 5% in 2023 despite the regional banking crisis.


The stock market was already in a confirmed uptrend, but IBD is now increasing its recommended exposure level to 60% to 80% (from 40%-60%) thanks to widening participation.


Debt Progress, Jobs Report Embolden Bulls
-----------------------------------------


Stocks got a shot in the arm after the Senate passed a bill to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, which also set a cap on some government spending for the next two years.Â President Joe Biden touted the deal as a "a big win for our economy and the American people."


Meanwhile, nonfarm payrolls soared in May, [rising 339,000 vs. analyst views for a 190,000 increase](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-strong-hiring-in-may-test-fed-pause-sp-500-futures-rise/). But average hourly earnings rose less than feared. The latter point was key to quelling bearish sentiment.


Fed officials now head into a relatively quiet period ahead of the June policy meeting. This could give indexes a chance to advance in a disciplined fashion.

These Stock Market Groups Impress
---------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors all ended the day positive. Materials, industrials and energy were the top areas, each up roughly 3% in another sign of better breadth. Technology was one of the weaker performers.



The performance of the IBD industry groups further underlined the expanding uptrend.


Mining machinery makers, department store stocks, chemicals plays and steel producers all impressed. The shoes and apparel group also popped amid strong results from **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), which rocketed 11.3%.


Food wholesalers, wireless telecom plays, gold miners and computer hardware makers were among the few laggards.

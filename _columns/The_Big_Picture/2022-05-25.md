Stock Market Gains On Fed Minutes But Consider This; Bearish Sentiment Slips In Key Gauge
==========================================================================================

The stock market powered higher Wednesday as investors digested the latest Fed minutes, which showed bankers seriously considered a more restrictive policy stance as they work to tame inflation.




Stock Market: Wednesday's Strengths And Weaknesses
--------------------------------------------------


Yet with volume in Wednesday's stock-market action underwhelming on the day, it is still too early to say if this could help spark a new proper market uptrend.


The market's whipsaw action continued as indexes turned in solid gains across the board. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the top gainer among the major indexes as it popped 1.5%. It was turned away at the short-term [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/), though. Plus, the composite index remains well shy of its other moving averages.


The broader S&P 500 continues to look bearish despite a nearly 1% gain on Wednesday. (The 500 rose 0.945%, which actually rounds down to 0.9%). It remains rooted firmly below the bulk of its moving averages, though it did pop back above its 10-day line. The index is down about 3.5% so far this month, vs. 7.3% for the Nasdaq.


[The S&P sectors were mostly positive.](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) The beaten down consumer discretionary area fared best while energy continued to perform well. The defensive utilities sector fared worst, though its losses were slight.

The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was the weakest of the major indexes. It ended the session up 0.6%. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) was the top performer as it jumped 3.1%. Volume grew 26% above average and hit the highest level for an up day since April 25. **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) was the worst laggard as it fell 1.6%.


Wednesday's gain does not change the fact indexes remain weak overall, with the market still firmly in the grip of a correction. Investors should continue to trade defensively and take advantage of the opportunity to build up a [robust watchlist](https://www.investors.com/videos/how-to-find-emerging-market-leadership-prep-your-watch-list-for-the-next-uptrend/).


Growth Stocks Shine Brightest
-----------------------------


Small caps have been getting battered in the stock market amid rising recession fears. But the bulls reigned supreme this time as the Russell 2000 ended the day up 2%. The index has a long ways to go before it retraces its losses of more than 20% so far for the year.


Growth stocks also battled back, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) popping 2.6%. While it has stemmed some bleeding it remains down nearly 32% for the year.


Fed Minutes Show Powell Keeps Options Open
------------------------------------------


Some have criticized the Federal Reserve for being too dovish amid runaway inflation. But FOMC members, led by Fed chairman Jerome Powell, seem to be keeping their options open behind the scenes if the latest minutes of the FOMC are any guide.


Central bankers see 50 basis point, or 0.5%, interest rate increases as appropriate for the next couple of meetings.


It also showed that they believe policy may have to shift into "restrictive" rather "neutral" territory in the future. While they opted to hold off at the last meeting to protect the strong recovery in the jobs market, it now seems clear they will use all the tools in their famous toolbox to get the problem under control.


"The FOMC minutes are over three weeks old, but they did give a glimmer of hope that they could adjust their policy tightening stance later in the year," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients.


Nevertheless, bankers have their work cut out if they are to achieve their touted "softish" landing amid runaway inflation without triggering a recession.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell again, slipping 1 basis point to 2.74%, according to Cboe data.


Retailers Fight Back After Stock Market Beatdown
------------------------------------------------


Keeping track of the top performing industry groups is key for the intelligent investor.


And on Wednesday it was beaten down areas that shone brightest amid the broader rally.


Retail managed to lock out the top three spots for the day, with consumer electronics, department stores and apparel all shining. Mobile home and home furnishing retail stocks also had good days.



In fact, department store chain **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) was one of the top performers on the stock market today, soaring 14%. This allowed it to smash through its 10-day moving average. JWN still needs to rally more than 9% to cross above the key [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


It was boosted after Q1 sales came in higher than Wall Street expectations. Perhaps more importantly, it also hiked its financial outlook for the year.


On the stock market's downside, it was a bad day for medical research equipment stocks, water supply utilities and gold miners.


Confectionary stocks, which have been on a bit of a tear in this year's stock market, also lagged. **Tootsie Roll** ([TR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TR)) saw a three-session win streak come to an end as it fell 2.1%.

Bears Still Strongest In Key Gauge Despite Retreat
--------------------------------------------------


The latest advisors sentiment weekly report from [Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) saw bears give up some ground following recent gains.


The bull-bear spread narrowed to -12.6% from -15.6% last week. Overall sentiment has now been negative for eight of the past 12 weeks.


The number of bears in the stock market fell to 40.8% from 43% the previous week. Some believe that a tradable rally is now due. Meanwhile, the bulls inched higher, rising from 27.8% to 28.2%. The ratio of newsletter editors now projecting a correction increased from 29.2% to 31%.


Remember, this is a contrarian indicator. But while the negative sentiment suggests a rally could take place, the whipsaw action of late suggests there is still considerable uncertainty about which way the hammer will fall.


As ever, it is key that investors use the daily action of the major indexes and performance of the current stock market leaders as their main guide.

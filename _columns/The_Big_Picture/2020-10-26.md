  Stocks Sell Off As These Signals Spark Doubts About Market's Direction

Sellers washed over the stock market Monday, dimming last week's hopeful signs and forcing a rethink of the market's outlook.




Indexes trimmed some losses late in the day, but the damage was done. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2.3%, a 650-point loss that left the Dow below the 50-day moving average.


The S&P 500 lost 1.9% and the Nasdaq composite 1.6%. Both also fell below their 50-day lines, although the Nasdaq reduced enough losses to close above the line. Other chart signals were poor.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Trading also was heavier on the NYSE, which gave the S&P 500 its fourth distribution day. Declining stocks led advancers by more than 4-to-1 on the NYSE and by more than 13-to-2 on the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP_4x2_102620-239x300.jpg)The Dow undercut the low of the Sept. 30 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). A close below it would have been even worse, but the deterioration since that rally confirmation was troubling. The Nasdaq already had undercut the low of its own follow-through on Oct. 12.


Besides breaking below the 50-day lines, indexes also sank underneath their 21-day exponential moving averages. Those lines appeared to be giving the indexes support. Monday's sell-off spoiled the [hopeful trajectory of last week's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/small-caps-lead-stock-market-gains-late-buying-lifts-nasdaq-sp-500/).


In sum, the market outlook has darkened, causing IBD to change its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure."


What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


This means investors need to turn much more cautious, but not go entirely to cash. Watch sell signals closely. Be sure to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price, and maybe even 3% or 4% if you want to raise cash. Avoid buying stocks for now, unless the breakout is exceptionally good.


This is not a good time to add to positions. Those using margin should stop immediately. Losses can accelerate quickly when the market weakens.


Leading stocks have been caught up in the market slide as much as any other stocks. The IBD 50 fell 1.2% Monday and is down more than 7% from its Oct. 13 peak.


On Monday, **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) made a round-trip sell signal and was removed from [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard). **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), also on Leaderboard, closed below the 50-day moving average. The company reports earnings on Tuesday after the close.


**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is now nearly 6% below last week's breakout at 209.12.


For all the bleeding, most leading stocks are still in their current patterns. Many of them are forming handles in their current bases. This leaves in place the chance of breakouts in top stocks in a matter of days.


Stock Market Faces Multiple Risks
---------------------------------


But it will be hard for the stock market to rally with so many risks now on the table. The election is about a week away. Congressional leaders and the White House still have no accord on a new coronavirus aid package, despite continued talks. Let's not forget the stubborn pandemic.


"The U.S.' seven-day average of new Covid cases hit an all-time high, and infections are rising in other parts of the world, just as it is getting chilly outside. And the timing of a vaccine continues to be crucial, but elusive, adding to concerns about economic prospects," Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist for Ally Invest, said in a report.


"Congress' back-and-forth on another round of fiscal aid has been going on for months, and it's getting old. Even though we've seen some hopeful signs of progress, the market is starting to believe that we won't get more stimulus for a while and I'm not holding my breath on getting something ahead of the election (in just eight days)," she added.


It's also a [big week for earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/).


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) report this week. That's about one-third of the Nasdaq composite and more than 20% of the S&P 500 that will reveal third-quarter results.


In addition, several companies developing Covid-19 vaccines or treatments are announcing results and could give update on those projects. **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) report this week.

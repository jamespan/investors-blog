A rally of about 2% Tuesday by the major indexes helped U.S. stocks extend a nascent rebound, as the market went into an after-hours session expected to bring pivotal election news.




The Nasdaq composite rallied almost 1.9%, and the S&P 500 added 1.8% after the latter made a bullish gap over Monday's price bar.


Best Day For U.S. Stocks Since July
-----------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.1%, its best day since July 14. Indexes would have closed practically at session highs if not for a sudden drop in the final few minutes of trading.


Breadth was bullish, with advancing stocks over decliners by a 4-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by nearly that much on the Nasdaq.

If you draw trend lines over the indexes' highs from their Oct. 12 peaks, indexes are below those levels. If they can break above the trend lines, consider it a positive step.


U.S. Stocks Need This Signal
----------------------------


The most important signal that the correction in U.S. stocks is ending would be a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). For that to happen, indexes have to continue rising for at least a couple more days, and then have a resounding day of gains. Volume should rise vs. the prior day. Follow-throughs are difficult to pinpoint, but [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) will have the confirmation when it happens.


From their October highs, U.S. stock indexes tumbled nearly 10%. Wall Street is considered to be in a correction when indexes fall more than 10%. IBD [changed its market outlook to "correction" Friday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-sell-off-amazon-apple-facebook-tesla-dive-alphabet-new-buy-point/) based on multiple negative signals in the market and in leading stocks.


Volume Tuesday was nearly the same as it was on Monday. Strong index gains like Tuesday's should come in markedly higher volume, but the advance certainly was no waste of time.


Almost every S&P sector rose except energy. A mix of consumer and cyclical sectors had the best gains. The Dow transports jumped 3.1% thanks to strength in rail, trucking, airfreight and shipping industry groups.



The IBD 50 climbed 1.6%, and might have outperformed the major indexes if not for a few stocks that tumbled. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) gapped down to a loss of more than 8% after [regulators suspended the Ant Group IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-stock-ant-ipo-initial-public-offering-china-stocks-baba/). **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) shed more than 4% after its earnings report.


**Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) helped offset those losses with a 12% vault. The stock also retook its 50-day moving average in accelerating turnover, a bullish sign.


Small Caps Outperform
---------------------


Small caps performed admirably, with the Russell 2000 surging 2.9%. The small-cap index has declined less than the three main indexes.


There was a pocket of weakness in construction stocks. **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)), **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) and **Masonite International** ([DOOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOOR)) fell in heavy volume. All three reported earnings.


The earliest vote totals were expected after 7 p.m. ET, when [Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Georgia may start announcing some results](https://news.yahoo.com/how-to-watch-election-night-2020-the-definitive-hourbyhour-guide-181852835.html). Those are all swing states, and have already started counting early votes.


At about 5 p.m. ET, U.S. stock futures were nearly flat.



Some industries face key risks from this election, including solar power, [electric vehicles](https://www.investors.com/news/electric-car-stocks-trump-biden-election-tesla-stock-gm-nikola/) and trade-sensitive industries. Disputed results would extend uncertainty and perhaps increase stock volatility. The race for the U.S. presidency [tightened in the past several days](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-vs-biden-poll-race-stays-close-election-day-ibd-tipp-presidential-poll/).


But a report from Wells Fargo Investment Institute today reminds investors that elections tend to have short-term effects.


U.S. Stocks During Elections And Afterward
------------------------------------------


"The history of the economy and the S&P 500 Index suggests that a president's party affiliation has made little difference when it comes to long-term investment returns," said Chao Ma, global portfolio and investment strategist. The S&P 500 and corporate earnings have trended higher regardless of which party holds the White House.


"Investors should focus on the trends that seem to be most dominant. We see an economic recovery; we expect more low interest rates and increasing use of digital technologies, and we anticipate more challenges for trade and diplomacy."


Other market analysts believe a new coronavirus relief package will move forward once the election is over. U.S. stocks rallied earlier this year in response to massive stimulus from Congress and the Federal Reserve.


And, oh yes, the number of coronavirus cases has been spiking, raising worries of new lockdowns that echo the bear market of February and March.

Stock Market Surges On Stimulus Aid, As U.S. Coronavirus Cases Top 81,000; Lululemon Falls Late On Earnings
============================================================================================================

The stock market surged Thursday, as the $2 trillion stimulus package overshadowed mounting U.S. coronavirus cases. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at sessions highs with a 5.6% advance.




The S&P 500 rallied 6.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 6.4%, or 1,351 points. Leading growth stocks also rose sharply: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) gained 5.4%. Volume on both main exchanges was sharply lower than Wednesday's sessions, removing one of the key ingredients of a potential [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


Rally Attempt Continues, As U.S. Coronavirus Cases Mount
--------------------------------------------------------


On Feb. 25, IBD [downgraded the stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) to a "market in correction," and the Nasdaq tumbled as much as 26% to Monday's low price of 6631.42 from the closing price on Feb. 25. But the major stock indexes have rallied sharply since Monday's lows.


Thursday's strong gains may have appeared to be a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/), but several key components were missing. First, the volume across both exchanges was much lower than Wednesday, indicating that institutions may not be fully committed to the attempted stock market rally.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP032619-255x300.jpg)Second, powerful [follow-throughs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) are usually accompanied by strong breakouts among the top growth stocks. So far, there haven't been many breakouts among the handful of elite names, which makes sense after the severe selling in recent weeks. Many stocks need more time before they finish the right side of their emerging bases. For example, FANG leaders **Amazon**.**com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are both building new bases, and are above their 50-day moving averages.


The coronavirus outbreak continues to spread rapidly in the U.S., with confirmed cases topping 81,000, along with 1,177 deaths total by Thursday, according to [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) data. New York continues to be the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. with more than 37,000 total cases, or about 47% of the country's total. Meanwhile, global coronavirus cases topped 525,000 with over 23,000 deaths.

Atlassian stock regained its 50-day line Thursday with a 6.5% advance. Shares are close to completing a new base, which would show a 156.22 buy point.

DocuSign [is featured](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-docusign-stock-esignature-leader-new-base/) as this week's [IPO Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/). Shares gained 2.8% Thursday.


Stock Market Earnings: Lululemon Falls Late
-------------------------------------------



Top retail stock Lululemon [reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-q4-2019-lululemon-stock/) after the stock market close Thursday. Analysts expected the [yoga-inspired athletic gear retailer](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-q4-2019-lululemon-stock/) to earn $2.25 a share on revenue of $1.98 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. After the close, Lululemon stock fell 2% to about 196 after the company topped Q4 earnings and sales forecasts, but missed on in-store comps. Shares closed Thursday at 200.80, up 3.7%.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Lululemon boasts a 98 out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Lululemon's relative strength line hit a new high this week, as the stock sharply rebounds from its recent lows.

  These Stocks Outrun Dow Jones Amid 3 Positive Signs For The Stock Market

Ever notice how most of the greatest marathoners are not tall, burly, large athletes who could pose for a mock NFL team photo? At least in recent years, the first to cross the finish line are smallish, with barely an ounce of fat on their bodies. They cut through the wind like the main sail of a yacht racing in the America's Cup. There's a parallel with the stock market. The biggest winners don't necessarily start their gigantic runs as a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.




The market on Tuesday showed a preference for the little folks. That is, small caps and a few sector indexes ran the furthest ahead on the start of a holiday-shortened week.


The Russell 2000 didn't rally that much. Yet its 0.3% gain by day's end beat advances of nearly 0.2% for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), the big kahuna of global retailing, commandeered tons of media spotlight after posting its best quarterly same-store sales growth since 2009. Yet even as shares in the megacap chain and e-commerce play rose 2%, just two other components within the 30-stock Dow Jones industrials also rose 1 point or more. The Dow Jones ended up 8 points, less than 0.1%.


A few other indexes did even better than the Russell 2000.


Better Performance Than The Dow Jones
-------------------------------------


The S&P SmallCap 600 rose almost 0.6%. At 980, the S&P 600 now owns a 16% gain since Jan. 1. The S&P 500 has run 10.9% higher over the same time frame.


Meanwhile, airline, trucking, railroad and other related shares kept rising, even as U.S. crude oil gained another 0.8% and eclipsed the $56-per-barrel level for the first time since November. The Dow Jones transports, at one point up as much as 1.1%, settled back for a 0.5% closing gain.


Still, index traders could rejoice in the fact that the Nasdaq composite, at 7486, managed to finish above the long-term 200-day moving average for a second straight session. Ditto for the Nasdaq 100, up nearly 0.2% on Tuesday.

Volume was lower on both main exchanges.


Overall, investors who mustered the courage to start actively picking up stocks when the Jan. 4 follow-through completely transformed IBD's outlook for stocks have been amply rewarded. The follow-through also triggered a [buy signal for index ETF traders](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/). Since the Jan. 4 market close, the triple-leveraged ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ([UPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPRO)) ETF has gained 31.7%.


[UPRO joined Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders) as a double full position on Dec. 27.


Since the major market bottom in 2009, the key indexes have shown numerous cases of rising eight weeks in a row. Such rallies led to an inevitable pullback. But investors shouldn't ignore these three emerging positive factors that have been in place since January.


3 Positive Stock Market Angles
------------------------------


One, instances of extreme professional selling remain sparse. As the Market Pulse shows, the S&P 500 shows just two days of distribution. And neither down day (Feb. 7, down 0.9% and Feb. 14, off 0.3%) was especially strong.


Two, the news flow has seemed to point to hope for the U.S. economy to avoid a recession. Reports of progress and an urgency by both the U.S. and China to de-escalate a brewing trade war have injected some confidence in the economy. The huge batch of quarterly results from across most of the broad spectrum of industries seems to have also inspired some market confidence.


Companies such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) are slowly recouping some of their big losses after issuing warnings related to the economic damage caused by tariffs and the prolonged partial U.S. federal government shutdown.


Three, market internals just keep getting better.


More than 100 issues on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE struck 52-week or all-time highs Tuesday. They vastly outnumbered the roughly 60 stocks hitting new lows. Meanwhile, enterprise software, mortgage services, fabless semiconductor, tech services, aerospace and medical software firms have made big jumps within IBD's [197 industry group rankings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) over the past six weeks. All six industry groups now rank in the top 25.



New IPO **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) was one such superior performer that made new highs. The seller of super premium-priced outdoors gear heated up for a fifth straight session amid its new breakout from an 11-week cup with handle base. Shares bolted 4.6% higher and made a new all-time peak of 24.64. That's a 27% advance past a 19.30 proper entry.


Yeti also underscored the modest, yet still noticeable, outperformance of small caps. It now has a market value of $2 billion with a float of 34 million shares and 84 million shares outstanding.


Meanwhile, [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) counted 221 stocks that finished the day up in heavy volume vs. 108 falling in big trade. Again, a healthy margin for the bulls.


The chart-reading pattern recognition algorithm spotted eight companies making breakouts, while 32 are "near pivot," meaning they are close to busting past a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

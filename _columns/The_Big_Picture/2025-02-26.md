Early gains faded in the stock market Wednesday on more tariff talk, but Nasdaq 100 futures got a lift in after-hours trading when **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) delivered another strong earnings report.


Strong opens and weak closes are typical in a softening market, and that's exactly what happened Wednesday. After rising nearly 1.4% intraday, the Nasdaq composite closed with a gain of less than 0.3%. The silver lining was that volume fell from Tuesday, and breadth was slightly positive.




But Nvidia's earnings got plenty of attention after the close. After rising 3.7% during the regular session, Nvidia was up nearly 3% at one point in extended trading after [reporting another quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-fiscal-q4-2025-earnings/) of strong bottom-line and top-line growth.


Its revenue outlook for the April-ended quarter was also bullish. The company forecast revenue of $43 billion, nearly $1 billion ahead of the $42.1 billion estimate from analysts.


Tariffs Bring Stock Market Angst
--------------------------------


The stock market started to weaken after 12:30 p.m. ET when President Donald Trump said that tariffs on European Union products would be 25% in general. He also said that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would take effect in early April.

The 10-year Treasury yield extended losses and was trading around 4.25% just after the stock market close, down more than four basis points. The 10-year yield, down for six straight sessions, is close to testing its 200-day moving average, currently around 4.24%. The bond market is worried that tariffs will stoke inflation.


The S&P 500 closed fractionally higher in lower volume after rallying up to its 50-day moving average. Breadth was slightly negative on the New York Stock Exchange.

**Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) was a big winner on the S&P 500, up around 15%, helped by a strong earnings report. The Taser maker also announced its largest deal ever with a global logistics firm, along with several deals for its new generative artificial intelligence product suite.


But Axon's bullish gain didn't do much to offset a 25% decline for the stock last week. It's still a damaged chart, like many other growth stocks, after several days in a row of institutional selling.


Now is not the time to be putting money to work in growth stocks. Doing so would be swimming against a negative stock market tide. Instead, keep tabs on growth names holding up relatively well.


**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **GeneDX** ([WGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGS)) are good examples. Atlassian is getting support at its 50-day line after retesting a 287.97 buy point. Meanwhile, after an orderly pullback, GeneDX is near an alternate entry of 98.97.


Boeing, Apple, Amgen Drag Dow
-----------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a loss of 0.4%, weighed down by declines of nearly 3% for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)). The blue-chip index also turned lower after briefly reclaiming its 50-day line.


**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) bucked the trend in the Dow Jones ahead of its earnings report after the close. The stock snapped a five-session losing streak with a gain of 0.5%, but it's still on a downtrend. Salesforce was down 1% just after 5 p.m. ET after revenue came in mostly in line with expectations.


The Russell 2000 jumped 1.4% early in the session and got close to its 200-day line. But the strong intraday gain faded to a 0.2% rise by the close. It's the weakest stock index at this point after a pullback of nearly 13%.


AppLovin Takes A Double-Digit Hit
---------------------------------


**AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) took the biggest hit in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), down more than 15%. The stock gapped below its 50-day line after two research firms disclosed [short positions](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/applovin-stock-plunges-short-seller-reports/) in the stock. Five straight above-average volume declines for AppLovin have knocked the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating down to D+.



But the news isn't all bad in the growth-stock space. Health care name **Masimo** ([MASI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MASI)) broke out cleanly over an alternate entry of 183.14 after reporting earnings, while some big leaders are holding support at their 50-day lines, including **Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)), **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)).

The S&P 500 hit a record high Tuesday, ending a short-lived market correction.

  

The index climbed 0.7%, surpassing the prior peak set on March 7. The Nasdaq, which rallied 1.6%, reclaimed its 50-day moving average. The composite got hit harder than the S&P 500 the past three weeks and remains 2% off its prior high.

  

Both indexes closed practically at session highs as buying picked up in afternoon trading.

  

Volume rose, making it two days in a row of substantial gains in higher volume. That's an indication that institutional investors are wading back into the market.

  

Indeed, a decline that lasted about three weeks (IBD's market outlook put the market in correction after Wednesday's sell-off) is over now that one of the major indexes has reached new heights.

  

Normally, the market ends a correction when a follow-through confirms a new rally attempt. This time, there was no such signal ahead of the new high.

  

That's occurred a few times before after moderate corrections. Last year, for example, IBD's market outlook flagged a correction in mid-August, then the Nasdaq's new high Sept. 9 meant the uptrend was back on.

  

Today the market resumes its uptrend with a heavy burden of distribution days. They are back in the picture.

  

The market is continuing a pattern of modest corrections that have been occurring since last year. The Nasdaq fell as much as 5.5% to Thursday's low, typical of its 3%-to-6.5% pullbacks since the start of 2013.

  

For individual investors, the bullish market outlook means there's less risk in buying stocks. Those who had been raising cash should be looking to raise their exposure.

  

There aren't many high-rated stocks forming bases at the moment. That may be a consequence of a market decline that didn't last long enough for growth-stocks to form bases. More often, today's buy opportunities are in pullbacks to the 10-week or 50-day moving averages.

  

**ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was unimpressive, but the breakout was a sign of leadership by the chip sector. Semiconductors were No. 10 out of 33 sectors in Tuesday's IBD, having climbed nearly 7% for the year so far. Only the auto, real estate and miscellaneous sectors have done any better.

  

The **Market Vectors Semiconductor** ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) ETF is up about 4% since the market topped in March.

  

Energy, consumer staple, industrial and financial stocks also have shown relative strength.

  

Chinese stocks accounted for many of the day's big gainers in higher volume. It's good to see that important segment of the market leadership try to straighten up from recent tumbles.

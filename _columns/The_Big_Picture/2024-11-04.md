Dull. Mixed. Wishy-washy. Confusing. Slightly more skittish than usual. These words, and perhaps a handful of others, describe how the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) acted Monday.




And who could blame Wall Street? Monday's apathetic moves, both on the upside and downside, reflected a lack of confidence in what the result will be in Tuesday's historic U.S. presidential election.


Of course, there's more at stake than the possibility of a first woman president or the return of a former president to the White House.


Investors and stock market strategists will be closely watching pivotal congressional races, from the Senate race in Montana to a number of New York seats in the House of Representatives, to determine if the majority shifts in either house of Congress, or even both.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both fell 0.3% on Monday.



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP110424-186x300.jpg)Particularly on the S&P 500, Monday's action was disappointing after last Thursday's sell-off in heavy turnover. A daily chart on [IBD MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/market/etfmarketstrategy) shows how the large-cap index finished below the 21-day exponential moving average for the third day in a row.


The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq briefly spent time on Monday in positive territory, yet the trade was arguably rangebound all session long.


One could argue that skittishness extended into the bond markets too. Investors scooped up long-dated U.S. Treasuries. Thus, the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond sank five basis points to 4.30%. It had fallen to as low as 4.26%.


Nonetheless, long-dated Treasuries actually show a losing year so far. The 10-year yield started in 2024 at 3.86%. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to conduct its second rate cut this year.


A Key Technical Level
---------------------


Monday's action also highlighted a test of support at the S&P 500's rising 50-day moving average. In fact, this week could mark the third time in which the S&P 500 falls below its 50-day line in the second half of the year. In the first half, the index tested buyers at or near the 50-day line just once, over a three-week time span from April 15 through May 3.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost the most among the major stock market indexes, down 0.6%. Perhaps surprising some investors, blue chips in the banking and financial sectors led the downside. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) in the Dow Jones both dropped more than 1%. Both components also took out their 21-day lines.


Amid these declines, it was somewhat puzzling to see smaller issues actually thrive on Monday. The Russell 2000 gained 0.5%, while the S&P MidCap 400 eked out a 0.3% rise.


Did oil and gas and other energy companies help the cause? Perhaps so. Some industrial and cyclical firms also shined brightly. Looking at IBD's industry groups, solar, oil machinery, oil drilling, oil and gas field services, building maintenance and agricultural chemical stocks jumped 2.4% or more for the day.

Recent Institutional Selling
----------------------------


Despite a slightly bearish tone to Monday's stock market, institutions didn't exactly flood the exits either.


Volume fell 5% on the NYSE to 3.6 billion shares, while turnover cooled around 2% vs. the prior session to 5.76 billion shares on the Nasdaq. Therefore, [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) wasn't apparent. Nevertheless, the accompanying Market Pulse highlights an elevated level of intense professional selling.


Indeed, when you consider the average decline among the S&P 500's distribution days is a pretty meaty 1.2% (down 1% on Oct. 7, 0.8% on Oct. 15, 0.9% on Oct. 23, and 1.9% on Oct. 31), it's certainly not time to become complacent about stock market behavior.


Beyond The Market: Exercise Caution Here
----------------------------------------


In fact, volatility is showing a bigger bump higher.


The Cboe Market Volatility Index has gained ground in three of the past four sessions. On Monday, the VIX edged up 0.5% to 21.98. Relatively speaking, that's still a depressed level compared with its spikes in recent years. During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic bear market, the VIX exploded to as high as 85.47 in March 2020.


Brett Friedman, a contributor at Winhall Risk Analytics and OptionMetrics, notes that preelection implied volatility in S&P 500 options jumped by 6.8% during an average election year from 1996 through 2023 vs. a 1.8% drop during nonelection years. The study covered trading over 10 days prior to Nov. 5.


Meanwhile, three areas of the stock market showed poor action to warrant extra caution among active stock traders.


First, recent breakouts by small-cap growth stocks have not done particularly well.


Take **TG Therapeutics** ([TGTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGTX)). The small-cap biotech firm, which reported a 49% plunge in third-quarter sales Monday, nose-dived 9% in heavy turnover to 24.36. TG Therapeutics also dropped more than 7%, triggering a [defensive sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), after breaking out of a narrow cup at 26.41 just one day ago.


Weak Group Action
-----------------


Second, some gold and silver miners took big hits.


**Idaho Strategic Resources** ([IDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDR)) collapsed despite a strong third-quarter report (EPS up 400%, revenue up 86%). The microcap fell more than 15% to 13.39 in more than double its usual turnover and undercut its rising 50-day line. The stock in August broke out of a [well-formed base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/) with an 11.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and climbed as much as 55%.


Gold itself continues to move steadily higher. But in the gold and silver mining group, **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) and **Newmont** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) have also pierced their 50-day moving averages, a bearish sign in the near term.


Finally, amid news that it could get more difficult for data centers to extract power from the nation's nuclear power plants to fuel their operations, utility stocks tanked. For months, Utilities Select SPDR Sector ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) acted like a [stock market leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). But on Monday, the ETF dropped further below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) with a 1.2% slide in heavy trading.


That action triggered a [profit-taking sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). The [ETF exited Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Monday. It also fell for the eighth time in 11 sessions.

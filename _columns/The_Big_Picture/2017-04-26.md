So, was it "Buy the rumor, sell the tax plan"?


Or was it simply time for the stock market to catch its breath?


Either way, Wednesday's mild losses did little to upset the long-term rally in stocks. As seen in the Market Pulse table, the current outlook remains at "Confirmed uptrend," which was upgraded from "Uptrend under pressure" on Monday as the Nasdaq composite roared to new highs.


The Nasdaq ended Wednesday's session flat while the S&P 500 lost less than 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrials 0.1%. The market ran into sellers in the final half-hour of the day, erasing earlier gains, after details were revealed on President Trump's ambitious plan to cut the corporate tax rate to a historically low 15%, while simplifying the exemptions and deductions that surround the ever-complex tax code for individual filers.

Indeed, stocks have enjoyed a refreshing advance since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections. Institutions saw the Trump win and Republican control of both the House and the Senate as paving the way for an era of lower taxes, fewer industrial regulations, and the dismantling of ObamaCare.


Nearly 100 days into office, Trump has achieved some cuts in regulations, but failed to get Congress to pass an alternative form of federal-scale health insurance. Already the media and politicians are buzzing with criticism over whether the new tax plan will lead to even more staggering government debt or larger budget deficits.


Opinions are opinions. But the fact is that stocks have had valid reasons to continue rising since a new uptrend was confirmed on June 30 last year.


The U.S. economy continues to jog along, not sprinting, but not moving like a tortoise either. Interest rates have been rising, but not to the point that a recession is crouching like a tiger in the bamboo thickets, ready to pounce. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond has recovered some lost ground, now at 2.30% and up from a recent near-term low of 2.18%.


That yield pales in comparison with forward-looking 12-month earnings yield for the S&P 500, which is still well over 5%.


Historically, the bull run is long in the tooth, yet we also had two of the very worst bear markets in the country's history over the past 17 years (2000 to 2002, down 78% on the Nasdaq; and 2008 to 2009, down 58% on the S&P 500). In other words, this is a weird time in equities.


Over the long term, few would doubt that a successful plan to reduce America's corporate tax rate and encourage multinational companies to repatriate cash earned in overseas markets back into the country would lead to a boost in business spending. The Reagan rally, which started in earnest with a follow-though on Aug. 17, 1982, proved that a supply-side approach to growing the economy does work.


Reagan first cut the tax on windfall profits in the oil industry in August 1981 with Congress' passage of the Economic Recovery Tax Act, then followed the next year with lower corporate and income tax rates. In the bipartisan-supported Tax Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress slashed the highest marginal tax rates and shaved the number of tax brackets, thus simplifying the system.


According to economic historians, Reagan's first measures to slash taxes caused the federal budget deficit to balloon, which helped send interest rates soaring to 20%. The result? The second part of the so-called "double dip recession" of 1978-1982. The Dow industrials collapsed 25% from a May 1981 high of 1030 to a mid-August 1982 low of 769.


For now, investors must make their buy and sell decisions based on facts presented by the day-to-day action of the market itself. And lately, those facts show reasons to stay bullish in stocks.


One, the breadth of the advance is improving. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line continues to rise and is threatening to reach new high ground. The NYSE's A-D line, as seen in the daily chart of the S&P 500 on IBD's general market indicators page (see the link at the bottom of this column), already notched new highs earlier this week.


Two, new highs are booming. In IBD's screened list, 251 stocks on the Nasdaq hit 52-week or all-time highs on Monday, and another 304 on Tuesday. In contrast, there were just 26 new lows on each day, respectively.


Three, all of the major indexes are holding above their 50-day moving averages.


Four, first-quarter earnings surprises among S&P 500 firms continue to be above the long-term trend, according to research by the $34 billion money management firm Glenmede. Through Friday, 78% of reporting S&P 500 firms beat the consensus profit view, up from the 65% that hit the upside in Q4 of last year. Jason Pride, director of investment strategy, notes that his firm's research "projects a similar rate of surprise for the remaining 80% of companies yet to report."


Five, as seen in the new high list, sector rotation is alive and well. While banks led the run-up in November to January, these days retail, medical and software firms have taken the leadership baton.


Wednesday's industry group action underlined this rotation.


 Among the nearly three dozen industry groups that rose 1% or more, they included numerous groups from the Leisure sector, ranked No. 4 among [33 sectors in IBD's database](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-apr-26-2017/) and holding a shiny 19.4% gain since Jan. 1; the retail-discount & variety group, which include new stars **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)); and some beaten-up industry groups such as auto retailing, major discount chains and apparel and shoe sellers.
Six, over-optimism is hard to find. Among options investors, the put-call volume ratio has recently got as high as 1.0 in recent weeks, reflecting that for 100 bullish calls traded, 100 bearish puts were also bought and sold. Plus, the latest Investors Intelligence survey shows 54.7% of newsletter editors feeling bullish about stocks, still off the recent Feb. 17 peak of 63.1%.

Nasdaq Hits High, Then Stalls; 5 Dow Stocks Are Near Buy Points
================================================================

Stock indexes posted a second day of small changes as volume kicked higher because of the expiration of options and futures.


The Nasdaq hit an all-time high but closed virtually flat, while the S&P 500 and blue chip Dow Jones industrial average each inched down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.4%, outperforming the market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP031717-206x300.png)Volume rose on both major exchanges. Friday was a quadruple witching day, when stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures expire. This often boosts volume.


Indexes faded late in the day, resulting in a stalling day for the Nasdaq, which raised its distribution-day count to four on the composite.


Blue chips were mostly up and included some good chart action. Among Dow components:


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is extended but completed a three-weeks-tight pattern Friday. The buy point is 141.12.


**United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) retook a 112.93 buy point in strong volume. **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) tried to clear a 130.10 entry in a cup-with-handle pattern but couldn't get the job done.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) continued work on a flat base. The stock needs about a 2% gain to clear the 66.01 buy point.


**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) has formed a four-weeks-tight pattern with a 34.63 buy point.


**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) is working on retaking a 112.09 buy point.


Dow components testing either their 10-week or 50-day lines include **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)). A bounce off the line in strong volume could establish a buy zone.


Several of these blue chips have Composite Ratings of 80 or better — not elite but not bad.


Economic news Friday had something for the bulls and the bears.


On the upside, the manufacturing segment of the Federal Reserve's industrial production report was better than expected. Leading indicators and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge topped views.


On the negative side, industrial production missed the consensus estimate, and the Baker Hughes rig count showed that the U.S. tally rose 3% vs. the previous week.


The coming week will feature a fair amount of economic data. On Monday, the Chicago Fed National Activity Index will be released. Home sales data will be released Wednesday and Thursday. Durable-goods orders will be reported Friday.


The housing-related data could give a lift or a dip to homebuilders. The homebuilders have been trying to crack into the top fifth of industry groups. In Friday's trading, the group was close, No. 42 among 197 industry groups, up from 82 three weeks ago.

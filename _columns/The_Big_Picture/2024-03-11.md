The stock market pared some losses Monday, doing its best to hold an uptrend that's come under threat from some of its pillars.




After a bearish price reversal Friday, the selling spread to Monday morning trading. Yet, some indexes came off session lows.


The S&P 500 ended the day 0.2% lower but had been down as much as 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 0.6% loss to close 0.1% higher. The Dow finished Monday above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) after dipping below it during the session.


The Nasdaq composite fell 0.4% and closed in the lower half of the day's price range. Energy, materials and utilities — sectors that don't favor the Nasdaq — outperformed on Monday's stock market.


Small caps lagged, as the Russell 2000 slid 0.8% and finished near session lows for a second straight day. Having topped resistance at the 2,000 level, the Russell now appears to be getting resistance around the 2,100 level.


Declining stocks topped advancers by a 7-5 ratio on the Nasdaq. Winners and losers were nearly even on the New York Stock Exchange.


Stock Market Indexes Hold 21-Day Line
-------------------------------------


![Market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP_5x4_031124.jpg)For now, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to get support at their 21-day exponential moving averages. That trend has withstood some harsh tests the past couple of months.


After sharp sell-offs on Jan. 31, Feb. 13, Feb. 20 and March 5, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 bounced right back. Each time, the 21-day line served as a safety net.


The line, thus, plays a significant role in judging the stock market's uptrend. It's fair to say that if the S&P or Nasdaq break the 21-day line, the stock market uptrend will be in peril.


Investors also can judge a market uptrend by leading stocks. Bearish reversals in the charts of **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)), **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)), **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) should come as a warning after prolific gains.


Friday's 4.5% drop for Nvidia cost the artificial intelligence chip company $128.53 billion in market cap, the most of any single day in its history, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


A bearish reversal for the PHLX Semiconductor Index could be the culmination of a run for the index that exceeded 65% from an Oct. 31 low.



Moreover, chip leaders such as **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)), which erased a 17% gain from its 73.53 buy point, and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), with a bearish reversal, offer ominous signals for the sector. Nine of the best-rated chip equipment stocks gapped down Monday.


Some Market Leaders Struggle
----------------------------


The IBD 50 index, a proxy for institutional-quality growth stocks, tumbled 1.9% Monday. Techs were among the weakest performers in the IBD 50. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) lost 4.4%, **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) fell 5.6%, **GigaCloud Technology** ([GCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GCT)) slid 10.3%, and **CleanSpark** ([CLSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLSK)) tumbled 16.5%.


The stock market has been piling up [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), suggesting that institutional investors are taking some of the fat profits accumulated over the past four months.


The S&P 500 has five such days of losses in higher volume and the Nasdaq four days over the past five weeks. Lower volume Monday kept the Nasdaq from adding another distribution day.


With risks increasing, IBD maintains a suggested exposure level of 60% to 80% in stocks for your portfolio. Lately, there hasn't been much new leadership to take up the slack for the softening leading stocks.


At trading desks Tuesday, it's all hands on deck at 8:30 a.m. ET for the February consumer price index. [Economists predict](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/&nbsp;) price gains will stay nearly the same as they were in January, when CPI rose 0.3% month to month and 3.1% on a 12-month basis.

  Stock Market Uptrend Intact As Small Caps Surge, But Software Sell-Off Hits Nasdaq

If you were only looking at the Dow Jones and S&P 500 Friday, the session looked pretty quiet. But it was far from quiet on the Nasdaq as software stocks faced a round of selling. Seven of the day's 10 worst-performing groups hailed from the [software sector](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), with losses ranging from 2.4% to 6.9%.




A key part in gauging stock market health is paying attention to the price action in leading growth stocks. In this vein, Friday's session was disconcerting.


IBD's enterprise software group slumped 3.5%, hurt by another sell-off in **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)) shares. On the heels of a 17.7% plunge Thursday, Fastly slumped another 11.5%, ending the week just above its 10-week moving average. Another leader in the group, **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), plunged below its 10-week line after reporting earnings, an unequivocal sell signal. **BlackLine** ([BL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BL)) also dived below its 10-week line.


Other big decliners in the group included **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) and **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)). Losses ranged from 5% to 7%. When leading stocks start to break down in the stock market, it can be a precursor to a broader market pullback.

The Nasdaq closed lower by 0.9%, and volume rose from Thursday, giving the index a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). The Dow Jones industrials edged higher by 0.2% and the S&P 500 inched up 0.1%. All three indexes continue to hold comfortably above short-term support levels.


Stock Market Leaders
--------------------


The Russell 2000 small-cap index surged 1.6%, helped by strong showings from **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)), **SailPoint Technologies** ([SAIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIL)), **Overstock.com** ([OSTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSTK)) and **iRhythm Technologies** ([IRTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRTC)).


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) cleared a 150.30 handle buy point on Monday and hasn't looked back. Meanwhile, after a breakout over a 270.64 buy point, the SPDR Dow Jones ETF ([DIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIA)) is getting into position for another breakout try over its June high of 276.38.


The stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend until proved otherwise. After seven straight gains, some selling in the Nasdaq wasn't surprising. Keep in mind that the index was also close to the top of a price channel headed into the session. The Nasdaq rose above that channel on July 13 before reversing sharply lower in heavy volume. The Nasdaq bumped up against its channel line on July 21 and reversed lower again.

At this point, it's perfectly fine trimming some of your big winners to cut exposure. But it's too early to get too bearish. Leading software stocks have come under pressure, but several other stock market leaders look just fine, including stocks in the retail sector like **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)).

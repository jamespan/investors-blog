Dow Jones Beats Nasdaq; The Stock Market Rally Could Expand This Way
=====================================================================

No tech investor going long in stocks likes to see the Nasdaq fall the way it did on Tuesday. Nor do they like to see the Nasdaq lag the Dow Jones Industrial Average.




But a 0.8% decline by the Nasdaq composite following giant-size gains earlier in the month seems reasonable. Plus, strength in commodity, cyclical and industrial stocks helped cushion the blow.


For more on one of the industrial sectors that did really well on Tuesday, please read the [IBD Stock Of The Day feature](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/transdigm-stock-buy-boeing-supplier-sales-growth/) on **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)). The supplier of aerospace components joined [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as a half-size position Tuesday.


The Nasdaq composite made a two-day losing streak for just the second time in 2019. The last time, on Jan. 11 and 14, the index gave back 1.1%.


This time around, the Nasdaq has lost just under 2% in the past two sessions. Yet given the big rebound off the market's lows around Christmas, such a drop seems quite normal. As seen in the General Market Indicators PDF file found at the bottom of every Big Picture column, the Nasdaq is now trying to build a home above its 50-day moving average.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MP012919-736x1024.jpg)In a healthy stock market, expect the Nasdaq and other key benchmarks to lead their respective 50-day lines, not lag it.


That's the case for the S&P 500 (down less than 0.2% on Tuesday) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (up 0.2%). A few sector averages fared better. The Dow Jones transports rallied 0.5%, even as West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures jumped more than 2% to $53.24 a barrel. The S&P SmallCap 600 ended virtually flat.


Bullish Chart Action, Not Just By The Dow Jones
-----------------------------------------------


For the past six sessions, the S&P 500 seems to have traded in a relatively tight range of 2610 to 2675. Throughout this period, the large-cap benchmark closed each day above its 50-day moving average.


That's quite a change from the swift and meaty rebounds that took place in both early and late November. In the former instance, the S&P 500 failed to cross back above the 50-day moving average. In the latter, it closed above the 50-day line for a single session before rolling over into bear-market territory.


Volume fell on both main exchanges Tuesday. That's exactly what you want to see in a confirmed market uptrend. When the indexes rise in heavy or higher turnover and fall in less volume, you are getting a clear-cut message from Wall Street. That message? The big funds, pensions, endowments, banks, insurers and the like are not anxious to lock in gains just yet.


No one would dispute that there's plenty to worry about. But real uptrends somehow find a way to climb the proverbial wall of worry.


Earnings misses, poor revenue outlooks, runaway inflation, an overly hawkish Federal Reserve (it wraps up the first meeting of 2019 on interest rates on Wednesday), prospects for deflation, a long and drawn-out trade war with China, and unexpected exogenous shocks (have you seen what's happened to **PG&E** ([PCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCG)) stock lately?) all go into the calculus of stock prices.



Some Stock Market Leaders Need More Time To Heal
------------------------------------------------


Wall Street downgrades can impact the very best growth stocks, too. **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) slumped 10% in heavy turnover following negative comments from Raymond James analyst John Davis. The stock has a lot of work left before completing a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). After a strong run that got ignited by a beautiful breakout past a 15.59 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [six-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) in February 2017, it should come as no surprise that certain market leaders such as Square need more time to digest their sterling gains.


If you look across the spectrum of [IBD growth stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), you won't see many charts that look like Square.


Rather, you might actually be cultivating a pretty thick watch list of quality companies that are trading closer to their 52-week highs than the major indexes. Watch for handles to form. And in those handles, the decline from high to low should be much less than the correction seen in the base.



Take **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)). The global online marketplace is forming a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The decline within the handle, 6.6%, is a fraction of the 28% drop within the cup portion. A 56.52 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) has emerged.


**Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) is building the right side of its own base, so far a cup. No handle has formed.


The Street sees earnings rising 40% to 21 cents a share in Q4 for Etsy and up 111% to 38 cents a share for Match, the owner of Tinder and many other dating apps. Please read this recent [Inside The IBD 50 column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/growth-stocks-biggest-earnings-sales/) on why it's critical to look at prior-year results, not simply current estimates.


Inside The IBD 50
-----------------


Match ranks No. 7 in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).



IBD 50 stocks mostly fell in quiet trade. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 0.5%. Yet at 30.13, the ETF is up 9.1% year to date. That beats a 5.3% rise for the S&P 500 and a 5.9% gain by the Nasdaq.


The mid-cap S&P 400 has motored ahead 9.2% since Jan. 1, the small-cap S&P 600 up 8.5%.

  Stock Market Correction Picks Up Steam; Stocks To Watch Include Amgen, Arch Resources

The stock market took another step back Tuesday amid more strength in the U.S. dollar and the 10-year Treasury yield near its highest level since 2007. Sentiment was also negative after the latest reading on consumer confidence came in below expectations along with August new-home sales.




Wall Street is worried about a lot these days, including the fact that interest rates could stay higher for longer. Fears of a recession have abated, but a stronger-than-expected economic recovery — along with higher oil prices — could fuel sticky inflation.


Another key inflation data point is due Friday with the release of the August Personal Income & Spending report. On a month-over-month and year-over-year basis, the headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is expected to increase from July. But month over month, the core PCE price index is expected to come in at 0.2%, unchanged from July, with core prices up 3.9% year over year. That's still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, but it would be lower than July's reading of 4.2%.


The 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 4.55% just after the stock market close, up 1 basis point. The yield jumped nearly 12 basis points last week and is up another 12 basis points so far this week.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite slumped 1.6% and undercut Monday's low, killing the one-day rally attempt. The index also undercut its Aug. 18 low, raising the probability of a visit to the 13,000 level. A break below this level could be the shakeout the stock market needs for some sort of tradable rally before the end of the year. But that's far from a sure thing with the market in a pronounced distribution phase.

Meanwhile, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) continues to hold just above the 400, a key support level to watch. It remains below its 50-day moving average. Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq by just over 2-to-1.


The S&P 500 swooned 1.5% and looks poised for a test of the 4,200 level. The index's 200-day line is just below 4,195. Declining stocks swamped advancers on the NYSE by more than 5-to-1.


Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Energy Select SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) held up the best Tuesday, falling just 0.6%. XLE is trading near the 90 level, which is very close to its 21-day exponential moving average.


After finding support at its 200-day line Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up that level Tuesday, falling 1.1%. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) was one of only two gainers in blue-chip index. After a low-volume pullback, the biotech is holding above short-term support levels and trading near a 268.24 entry.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


The damage to leading growth stocks has been widespread, although several oil and gas stocks, along with insurers, continue to show relative strength.


Among oil and gas producers, **CNX Resources** ([CNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNX)) is holding support at its 10-week moving average at it forms a giant cup-with-handle base.


In the oil refiner group, **Par Pacific** ([PARR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PARR)) is testing its 10-week line for the first time after soaring out of a cup base.

Meanwhile, **International Seaways** ([INSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSW)) and **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) outperformed in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) with gains of 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively.


Crude oil transporter INSW has its [sights set on a 48.40 entry](https://www.investors.com/research/oil-prices-drive-growth-stock-in-ibd-50-higher-amid-rising-oil-demand/) after finding support at its 50-day moving average. TDW stock is finding support at its 10-week moving line for the second time after a breakout from a consolidation in late June.


**Frontline** ([FRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRO)), tracked in the same industry group as INSW, closed just below an 18.75 entry. But after eight straight price gains, it's best to wait for the stock to pause and digest gains.


In the coal group, **Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) has a bullish [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of A, helped by several higher-volume gains since late July. Arch closed just below a cup-with-handle buy point of 163.75.



Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), insurance stocks like **Arch Capital Group** ([ACGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACGL)) and **Goosehead Insurance** ([GSHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSHD)) are worth watching. ACGL has a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) in new high ground as it forms a cup base, while GSHD has pulled back in light volume as it holds above the 10-day line and a 73.85 handle buy point best seen in the daily chart.

What To Do Now
--------------


In the current market, though, it's not about targeting bullish technical setups and buying them — even if the setups are from strong performing industries and sectors. A weak market tends to take everything down with it. When IBD put the stock market in a correction last week, the recommended invested percentage was lowered to 0% to 20%.


But the bond market is quite oversold, along with the major stock indexes. That means a bounce for the bond market and stock market could happen at any time, especially since stochastics point toward a very overbought U.S. dollar. The Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish ETF ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) shows 10 straight weekly price gains.


Now is the time to be building a watchlist of stocks so you're prepared for the possibility of a year-end rally. A [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/) can occur as early as four days after the start of a rally attempt.

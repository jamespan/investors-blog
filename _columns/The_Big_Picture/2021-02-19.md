Unable to find direction much of the day, the stock market Friday closed narrowly mixed. But it wasn't a wasted day for the bulls, because small caps and leading stocks vastly outperformed.




That's been an occasional theme in [this year's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/): The broad indexes hardly move, but small caps and leaders outperform. It happened again Friday, when the Russell 2000 rallied 2%. The small-cap benchmark is beating the main stock indexes so far in 2021, about doubling the Nasdaq's 7.7% increase.


The IBD 50 jumped 1.8% after several components rose sharply. **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) surged 6.3%, breaking a six-day losing streak. **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) leapt nearly 7% after the company [beat fourth-quarter expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/trade-desk-stock-ttd-earnings-q42020/).


**Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) rose 6% to a new high, as natural resources stocks extend gains. **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) gapped to a new high after the semiconductor equipment company beat profit estimates. The company also gave a bullish outlook, which [helped ignite a rally in the chip sector](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/tech-leaders/amat-stock-leads-rally-semiconductor-equipment-stocks/). VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) rose 2.2%.


**![MP021921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP021921-231x300.jpg)Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) and **SciPlay** ([SCPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCPL)) climbed to new highs.


Those moves offset sell-offs in some health care leaders. **Hologic** ([HOLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOLX)) plunged 8.1%. **Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)) gapped down 12% in a post-earnings sell-off. **Meridian Bioscience** ([VIVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIVO)) plummeted 10.3%. Those were substantial losses in an index that hadn't seen many sell-offs this year.


Stock Market Risks Lurk
-----------------------


Those heavy losses are a reminder that even if the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, there are areas of high risk. Skyrocketing stocks such as **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)), **EXP World** ([EXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPI)), **Riot Blockchain** ([RIOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIOT)), **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) and Bitcoin investor **MicroStrategy** ([MSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR)) appear due to come back to Earth.


The S&P 500 eased 0.2% Friday and the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.1%. For the week, the Nasdaq fell 1.6% and the S&P 500 0.7%.


Indexes closed near session lows, although the day's price ranges were relatively small. The Nasdaq found support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) Thursday. That's significant, because the index has bounced off that level twice since the early November [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat but still notched an intraday all-time high. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Dow Inc.** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) led the industrials Friday, reflecting the emerging leadership in cyclical stocks. Plastics, specialty alloys and machinery are some industry groups climbing since the start of the year.


The stock market seems to feel better about the ebbing coronavirus pandemic. [Breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) Friday included hotel chains **Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)) and **Hilton Worldwide** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)) plus hotel REIT **RLJ Lodging Trust** ([RLJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RLJ)). IBD's airline industry group ascended about 4.5% as some half-dozen of the 20 stocks made 52-week highs.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared higher on the NYSE. Breadth was much stronger than the indexes would have you believe: Advancing stocks beat decliners by 2 to 1 on the NYSE and better than 2 to 1 on the Nasdaq.

Stock Market Sells Off As Facebook Parent Suffers Historic Loss; Amazon Soars On Earnings
==========================================================================================

The stock market sold off Thursday, as techs plunged and **Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) [crumbled more than 26% on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fb-stock-drops-meta-earnings-miss-estimates/), hindering a stock market rally that is already short on investing opportunities.




Meta Platforms lost more than $230 billion in market capitalization — the largest single-day loss in market value ever recorded for any U.S. company, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Meta's [quarterly earnings missed expectations,](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fb-stock-drops-meta-earnings-miss-estimates/) and the social media giant gave a cloudy outlook.


After the stock market close, e-commerce titan **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and automaker **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) reported their quarterly results. Amazon stock surged, while Ford skidded in after-hours trade on disappointing sales and a soft outlook.


Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 1.5% Thursday, while the S&P 500 moved down 2.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dived 3.7%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 descended 1.9%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP020322-258x300.jpg)Volume fell on the Nasdaq, despite that trading in Meta Platforms of 185 million shares was nearly nine times larger than its average of about 21 million, and about 127 million more shares than Wednesday's total. Volume also appeared to be slightly lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Top growth stocks were also hit hard, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slid 2.3%. The ETF of top growth stocks snapped a four-day winning streak.


The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up above 1.82% Thursday and is back near recent highs. Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices climbed sharply, as West Texas Intermediate crude topped $90 a barrel for the first time since 2014.


The market could be in for an unpleasant surprise before the market opens Friday, when the Labor Department releases January's jobs report. Econoday's consensus estimate is for an increase of 150,000 jobs. But earlier this week, the National Employment Report from ADP showed that companies unexpectedly cut 301,000 jobs in January, far below estimates that called for the creation of 225,000 jobs during the month.

Following Monday's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), the stock market remains in an uptrend, but Thursday's sharp losses are clearly a cause for concern. The only silver lining amid the day's carnage was lower volume compared with Wednesday, which means the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both avoided [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Investors still have the ability to buy new breakouts, but proceed with caution. One problem is that there's been relatively few breakouts, and most have been in cyclical and financial sectors.

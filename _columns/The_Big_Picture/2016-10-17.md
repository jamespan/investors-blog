Major stock indexes didn't move much Monday, ending with small losses in light volume, as Wall Street weighed more earnings reports.


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow each lost 0.3%. Small caps performed mostly in line with the market, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.2%.


The market didn't seem too concerned about a downbeat reading in New York-area manufacturing. The October Empire State manufacturing index contracted for the third straight month in October, coming in at -6.8 vs. the consensus estimate of 1.


![mp101716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP101716.png)Nice earnings beats from **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) didn't fuel much enthusiasm. BofA added 0.3% after an initial 1.2% pop. Charles Schwab lost 0.9% even after reporting its fourth straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Schwab did manage to close in the top half of its intraday range as it holds above its 50-day moving average.


Mining, steel and coal stocks outperformed. Retail stocks and oil drillers lagged as crude oil settled below the $50-a-barrel level for the first time since Oct. 7. West Texas intermediate crude oil for November delivery lost 1% to $49.86 a barrel.

The IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks lost 0.4%. There are still plenty of names acting well, including **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)). Both are showing supporting action at their 10-week moving averages.



Meanwhile, IBD 50 member **Match.com** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) is trading tightly above a recent buy point of 17.10. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) is also showing tight weekly closes near its 10-week moving average as the stock works on a flat base with a 53.03 buy point.


Still, it's been a challenging environment in the growth space for some time now, and it's getting even harder amid increasing signs of distribution.


The S&P 500 shows five distribution days since Sept. 29, or five in the past 13 trading sessions. When days of institutional selling start to cluster like this, it's reason to be even more cautious. Limited exposure to growth stocks makes sense; aggressive exposure does not.


The benchmark index has also been getting resistance at its 50-day moving average for several days now. The Nasdaq followed the S&P 500 in sinking below its 50-day line last week. It tried to rally above it Friday but reversed.


Also consider that some growth names are having a difficult time moving even when headlines are positive. Recent positive analyst chatter around **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) hasn't done much to help the cause of either stock. They're still big leaders and aren't doing anything wrong, but sluggish price action just shows that new buyers remain reluctant.


All this adds up to a market where the risk level is elevated. Leading stocks aren't flashing sell signals, but recent price action in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 has been raising yellow flags.


Monday's after-hours session served up some fireworks, thanks to better-than-expected earnings and subscriber growth from **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Shares soared 20% after earnings per share of 12 cents doubled expectations. PowerShares QQQ ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) rose 0.3% in after hours trading.

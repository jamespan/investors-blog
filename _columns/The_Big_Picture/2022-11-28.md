The U.S. stock market came back from the Thanksgiving weekend with an appetite for selling.




Indexes fell sharply and broadly as Wall Street matched weak action throughout global markets. Several key events coming later in the week also kept investors on guard.


On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a [speech at the Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/events/federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-the-economic-outlook-and-the-labor-market/) on the economy, inflation and the labor market. Even a whisper from Powell gets a lot of attention from the stock market these days.


Also on Wednesday, a revised GDP for the third quarter comes out. The November jobs report is due out on Friday.


The stock market also is keeping an eye on earnings reports. Dow component **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) is one of the biggest names, with results due Wednesday. Retailers **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG))**, Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Kroger** ([KG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KG)) may illuminate the mood of U.S. consumers.


Stock Market Indexes Off About 1.5%
-----------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite sold off 1.6%. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.4%. The Russell 2000 was among the worst indexes, down more than 2%.


The S&P 500 closed back below the 4,000 level, just three sessions after winning it back. The Nasdaq remained in a sideways range, still above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The Dow Jones, for its part, sank back below the 34,000 level.


Following a half session on Friday, volume naturally swelled in Monday's full session. Because today's losses came in higher volume, the Nasdaq and NYSE added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). IBD makes no allowance for such cases when determining distribution days.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP_112822-257x300.jpg)But making an apples-to-apples comparison, Nasdaq volume was still higher. Trading levels were higher at 1 p.m. Monday compared with the 2.16 billion shares traded all day on Friday.


On the flip side, NYSE volume was below Friday's total at the same time today.


Declining stocks topped advancers by a 5-to-2 ratio on the Nasdaq and by about 7-to-2 on the NYSE.


Global Markets Fall On China Unrest
-----------------------------------


Global stock markets focused on China, where growing protests over Covid-19 lockdowns threaten to hurt that nation's economic activity and choke major supply channels.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) sank 2.6% and closed below the 50-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 10. Protests at a Foxconn factory in China are expected to slow production of some iPhone 14 models.



[Demonstrations erupted in several major cities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-clamps-down-on-protesters-against-zero-covid-policies-11669647813?mod=hp_lead_pos5) over the weekend in a rare defiance of China's rulers. The government responded with a crackdown on protests and public gatherings.


The Shanghai composite fell nearly 0.8% while the Hong Kong Hang Seng sold off 1.6%. But in U.S. trading, the iShares MSCI China ETF ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) rose 1.1% and iShares China Large Cap ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) rose 0.9%.


In Europe, the London FTSE 100 Index fell 0.2%, the German DAX was down 1.1% and the Paris CAC 40 Index lost 0.7%.


The China news hit commodity prices, with gold down 0.8%, silver off 2.4% and copper down 0.4%. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 1.3% to $77.24 per barrel and hit the lowest point since January before trimming losses.


Energy stocks fell broadly, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) down 2.7%. The ETF is now below the 93.41 buy point of an irregular base.


Weakness in energy stocks hit the IBD 50, where nearly half of the stocks are oil, gas or solar-related. The index fell 2.4% Monday.


Stock Market Watches Fed Remarks
--------------------------------


Fed officials Monday reiterated their battle against inflation remains far from done.


St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told MarketWatch the [Federal Reserve will likely need to keep its benchmark policy rate above 5%](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-will-likely-need-to-keep-interest-rates-above-5-into-2024-to-succeed-in-taming-inflation-bullard-says-11669663361?mod=home-page) for most of 2023 and into 2024 to succeed in taming inflation.


Bullard said it appears financial markets continue to underestimate the degree to which the Fed will need to keep policy tight to control inflation.


Earlier Monday, New York Fed President John Williams said he [expects inflation pressures to ease](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-discuss-outlook-for-inflation-interest-rates-11669654763?mod=hp_lead_pos3) but cautioned prices may decelerate to levels still above the Fed's 2% target.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 3.7%.

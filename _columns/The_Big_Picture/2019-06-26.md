Stock market indexes posted mixed results Wednesday as President Donald Trump played bad cop on trade to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's good cop.




Mnuchin said a trade deal with China is 90% complete, but Trump said China wants "a deal more than I do."


Trump will meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Saturday at the G-20 summit in Japan.


Whether Wednesday's remarks from Trump and Mnuchin were coordinated or not, the result was the same: The stock market [remains hostage to U.S.-China trade relations](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-next-six-months-2019/).


Reversal In Stock Indexes
-------------------------


The Nasdaq popped as much as 1.1% early Wednesday and then retreated to a 0.3% gain. The S&P 500 fell 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a little less than flat. Indexes closed near session lows, a trend that's appeared since indexes made last week's highs.

Three Outcomes For Trade Talks
------------------------------


Many market-watchers see only three possible outcomes to the Trump-Xi talks.


The best outcome would be a breakthrough that leads to an agreement. The stock market would likely rally in that situation.


Second best would be a temporary fix that holds off on more U.S. tariffs for a fixed period, such as 60 or 90 days. Market choppiness might be expected in that scenario.


The worst outcome would be a breakdown in the talks, followed by a surge of tariffs. No one especially wants to think about that outcome, but it likely would be painful to the bulls.


Crude Oil Shows Muscle
----------------------


Oil was the chief area of strength Wednesday. Light sweet crude jumped $1.63 to $59.46. Factors driving the price up were a bigger than expected drop in supplies, and the aftermath of a refinery fire in Philadelphia.


The consensus estimate on crude oil supplies was for a 3.1 million-barrel drop. The decline came in at 12.8 million barrels.


In the meantime, the Philadelphia refinery is expected to close permanently. The fire began early Friday.


Stocks Moving Up
----------------


Among all stocks, action was mostly wait and see. Few issues made much of a splash.


Exceptions included **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), up 3%; oil explorer **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)), up 5%; and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), up 13% on an earnings beat. Micron's results helped spark a rally in chip stocks.



One way to measure the impact of the U.S.-China trade standoff is to look at performance since May 6, when Trump announced that China had reneged on the deal.


The biggest gainers in the period since have been the gold miners group (up 22%) and meat producers (up 17%).


Looking at the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), the best performers since May 6 have been **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)), up 45%; Brazilian payment processor **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), up 40% and **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), up 38%.


Before the open Thursday, the government will give the third reading on first quarter GDP. The consensus view is for a 3.1% increase.

If Shakespeare were a beat reporter covering the Fed, would he have posted this headline today: "Much Ado About Nothing, At Least Until Inflation Truly Returns"?


The stock market seemed to telegraph this message Wednesday, as the key indexes inched higher following the release of minutes from the July 26-27 Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates. The notes revealed little new about the U.S. central bank's "go slow" strategy.


The small-cap Russell 2000 gauge slipped 0.3% while the S&P 500 edged nearly 0.2% higher. The small-cap S&P 600 also fell nearly 0.3%.


![MP081716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP081716.jpg)The Nasdaq composite rose fractionally. Utility, meat, tobacco, RV makers and railroad stocks paced the upside. Volume grew on both exchanges.


Not all aspects of the trading session were rosy.


The Russell 2000 continues to lag the S&P 500; at 1227, it's still more than 5% below an all-time high of 1295 set in June of last year.


The breadth of the market was mixed. While winners edged losers on the NYSE by a slender margin, the opposite occurred on the Nasdaq, where losers surpassed winners by a 7-to-5 ratio.


Finally, the new-high list continues to thin. When fewer companies are making 52-week or all-time highs, there are likely fewer stocks breaking out of good bases. Fortunately, the biggest components of the list, in terms of industry sectors, no longer look like the national convention for dividend hunters. Take Tuesday's list, which you can see by going to "[Stock Lists](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/)" at Investors.com and clicking on the [data tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) portion. Among the top four contributing sectors in terms of new highs, all four are growth-oriented: banks, business services, building and leisure.


Just a few months back, REITs and utilities held a Caesar-like grip at the top of the list.


Still, a rise in the major indexes in higher volume is always a blessing for the bulls. However, Wednesday's session was also practically as tame as it gets on a quiet day in August, although some travel booking and video game software stocks also rallied solidly.


The financial media was gearing up for a big reaction to the 2 p.m. ET release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's late-July decision on short-term interest rates. William Dudley, vice chair of the Federal Reserve, piqued fund managers' interest during a TV interview on Monday by noting a possibility, no matter how mild, of raising interest rates for the second time since last December. However, the minutes reaffirmed the U.S. central bank's desire to take an extra-gradual approach toward normalizing the cost of money.


With dull GDP growth, weakness in U.S. wholesale (down 0.4% in July) and consumer prices (flat in July), the November election between Hillary and The Donald, and lingering nervousness over a future EU sans Britain, who can blame the Fed?


Observers on Wall Street aren't expecting much on the policy front in the next month or so, including the annual summer retreat for central bankers around the world in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which will likely include an address by Fed chief Janet Yellen on Aug. 26.


"This statement was another 'on this hand, but on the other hand' statement -- clearly, equities, treasuries, and the US dollar believe that Chair Yellen won't offer her hand to either camp in her Jackson Hole speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at **Prudential Financial** ([PRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRU)).


From the lens of the market's leading stocks, the view is still pretty good.


Take a look at the upper echelon of the IBD 50. None of top 15 currently in the list are poised to undercut their 50-day moving averages. A stock trading above its 50-day line is rising faster than it normally would over the past 50 sessions. **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), No. 16 in the list, is a rare leader these days to undercut the pivotal 50-day line. The $5-and-below retailer fell more than 2% to 46.42, sinking further below the important midterm support line.


Finally, more turnarounds may be in store for the market and astute watchers. **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) gapped up on strong quarterly results, rising 15% to a 52-week high of 36.05 after posting a 27% jump in second-quarter earnings per share, the biggest increase in 13 quarters. In the 2000s, the operator of its namesake clothing and interior goods shops and Anthropologie boutiques was a major leader among retailing stocks.


So, what's different today? Their Anthropologie stores still have cutting-edge interiors. Yet the robust sales gains of the past simply aren't there. Q2 revenue rose just 3% to $891 million. In contrast, IBD 50 members Five Below, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and dining play **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) grew their latest quarterly revenue by 25%, 24% and 37%, respectively.

Stocks today reflected mixed action that's quite typical for a bull market that is also showing some rotation.




While the Nasdaq gave back 0.2% on Tuesday after solid gains of 1.8% in the prior two sessions, the S&P also ended its two-day win streak, down 0.5%. The latter had just marked a new all-time closing high. One could excuse the large-cap index for pausing. Since the Oct. 30 low near 3234, the S&P 500 had scaled nearly 13% in the course of just six sessions.


Volume inched lower on the Nasdaq, so that index narrowly skirted a [new distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the books. But Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which follows the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq, edged 0.3% lower.


NYSE volume fell sharply vs. Monday's level.


A New Technical Tool To Examine Stocks Today
--------------------------------------------


For the first time, the General Market Indicators PDF now features the advance-decline line of the Nasdaq. Please see the link at the bottom of this story, as well as on the [Market Trend webpage](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). This makes it easy to monitor the breadth of the rally among Nasdaq-listed issues.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped nearly 0.6%. That's reasonable after gains of 1.4% and 1.6% the prior two sessions. Meanwhile, more money made its way into companies with market caps in the $1 billion to $10 billion range. SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) rose for a third straight day, rising 0.2%. And iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) made a nifty reversal on Tuesday, turning a 1.9% early loss into a 0.5% gain.

Five Reasons To Stay The Course
-------------------------------


![MP111720](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP111720-203x300.jpg)Market signals offer five reasons to remain bullish about stocks.


One, the market appears to be taking negative headlines in stride. Coronavirus cases — at least the known ones — are hitting new daily records in the U.S. [France joined the 2-million-case club](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). Retail sales grew in October but missed the Econoday consensus view for 0.4% growth vs. the prior month.


Yet market veterans are seeing a little more light at the end of this dark economic tunnel.


"The global population couldn't have asked for more from the Moderna vaccine. With an almost 95% efficacy and more acceptable logistical and storage dynamics, today's news should solidify the market rally that has been in play since last week," Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, told IBD in an email. "Visibility towards a return to normality is increasing, and this should provide more fuel to the reflation rally, with small caps, value and cyclicals clear beneficiaries."


Two, the level of heavy institutional selling appears barren. As the Market Pulse shows, the [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) is low. Sell-off days in higher volume get kicked off the count after 25 trading sessions pass, or if the indexes make substantial upside progress vs. the closing price following a distribution day.


Three, true market leaders are not acting too badly.


Is The Software Sector Resting For Another Future Move?
-------------------------------------------------------



The Market Pulse shows clearly that top stocks that rose in heavy turnover swamped those dropping in above-average trade. Sure, some are licking their recent wounds after breakouts failed. But many are trying to settle down.


Watch to see if the balance shifts more toward net institutional demand vs. supply. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) and **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) serve as good barometers for market conditions in the enterprise software field.


Four, the market's internals showed some shiny elements. On the NYSE, rising stocks actually beat falling ones by a roughly 4-3 margin. On the Nasdaq, winners edged out losers by a little more than 100 issues. Plus, sector rotation benefits the general health of the bull market. Why? While the beaten-down sectors of Wall Street catch up and advance, leading sectors can take a break. Investing pros often like to say the market needs time for the "E" (or earnings) to catch up with the "P" (price).


Palo Alto Breaks Out
--------------------


Five, breakouts still remain sparse on the current landscape. But a few are showing stunning power.



Consider **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)). In the course of two days, the stock has vaulted as much as 13% past a breakout point of 260.25 in a symmetrical [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/), one of the most bullish chart patterns for growth stock pickers.

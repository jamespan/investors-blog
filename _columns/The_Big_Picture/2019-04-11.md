Stock Market Steps Back, But Leaders Hold Up Well
==================================================

U.S. stock indexes took a timeout Thursday, as small moves characterized the session. Yet in a broader sense, the stock uptrend's leadership continued to do well.




The Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 each sanded off about 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average filed off less than 0.1%. The large cap S&P 500 closed just above flat.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Leaders attracted little volume. Trade was up 40% from normal for only three stocks in the IBD 50.

Fastenal [reported earnings that beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/fastenal-earnings-q1-2019-fastenal-stock/), sending shares to a record high.


Four Top Sectors
----------------


Going into Thursday's session, four sectors constitute the leadership so far this year: electronics, up 29%; computer, up 28%; semiconductors, up 27%; and software, up 27%.


Most of the leaders in those sectors marked quiet gains Thursday. Two are of particular interest right now.


Electronics contract manufacturer **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)) is working on a cup base. The stock needs more time to complete the base and is about 4% shy of the buy point. Fabrinet inched up 0.2% Thursday.


Software security provider **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is sketching a base-on-base pattern. The potential buy point is 260.73. Palo Alto is about 5% shy of testing that entry. The stock rose 1.5%.


An additional [nine software stocks near buy points](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/how-to-invest-nine-software-stocks-that-could-begin-fresh-ascents/) were highlighted in a recent IBD column.


IPO Power
---------


The power of the software stocks is clear, and an initial public offering launched Thursday underlined that strength. San Francisco-based digital enterprise company **PagerDuty** ([PD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PD)) made its debut on the NYSE. The stock popped 59% to 38.25 from its pricing at 24 Wednesday. On Thursday, it opened at 36.75.


PagerDuty lost money in fiscal 2018 and 2019. The fiscal year ends in January. Sales growth was [very strong in 2019, up 48%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pagerduty-ipo-tufin-software-initial-public-offerings/). Young companies sometimes focus more on revenue growth than profits in their early years. And sometimes the Street accepts that.


Other IPOs expected to launch in the near term include conference software firm Zoom, photo-sharing network [Pinterest](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinterest-ipo-initial-public-offering-2/) and ride provider Uber.


Uber rival **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) had a rough IPO start in late March. The stock lost 5% in the week ended April 5 and an additional 18% so far this week.


Random Notes
------------


First-time jobless claims came in at 196,000, below the lowest estimate in economists' range of estimates (210.000). The reading was the most bullish since 1969 and suggested strength in the U.S. economy.


White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said he is optimistic about the U.S. reaching a trade deal with China. "We've made good progress," Kudlow told The Hill.


The IBD-tied exchange traded funds Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) and Breakout Opportunities Fund ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) rose 0.2% each on a sluggish day. With leading stocks outperforming Thursday, there some underlying strength in the market.


But biotechs struggled as the iShares Nasdaq Biotech Fund ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) skidded 1.8%. In fact, the health care sector was broadly weaker.


Watch For JPMorgan's Report
---------------------------


Before the opening bell Friday, the Street will be awaiting the release of **JPMorgan Chase's** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) quarterly earnings report. Analysts expect earnings to rise 4% to $2.35 a share vs. the same time last year.

The stock market took another positive step Monday, and the question now is whether indexes can sustain their rebound.




The Nasdaq composite's 1.4% advance was enough to take the index back above its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq 100 outperformed, up 1.7% as major techs **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) added more than 2% each. The Nasdaq 100 also closed above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Two of the three megacap techs that are noted above hold a spot in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


The S&P 500 has been a step ahead of the Nasdaq, having bounced off its 50-day line twice in the past two weeks. On Monday, the S&P 500 secured a bit more room above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) after a 1% increase. When the S&P 500 wants to climb, it seems there's no wasted motion lately: The four times the index rose since touching the 50-day line on May 12, it's done so with gains of 1% or more.


The IBD 50 rose 1.5% Monday. **Upstart Holdings** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)), one of the star performers lately [in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), reversed badly, however.


![MP052421](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP052421-236x300.jpg)Despite signs that the stock market is shaking off its May malaise, indexes [remain under pressure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/). Investors must remain cautious, being extra careful with any new stock purchases. [Cutting losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), as always, should keep investors out of big trouble.


Some Stock Market Internals Look Weak
-------------------------------------


Why the extra care? For one, few breakouts in the past several weeks have produced sizable gains. Also, some market internals look soft.


The [NYSE advance-decline line](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DailyGMI052121.pdf) is near highs, indicating good participation at an individual stock level by that part of the market. But breadth is weaker in the Nasdaq. Its advance-decline line has been making lower lows and lower highs since February. Monday's breadth only confirmed the diverging trends: Advancing stocks led decliners by nearly 2-1 on the NYSE and were about even on the Nasdaq.


Volume continues to dry up, including days when it should be rising. Monday's strong Nasdaq gains came in below-average volume. In fact, Nasdaq turnover has been below average nearly every day since mid-February. The S&P 500 has been more active, but now seven [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) have piled up in the past few weeks. Both indexes are burdened with [Accumulation/Distribution Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of D-.


Growth investing remains largely out of favor. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) is up less than 6% this year.


So, with the market fickle, it is smart for the time being to avoid heavy exposure to stocks.


On Monday, strength in technology made the Nasdaq the day's winner. Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) jumped 1.8% and is back above its 50-day line.


Parsing the sector, you'd find that semiconductor and internet stocks hoisted the technology sector the most. Internet content, chip equipment and chip designer groups were in Monday's top 10 out of 197 groups. Chipmakers were the day's No. 25 top-performing group on a price-weighted basis, while some software groups made it into the top 30.


Internet Stocks Also Lead Market
--------------------------------


The S&P Communications Services sector, mainly internet companies, rose 1.8%.


Some new buy opportunities started emerging since last week's stock market bounce. Some of that is in natural resources, where fundamentals are mixed.



Oil producer **Range Resources** ([RRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RRC)) has rallied about 20% from its [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in a low-price base and an 11.70 entry earlier this month, according to [MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


In consumer stocks, **Medifast** ([MED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MED)) has risen 17% from a 279.56 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Children's Place** ([PLCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLCE)) is up about 12% from an 84.33 buy point.

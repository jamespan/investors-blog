title: More Stocks Join The Post-Coronavirus Rebound; Did The Bears Miss This Factor?

Some market observers may have called this uptrend, confirmed by an [April 2 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), fake and false. One beef they had? It's simply a FAANG rally.




Such bearish sentiment may have gone into full hibernation now.


The Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% and logged its fourth up day in a row. At Wednesday's high of 9707, the top index for growth stocks is a 1.3% gain away from moving past its Feb. 19 all-time peak of 9838. The Nasdaq 100, up 0.5%, stands less than 0.4% beneath its February high.


And yet these two key indexes took a back seat to the strength of other sectors on Wall Street. Clearly, the market is showing more confidence that the U.S. economy is going to make a real comeback.


Post-Coronavirus Rebound: Which Stocks Led Today?
-------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP_060320-199x300.jpg)The SMIDs — jargon for small and midcap stocks — enjoyed another buying surge.


The SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ETF rallied 2.7% and closed above its slow-moving, long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since Feb. 24.


IShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), another popular exchange traded fund, rose 2.4% and outstretched a 1.4% advance by the S&P 500.


Long-dated U.S. Treasuries sold off. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond soared 9 basis points to 0.77%.


"In the early stages of the post-March 23 waterfall recovery, one of the criticisms of the rally was that the gains in the popular averages were dominated by megacap growth names that hid weakness in the average stock," Ed Clissold and Thanh Nguyen of Ned Davis Research wrote in a June 2 client note. But they added that "breadth thrust indicators, such as 90% of stocks above their 50-day moving averages, trigger about two months after bear market lows."


This indicator came on schedule on May 26.

As further proof that equity investors embraced more of a "risk-on" cap, consider the S&P 100, which tracks the 100 largest companies traded in the U.S. exchanges. It rose almost 1.1%.


A wider advance within the rally bodes well for stock pickers.


You can see that in the new highs list that IBD publishes each day after the market close. Go to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to see the list. On the new highs page, click on "New Highs" and you'll see which sectors dominated the lists.


[In the Tuesday edition](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jun-02-2020/), a total 139 issues on the Nasdaq and NYSE stroked a new 52-week or all-time high. The day saw just seven new lows. And Wednesday's numbers should reflect more stocks hitting new highs.


This points to the higher possibility of institutional-quality stocks [making a breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from a [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Volume bulged on both main exchanges vs. Tuesday. Such gains in higher turnover signal more enthusiasm by trading desks across the country to deploy more capital.


From Coronavirus Crash To Teflon Uptrend?
-----------------------------------------


The ADP private sector payrolls report for May seemed to set the stage for a healthy gain in the stock market Wednesday. Losing 2.76 million jobs for the month is awful. But that decline came in well under the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for a nearly 8.7 million-job plunge.


Investors hinted that they weren't going to wait for Friday's upcoming and broader U.S. jobs report.


The market is clearly climbing a thick wall of worry. It's been built with bricks of concern over a second wave of Covid-19 infections, the impact that George Floyd-inspired demonstrations may have on retail sales, and the "Cool War" (as opposed to the U.S.-Soviet Cold War) that one Asia expert once termed between the U.S. and China.


What some may have not expected, however: Corporate share buybacks may stay strong.


S&P Dow Jones Indices reported that with more than 95% of data for the S&P 500 firms now in, managers of these companies made a combined $198.4 billion in buybacks for the first quarter of 2020, up from $181.6 billion in Q4.


"While the buybacks may have been in line with the expectations at year-end, they are significantly higher than the updated March estimates. The take-away is that companies were mostly in for the quarter, even as many banks suspended their Q2 buybacks in mid-March," Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Global, wrote in a Wednesday note.

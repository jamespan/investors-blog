Nerves got the best of the stock market early Monday to start a week of earnings reports in the fragile banking sector and new data on inflation. But indexes eliminated most, if not all losses by the closing bell.




Indexes wavered during the session but firmed up in the final few hours. For the second-straight session, the stock market closed well off lows and at the day's highs.


While the stock market is not in high gear, it is doing remarkably well considering the Fed continues a tightening campaign, earnings are weakening, a recession could take hold and geopolitical flare-ups threaten global stability.


The Nasdaq composite continues to hold above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). For the second-straight session, it dipped below the 12,000 level but closed above it. It opened with a loss of nearly 1.4% but fought back to close less than 0.1% lower.


The S&P 500 also is well above its 50-day line and has built a 4% cushion above its 200-day average. In a nearly identical price bar to Thursday, the S&P closed 0.1% higher after falling 0.8% near the open. (The stock market was closed Friday for Good Friday.)

Volume eased on the NYSE and rose on the Nasdaq from Thursday's preholiday totals.


Megacaps Lead Stock Market
--------------------------


The IBD 50 index outperformed Monday with a 0.7% increase. The index is edging out the S&P 500 so far this year, up 7.5% even though it's been rangebound since February.


Semiconductor, software, biotech, homebuilding and select consumer stocks have been leading the IBD 50. This shows there are opportunities in growth stocks despite some hesitation in the major indexes.


Investors are smart to focus on stock market leadership but, overall, it is narrowly concentrated in the largest stocks. It is also predominantly focused on growth rather than value.


While the Nasdaq is up more than 15% so far this year, the Nasdaq 100 index is up better than 19%.


The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weighted ETF ([RPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RPS)) is up less than 2%, while the S&P 100 index has climbed more than 10%.


And if you take the so-called FAANG and other megacap stocks, the performance gap is much greater. MicroSectors FANG+ ([FNGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNGS)), which tracks only 10 megacaps, is up a staggering 36%.


Small caps are lagging, with the Russell 2000 barely higher for the year. Broad selling in regional banks and worries that lending may seize up for smaller companies hurt the index.


Growth is beating value by a mile. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) is up 13.4%. IShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) is trailing with a 0.9% gain.


Such concentration of strength forces investors to be good stock pickers. Keep an eye on the IBD 50, [MarketSmith 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) and other screens for opportunities.


Fund Investors Pull Away From Stocks
------------------------------------


A sense of caution prevails among individual investors, who remain reluctant to put money into stocks and continue to pour cash into fixed income funds.


Investors took out $2.6 billion from equity exchange traded funds last week, the third weekly outflow in the last four weeks, according to Refinitiv Lipper.


Investors took $3.4 billion out of large cap ETFs, $1.6 billion from small cap ETFs and withdrew $1.2 billion from financial/banking ETFs. Those were the top groups to log outflows the week ended April 5.


Meanwhile, fixed income ETFs saw a net $6.1 billion inflow, for the seventh straight weekly increase.


Big Week For Bank Earnings, Inflation
-------------------------------------


The stock market this week gets [first-quarter reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/unh-stock-rallies-q1-earnings-4-financial-giants-headline-earnings-calendar/) from**Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)). This comes at a time of low confidence about banks and worries of tighter lending. Comments from those banks and their conference calls could be telling.



In the most important of several economic reports this week, the March consumer price index will be announced Wednesday before the open.


Nomura expects core inflation to remain elevated at 0.5% vs. the previous month, and to accelerate to 5.7% on a 12-month basis, from 5.5% in February. That's a bit hotter than consensus estimates.


Nomura economists Aichi Amemiya and Jacob Meyer believe month-on-month core goods (excluding food and energy) inflation accelerated, offsetting a moderation in core services inflation.


After falling for eight straight months, used vehicle prices should edge higher. Limited supply probably pushed up new car prices, the economists added. Higher prices for vehicles and apparel products likely outweighed the negative impact from other core goods prices.Â Services inflation should see the start of a deceleration trend in rents. But airfares and lodging prices probably continued to rise.


Later Wednesday, the Fed will release April meeting minutes. On Thursday, the producer price index will offer another reading on inflation. Initial jobless claims is another potential market mover that day.

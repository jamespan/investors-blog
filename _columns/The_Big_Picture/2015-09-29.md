Stocks Finish Mixed As Selling Wave Slows
==========================================

The stock market closed mixed Tuesday, as sellers slowed their assault. The Nasdaq fell for a sixth consecutive day, dropping 0.6%. The S&P 500 edged up 0.1% after a late rally erased a loss of as much as 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.6%.

  

Volume eased on the major exchanges yet remained heavy. Declining stocks led advancers by 9-to-7 on the NYSE and by 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.

  

The main indexes are perhaps poised to test their August closing lows and thus have an opportunity to put in at least a short-term low.

  

After sliding nearly 10% in less than two weeks, the Nasdaq could be due to snap back.

  

The survey from Investors Intelligence has an unusual tilt of more bears than bulls among advisors. Such excessive fear can ultimately be good for the market.

  

But the put-call volume ratio — practically infallible as an indicator of short-term lows for more than a year — hasn't worked lately. The ratio spiked above 1.1 several times this month.

  

Yet the market remains shaky. Sentiment indicators are secondary gauges, but the repeated failed signals are a symptom of the difficult market conditions.

  

The IBD 50 was broadly lower Tuesday, falling 0.5%. Its medical components — once a strength — are now dragging its performance. Biotech and other pharmaceutical industry groups were among the day's worst again.

  

Building stocks were broadly lower. The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index dipped 0.2% in July but rose 5% vs. a year earlier.

  

The medical sector has lost its spot as a market leader. But as usually happens in market corrections, the demise of one sector can lead to the emergence of others and fresh leadership.

  

IBD's ranking of 197 industry groups (on Page B4) shows some groups rising in the past few weeks, including airlines, regional banks and telecoms.

  

**Meridian Bancorp** ([EBSB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBSB)), a small-cap based in Massachusetts, broke out of a base Tuesday. Shares climbed past the 13.76 buy point in heavy trading.

  

The food sector had been shaping up for a leadership role, but this week's implosion of **Post Holdings** ([POST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POST)), **Pinnacle Foods** ([PF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PF)) and **Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)) (which missed profit expectations) has soured those chances.

  

Investors will need to be patient before committing capital in any serious way until the market makes a follow-through.

  

The way that breakouts are faltering left and right illustrates a danger with [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/).

  

Of about three dozen stocks that IBD's database identifies as recent breakouts, some 20 are below buy points. Most of the rest are modestly above entries.

  

One investing strategy that is working now is [short selling](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm).

  

When former leaders attempt to regain their downward-sloping 50-day moving averages, opportunities exist to make money on the short side.

  

It's a risky alternative to buying stocks on the long side but one that can be rewarding during weak markets.

  

This can be a good time to brush up on short-selling skills, provided that you control risk just as you do on the long side. The [Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/) on IBD's Leaderboard has a few stocks identified as short-sale plays, some of which already have been profitable in that role.

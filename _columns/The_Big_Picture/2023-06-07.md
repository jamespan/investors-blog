Just when perhaps some folks thought that the stock market is heading into a FOMO phase — fear of missing out — the market does its job of keeping investors in check. At least, that's what Wednesday's session appeared to convey.




However, Wednesday's trading also contained elements of confidence in the economy as well as the banking sector. And a quick rundown of the top performers shows why.


First, let's look at the leading index in 2023. The Nasdaq composite, heading into Wednesday's session with an eye-opening 26.8% year-to-date gain — spent the first 15 minutes of trading in the black before sinking the rest of the day. By the close, the tech-fortified gauge dropped 1.3% to 13,104, only 15 points above its session low of 13,089.

That decline topped a mild loss of 0.4% for the S&P 500.


But like the moon, if one side of the market was dark, the other side shone brightly.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Small caps bathed in the bullish spotlight. The Russell 2000 rallied 1.8%. The session marked the second day in a row of 1%-plus gains and hoisted the popular index to a three-month high. Meanwhile, the S&P SmallCap 600 shot 2.4% higher on Wednesday.


Blue chips also enjoyed gains overall, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.3% higher.


Nonetheless, the session underscored the importance of these three IBD investing principles:


* Do not chase a stock beyond the 5% buy zone from the [breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).
* Avoid buying shares if they've already rebounded more than 10% after a [pullback to the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).
* Strongly consider taking at least partial profits when [your stock has rallied 20% to 25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) from the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Just consider leaders including **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) (rallying 22% after a breakout past 276.76), **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) (up as much as 25% from a 178.84 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)), and prostate cancer testing innovator **Lantheus** ([LNTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNTH)) (a 34% gain after clearing a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 75.10).


Distribution Count Update
-------------------------


All of the equity averages discussed above continue to trade above their 50-day moving average. Three months ago? Not the case.


Amid a confirmed stock market uptrend, you wish to see indexes rise in higher volume vs. the prior session and fall in lower turnover. Wednesday's case? It turned out to be a session of earnest profit taking by mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, pension plans and the like. Nasdaq volume jumped 10% while the NYSE saw turnover bulge nearly 14% vs. Tuesday.


Thus, the Nasdaq scored its third [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) over the past 25 sessions. The S&P 500 lost its May 2 distribution due to time. But as the Market Pulse shows, the count stays the same at six with Wednesday's new bout of distribution.


What made Wednesday's session interesting? The market did not paint with bearish strokes alone, particularly when it comes to viewing the market under the hood.


For starters, breadth continued to improve.


On the Nasdaq, advancing issues actually outweighed declining ones by a nearly 5-4 margin. On the NYSE, the ratio widened to virtually 2 to 1 in favor of the winners.


Also, IBD readers can witness rising institutional demand via the resurgence of companies making new highs. Headed into Wednesday's session, the Nasdaq has seen more stocks hit 52-week or all-time highs vs. lows for four sessions in a row. Over that time frame, on average 104 stocks on the Nasdaq made new highs, vs. 39 new lows. (Go to Stock Lists at Investors.com, then [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to see the daily list of new highs vs. new lows. Both lists divvy up the stocks by broad industry sector.)


Check The Stock Market Internals
--------------------------------


What accounted for this divergence? Give credit to the banking sector and energy stocks.


Looking at the daily performance of the [197 IBD industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), at least 20 rallied 3% or more, early data showed. That's not a misprint — up 3% or more. Oil royalty trust stocks led the way, up 4.3%; oil and gas drillers rebounded 4.2%, and coal miners sprung 4.1%. Light sweet crude oil futures closed the day above $72 a barrel.


Other big winners included Northeast banks (up 3.7%), Midwest banks (up 3.6%), oil refining (3.5%), international oil exploration (3.3%) and construction and mining machinery (3%).



**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) outperformed the Dow Jones, rising 1.9%. The broker dealer and wealth management giant finished its ninth straight session above its 50-day moving average.


Shares, however, still remain more than a stone's throw away from its year-to-date high of 86.63. And its three-month Relative Strength Rating (available on MarketSmith, in the Technical section of the stock's Related Information Panel) is still less than savory at 36 on a scale of 1 to 99.


Wednesday's session carried a defensive aroma as well.


The Dow Jones Utility Average added almost 1.8% for its third gain in four sessions. Without question, the utilities still lag in 2023.


In contrast, leading stocks, as profiled in key stock lists such as the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), succumbed to heavy profit taking amid a stock market that has embraced the theme of investing in AI quite seriously for weeks, if not months.

What About Volatility?
----------------------



Elsewhere, IBD readers should remain vigilant about the return of stock market volatility. Sure, the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) remains unusually low, finishing Wednesday at 13.94.


That marked the lowest level since the week ended Feb. 21, 2020, just before the stock market collapsed under the weight of the global Covid-19 pandemic. But another Federal Reserve meeting lies just around the corner. On June 13-14, Fed board governors will decide on whether or not to raise short-term interest rates for the fourth time this year.


"There is certainly a motivation to get in front of a Fed pause, which historically has been an almost guaranteed rally," veteran fund manager Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates wrote in comments sent to IBD. "But the central bank bet has a few clouds emerging; both Australia and Canada have raised rates in the face of a slowing economy due to stubborn inflation trends, as stagflation is seen as worse than suffering through a recession to break inflation."


The probability of a fourth quarter-point rate hike now? According to the CME FedWatch tool, futures traders see a 33.8% chance of a quarter-point hike to a 5.25%-5.5% target range, up from 8.5% a month ago.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond ticked 8 basis points higher to 3.78%.

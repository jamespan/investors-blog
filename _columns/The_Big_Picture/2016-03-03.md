Stocks kept mostly to a narrow range Thursday as the market awaited Friday's jobs report for February.


The Nasdaq added 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each rose 0.3%.


![MP030316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP030316-1-213x300.jpg)Small caps elbowed to the front as the S&P 600 gained 1.1%. The IBD 50 was flat.


Volume inched up on both major exchanges.


Leaders were quiet, with few moving up or down in volume. Restaurant stocks, however, continued to heat up.


**Carrols Restaurant Group** ([TAST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAST)) retook a 14.10 buy point Thursday in volume 233% above average. The stock is thinly traded. Carrols owns and operates more than 700 Burger King restaurants in 16 states.


**Panera Bread** ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) cleared a 208.10 buy point Tuesday and padded the gain Thursday with a 2% pop in volume about 10% above average. The stock remains in the 5% buy zone.


However, volume was only 4% above average on the breakout. A proper breakout cranks volume up at least 40% above average, which is a sign that funds are buying.


**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) staged a breakaway gap in huge volume Feb. 25 and has been trading bullishly tight since then. A breakaway gap is a breakout that leaps past the entire previous trading range of a base.


**Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) broke out Feb. 23 and remains in a buy zone up to 42.97. The stock added 0.36 to 42.24 Thursday.


IBD's restaurants industry group has turned on the high heat. The group rose in 15 of the past 16 sessions, boosting its rank among 197 industry groups from No. 117 to No. 49.


Meanwhile, the defensive stocks are beginning to trail the key indexes. From the Feb. 11 closing low, the small cap S&P 600, Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbed 12%, 10% and 9% respectively. The Dow Jones utility average booked a 1% gain.


The move from defense to the more aggressive small caps is a good sign for this uptrend.


Another good sign is the improvement in the balance of new highs and new lows. While the highs tally isn't yet emphatic, the new lows count has faded.


In economic news Friday, first-time jobless claims were 3% higher than expected. Factory orders for February missed views. However, the ISM nonmanufacturing gauge topped views.


February payroll data will be released Friday before the open.


After the close, **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) reported fiscal Q3 results ended in January. The company trounced the Street's view on earnings and sales. Shares rose 5% in after-hours trading.

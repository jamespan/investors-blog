  Why The Nasdaq Outperformed; Netflix, Amazon.com Play A Role

The Nasdaq composite made the best of a stock market rebound, absorbing an initial 1.4% loss and reversing higher for a 0.5% gain. The market is extending its uptrend, even if it didn't entirely look that way Monday.




Strength in **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), semiconductor and software shares gave the Nasdaq an advantage over other indexes. This, even while S&P 500-heavy industries such as oil and metals performed well also.


The S&P 500 fell 1% after being down as much as 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 off nearly 2.8%.


Normally, the day before a three-day holiday results in slower trading. But volume Thursday was above average on the NYSE and Nasdaq. Whatever the reason, lower volume Monday meant the S&P 500 avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP-042020-234x300.jpg)The pace of the market's advance slowed the past couple of sessions, and investors may expect a pullback after robust gains since the March 23 lows. Judging from many Wall Street analyst reports, there's fear that the major indexes will roll over and test the March lows.


While that can't be ruled out, the current analysis shows a market trending higher. Minor distribution since the [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/)Â by the S&P 500 on April 2 stands as a good sign.


A week ago, the Nasdaq topped its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA), a short-term indicator that has been discussed frequently in the [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) lately. Today, the Nasdaq has closed five straight sessions above that line. The price ranges of all those days have plotted above the 21-day exponential average, too. The S&P 500's 21-day EMA traces a similar path.


The main problem with today's market is that while the fields are well irrigated and fertilized, there's little to harvest. That is, too few stocks have broken out since the [April 2 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/). Most stocks are still in recovery phase, not quite ready for new highs. That's not surprising given the deep losses growth stocks suffered in the [coronavirus bear market](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/).


Sellers Not Gone From Stock Market
----------------------------------


In general, the market has not wrung off sellers that much. As of last week, there were [3,358 stocks with Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of D or E](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GMI_041320.pdf). In contrast, there were 1,472 stocks with A or B ratings.


Slowly, a few are clearing [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). On Monday, Netflix broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 383. 11 buy point. The [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock is growing subscriptions as much of the world is shutting itself indoors.



Canaccord Genuity raised its price target on Netflix to 450 from 415 and maintained a buy rating. Analysts raised their net subscriber addition estimates by about 21% for Q1 and by about 5% for the full year. "The revision to net addition estimates reflects both an increase of new customer additions and a reduction of subscriber churn due to additional time spent at home and a lack of other entertainment options, particularly no live sports," the analysts said in a report.


Evercore also [made bullish comments on Netflix](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/netflix-stock-surges-app-downloads-go-gangbusters/).


Amazon.com surged more than 6%, also on coronavirus factors. The company is [adding thousands of workers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/online-grocery-why-amazon-delivery-service-stalling/) as it tries to keep up with a flood or orders. Amazon.com shares are nearing a 2,186.05 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in what is so far a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


Mining leaders **Franco-Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)) and **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) also [rose above buy points](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/top-stocks-breaking-out-to-new-highs-two-leaders/).


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) outperformed with a 0.6% increase. Netflix, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) contributed to the IBD 50's gain.


The energy sector showed some relative strength in today's stock market. Oil prices fell modestly and remain sluggish, trading around $22.50 a barrel late Monday. Major oil producing countries finalized a deal Sunday to [cut output by nearly 10 million barrels a day](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-opec-meeting-russia-saudi-arabia-us-output-cuts/) in May and June, and smaller reductions for the next two years. Goldman Sachs analysts called the agreement insufficient to address the global oil glut.

Stock Market Rises Again As Signals Turn Positive; Santa Claus Rally On Deck?
==============================================================================

The major indexes extended their Christmas-week rally, and investors got a gift of sorts as more positive signals came out of the stock market.




The S&P 500 made a new closing high Thursday after rising 0.6%. For the holiday-shortened week, the index made a positive reversal and rose 2.2%. The Nasdaq composite added 0.8% Thursday and 3.2% for the week. The Nasdaq still lags the S&P 500, but offered some good tidings. It closed above its Dec. 16 high, and above a trend line touching the highs since the Nov. 22 peak. The composite also is nearly 1% above its 50-day moving average.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE, which meant each of the week's gains came in dwindling trade. That's normally a bearish signal, although optimists will argue that the volume decline has something to do with the holiday approaching. (The stock market is closed Friday for the Christmas holiday.)

Change In Stock Market Outlook
------------------------------


Add it all up, and [IBD's market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) now improves to a confirmed uptrend. The uncertainty that led to "uptrend under pressure" is receding.


For investors, this means sharpening your watchlist and raising exposure back into stocks. But do so carefully. The stock market remains volatile, and many top-rated stocks suffer from choppy chart action. After a period of relative calm, December has been the [most volatile month since September 2020](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-leans-toward-recovery-as-these-sectors-lead-3-stocks-hit-buy-points/).


The stock market is picking up momentum just in time for its traditional Santa Claus rally. This year-end trend — identified by the authors of the Stock Trader's Almanac — says the market rallies in the final five days of the year and into the first two sessions of the new year.


The Santa Claus rally has delivered gifts for stock investors the past five years, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Returns were mostly modest, except for the Nasdaq's 2.1% climb in the 2018-19 Santa rally. What if Santa doesn't come? When the rally doesn't materialize, the Grinch arrives. The Stock Trader's Almanac says those years tend to bring bear markets, or a significant decline.

IBD 50 Climbs, Beats Key Indexes
--------------------------------


The IBD 50 rose 1.1% Thursday, edging back above its 200-day moving average. Although off its December lows, the IBD 50 remains 6.6% down for the month and on pace for a second straight down month.


Some buying opportunities can be found in the index.



**West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)) topped the 458.09 buy point of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). But volume was light. **West Fraser Timber** ([WFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFG)), showcased in Thursday's [Industry Themes column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-industry-themes/), also made a low-volume breakout out of a cup with handle. **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)), new in Leaderboard, sprang up from the 10-week line. **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) broke out of a base Wednesday and remained in buy range from the 301.82 buy point. The stock also occupies space in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), where resistance around 290 was used for an entry.


Despite post-breakout volatility, **Customers Bancorp** ([CUBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBI)) is back above its 61.58 buy point. Keep an eye on **Harmony Biosciences** ([HRMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRMY)), which closed almost at the 44.49 cup entry.

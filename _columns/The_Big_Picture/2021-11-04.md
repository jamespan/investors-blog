The major stock indexes ended on a mostly positive note Thursday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 set more record highs. In a solid day for growth stocks, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) continue to set the pace.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Nasdaq led the major stock indexes higher Thursday, rallying 0.8%. The S&P 500 followed up with a 0.4% gain. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average and small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.1% apiece.


Leading growth stocks climbed sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 1.5%, closing within striking distance of Sept. 23's record high. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)) climbed 4.9%, breaking out past an 80.62 buy point in a cup with handle. A potential flaw is the stock's lagging RS line.


Volume inched lower on the Nasdaq, but rose on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's numbers.


What To Do Now
--------------


The stock market rally put in a mixed performance Thursday with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting more record highs. The Nasdaq extended a win streak to nine sessions, while the S&P 500 rose for a sixth straight day. The Dow 30 took a breather after Wednesday's all-time highs.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 now each have just one distribution day. The Nasdaq's Oct. 22 distribution day fell off the count due to the 5% rule: Once an index rises at least 5% from the close of the distribution day, then it is considered no longer relevant.

With the stock market at all-time highs and a small amount of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), investors should remain bullish on the confirmed uptrend. But is the stock market rally too extended now, and should investors be expecting a pullback?


The Nasdaq closed Thursday over 6% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), which is about when some previous pullbacks have started. Looking back at previous pullbacks, the Nasdaq closed 4% above its 50-day line on Sept. 7 ahead of an 8% correction. On Feb. 12, the Nasdaq ended 7.7% above its 50-day line before declining about 13% from its highs. On Sept. 2, 2020, the composite surged more than 11% above its 50-day line before falling sharply over the next few weeks.


While a pullback is certainly possible, it's important to remember to interpret the daily action as opposed to making predictions about what may or may not happen. Despite an extended rally, investors should still be looking for new buying opportunities to increase market exposure, but be sure to buy properly. Don't chase stocks out of the 5% buy zones. On the sell side, be sure to cut losses after [sell signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). And it's also OK to take some profits into strength to help avoid some potential downside.



Stock Market Leaders Continue To Outperform
-------------------------------------------


AMD jumped 5.3%, reaching the [20%-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) from a 114.59 entry in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/). Rival [Nvidia surged 12%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-excitement-for-chipmakers-metaverse-strategy/) Thursday, closing about 29% above a 230.53 buy point. The stock triggered the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/), but investors could still take some profits, especially ahead of the company's earnings results on Nov. 17. Early Thursday, Wells Fargo Securities reiterated its overweight rating, while raising the price target from 245 to 320.


Microsoft rose another 0.7% to new highs, its seventh gain in the past eight session. The stock is about 10% above a 305.94 flat-base following an Oct. 18 breakout.


EV leader Tesla hit another record high Thursday, gaining 1.3%. The stock is about 37% above a 900.50 buy point.

Late-stages bases have less upside and are more likely to fail than earlier-stage patterns.

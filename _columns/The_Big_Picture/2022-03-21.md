Stock Market Hits Resistance Levels As Powell Backs Aggressive Tightening If Needed
====================================================================================

After rallying for its best week since November 2020, the stock market throttled back Monday. While a pause was not surprising, the point where it happened left something to ponder.




The Nasdaq composite, after a seesaw session, closed 0.4% lower. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1% after paring losses.


Following last week's rally — the Nasdaq and S&P 500 made their best gains since November 2020 — it wasn't surprising for indexes to catch their breath. Both made [follow-through rally confirmations](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) last week, which [changed IBD's market outlook to "confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-as-fed-chair-powell-grasps-this-challenge-these-areas-shine-brightest/)."


But on Monday the Nasdaq met resistance at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), while the S&P 500 got stopped at its [200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/). The S&P did manage to close above the neighboring 50-day average.


The charts suggest the stock market could spend some time consolidating gains from last week's surge before resuming its advance. That's no reason to stop buying stocks right now, but it is a reminder that market volatility will make stock gains harder to gain and manage.


Stock Market Pulls Back On Powell Comments
------------------------------------------


Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ruined lunch for many traders after he backed aggressive tightening if it's necessary to bring down inflation. Stock indexes were near session highs before Powell's remarks came out, and they sank once his quotes made it to Wall Street.

In a speech at an economic conference, Powell said the [Fed could raise interest rates with half-point hikes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-says-fed-will-consider-more-aggressive-interest-rate-increases-to-reduce-inflation-11647880218?mod=article_inline). Last week, the Fed raised rates by a quarter point in the first increase since December 2018.


The inflation outlook, Powell said Monday, had deteriorated even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the conflict — along with sanctions from Western nations — could further aggravate supply-chain disruptions and drive up commodity prices.


Nymex crude oil for April delivery rose $7.42, or 7.1%, to $112.12 a barrel. [Wheat futures jumped 5%](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/commodities?mod=nav_top_subsection). Silver rose 1.4% and gold 0.5%.


In stocks, small caps went farther south as the Russell 2000 lost 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 0.6% to end a five-day win streak.


Boeing Down After Plane Crash
-----------------------------


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) dragged on the Dow with a 3.6% decline in heavy trading. A Boeing 737  operated by China Eastern Airlines crashed in the Guangxi region. The plane was carrying 132 people.


While little is known about the crash, a [design or manufacturing flaw is not the likely cause](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-crash-china-grounding-unlikley/). The plane entered service in 2015. It's part of the 800 series of the 737 model, not the Max plane that was grounded for about two years after two deadly crashes.


The Nasdaq's loss Monday would have been a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) if volume had climbed vs. the prior session. But Friday's [witching session of options and futures expirations](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/options-expiration-witching-days-do-they-place-the-market-under-a-spell-or-not/) drove up volume, making it almost impossible for Monday's trading to match that volume. At any rate, Monday's volume was even lower than Thursday's on the Nasdaq and NYSE.



Stocks Leading The Stock Market
-------------------------------


While the market remains volatile, some opportunities exist in shipping, energy, health care and other areas. Just don't look for much in technology, where so many charts are just now rebounding. Software and chip equipment groups were some of Monday's poorest.


You'll find some well-groomed charts in **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Wesco International** ([WCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCC)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)). And shipper **Costamare** ([CMRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMRE)) has cleared a cup with handle.


Builders FirstSource and Wesco have both been featured in [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) at least once this year.


**MP Materials** ([MP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MP)), a miner of rare earths, broke out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and closed Monday's session firmly above the 47.40 buy point. A midcap leader in the stock market and Monday's [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mp-stock-near-buy-point-rare-earth-elements-green-energy/), MP showed a deeper-than-normal handle. **Darling Ingredients** ([DAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAR)), added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) as a quarter-size position, is forming another cup with handle.


The IBD 50 fell 0.1%. Fertilizer company **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)), Darling, steelmaker **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)), MP Materials, **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), **Zim Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)), Costamare and **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) rose more than 4%.

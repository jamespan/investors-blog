The stock market ended with modest gains and closed near sessions highs Wednesday after the Federal Reserve did what was expected and cut interest rates for the third time this year.




The stock market was mildly lower ahead of the statement, then turned modestly higher. The Dow Jones led the way, up 0.4%. The S&P 500 hit another all-time high, rising 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite also picked up 0.3%. Small caps lagged but closed off session lows, with the Russell 2000 down 0.3%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE came in slightly higher than Tuesday.


The Federal Open Market Committee [cut its key lending rate by 25 basis points](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-cuts-rates-again-but-thats-all-for-now-dow-jones/) to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%. The Fed's new statement said it will monitor incoming data "as it assesses the appropriate path" of monetary policy. That was a change from wording in the September statement that noted the Fed "will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion." Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also said that rate hikes are not on the horizon unless inflation rises significantly.

President Trump wanted to ink an initial trade deal at the summit with China's Xi Jinping.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


Stock indexes remain perched near highs, and the pieces seem to be in place for a year-end rally amid a shrinking [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count. If distribution days remain contained and the market continues to serve up breakouts among leading stocks, new highs for the Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite may not be far off. Indeed, leading growth stocks continue to act well generally.


Wednesday's modest gains were in stark contrast to a weak performance by the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which dropped 1.8%. [Sentiment was negative in the sector](https://www.investors.com/news/saia-earnings-trucking-stocks-hit-as-group-leader-c-h-robinson-miss-views/) after leading trucking stock **Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)) and logistics firm **C.H. Robinson Worldwide** ([CHRW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHRW)) plunged on earnings.


A big leader in the housing sector, **Taylor Morrison** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)), flashed a sell signal Wednesday with a decisive break of its 50-day moving average after the homebuilder's earnings report.


Overall, though, top-rated growth stocks continue to act well.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


[Software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) outperformed, although many of the moves still look like dead-cat bounces. Five of the day's top-performing industry groups in IBD's database hailed from the software sector.


The database software group rallied 2.7%, led by **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)). Shares jumped nearly 6%, but the stock is still 28% off its high. Still, if software stocks continue to rally, MongoDB could try to break out over a descending trend line, found by connecting the stock's recent highs. A trend line breakout would correspond with a move above the 140 level. **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) is also a candidate for a breakout over a trend line.


**Nice** ([NICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NICE)) is one of the last stocks left standing the security software group. The stock extended gains Wednesday after topping a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) entry Tuesday. It's still well within buy range from a 155.86 entry.


In the enterprise software group, **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) extended its winning streak to six sessions. After the close, the company reported another strong quarter, but shares were inactive in after-hours trading.


**DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) and **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) are two other enterprise software stocks that have held up well amid intense selling in the group. Both are extended.

CLOSE




Wednesday's session yielded at least two bullish breakouts. [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) was looking like a tired stock, trading below its 50-day moving average, ahead of its quarterly earnings report. But shares gapped up powerfully after the chip company reported a 50% rise in adjusted profit and 21% increase in sales to $94.2 million.


**Clean Harbors** ([CLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLH)) gapped out of flat base, rising 7% to 84.05, also on strong earnings.


Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) picked up 0.3% in Wednesday's after-hour session, helped by solid earnings reports from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). Both stocks were up 1% in late trading.

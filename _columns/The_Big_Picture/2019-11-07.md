The major stock indexes powered to record highs Thursday, but the day's early gains faded amid U.S.-China trade news.




China said the two countries had [agreed to phase out the existing tariffs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-to-remove-tariffs-bit-by-bit-if-partial-deal-clinched-says-beijing-11573129323?mod=hp_lead_pos1). Meanwhile, a U.S. official said the plan faces internal opposition in the White House.


The Nasdaq composite ended with a mild 0.3% gain, after rising as much as 0.9% and hitting a session high of 8,483.16. The S&P 500 also gained 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a 0.7% advance, or 182 points.


Strength in **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) helped drive the Dow Jones industrials to record highs. Goldman Sachs is breaking out above a 222.34 buy point in a flat base, while [Caterpillar stock](https://www.investors.com/research/cat-stock-buy-now/) is nearly extended from a breakout above a 140.72 buy point.


**Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) beat the Street's fiscal-Q4 estimates late Thursday. Disney stock jumped almost 4% in the extended-hours session to about 138.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP110719-246x300.jpg)Volume was mixed, coming in just above Wednesday's total on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on the NYSE.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) gained 0.4%, performing in line with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. The index of top growth stocks is trying to regain its 200-day moving average after spending about two months mainly below that key level.


Current Stock Market Rally
--------------------------


This week, all three major indexes continued to notch record highs, as the stock market uptrend extends gains. The [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) continues to dwindle, showing improving institutional sentiment.


Third-quarter earnings season is winding down, but there are still many companies set to report earnings and with each there are risks. Be particularly mindful of buying stocks ahead of earnings releases. On the upside, strong results can send stocks surging, often staging [bullish breakaway gaps.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) For example, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) broke out of a base Thursday, soaring 27%.


On the downside, weaker-than-expected earnings can result in sharp breakdowns. For example, former top growth stock **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) dove 16% Thursday after the [company's disappointing earnings outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q3-2019-roku-stock/).

IBD 50: Chinese Stocks Outperform
---------------------------------



Our index of leading growth stocks — the IBD 50 — performed in line with the major stock indexes Thursday amid strength in Chinese stock leaders **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **Huya** ([HUYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUYA)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)).


Notably, e-commerce giant [Alibaba's stock](https://www.investors.com/research/alibaba-stock-buy-now/) is in buy range above a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) 184.23 buy point after Wednesday's breakout. The 5% buy zone tops out at 193.44. Bearishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has a ways to go before a new high. Ideally, the stock's RS line should hit a new high on the stock's breakout.


On the downside, sell-offs in real estate investment trusts **CareTrust** ([CTRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRE)) and **Spirit Realty Capital** ([SRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRC)) weighed on the list of top growth stocks. CareTrust extended a losing streak to five sessions, with a 4.4% slide. Spirit Realty fell 2.5%, but remained above its 50-day line.


Stocks To Watch Amid Current Stock Market Rally
-----------------------------------------------


Top stocks to watch in the current stock market include today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), Dexcom, and IBD 50 stock **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)).


Dexcom stock staged a breakaway gap above a 178.55 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a consolidation after the company's "[massive earnings beat](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dexcom-stock-breaks-out-record-high-diabetes-treatment-giant-tops-quarterly-estimates/)." Shares ended the session with a 27% gain, closing at 194.70. In a breakaway gap, the stock's opening price can be used as the proper buy point. For Dexcom, the opening price was 185.20.



OLED stock is shaping a cup base with a 230.42 buy point. Shares remain about 13% away from entry after blasting up the right side of a new base following the company's Q3 earnings last week. Be on the lookout for a potential handle to form that would lower the risk-optimal entry.

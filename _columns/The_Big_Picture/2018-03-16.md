  Small Caps Pace Orderly Session As Wall Street's Attention Turns To Fed

The stock market turned in modest gains Friday as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite capped the week with weekly losses ranging from 1% to 1.5%.




Wall Street's attention in the coming week will be squarely on the Federal Reserve. The two-day meeting concludes Wednesday and a quarter-point hike is widely expected, which would lift the federal funds rate to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.


Small caps led the charge Friday, with the Russell 2000 up 0.6%. Buying was more subdued in the other major stock indexes, with the Dow up 0.3% and the S&P 500 up 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite ended fractionally higher. Option and futures expirations resulted in unusually heavy volume. Nasdaq volume surged, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE also soaring from Thursday's levels.


Clearly, the Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 small-cap index are the leading indexes at the moment as both hold comfortably above their 50-day moving average lines. To be sure, the price action in both indexes give the bull camp reason for optimism.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP031618-220x300.png)The market remains in a confirmed uptrend with limited signs of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), or institutional selling, in the Nasdaq. The story is a little different for the S&P 500, which currently shows six distribution days since Feb. 21. Of the six, three showed declines of 1.1% to 1.3% in higher volume. Readers of this column know that in 2017, the stock indexes were able to hold up in periods when the distribution-day count was even higher than that. But in many cases, the higher-volume declines showed modest percentage declines of 0.3% or 0.4% and didn't have the feel of unequivocal institutional selling.


Meanwhile, a look at the daily charts for the Dow and broad-based NYSE composite doesn't inspire much confidence as both indexes continue to face resistance at the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 is holding above the 50-day line but only by a whisker.


Still, the action in leading growth stocks has generally been strong as FANG names like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) continue to show exceptional relative strength with zero in the way of sell signals.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) doesn't have the look of the market leader it once was as price performance has started to flatten out a bit. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), meanwhile, is forming a cup-shaped base with a conventional entry at a 1,198.10 buy point, but the base clearly shows more distribution weeks (above-average volume weekly declines) than accumulation weeks (above-average volume weekly gains).

Heavy-volume breakouts were sparse again Friday, but **Smart Global** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)) fit the bill. It's a more speculative name with a market capitalization less than $1 billion. Still, a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 99 is indicative of a stock with potential. Shares of the data storage firm jumped nearly 5% to 44.22, ending the week in buy range from a 43.26 entry.


Individual investors should be looking at recent buys. Are they working, treading water, or under water? If most are profitable, look for add-on entry points. If you're content with the current size of the position, have an exit strategy in mind because during periods of market volatility, a gain can evaporate quickly.


Biotech leader **Ligand** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) is a good example of how bullish breakouts can be challenging. Ligand rallied 8% past a 170.40 buy point, but it tested the buy point Friday, falling 3% to 171.85. With an elevated distribution-day count in the S&P 500, cutting losses at 3% to 4% often makes sense.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) index of leading growth stocks continues to outperform the S&P 500 nicely. Headed into Friday, it was up 10.9% compared with a 2.8% gain for the S&P 500.


In IPO news, **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) priced Thursday night at 16, above the proposed range of 13-15. Shares opened at 27.50 Friday and closed at 33. The provider of cloud-based network security solutions isn't profitable yet, but the company reported sales of $45 million in its latest quarter, up 53% from the year ago period. Separately, the highly-anticipated Dropbox IPO is scheduled to price Thursday and start trading Friday under the ticker DBX. The proposed range is 16-18.


Keep in mind that it's important to let an IPO trade for a bit of time before considering a buy. While most bases need a minimum of five weeks to form, IPO bases can be shorter in duration. [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com) name **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) jumped out of a short IPO base Feb. 16 with a 30.02 buy point.


Wall Street didn't react much to news early Friday that housing starts and building permits came in lower than expected in February. After a stellar 2017, homebuilders have been under stiff selling pressure since the group topped in January. With the market in a confirmed uptrend, targeting leading stocks in leading industry groups gives the best chance for outperformance.

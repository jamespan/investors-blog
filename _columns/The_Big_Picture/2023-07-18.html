<div class="single-post-content post-content drop-cap crawler"><p>The stock market powered higher despite mixed retail data, buoyed by more positive earnings reports. <strong>Tesla</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA" target="_blank">TSLA</a>), one of the most watched issues among investors, is now set to report.</p>

But the tech-heavy index is increasingly extended.

<p>The Nasdaq composite continues to look mighty, powering up an impressive 0.8%. It is already up nearly 2% so far this week. The tech-heavy index is at highs for the year and clear of its <a href="https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/">short-term moving averages.</a> Most important, it shed its last two remaining <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/">distribution days</a> due to the 5% gain rule.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 opened lower but closed with a meaty daily gain of 0.7%. The benchmark index is lagging the Nasdaq with a weekly gain of just over 1% but continues to pull away from its 10-day moving average.</p>
<p>Advancers outnumbered decliners by around 2.5-to-1 on the NYSE and just over 1.5-to-1 on the Nasdaq. <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/">Volume was higher, a positive</a>. With the stock market uptrend looking strong, IBD recommends holding exposure at the 80%-100% level. But as indexes advance, the risk of a pullback increases, so keep on top of any sell signals within your portfolio.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average actually did best out of the major indexes, thanks to a 1.1% vault. <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT" target="_blank">MSFT</a>) fared best as it surged 4% after it detailed its <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-spikes-to-record-high-on-ai-pricing-details/">plans to monetize AI</a>. In contrast, <strong>Honeywell International</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON" target="_blank">HON</a>) and <strong>Visa</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V" target="_blank">V</a>) lagged.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>
<p>But small caps and growth stocks turned in particularly impressive performances for the day. Both the Russell 2000 and the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY" target="_blank">FFTY</a>) bloodied the noses of bears by punching 1.3% higher.</p>
<h2>Retail Data Mixed As Tesla Earnings Loom</h2>
<p>Stocks opened lower as investors digested mixed retail data. U.S. Census Bureau data showed retail sales were up 0.2% in June, below expectations for a 0.5% lift.</p>

<p>Positive big bank earnings reports made the news. <strong>Bank of America</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC" target="_blank">BAC</a>), the second-largest U.S. bank, topped views, as did <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS" target="_blank">MS</a>). Banks have been boosted by higher net interest income tied to higher interest rates.</p>
<p>"We are done with the majority of the big banks and the overall takeaway is that they did OK despite a weakening economy and all the turmoil that stemmed from the regional banking crisis last quarter," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients.</p>
<p>He also thinks that investors could remain hopeful that a resilient U.S. economy "should translate into decent spending despite all the headwinds."</p>
<p>Tesla earnings now loom after the close Wednesday. This is an important report as TSLA is one of the most active issues on the <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/">stock market today</a>.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns "><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=weekly&amp;symbol=TSLA"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Earnings per share are seen rising 9% to 83 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research. Analysts expect top-line growth to jump 47% to $24.88 billion.</p>
<p>Tesla is a member of the prestigious <a href="https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint">IBD Leaderboard list of top stocks</a>.</p>
<h2>These Stock Market Groups Energize</h2>
<p>Most of the S&amp;P 500 sectors ended the session in the green. Technology and energy led the upside while real estate and utilities, defensive areas, lagged.</p>
<p>For a deeper insight into the stock market action, it's wise to reflect on the relative performance of the IBD industry groups.</p>
<p>A variety of oil and gas groups, movie stocks, desktop software companies, and radio and TV stocks all had strong sessions.</p>
<p>In contrast, toymakers, solar plays, medical systems stocks, educational software firms and electrical utilities all suffered.</p>

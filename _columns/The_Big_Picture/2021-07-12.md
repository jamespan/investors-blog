The stock market ended modestly higher Monday as Wall Street braced for a busy week of earnings in the financial sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite closed near sessions highs and marked all-time closing highs.




It's also a [busy week of economic data](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), with the Consumer Price Index due Tuesday and the Producer Price Index out Wednesday. Weekly jobless claims will be out Thursday, along with two pieces of manufacturing data: the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index and the Empire State Manufacturing Index. June retail sales data is due Friday.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones industrials topped the 35,000 level in the stock market today, rising nearly 0.4%. The S&P 500 gained just over 0.3% and the Nasdaq added 0.2%. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) pared a 0.8% early loss to less than 0.1%.

The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) added 0.4%, but it's looking extended at nearly 7% above its 50-day moving average.


Winners topped losers on the Nasdaq by an 11-to-10 margin. Breadth was better on the NYSE, with advancing stocks beating decliners by nearly 2-to-1.


The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite is relatively light. The June 18 distribution day for the S&P 500 fell off the count Monday because the index rallied 5% from the closing price on that day. That leaves three for the S&P 500 and two for the Nasdaq.


Financials Lead Stock Market Rally
----------------------------------


Financial stocks outperformed, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) up 1%. Top-10 holdings **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) kick things off with earnings Tuesday before the open. Goldman stock broke out over a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) Monday as it forms a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 393.36 buy point. Shares rose more than 2% to 380.50.


One of the leading industry groups in the financial sector at this point is investment management. Six weeks ago, the group ranked No. 51 out of 197 groups ranked by IBD based on six-month price performance. As of Friday's close, the group had moved up to No. 33.


Investment manager **Janus Henderson** ([JHG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JHG)) broke out of a flat base Monday, rising more than 3% to 40.86. It's still in the 5% buy zone from the 40.49 buy point, although volume was not heavy.



Leadership is broad in the group. **Affiliated Managers** ([AMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMG)) cleared a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) last week with a 168.21 entry. **KKR & Co**. ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)) is still in buy range after clearing a base June 23 with a 59.25 buy point. **Focus Financial Partners** ([FOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOCS)), meanwhile, is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 54.85 buy point.


After getting some resistance near the 100 level, IBD 50 firm **Blackstone Group** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)) topped the 100 level, rising 2% to 101.93.


The 10-year Treasury yield edged higher to 1.36% after jumping 7 basis points Friday.


What To Do Now
--------------


With the stock market still in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), it makes sense to look for stocks to buy. But if you're happy with your current exposure, it also makes sense to evaluate your current holdings. If you've got some nice winners that continue to hold above key support levels, give them room to work. But consider trimming a winning position if a stock breaks support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Do you own stocks that haven't made much progress after you bought them? Or are they down slightly from your entry? If they're starting to look like laggards, don't be afraid to cut ties with them and put money into stocks that are working.


Albemarle Heats Up
------------------


In the chemicals sector, **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) broke out over a short trendline Friday and followed through Monday, topping a 177.68 buy point from a cup with handle. Shares jumped nearly 7% to 187.49.



Albemarle makes lithium products and other specialty chemicals. In late June, the company announced plans to open a facility in North Carolina to focus on lithium-ion battery technologies.


Earlier this year, the company said worldwide demand for lithium reached almost 300,000 metric tons in 2020. It believes demand will top 1.1 million tons by 2025.


Group peer **Element Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)) is making a test of its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/), putting the stock in a follow-on buy zone.


IBD 50 Movers
-------------


Inside the IBD 50, **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) was the day's best percentage gainer, up 12.5%, after the provider of medical aesthetic treatments raised its [Q2 and full-year earnings and sales outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/inmode-stock-launches-to-record-high-here-is-what-to-expect-in-its-quarterly-report/). InMode joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) when it gapped up on June 7.

InMode also led the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), along with **Xpel** ([XPEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEL)), which is slightly extended after a nice bounce off the 10-week line.


Elsewhere, three new issues in the IBD 50 outperformed and are holding gains nicely after strong uptrends. **Global E-Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) is trading well after finding support at its 21-day line. Same goes for **Figs** ([FIGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIGS)), which reversed higher off its 21-day line. **DLocal** ([DLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLO)), which provides a cloud-based payment platform for emerging markets, is holding near highs and trading near its 10-day line.


All three stocks are now forming IPO bases.

The stock market hit more record highs Thursday, kicking off 2020 in style. The Nasdaq composite led the major indexes with a 1.3% advance, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained as many as 334 points.




The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced almost 1.2%. All three major indexes hit all-time highs. Elsewhere, the Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.1% loss amid a sharp decline in small-cap stocks. Volume was much higher across both exchanges relative to Tuesday's turnover, adding fuel to Thursday's bullish gains. (The stock market was closed Wednesday for New Year's Day.)


Stock Market Rally Hits More Highs
----------------------------------


The major stock indexes recorded all-time highs Thursday, kicking off the new year on a positive note. Last year, the Nasdaq composite rallied 35.2%, snapping back from 2018's 3.9% decline. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average followed up with increases of 28.9% and 22.3%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP010220-224x300.jpg)Adding to the bullish tone, the Nasdaq's Dec. 9 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the overall count after Thursday's big gain. (The index is more than 5% past the closing price of Dec. 9.) Now the Nasdaq composite shows just two distribution days over the last 25 trading sessions. The S&P 500 also has two. Distribution days represent institutional selling, and there hasn't been much of that. With no clear signs of a market peak, investors should continue to look for top stocks breaking out past buy points in heavy volume.


IBD 50: Chinese Leadership Dominates
------------------------------------


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), one of numerous IBD screens of top growth stocks, rallied 1.9% Thursday, as Chinese leaders led the way. On Wednesday, China injected about $115 billion into its economy by lowering the amount of reserve cash that its banks must hold.


Chinese stocks **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) were among the day's top performers. Alibaba gained 3.6% to 219.77. Shares are just off the 20%-25% profit-taking zone from a 184.23 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a cup with handle.


Momo rallied 8.3% to 36.28 as it continues to form a new base. Shares of Momo are trying to retake their 50-day moving average.


New Oriental Education moved up almost 5% to 127.25 and is rebounding from its 50-day-moving-average support level. The stock is extended beyond a 115.98 entry in an ascending base.


On the downside, **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) and **NMI** **Holdings** ([NMIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMIH)) slid more than 2% apiece. HealthEquity stock is shaping a cup with handle with a 77.04 buy point. NMI Holdings closed below its 50-day line in heavy volume for the first time since a breakout above a 30.74 cup-with-handle entry on Nov. 7.

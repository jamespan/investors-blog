Major stock market indexes cooled off on Tuesday, but a late-afternoon rebound softened some of the day's losses. Overall, the action also reflected the challenges of investing in new breakouts following a big run-up from the end of last year's swift bear market.




Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite had performed admirably lately. The former threatened to take out its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) on July 19, when sellers slammed the large-cap benchmark 1.6% lower. Yet the S&P 500 did a fast U-turn, rising the next five sessions. So, Tuesday's 0.5% drop following a 3.8% run-up seems reasonable.


The Nasdaq also rallied five days in a row, gaining almost 4% in the process. Therefore, Tuesday's 1.2% decline essentially gave back less than a third of the recent run. At one point, the composite's loss on Tuesday reached almost 2.3%. It found buyers near the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and still shows quite a cushion above its 50-day moving average.


Meanwhile, small caps continued to underperform.


Big Growth Vs. Little Growth
----------------------------


![MP072721](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP072721-192x300.jpg)Take a close look at the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund. It almost matched the Nasdaq's 1.2% drop. But it's on the way to potentially closing beneath its 50-day moving average for the third consecutive week. When did that last happen? You'd have to go all the way back to April 2020 â€” right when the stock market turned higher with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) by the S&P 500 on April 2 that year.


Check out a [graph plotting the performance](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DailyMutuals072621.pdf) of SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ([SPYG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPYG)) vs. SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Growth ([SLYG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLYG)), updated in the [Mutual Fund Charts feature](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/mutual-fund-charts-jul-26-2021/) within [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) at Investors.com each day. The S&P 500 Growth ETF began to illustrate the outperformance of large-cap growth stocks vs. small caps in June.


Clearly, the return of institutional buyers into long-dated U.S. Treasuries has weighed on lenders of all sizes. As the yield on the benchmark U.S. government 10-year bond slumped again on Tuesday, more superregional banks and smaller lenders have not participated in the recent rally to new highs. **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) is basing, yet is now spending five weeks beneath its 50-day line. **Keycorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) is trying to find a bottom near its 200-day moving average.


Stock Market Today: Yields Keep Falling
---------------------------------------


On Tuesday, Cboe data showed the [10-year bond yield falling 4 basis points to 1.23%](https://www.cboe.com/delayed_quotes/tnx). The yield has plunged more than half a full percentage point since the March 31 peak.


Outside the finance sector, the day's heavy selling appeared concentrated in areas such as airfreight (see the 7% gap down in massive volume in **United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS))), auto and truck parts, database software, semiconductor manufacturing and chip equipment, U.S. oil and gas exploration, oil drilling, automaker, department store chain, movie and retail internet stocks. These groups and a bunch more fell 2% or more.


Utilities outperformed on Tuesday. Among the 11 IBD industry groups up 1% or more, four hailed from the utility sector. SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) ramped up 1.7% to a six-week high.

Don't Make This Earnings Season Mistake
---------------------------------------


During earnings season, it's never a bad idea to have some cash in your portfolio. If the stock market has already priced in strong growth in second-quarter profits and sales, then you can expect many companies to get bid up in the weeks leading to their report, then sell off on the news.



So far, it's not happening on a widespread scale. But UPS offers a convincing argument why it can often pay to sit on your hands and wait for the stock to prove it has the power to break out of a [complete new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) and mark new highs. The global delivery giant [disappointed investors](https://www.investors.com/news/ups-stock-ups-earnings-q2-2021/) despite posting a third quarter in a row of [CAN SLIM-quality earnings growth of 25% or more](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/).


Tuesday's early drubbing in equities made some options players nervous. But volatility is nowhere close to prior high levels in either 2020 or earlier in 2021.


The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or the VIX, jumped 7% to 18.87. At the session high of 20.44, that's still miles below prior peak readings of 37.51 (on Jan. 29) and 28.93 (on May 13).

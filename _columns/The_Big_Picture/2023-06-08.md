The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite bounced sharply Thursday, leading the stock market higher, as first-time jobless claims hit their highest level since October 2021.




The stock market uptrend features a number of leading stocks in or near buy zones, with a handful more this week. [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) idea **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) and **Kinsale Capital** ([KNSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNSL)) are in buy zones following this week's moves.


Jobless Claims, Earnings Movers
-------------------------------


The final round of initial unemployment claims before the Federal Reserve's rate policy meeting next week showed applications jumping to 261,000 from 232,000 from the previous week. They were expected to edge higher to 235,000, according to Econoday.


The surprising increase may catch the Fed's attention, in conjunction with last month's rise in the unemployment rate. In the [May jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-strong-hiring-in-may-test-fed-pause-sp-500-futures-rise/), the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% from 3.4%. Wall Street had expected a slight increase to 3.5%.


As of Thursday afternoon, there was a [26% chance of a quarter-percentage point hike](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) at next week's Fed meeting vs. a 20% chance one week ago. Further, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 3.71% Thursday, ending a four-day win streak. The 10-year yield is still close to its late-May highs.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP060823-274x300.jpg)GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) stock plunged nearly 18% Thursday. Late Wednesday, [GameStop terminated CEO Matt Furlong](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-fires-ceo-names-investor-ryan-cohen-executive-chairman-39782eac) and said that its per-share loss narrowed to 14 cents, while sales dropped to $1.34 billion.


Other key earnings reports include **Smartsheet** ([SMAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMAR)) and **Toro** ([TTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTC)).


Enterprise software firm Smartsheet beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter but disappointed with its sales outlook. SMAR stock crumbled 17.5%, triggering the 7% loss rule from the 48.99 entry. Finally, Toro shares tumbled more than 7% after the earnings announcement.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5%, closing at its highest level since May 1. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, a new closing 2023 high. The Nasdaq composite bounced 1%, retaking much of Wednesday's sell-off. And the small-cap Russell 2000 dipped 0.4%, ending a two-day rally.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. the prior session, which took some of the bullishness out of Thursday's rebound. The Nasdaq's [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is still at three, while the S&P 500's count remains at six.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed 0.8% Thursday, erasing a part of Wednesday's decline. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) rebounded 3.3%, ending a two-day skid. Shares are once again extended beyond a 37.58 buy point.


With the Nasdaq holding near its 2023 highs, IBD's recommended market exposure sits at 60%-80%. The composite still looks extended and continues to test resistance.

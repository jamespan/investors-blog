Stock Market Slumps Again As Bears Attack; Can Bulls Overcome Key Test?
========================================================================

The stock market bears ended the week with bloody hands as indexes fell once again Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now negative for the year while a key test lies ahead for the benchmark S&P 500.




The Nasdaq lagged other major indexes, sliding 1.7% as it continues to dip sharply from recent highs. The sharp reversal is even more apparent when you consider it booked a weekly loss of 3.3%.


The index undercut its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/), the first of the big benchmarks to break that critical support. However, it remains within striking distance if a bounce unfolds. Additionally, the tech-heavy index remains up almost 10% for the year so far.


The S&P 500 closed off lows for the day but still fell 1.1%. It lost 2.7% this week and has now lost ground for three weeks in a row. Gains for the year have atrophied below 4%.


The benchmark index managed to find support just above its 200-day moving average but fell below the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Retaking the shorter line will be a key objective for bulls, while bears will be aiming to drag prices below the 200-day line.


Decliners outnumbered gainers by more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and about 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. However, volume was lower on both benchmarks, a bullish sign.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed but still lost 1% Friday and has erased all gains for 2023.


It is now situated well below the 10-week moving average after falling for a fourth week in a row. **Dow** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)), an index component, led the upside while **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) fared worst.


Small Caps Strongest; Defensive Posture Is Key
----------------------------------------------


Small caps fared better than major indexes but the Russell 2000 still fell 0.9%. This key stock market group knifed almost 3% lower for the week. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) closed off the day's lows but still shed 0.9%.


Stocks lost ground after the January personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) jumped 5.4% year-over-year, above 5.0% estimates, It was also higher than December's 5.3% increase. This raises odds the Federal Reserve will raise rates higher for longer.


Investors will be keen to hear the thoughts of legendary investor Warren Buffett. His latest letter to investors will be released Feb. 25 when **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) reports earnings.


The current uptrend is coming under increasing pressure, which justifies holding a lower exposure level of 40% to 60%. Pay special attention to sell signals within your portfolio. Cut stocks that fall 7% to 8% from your entry and holdings that break below the 50-day or 10-week moving averages.

These Stock Market Groups Buck Downtrend
----------------------------------------


S&P 500 sector performance reflected the tough action, ending mostly in the red. Real estate and technology lagged the most while materials and financials were the only gainers.


Investors got deeper insight into relative stock market performance via the IBD industry groups.


Department stores, a number of oil and gas groups, foreign banks and building maintenance stocks all managed to outperform.


On the flip side, fiber optics plays, desktop and education software stocks, cable companies, office supply retailers and solar stocks were among the worst laggards.

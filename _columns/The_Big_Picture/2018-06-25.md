  The Big Picture: Bull Market Gets Bloody Nose; Keep Eyes On This Sell Signal

Bloody noses surely aren't limited to World Cup matches or boxing bouts, if the Wall Street action on Monday meant anything.




Institutional equity fund managers ganged up on the recent spate of tit-for-tat actions by the White House and China over import tariffs, and the heavy selling was clearly on display for all to see. Sellers kicked the Nasdaq lower by as much as 2.8% before the premier index for growth stocks finished the day down 2.1%.


What fueled the sell-off?


Before the market open, the major news wires reported that the Treasury Department is preparing to issue new regulations that would block any company with at least 25% ownership by Chinese entities from acquiring any U.S. firm with "industrially significant technology." But with less than half an hour to go in the 6-1/2-hour regular trading session, sellers took a break after Peter Navarro, a top economic advisor to President Trump, said on CNBC that the U.S. is not planning any such new restrictions.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MP062518-199x300.jpg)The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 biggest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, slid 2.2% lower. The S&P 500 fell nearly 1.4%. Small caps got smacked hard too. The S&P SmallCap 600 dropped 1.6%.


U.S. Treasury bond prices rallied, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down 3 basis points to 2.87%, the lowest so far in June. Three-month T bills ended Monday trading at 1.93%.


Volume officially fell on both exchanges vs. Friday, but only on a major technicality. In the final minutes of Friday's session, turnover spiked on the annual rebalancing of the popular Russell equity indexes.


But don't be fooled by the raw numbers. Around 3 p.m. ET on Monday, turnover on the Nasdaq had hit 1.75 billion shares, hundreds of millions of shares more than the roughly 1.42 billion shares that had traded hands by the same time on Friday.


In other words, Monday's volume likely would have far exceeded Friday's level ex-Russell index rebalancing. Meanwhile, go to an IBD daily chart and you'll see that total turnover easily surpassed the 50-day average line.


Moreover, the Market Pulse shows how leading stocks suffered plenty of damage.


With the total number of distribution days already at elevated levels going into Monday morning, the strength of the day's overall decline justifies a shift toward caution. Thus, IBD is downgrading the current outlook to "uptrend under pressure" from "confirmed uptrend."


Watch This Sell Signal
----------------------


In this new environment, it makes sense to be extra cautious about making any new buys in growth stocks. Raising some cash to give your portfolio some insulation against future sell-offs is smart portfolio strategy.


Plus, any stock that suddenly tears down through the 50-day moving average and shows little or no intention of rebounding quickly is offering shareholders a [timely sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


When you have a magnificent cushion of gains in a stock with fantastic fundamentals, holding through a new correction in price is an option. But keep in mind that market leaders can easily fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times more in price than the general market.


So if the S&P 500 goes through another intermediate correction of 10% or more off its 52-week high, expect leading stocks to fall anywhere from 15% to 25%, or even more.


China Shares Get A Bloody Nose Too
----------------------------------


Chinese ADRs that represent new growth markets within the Middle Kingdom got stomped on hard by sellers. **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)), which helps foreign companies excel in the Chinese consumer markets, has already fallen 10% for the week and is now just 4% above the 52.43 entry in it latest base.


But mutual funds, banks, hedge funds, insurers and the like also actively took profits in leaders across a wide swath of industries, from database software to online food ordering to commodities.


**Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), and **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) have also undercut their own 50-day lines in varying degrees.



Splunk, the machine data specialist, took out the intermediate-term support level with ease on Friday. At one point Monday, shares fell more than 20% below its all-time high of 121.64.


Expect a new base to form. Use the weekly chart and see if Splunk holds up or takes out its longer-term 40-week moving average. ([MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows the 40-week line on the weekly chart in black.) That support level was significant when the stock made a cuplike base in late September to November.


Steel Groups Lead The Selling
-----------------------------


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, steel and steel alloy stocks occupied two of the five worst-performing slots on Monday.


**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), highlighted in [today's IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-of-the-day-autohome/) column, dropped more than 5.5% for its worst single-session decline of the year. Volume jumped 30% above usual levels. The Chinese automobile website and marketing company didn't slice through the 50-day line. Yet, it still surrendered all of its mild double-digit gains.



Autohome departed [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Monday. The midcap growth stock joined the list of elite growth stocks on Jan. 2 during a breakout from a base with an early entry point at 66.55. That base showed [elements of a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). The Chinese consumer spending play finished that session at 71.66. Earlier this month, Autohome hit as high as 119.43, up 79% from the early buy point.


While the S&P 500 finished roughly 1 point above its 50-day moving average, the Nasdaq challenged the 7500 price level for the first time in more than three weeks.


It would take another slide of 1.7% or more for the Nasdaq to cross below its own 50-day line and provide another key test of the buying appetite of institutional investors.


Monday's Sharp Rise In Fear
---------------------------


The CBOE Market Volatility index, or the VIX, soared 27% to 17.51, marking the highest close in more than nine weeks. That's still well below its 52-week peak of 50.30, set on Feb. 6.


This sentiment indicator tends to spike when fear among options traders soars. A big jump also can serve as a secondary indicator that the selling has reached a peak.


It's way too early to tell if that's the case now.

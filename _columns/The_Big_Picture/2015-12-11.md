Bears Clobber Major Stock Indexes; Oil Demand Fears Stoke The Selling
======================================================================

Stocks staggered to an ugly finish Friday, led by a fast retreat in oil-related stocks. The Nasdaq lost 2.2%, while the small-cap S&P 600 and big-cap S&P 500 each dropped 1.9%.


The IBD 50 skidded 2.1%.


Volume rose sharply on both major exchanges.


Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed low in the day's range, leaving no doubt that the bulls' sole contribution was getting out of the bears' way.


The indexes are now below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, even as the Nasdaq's 50-day line reclaimed its normal status above the 200-day line.


Overall, the action was sufficiently bearish to tip IBD's market outlook to correction.


Oil was the big negative Friday, which apparently caught many by surprise. After all, oil had been sagging since mid-October, so why the nervousness Friday?


In a word: demand.


Previous concerns had revolved around too much supply, thanks mainly to the Saudis war on U.S. fracking. The status of supply, though, said little about the world or U.S. economy.


However, the focus unexpectedly shifted to demand Friday.


The International Energy Agency slashed its demand estimates for 2016. And flagging demand for oil fits one scary scenario: recession.

Bears then went about hammering the oil stocks. Of the 10 oil industry groups, all 10 fell, and some more than 5%. However, the mauling didn't stop there.


The pain spread marketwide. Only five of IBD's 197 industry groups rose — fiber optics, gold miners, toy makers, managed care and solar power.


Losers led winners by a 7-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by almost 6-1 on the Nasdaq.


New lows ran wild, while new highs were scarce.


The market offered only one sliver of hope — the put-call volume ratio.


It closed at 1.19 Friday, after closing at 1.0 to 1.1 three other days during the week. The 1.15 level or higher is often associated with short-term market bottoms.


However, sometimes the ratio will send multiple messages before the market takes the hint.


At this juncture, IBD-style growth investors should be cutting losses, taking profits where appropriate and raising some cash. Holding a stock is fine, if there is a profit cushion. Adding shares or making fresh purchases of shares is risky. The odds now favor the bears.


Still a few stocks, beat the odds Friday.


**Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) rose 2.46 to 91.42 in heavy volume. The stock pulled back to the 50-day moving average, where it found support. That would set up a buying opportunity, if the market were in better shape.


Adobe reported quarterly results after hours Thursday, matching the consensus estimate for revenue and beating the number for earnings.


**Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) posted a gain for a seventh session in a row, adding 0.45 to 23.45 in heavy volume.


Firearms stocks can be wild. Smith & Wesson's five-year earnings Stability Factor is 74 on a scale of 0 (calm) to 99 (unstable). The stock was a $2 to $3 issue in September 2011.


For the week, the small-cap S&P 600 dropped 4.9%; the IBD 50, 4.2%; the Nasdaq, 4.1%; the S&P 500, 3.8%; and the Dow Jones industrial average, 3.3%.

Stock Market Climbs; Will Small-Cap Indexes Pass This Key Technical Test?
==========================================================================

Stock market indexes rose for the fifth time in the past six days, giving themselves a bit more space above key technical levels.




The S&P 500 added 0.4% and closed near session highs Monday. That modest increase was enough to lead the main indexes. The Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%.


The market suffered a midsession slump that cost the indexes most of their morning gains, but a recovery extended into the close. Farther away from the minute-to-minute price activity, indexes continued to add to last week's rebound in a measured way. Gains have been smaller the past few sessions, but the market is still in a constructive trend.


Institutional investors could be wary to make big moves before the Federal Reserve's meeting this week. The Fed starts meeting Tuesday and will announce its latest policy on Wednesday. Virtually no one expects a change in interest rates, but Wall Street is keen to find any signs on the central bank's pause in tightening.


While indexes pace forward, the Nasdaq is farther up from the 7500 level and its 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 is 3% above the 200-day average and building a buffer above the 2800 price level. At 2833, the S&P 500 is at the highest level since Oct. 10.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP-031819-228x300.jpg)Volume fell sharply vs. the prior day, no surprise at all after quadruple witching on Friday caused a spike in volume. Witching is the simultaneous expiration of options and futures contracts.


In a break from a trend this month, small caps outperformed. The Russell 2000 jumped 0.7% and the S&P 600 0.8%.


The Challenge Small Caps Face Now
---------------------------------


Both small-cap benchmarks lagged last week's market rebound. The Russell 2000, for example, remains more than 2% below its Feb. 25 peak, while the major indexes already topped their February and early March highs.


It's a curious divergence, and one that has some market watchers wondering what it means for the broader market. Small caps tend to have more speculative traits, and their revenue base is more domestic than for large companies.


Keep in mind that the Russell 2000 plummeted 27% from an August high to the Dec. 24 low, a lot more than the Nasdaq, Dow or S&P 500 fell in the late-2018 bear market. Still, small caps have some catching up to do.


On Monday, energy was the top performing sector. SPDR Energy ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 1.4% as U.S. crude oil rose 0.9% to $59.03 a barrel. It's at the highest point since Nov. 13.


A few pipeline stocks broke out but in low volume. **Enterprise Products Partners** ([EPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPD)), which was discussed in [today's Income Investor](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/income-stock-with-payout-20-years-in-row/), edged past a 28.84 buy point. **Plains All American Pipeline** ([PAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAA)) topped a 24.68 entry. **Plains Group Holdings** ([PAGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGP)) cleared a 24.70 buy point.


Financial, industrial and consumer discretionary sectors also led.


A Drag On Blue Chips
--------------------


On the Dow, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) continued to feel like a 60-pound kettlebell. Boeing lost 1.8% and remains below the 50-day line. New evidence suggests that the flight computer of the 737 Max airplanes may be responsible for two jet crashes. And now a [Justice Department prosecutor is looking into the development of the Boeing 737 Max](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-criminal-probe-grand-jury/).


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), the largest stock by market capitalization, made a new high and rose for a seventh consecutive day. The software company is part of a new leadership in the tech sector as the FANG stocks try to recover from last year's meltdown. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) fell to its 50-day line Monday after [Needham downgraded the social media stock to hold from buy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-wall-street-analyst-downgrade/), noting risks from executive departures and the company's strategy.


A few more stocks broke out, with varying degrees of energy. **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) sailed past the 45.16 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a handle in heavy volume. The stock is the subject of [today's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-top-stock-stages-breakout-heavy-trade/).


**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) cleared the 53.58 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a long, irregular pattern in volume 30% above normal. **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) rose past a 71.20 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) but volume was well below average.


China's stock market soared. The Shanghai composite surged 2.5% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng added 1.4%. The market saw some carryover for U.S.-listed Chinese shares. **Yum China** ([YUMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUMC)) followed through on Friday's move past a 42.63 buy point, and **Tencent Music Entertainment** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) made a new high in active trading.

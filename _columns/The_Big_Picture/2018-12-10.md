The Dow and the S&P 500 on Monday made new lows, then rebounded. It was the latest in a series of mixed signals for a stock market struggling to end a long slump.




In early trading, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average undercut their Oct. 29 lows. With a six-week floor giving way, it looked as though sellers would have their way again. But around 11 a.m. ET, indexes started to rebound.


By the close, all three main indexes were in the black. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.1%, and the S&P 500 erased a 1.9% loss to close 0.2% higher. The Nasdaq composite also made a bullish reversal, erasing a 1.3% decline to end 0.7% higher.

For the S&P 500, the 2600 level held up just like it did at the Oct. 29 low. The Dow fell below its October low but closed above it.


While that gives investors reason for hope, similar reversals haven't necessarily led to extended gains. For example, on Thursday impressive index rebounds were met with more selling the next day.


With new lows Monday, the S&P 500 and Dow are in a declining trend, making lower highs and lower lows. The Nasdaq, however, is holding above its October low.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE as well. Declining stocks led advancers by a 2-1 ratio on the NYSE and by nearly 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


Some key chart levels will provide valuable signals for the market. For the Nasdaq, 7000 is proving to be critical. The composite is holding around that round number, where there was support in late October and in November. The S&P 500 needs to defend the 2600 level.


Unable to rebound with the main indexes Monday, the Russell 2000 fell 0.3%. The small-cap benchmark fell to the lowest price since September 2017. Now 17% off its high, the Russell 2000 is in a deeper hole than other indexes. The market will need small caps to participate in a sustained uptrend.


The 50-day moving averages of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are now below the 200-day lines. To chart readers, that's known as the "cross of death." But the signal historically is not as bearish as its name implies.


Similar inversions in the past weren't good indicators of bear markets. Since the bull market started in March 2009, negative moving average crossovers in the S&P 500 served mainly as late signals of market corrections.


The Nasdaq on Monday roughly tracked the movement of its largest component, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). In what is becoming a habit, [another analyst downgraded Apple](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-drops-china-worries/) on concerns about iPhone demand. Citi cut the price target on Apple shares to 200 from 240.


In China, **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) won a preliminary injunction against the sale of older-model iPhones in that country. The news was another blow for Apple. But the stock rebounded as it became more clear that the potential damage would be limited.


Apple said all iPhone models remain available in China, and that it will appeal. Apple closed with a 0.7% gain. It could be finding support above 160, where shares bottomed twice in April. A midday surge in Apple shares helped take the Nasdaq into positive territory for the day.


In fact, semiconductor and other technology stocks led the market's rebound. Chip designers, internet networking and several software groups were in Monday's top 15.


The defense sector also was strong after [President Donald Trump asked the Pentagon to increase its budget](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/defense-stocks-rally-trump-pentagon-budget-increase/). IBD's aerospace and defense industry group climbed 1.4%.


But the energy sector resumed its bear market. The SPDR Energy ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) fell 1.6%, touching the lowest level since Aug. 21, 2017. The price of U.S. crude traded below $51 a barrel, down more than 3%, in late trading. Futures erased the entire 3% gain made Friday after OPEC and Russia agreed to reduce production.

Tuesday action in stocks reaffirmed one of the great maxims on Wall Street.




When the Fed speaks, investors listen.


At an event in Chicago before the Wall Street open, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell essentially backed up the commentary that one of his fellow members at the U.S. central bank, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, gave amid a frenetic day of selling the prior day. Both bankers stressed the need to react accordingly to any signs that the economy could slow after years of nice growth. They both expressed that inflation remains low, and so a drop in the cost of money would not harm that aspect of the economy.


Powell made it exceptionally clear that he does not want the U.S. to fall into recession on his watch.


"We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2% objective," Powell told a conference at the Chicago Fed, as reported by Bloomberg.


Wall Street responded sharply.

Nasdaq Leads Stocks Higher
--------------------------


The Nasdaq composite rose more than 2.6% and retook its long-term 200-day moving average. A 2.7% bounce higher by the Nasdaq 100 affirmed a bargain-hunting frame of mind among tech stocks.


Robert Maltbie, president of SingularResearch.com and a veteran fundamental analyst of small cap growth stocks, pointed to a negative monthly outflow on the scale of $20 billion coming out of equity markets as one factor that has hurt U.S. stocks lately. Massive new IPOs among the tech unicorns also have sucked air out of the market.


But Maltbie also feels that Fed chief Powell made it clear on Tuesday that he's serious about working the levers of monetary policy. Why? Data suggests that a persistent lack of liquidity in the financial system could negatively impact future U.S. GDP growth.


Maltbie sees high potential for two quarter-point cuts in the fed funds rate, or what the Federal Reserve charges on overnight loans to large lenders, within the next six months. In the last month, a shift to positive money velocity "adds a 1% kicker" to a 4% growth rate of M2 money over the past 12 months, vs. a long-term growth rate of roughly 2% in U.S. GDP over the past decade.


"When you don't have enough liquidity in the economy, it's like having the foot on the brakes and driving," Maltbie told IBD in an interview.


M2 money includes M1 money (cash and checking deposits) plus so-called "near money" in the form of savings deposits, money market securities, mutual funds and other time deposits.


The CME FedWatch tool on Tuesday counted a 63% chance that the Fed will shave rates by a quarter point to the range of 2%-2.25% by its July 31 meeting. It also graphed a 50.4% probability of a second quarter-point drop by September. The chances of at least one rate cut by September? More than 90%.


On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note spiked up 5 basis points to 2.12%. But 3-month T-bills stayed flat at 2.35%. That's still down 7 basis points from 2.42% at the start of the year and 12 basis points below the year-to-date peak of 2.47%.


The Only Stain On Tuesday's Up Day?
-----------------------------------


A drop in volume on both exchanges hinted at some reservations among institutional-class investors to jump back into stocks. Turnover dropped 8% on the Nasdaq and roughly 3% on the NYSE vs. Monday.


Nonetheless, Tuesday's rebound marked the first step for a potential end of a "market in correction" in the [IBD outlook for stocks](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), now in its third week since the downgrade from "uptrend under pressure" on May 13.


The S&P 500 trailed the Nasdaq on Tuesday, rising 2.1%. But that still marked the biggest single-session gain since a 3.4% upward thrust on Jan. 4. Small caps also rallied hard; the S&P SmallCap 600 bolted ahead 2.7%. Yet it remains nearly 17% below a 52-week peak of 1100.


Jan. 4 indeed marked a pivotal session for investors this year. As [The Big Picture wrote that day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/), it marked a [Day seven follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) by the large-cap benchmark following a bear-market-level washout in stocks late last year.


In The Stock Market, One Big Up Day Doth Not Make A New Uptrend
---------------------------------------------------------------


When a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/) occurs, the chances of a significant new uptrend are never 100%. But they signal it's time to actively hunt for leading stocks for a watch list. Bill O'Neil, IBD founder and longtime chair, always made it a point to buy something on the follow-through day.


Another reason to show courage? When one is fearful, taking action helps remove fear.


Yet for now, investors should stay patient.


In almost every case, a follow-though can occur as early as Day four in a new rally attempt. We're not there yet. But now is a good time to assemble a fresh watch list.


4 Bullish Elements To Watch In Stocks
-------------------------------------


As you scan IBD's key screens for growth stocks, pay close attention to the price-and-volume action. In Sector Leaders, [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), are you seeing bunches of companies advancing in price in heavy volume? If so, that's one bullish sign.


But if instead you notice highly rated stocks rebounding in light trade, you may be spotting a bull trap in the works.


Don't forget this [key sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stocks-low-volume-sell/): After a big run-up, a stock that [plunges in heavy volume, then rebounds in lighter turnove](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stocks-low-volume-sell/)r may just be setting up another harsh retreat. In contrast, true market leaders will recover lost ground in heavy turnover and do the hard work of [clearing through overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) to finish a [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).



Let's look at the five stocks that made [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) at the end of Monday's session.


**Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and new breakout stock **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) showed strong gains in above-average turnover. The other three, including **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), demonstrated nice support at or near the 50-day moving average. But they also showed turnover falling vs. the prior session and below their respective 50-day average levels.


A second element to watch: the overall stock market internals.


Tuesday's trading revealed positive numbers. New highs exceeded new lows, even if the total number of Nasdaq and NYSE-listed stocks doing so was relatively mild. But as seen on the [MarketSmith home page](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), stocks that rose significantly in heavy volume swamped those that fell in fast turnover by a nearly 10-1 margin.


Without looking at volume changes, winners on the NYSE upended losers by roughly four to one.


Third, more stocks should either find support at the 10-week moving average or rebound to within 5% to 15% of a 52-week high. Such action would point to the formation of new bases, the necessary ingredient for [future breakouts to new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).



Four, if the market seeks to rally in earnest again, benchmarks of leading stocks should outperform the major indexes.


On Tuesday, Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF ramped up 2.7%. It still holds a bigger year-to-date gain (up 17.9%) than the S&P 500 (up 11.8%).

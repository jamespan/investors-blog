The stock market didn't get off to the best of starts Monday, weighed down early by broad-based weakness in overseas markets. But the bulls got the ending they were looking for as major stock indexes rallied sharply into the close.




**Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) led the Dow higher. Top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), with gains of more than 2%.


Headed into Monday, the S&P 500 closed in the bottom half of its intraday range in seven of the past eight trading sessions. But the stock market offered a different narrative Monday.


Stock Market Recovers Impressively
----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP070218-268x300.jpg)After falling 0.9% intraday, the Nasdaq composite reversed sharply higher, rising 0.8%; the S&P 500 added 0.3%, weighed down by weakness in oil and gas stocks, and the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Friday's levels.


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) turned in a solid showing, helped by strength in names like Micron, **Zebra Technologies** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)) and **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)). All three ended with gains of more than 3%.


Much of the Nasdaq's strength came from software-related industry groups in IBD's database.


Stock Market Winners
--------------------


**VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) led enterprise software makers higher. Shares soared 10% after parent **Dell Technologies** ([DVMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVMT)) said it would pay $21.7 billion in cash and stock to buy back shares tied to its interest in VMware. Shares of Dell Technologies jumped 9%.


Also in the enterprise software group, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) climbed above its 50-day moving average in higher volume, rising 3%. **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) closed in on another all-time high, rising 3%. **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) and **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)) continue to hold support at their 50-day moving averages.


Other software-related groups outperformed, including medical, security and database software.


The Nasdaq's performance was all the more impressive in light of weak performances from **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)).


Shares of Tesla reversed lower after soaring more than 6% early. Elon Musk on Sunday said the company met its goal to produce 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a week. Tesla also said that total vehicle production in Q2 was 53,339, up 55% from Q1. The company also said it expects to produce 6,000 Model 3s a week by late next month.


Wynn Resorts Takes Hit
----------------------


Wynn Resorts was by far the worst performer in the Nasdaq 100, falling 8%. Casino operators with a presence in China were lower across the board on news that gambling revenue in Macau rose 12.5% in June. That was below expectations of 17% to 21% growth, according to Reuters.


Weakness in overseas markets was reflected in iShares Core MSCI Total International ([IXUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IXUS)). The exchanged traded fund fell 1.5% in big volume. It has exposure to a broad range of international developed and emerging market firms. The fund hasn't been able to attract buyers since gapping below the 65 level in early February.


Meanwhile, biotech **Supernus** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)) offers a good example of why it's still a tricky environment for technical breakouts. It stumbled again Monday after a breakout from a flat base. Shares slumped 5.5%.


While several market-leading growth stocks have given up support at their 50-day moving averages recently, it's not a market where tattered charts are the rule. Far from it, actually.


Bullish Charts
--------------


A quick scan of recent breakouts in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com) shows plenty of compelling charts, including **Darden Restaurants** ([DRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRI)).


Inside the IBD 50, **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) continues to trade tightly near highs, while [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)) is getting support at its 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout.


With the market uptrend under pressure, there's no need to be 100% in the market at this point. Have some cash on hand to protect yourself from the possibility of more downside. A headline-driven market will likely have more volatile headlines to deal with in coming days and weeks.

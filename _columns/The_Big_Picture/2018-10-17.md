Stocks Resilient After Early Downdraft; Fed Minutes Hint At More Rate Hikes
============================================================================

Investors got a stern reminder about why the stock market is still in a correction early Wednesday when major stock indexes fell more than 1%. But investors also got a reminder that volatility in stocks is alive and well as indexes significantly pared losses by the close.




Overall, it was a resilient session for stocks, but the session showed that sellers are still lurking. At the close, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended with losses of less than 0.1% and near the day's highs. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.4%, weighed down by weakness in **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)). IBM slumped nearly 8% on weak Q3 results. Home Depot gave back 4% after Credit Suisse downgraded shares to neutral.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MP101718-213x300.jpg)The Russell 2000 small-cap index lost 0.5% and the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) surrendered 0.2%. Inside the IBD 50, **Wildhorse Resource Development** ([WRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WRD)) and **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) fell 8% and 4%, respectively, hurt by falling oil prices. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $69.75 a barrel, down 3%. The Energy Information Administration reported a big climb in crude supplies for the fourth week in a row.


Fed Minutes
-----------


The minutes from the September Federal Reserve meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET. The minutes showed that committee members are mostly in agreement with continuing a gradual path of rate increases. But there was also talk of [a more restrictive policy](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-minutes-reveal-debate-restrictive-rate-policy/) where rate hikes could get more aggressive due to "significant financial imbalances." That would imply a federal funds rate above neutral, which policy members currently see around 3%.


Currently, the federal funds rate is at a range of 2% to 2.25%. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates again at the December meeting to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.


The 10-year Treasury yield added 3 basis points to 3.19%


Overall Market Health
---------------------


After strong gains for the major stock indexes Tuesday, it wasn't hard to slant toward a bullish bias. But longtime IBD readers know that the stock market is [still in the early stages of a rally attempt](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-soars-stocks-make-bottoming-signal/). Strong gains for the market Friday and more gains Tuesday were good to see, but it's common to see short-covering in the first few days of a rally attempt. The question now is: Will new money start to come in from the sidelines? This question hasn't been answered yet, which is why IBD's current outlook still says "market in correction."


Keep in mind that significant damage has been done to former leading growth stocks. Headed into Wednesday, the IBD 50 showed an October decline of nearly 9% compared with a 5% decline for the Nasdaq composite.

CLOSE




If a new market uptrend is confirmed down the line, it would be good to see plenty of bullish chart setups among top-rated growth stocks. Technical breakouts are the fuel for new market uptrends, but bullish patterns are in short supply at the moment. At some point, the setups will be there, but patience is key for now.


Top Stocks Today
----------------


Airline stocks took flight Wednesday, helped by strong earnings from **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)). Shares of United gapped above the 50-day moving average after the company reported another quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Normally when a stock gaps above the 50-day line, it's a buy area, but with the market still in a correction, new buys are risky. The airline group rose 1.7%.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) showed similar action, with a gap above the 50-day, but its price action was disappointing. After rising nearly 10% at the open, Netflix ended well off its session high, up 5%.


Lagging Stocks
--------------


Auto parts retailers fell sharply, one day after **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) announced a sales partnership with **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)). After rising 1% Tuesday, shares of Advance Auto Parts plunged 5%. **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) also took a beating, down nearly 8%. It closed just above its 200-day moving average. Headed into Wednesday, auto parts retailers were the highest-ranked industry group in IBD's database. The group tanked nearly 6% Wednesday.

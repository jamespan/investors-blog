  Sellers Wrench Nasdaq, Small Caps; Clues That Reveal A Coming Bear Market

Big drop across the major indexes, including the Nasdaq, in higher volume? Check. Few, if any, breakouts working now? Check. Clearly negative news impacting the greater market as a whole? No doubt.




Tuesday's steep fall in equities encompassed all of these angles. And even though some indexes actually haven't fallen that much from their all-time highs, it's the size of the retreat since the latest [follow-through day on Dec. 15](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-fed-policy-decision-time-to-get-back-in/) that ultimately tells careful IBD readers that cash is a great position in the portfolio right now.


That's why IBD has cut its outlook to "market in correction."


The Nasdaq, to this day, remains the superlative index for high-octane growth companies. But Tuesday's 2.6% slide yanked the composite index below its [long-term 200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) for the first time in more than 21 months. The drop follows a small series of big sell-offs since the start of 2022.


Nasdaq volume wasn't necessarily heavy in terms of comparing it with the average over the past 50 sessions. But it soared 15% vs. the prior session.

A very disappointing salvo of [fourth-quarter results from key banks](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-goldman-sachs-charles-schwab-earnings/), plus overwhelming evidence that growth in China's economy slowed in Q4 last year, immediately set the bearish tone for U.S. stocks on Tuesday.


Awful Technical Action
----------------------


Go to an intraday chart, and you'll see the Nasdaq composite gap nearly 300 points lower in the first 15 minutes of trading, rebound meekly, then roll over as the day progressed.


A close virtually at the session lows? You just witnessed a signature of weak markets, not strong ones.


Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), the ETF tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq, dropped 2.5%. For now, QQQ remains above its 200-day moving average after having fallen 9.5% from its Nov. 22 peak.



Meanwhile, small caps got whacked even harder. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund sank 3% to mark its lowest close since Jan. 25, 2021. The S&P 500 lost 1.8%.


Another surge in the cost of money likely impacted small caps more. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rocketed 9 basis points to 1.86%. (See the chart on [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) by going to zero-TNX). The lift in yields of more than 50 basis points since early December reflects growing seriousness that the Federal Reserve has shifted its thinking to prioritize taming inflation over keeping the economy growing.


What could scare some investors, though? Tuesday's session included a huge miss on the [Empire State manufacturing survey for January](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).

It's Still About The Economy
----------------------------


Watch for more key economic data to arrive. We've already seen big increases in U.S. consumer and wholesale price data. Inflation is here. It may be peaking â€” or not. But amid a very challenging labor market and ongoing stoppages in the supply chain, is the U.S. economy in fact really slowing down? The latest [manufacturing survey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) on Thursday and the Leading Economic Indicators index on Friday offer new data points.


At this stage, following three straight years of double-digit returns in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, the key message from the market is to stay cautious. This means taking a pass at most new breakouts. Selling losing stocks more quickly makes sense. It raises your cash level in the portfolio and shields it from further sharp declines.


In the meantime, sharpen your eyes on the emerging leaders on [key stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) by looking for support at key levels, including the 50-day moving average. A [rising relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) in this juncture of the market indicates a stock is falling less than the S&P 500. Look for pockets of strength in certain industry groups and sectors, including agriculture, banking, computers, semiconductors and miscellaneous and diversified industries.


Beyond The Nasdaq: Clues We're Heading Into A Bear Market
---------------------------------------------------------


IBD has stuck with the common definition of a bear market as a 20% decline off the top. We haven't reached that level yet. But the following bullet points could give us more clarity on this possibility.


* Will the Nasdaq sink a lot further below its 200-day moving average? The action by FAANG stocks plays a pivotal role.
* Will future rebounds start strong but end weak among the major indexes?
* How will stocks in the IBD 50 fare? On Tuesday, Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped 4%. That's the ETF's fifth drop of 1% or more since the start of 2022.
* Does the breadth of the market shrink even more? As seen on either "GMIAA" on MarketSmith or on the daily General Market Indicators page, the NYSE advance-decline line is flattening after a healthy rise during the final two weeks of December. But the Nasdaq's A-D line is clearly spiraling lower.

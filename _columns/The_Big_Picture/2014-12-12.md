Stock indexes staggered to big losses in rising volume Friday, capping an ugly week.

  

The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%, while the Nasdaq and IBD 50 fell 1.2% each.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

The price-and-volume action constituted distribution, a footprint of fund selling. The Nasdaq added two distribution days to its count because a provisional stalling day on Nov. 21 was brought into the count. Stalling days are counted differently from regular distribution days.

  

With the market under pressure, playing defense is prudent. It means cutting losses and locking in some profits.

  

An individual investor might decide to hold a high-conviction stock through a consolidation. That's fine, too, provided that the stock doesn't flash sell signals.

  

A profit cushion can let investors sit tight and give back some gains — the price for waiting to see if the market turbulence will be shallow or short-lived.

  

On Friday, the put-call volume ratio closed at 1.15, a bullish level for this contrarian indicator. The gauge has done a good job at identifying short-term market lows this year.

  

Here's the chief danger of this market: When an uptrend weakens, emotions can distort judgment. Try to see what's happening on the charts and accept it.

  

For instance, look closely at the charts on Page B9.

  

The indexes have had a nice run since mid-October, but their action shows a change in character over the past week. Trading ranges are looser. The indexes show four weak closes in five sessions — something not done previously in the entire run.

  

At minimum, this pattern points to a lack of confidence.

  

Yet for all that, the indexes are only 3% to 4% off recent highs.

  

On Friday, retail industry groups held up best — including apparel, department stores, home furnishings and restaurants. Low-rated groups led the downside: construction equipment, steel alloys and oil-field services.

  

Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the best performers over the past four weeks show a mixed profile. The top dozen hold conservative diversified stocks but also the more growth-oriented biotechs and chipmakers. Despite the different profiles, most share a characteristic: They are from strong industry groups.

  

Crude oil, which has been impacting stocks, fell under $58 a barrel Friday. The price is approaching the $55 level that Bank of America analysts say is the breakeven point for half of U.S. producers.

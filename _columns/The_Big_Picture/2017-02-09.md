In the mid-1980s, Japan's economy, corporate profits and stock prices soared — enough so that the country earned a slightly degrading nickname: Japan Inc.


Judging by all of the decisions, declarations and tweets coming from President Trump, only three weeks on the job, will a new nickname arise? Will the national media coin something like "White House Inc."?


On Wednesday, the Oval Office served perhaps for the first time as the venue in which a major semiconductor company (**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC))) announced plans to expand manufacturing operations in the U.S. On Thursday, Trump met with leaders of the U.S. airline industry, then spurred Wall Street into action with news of an upcoming "phenomenal" plan for cutting taxes and revving up the economy.


And since Wednesday, the media are having a field day over the Twitter feud between Trump and the well-respected department store chain **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)), founded in Seattle, over his criticism on the company's decision to cut ties with daughter Ivanka Trump's clothing line.


Every American president is unique. Trump is no exception. Yet make no mistake: The stock market, the place where millions of individuals, professionals and deep-pocketed entities make real-money decisions in real time, continues to show signs that it wants to go up.


Indeed, broad gains across all of the key indexes underscored a strength of institutional demand that has allowed stocks to have a solid start in 2017 after a rocky-yet-positive 2016.


The Nasdaq composite, fueled by gains across banking, electronics, chip, medical software and computer-related issues, rallied nearly 0.6% and finished close to session highs. That action echoed the numerous high closes seen by the index in recent weeks.


![mp020917](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP020917-161x300.png)The NYSE composite edged out the Nasdaq composite, up almost 0.7%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials both rose 0.6%. Volume rose slightly.


Even small caps are now up for the year, another sign of the market's confidence in corporate profits and future economic growth. The Russell 2000, which blasted 19.5% higher in 2016, led the field on Thursday with a 1.5% advance.


As seen in the big charts on the General Market Indicators page (see the link at the bottom of this article), the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the Nasdaq (an A- on a scale of A to E as of Wednesday), S&P 500 (B+) and 30-stock Dow (B) all point to net accumulation by mutual funds, insurers, college endowments, pension plans and the like.


Winners trounced losing stocks on Thursday, a little more so on the Nasdaq (roughly 5 to 2) than on the NYSE (2 to 1).


Interestingly, the finance and banking sectors no longer have a stranglehold on the new high list.


Take Wednesday's session, which was light in terms of the number of companies making IBD's screened [new high list](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). Chips led the way with eight stocks, followed by Retail and Finance (six each).


On Tuesday's session, Finance was No. 1 with 14 stocks, but Insurance and Chips tied at No. 2 with 12 each.


Earnings continue to be a generally good tailwind for equities, it seems, despite some post-earnings price slumps here and there (see **iRobot** ([IRBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRBT)), **Synchronoss** ([SNCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNCR)), **Microchip Tech** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)), and **Air Products** ([APD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APD)) following its Jan. 27 report).


And while **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was volatile in after-hours trade following excellent Q4 results, the market seems to have a broad enough set of leaders to maintain positive momentum.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Nvidia sales growth accelerated for a seventh straight quarter as earnings crushed views. But here's why investors were cautious following [Nvidia's Q4 report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-beats-q4-targets-stock-falls-late-on-guidance/).*

New York-based independent research firm CFRA told IBD that the 2017 EPS estimate for S&P 500 firms is currently at $130.81 a share, up 10% vs. a year ago.


That number is even more impressive when you consider that the energy sector is still suffering with shrinking profits. CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell wrote in a note to clients that Q4 earnings among energy firms in the S&P 500 are now seen dropping 15.2%, much worse than the 7.1% decline estimated back in early December.


"2017 energy estimates, however, are moving higher," Bell wrote. "Energy and financials are the only two sectors where consensus EPS estimates have increased for each of the next four quarters."


With the S&P 500 currently at 2307, the projected earnings yield of 5.7% (130.81 divided by 2307, times 100) vs. a 2.39% yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond means that relative to government bonds, U.S. equities still pose as an attractive long-term investment.


 More than half a dozen Dow 30 industrials stocks rose 1 point or more, including some that have big business outside the U.S. (think **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT))).
And so perhaps the argument that a strong dollar will hurt the exports of multinationals holds less water. The reason? If the domestic economy revs up, it's good even for the bluest blue chips.

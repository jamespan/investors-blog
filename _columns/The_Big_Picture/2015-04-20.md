Stocks bounced back Monday from Friday's selling, while the level of distribution in the market lightened a bit.

  

Helped by strength in Internet stocks, the Nasdaq jumped 1.3%. It erased the bulk of Friday's loss and poked above the 5000 level before closing below it. The index found support at its 50-day moving average Friday, as it has since late March.

  

The S&P 500 rallied 0.9%, closing back above its 50-day moving average. It also recouped most of what it lost Friday.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1%. The IBD 50 rose 1.2%.

  

Sunday's news that China's central bank was cutting the reserve requirement for banks by 100 basis points fueled Wall Street's gains. Also, better-than-expected earnings from the likes of **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)), **Check Point Software Technologies** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)) and even oilfield service giant **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) added to the day's positive tone.

  

But for such a big day in the market, **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) was one of only a few leaders up in volume.

  

Many recent breakouts have only modest gains from their buy points. But Under Armour is one exception; it has climbed 20% from a 73.08 handle buy point. The company releases its earnings report Tuesday morning.

Despite the news from China, leading Chinese stocks delivered mixed performances Monday.

  

**Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)) rallied nearly 3%. But **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) both slipped.

  

This week and next will continue to bring a flood of earnings reports. Companies from biotech **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) to Internet search engine **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) are set to report this week.

  

Volume fell sharply from Friday's heavy pace on both major exchanges. Options expiration lifted Friday's totals, making it difficult for Monday's volume to increase.

  

On a brighter note, the March 13 distribution day expired on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 due to time. Yet the level of distribution days on the major indexes are still at relatively high levels. This, along with a market that's stuck in a trading range, means that investors should continue to take a more cautious approach.

  

This isn't the time to be fully invested. Investors may want to set smaller targets for when to take profits and when to cut losses. In a rangebound market, consider locking in gains at 10% to 15% and cutting losses at 3% to 5%.

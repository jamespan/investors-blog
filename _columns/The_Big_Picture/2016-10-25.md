Institutional investors sold heavily Tuesday, as some bellwether companies gave bearish forecasts and earnings reports sparked big moves.


The Nasdaq fell 0.5%, giving back half of Monday's 1% rally. Still, the composite has cleared some room above its 50-day moving average, an important step for the market. The S&P 500 decreased by 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slid 0.8%. But the Dow utility average bucked the trend, rising 0.6%.


After the close, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) shares were about 3% lower after a mixed earnings report. The personal technology titan missed sales expectations and earnings were only a penny above the consensus estimate. But Apple guided sales higher for the holiday quarter. The stock is a major weighting on the Nasdaq and is part of the Dow and S&P 500, making it an important element of the general market.


Volume rose across the board, which added up to a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). With six on the S&P 500 and five on the Nasdaq, the amount of institutional-size declines the past few weeks warrants continued cautious investing and selective exposure to stocks.


![MP102516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP102516-195x300.png)More important for this diagnosis is the bifurcated nature of today's market. While the Nasdaq has new highs within reach, the S&P 500, Dow industrials, Russell 2000 and other key indexes remain below their 50-day lines, and some of those lines are bending lower. A good market doesn't behave like that.


The IBD 50 fell 1%, weighed by a dozen components that fell more than 2%.


But the market hasn't deteriorated to the point that it requires total abstention. There are a sufficient number of solid stocks making headway. **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), **KB Financial** ([KB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KB)), **Worthington Industries** ([WOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOR)) and **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) are among breakouts in the past few weeks that are working out so far.


Now in the wide part of earnings season, the market saw some troubling messages from major industrial companies such as **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)). Caterpillar lowered its outlook and expects soft demand into next year. GM warned that it may miss its targets for Europe and it sees the U.S. market having "plateaued." 3M trimmed its full-year profit outlook to below analysts' consensus estimate.


It was a gloomy set of forecasts that only added questions for the market. In particular, the home improvement industry was shaken by a combination of disappointing results and weak outlooks.


**Whirlpool** ([WHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHR)) gapped down to a loss of nearly 11% in the highest volume in more than a year. The appliance manufacturer missed profit and sales estimates, and it cut its full-year earnings outlook. The company cited soft demand in the U.S. and the U.K. amid the weakening British pound.


**Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) missed Q3 estimates. The stock fell 11% to the lowest level since February. **Masco** ([MAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAS)) plunged 9.5% in heavy trading, falling below the long-term 200-day moving average. The maker of doors, windows, cabinets and other home construction products also missed third-quarter profit expectations. **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)) slid 4% in double its usual volume.


Apparel, restaurant, leisure product and other retail industry groups fell more than 1.5%. **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) crashed 13% on a weak outlook, and **Sonic** ([SONC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SONC)) plummeted nearly 17% in big volume after the restaurant chain missed sales estimates.


It all added up to a bad day for the consumer sector. U.S. consumer confidence fell more than expected in October, to the lowest level since July. But the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index was at odds, registering a 9.9% leap in October to 51.3, its highest reading since April 2015.

Stock Market Drops, Nasdaq Aims At History; Watch These 4 D's Regarding Inflation
==================================================================================

A bullish stock market normally finishes the day strong. Tuesday saw equities end ugly.




For most of the session, the indexes bobbed up and down in a relatively tight band. But a sell-off in the final 20 minutes of trading made it clear the sellers were in charge.


You could blame a number of reasons for the drop. [U.S. housing starts](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) fizzled in April. [Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pounded the table for higher corporate taxes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-falls-as-yellen-touts-higher-taxes-unions-walmart-stock-surges-on-earnings/) during a meeting with American business chiefs. The U.S. dollar continued to shrink against the euro and the Japanese yen. Bitcoin has plunged more than 30% from its peak near $63,000. The prospects for a new nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran fueled profit-taking in crude oil.


Keep in mind that Energy, which headed into Tuesday's action ranked [No. 2 among 33 sectors in IBD's stock tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-may-17-2021/), now has a market leadership role.


A News-Driven Late-Minute Slide?
--------------------------------


![MP051821_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP051821_2-207x300.jpg)The declines among key indexes — ranging from 0.6% for the Nasdaq to around 0.8% to 0.9% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) — didn't rock the market too hard. Yet technically speaking, the action disappointed.


Midcaps fell a little more. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) lost nearly 1.1%. The iShares Transportation ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) ETF retreated almost 1.3%.


Commodity stocks took a break as a few beaten-down IPOs in the tech space — consider **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) and **UiPath** ([PATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PATH)), which got some air play in the [IBD Live show Tuesday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) — enjoyed some bargain hunting.


Volume rose 7% vs. Monday on the Nasdaq and jumped 6% on the NYSE. The [distribution day count](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains elevated overall. Also troubling, on a technical level, the Nasdaq composite, Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 are still having a tough time rebounding back above their respective [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Stock Market History In The Making?
-----------------------------------



Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 and the Nasdaq composite face the possibility of a fifth straight down week. This hasn't happened since a six-week slide in October and November of 2012. However, we are not seeing the kind of free-fall witnessed at the start of the bear market in the fourth quarter of 2018, or the coronavirus stock market crash of February-March 2020.


In fact, given the stubborn rise in bullishness (please monitor the weekly [Investors Intelligence survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) posted every Wednesday), the current decline may in fact be healthy. Pullbacks help keep the longer-term uptrend alive.


Compared with last week's gyrations, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq seem to want to calm down. Check out the weekly charts in both, and for now you'll spy an [inside week](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/) in the making.



For now, volatility in the long end of the U.S. Treasury market has slowed. Cboe data showed the benchmark 10-year bond yield at 1.64% — more than a stone's throw away from its March peak at 1.76%. The yield has hardly budged since the start of May.


Clearly, that's good for equities.

Scared About Inflation? The 4 D's To Consider
---------------------------------------------



Another sudden spike in the cost of money would indicate even more fear about inflation and the cost of companies in being able to invest in the future or keep up a healthy appetite for stock buybacks.


Michael Arone, chief investment strategist of the U.S. SPDR sector ETF unit at State Street Global Advisors, thinks the Federal Reserve will truly act aggressively to curtail — and possibly end — monthly bond purchases to keep interest rates down only when it sees true signs of a hot labor market. He also notes economic forecasters have largely been whiffing in their estimates on job growth, retail sales and other measures of the economy.


And it's understandable. While we've seen historic actions by the Fed and the U.S. government to stimulate the recovery, a health care crisis as big as the Covid-19 pandemic has made it hard to predict how fast the economy will come back.


"I think headline (price index) numbers will continue to rise and give an inflationary scare. But debt, the deficit, demographics and the disinflationary forces of technology will put a limit" on how much inflation will rise beyond 2021, Arone notes.


Keep eyes out for the market's reaction to the unveiling Wednesday of minutes from the Fed's April 27-28 meeting on interest rates.

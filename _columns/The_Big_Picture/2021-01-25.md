The stock market kicked off the week with another volatile session Monday. But what looked like a harsh distribution day taking shape in the morning ended up being a constructive outside day for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500.




The Nasdaq composite gapped up at the open and rose nearly 1.4% intraday. But a wave of selling hit the index around 8 a.m. PT, hurting breakout attempts for [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)). But Palantir rallied strongly into the close, ending nicely above the 33.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Leaderboard subscribers were alerted to a buy signal for Palantir on Friday when the stock [broke out over a short trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/). The company's inaugural Demo Day, where Palantir will showcase the latest developments to its software platform, is scheduled for Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. PT.


Pinduoduo, meanwhile, cleared an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/) with a 187.80 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). But the China leader closed near sessions lows and below the entry. The three pullbacks in the ascending base, as highlighted in a [Leaderboard chart](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), are easily seen on the daily chart.



Stock Market Today
------------------


After falling 1.3% intraday, the Nasdaq composite closed with a gain of 0.7%. The S&P 500 also scored a bullish close and rose 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged lower but closed near its session high. The Russell 2000 small-cap index fell nearly 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Friday, resulting in yet another accumulation day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.

Keep in mind that out of the S&P 500's five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/), just one had the feel of meaningful distribution. That's when the index slumped 1.5% in higher volume on Jan. 4.


Apple held up well in the Dow Jones today ahead of its earnings report Wednesday after the close. It's still in the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) after a breakout over a 138.89 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Apple is among a group of high-profile technology stocks set to report earnings this week. Watch for other reports from **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).


Leading Sectors
---------------


Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, utility, real estate and consumer staple stocks outperformed. Energy and financial stocks lagged. Financial stocks were pressured, hurt by falling bond yields. The key 10-year Treasury yield was recently trading around 1.03%, down 6 basis points.


At one point Monday, the Nasdaq was nearly 9% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). That's a lofty level where a pullback wouldn't be out of the ordinary. Keep in mind, though, that the Nasdaq rose to 12% above its 50-day line in early September before correcting 13% off its high.


Increasing volatility in the stock market, along with excessive bullishness and euphoria in many individual stocks, is reason enough to be defensive. If you haven't done so already, consider raising cash to lower exposure. The risk seems to outweigh the reward at this point, although Monday's upside reversal for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showed that buyers are still around.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) had a volatile session and suffered an [outside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-an-outside-day-in-stock-charts/). But it didn't give up much ground from Friday's close, falling just 0.4%. The IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks was weighed down by weakness in **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)), **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)).


More Frothy Action
------------------


Market froth was evident once again Monday with huge intraday gains for **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)) and **iRobot** ([IRBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRBT)). But all three stocks ended well off session highs.


**Yalla Group** ([YALA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YALA)), an emerging leader in the internet content group, was a bright spot. Shares soared more than 30%, good for a breakout from a six-week cup base with a 23.28 buy point.



Another new issue, **MediaAlpha** ([MAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAX)), gapped up over a 46.93 early entry within its base, rising nearly 7% to 47.53.


Security software stocks were notable laggards Monday. The group lost 1%, fueled by big decliners for stock market leaders like **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)).


CrowdStrike and Zscaler are [Leaderboard stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). The Zscaler position was trimmed Monday due to a relatively heavy weighting in the Leaderboard portfolio. Palo Alto Networks slipped 1% but found support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).

Questions For Stock Market Will Soon Get Answers
=================================================

The coming days pose two big questions for the stock market. Can companies surpass the Street's expectations on Q4 results? And can quality stocks start delivering breakouts?




On Friday, stock indexes hedged their bets. Some money came off the table, but a great deal remains untouched.


The Nasdaq dropped 0.2% Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were just under flat. Small caps, as gauged in the Russell 2000, rose 0.1%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.

Gains For The Week
------------------


The tech-leaning Nasdaq gained 4%, 2.3% and 3.5% in the past three weeks.


The large-cap index S&P 500 advanced 2.9%, 1.9% and 2.5%.


The blue chip Dow Jones rose 2.7%, 1.6% and 2.4%.


Small caps as gauged in the Russell 2000 pocketed 3.5%, 3.2% and 4.8%.


Top Movers So Far In 2019
-------------------------


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the best performers in 2019 so far are specialty consumer products (largely marijuana-related stocks); movies (mainly **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX))) and oil stocks.


The lack of breakouts has made it tough for IBD-style investors to get exposure.


On Friday, only three stocks either broke out or tried to break out. **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) popped 1.1% to cross above a 187.86 buy point in an awkward double-bottom base.


Restaurant chain **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) advanced 1.4%, clearing a 72.10 buy point in a cup base but then fell back under the entry.


Cereal maker **Post** ([POST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POST)) rose for a 10th consecutive session and topped a 98.76 buy point. Volume, though, was quiet.


In the meantime, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) has been attracting attention. The stock cleared a 501.08 buy point the past week in strong weekly volume. Chipotle's relative strength line is at a high, and the pattern is a double bottom. The stock's 5% buy zone runs to 526.13.


Questions For The Stock Market: Are Earnings The Answer?
--------------------------------------------------------


What about the companies about to report results? Are there any stock charts that look poised for a breakout?


A look at 50 companies ready to report provided the answer: 0-for-50. An athlete who went 0-for-50 would be looking at some serious bench time.


Bench time might be tempting but this is not a market in correction. A few test buys (small positions) would be prudent.

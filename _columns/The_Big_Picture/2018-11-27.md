The stock market had a hard time finding direction Tuesday, and ultimately closed with modest gains that kept a rally attempt — and investors' hopes — alive.




Indexes opened lower after President Trump signaled a willingness to escalate the trade war by raising and expanding tariffs on Chinese imports.


The Nasdaq was down as much as 0.9% early on, but soon bounced back. After shifting direction a few times, the composite and other major indexes found strength in afternoon trading. The Nasdaq closed a fraction higher and the S&P 500 up 0.3%.

After a period of high volatility, the market has calmed down. Since starting its gyrations Oct. 4, the average daily price swing in the Nasdaq was 2.3%. But since the eve of Thanksgiving, the average swing diminished to 1.1%.


Volatility is often a reflex of fear and uncertainty, so maybe there's a good sign in all this. Still, the market waits for a [follow-through bottoming signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). Investors must remain patient, looking for top stocks shaping attractive patterns while holding off on new purchases for now.


Despite positive index action, Tuesday's market reflected a defensive tone. Health care, consumer staples and utilities led. Cyclicals such as materials, energy and industrials were the only S&P sectors to drop.


Small caps were weaker, with the Russell 2000 off 0.9%. Biotechs lagged and contributed to the weakness in small caps.


The IBD 50 eased 0.1% after **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)), **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) tumbled.


Combine the sector performance with the weakness in leading stocks and small caps, and there's three reasons to believe the market needs more time to heal.


Volume rose on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Breadth was much poorer than the index gains would suggest. Declining stocks led advancers by an 8-5 ratio on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4% on a day when its fortunes depended heavily on a single component.


**United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) slid as much as 7% in heavy volume before paring its loss to 4%. The company [announced it will spin off](https://www.investors.com/news/united-technologies-stock-breakup-cost-collins-cash-flow/) its Carrier climate-control unit and Otis elevators, and will keep Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace Systems. United Technologies also completed the acquisition of Rockwell Collins.


Airlines also led Tuesday as **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) soared on a bullish metric. The discount carrier expects total [revenue per available seat mile to jump about 11%](https://www.investors.com/news/spirit-airlines-stock-soars-bullish-revenue-projection-airline-stocks/) in Q4, well above an earlier forecast. Spirit shares gapped up to a 15% gain, touching the highest level since August 2015.


**Sunrun** ([RUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUN)) jumped 8%, adding some space above its 50-day moving average. The provider of solar power systems for homes is forming the right side of a base. Solar stocks were Tuesday's best industry group, up 4.2%.

The stock market turned in another impressive performance Monday with a weak open and strong close. Helped by another bullish showing for [software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), the Nasdaq led the way with a 1.2% gain after being down as much as 0.8% intraday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 reversed higher after falling more than 1% intraday.




The S&P 500 picked up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones industrials and Russell 2000 small-cap index closed with gains of 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in lower than Friday.


A key support level to watch for the Nasdaq composite is its 200-day moving average, currently around 8429. It closed Monday more than 3% above that level. For the S&P 500, it's the 50-day moving average, just under 2750. The index closed Monday 3.3% above that level.


The daily charts of the Dow Jones and Russell 2000 small-cap index have similar looks. Both indexes are below their 200-day moving averages as they test support at the 50-day moving average.


Stock Market 'Tells'
--------------------


The major stock indexes give "tells" all the time about their underlying health. Weak opens and strong closes are hallmarks of healthy markets, and Monday's action showed that buyers are still around.


Buyers were around last week when the Nasdaq eased 0.3% in heavy volume on Thursday. It closed in the upper half of its range and inside the prior day's range. It was another bullish "tell" by the Nasdaq because it barely budged after soaring 3.6% the prior session.

IBD's [airline group](https://www.investors.com/news/airline-industry-news-and-stocks-to-watch-united-delta-american-southwest/) gave back around 4%, hurt by weakness in former Warren Buffett holdings **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)), **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) and **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)). All four stocks offer a good lesson about why it's dangerous trying to catch a stock "on sale" amid unequivocal signs of institutional selling.


Software Sector Leads Stock Market
----------------------------------


[IBD's enterprise software group](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) was one of the day's top performing groups, rising more than 3%.


Software stocks are well represented in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks, with names like **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) making the cut as of Friday's close.


Veeva is trading tightly near highs after a breakout — so much so that a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) could be in place by the end of the week. Adobe and Autodesk are just below [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



After a breakout over a 149.80 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), the Atlassian position was increased on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Monday when it cleared an alternate entry of 156.22.


After a strong earnings report last week, ServiceNow is forming a nice [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 363.05 [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But the stock could form a [handle area](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/), which would present an earlier entry. When a stock forms [the right side of a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), it's common for sellers to get shaken out of a stock one last time before a possible breakout. Watch to see if that happens with ServiceNow.


IBD's biotech group also rallied more than 3%, helped by strong showings from top-rated stocks like **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) and **Exelixis** ([EXEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXEL)).


Stock Market Health
-------------------


Despite the Nasdaq's outperformance Monday, the index didn't get much help from [semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news). The Philadelphia Semiconductor index lagged for most of the session but strengthened late to close with a gain of 1%.

But two leading chip stocks bounced back after some selling last week. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) surged more than 5%. It's firming up around the 50 level after four straight declines, but it still has a ways to go to get to a 58.73 [cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) gained 3%. It's still holding above a 175.50 handle buy point, but a [new five-day handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) shows an alternate, or add-on, entry of 304.30.


With only one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, the confirmed uptrend still has plenty going for it. A low distribution count, plus a nice supply of bullish charts among institutional-quality growth stocks, are two reasons to be optimistic about the confirmed uptrend. If distribution days start to increase significantly in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, that will likely cause problems for the confirmed uptrend, but it's not happening yet.


It's a relatively quiet week of economic data, but Friday's April jobs report looms large. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to plunge by 21.25 million, with the unemployment rate soaring to 16.5% from 4.4% in March.


Stock Market Earnings
---------------------


Meanwhile, it's another busy week of earnings, with several top-rated growth stocks near buy points ahead of results.



**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/shopify-stock-shows-bullish-action-ahead-of-earnings/) column, is near the top of a cup base with a 124.55 entry. Results are due Wednesday after the close.


**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) has formed a "shelf" (as often described for such chart action [in the IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958)) as it trades tightly near highs. A shelf is simply a short consolidation that can present an add-on entry. Tight trading after a breakout is a sign of strength and support. Shopify reports earnings Wednesday before the open.


Other stocks on breakout watch with earnings due this week include, **Match** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Bill.com** ([BILL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILL)) and **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)).

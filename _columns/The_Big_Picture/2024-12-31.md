The final trading day of 2024 wasn't a great one for stock market bulls Tuesday, as the major stock indexes extended losses after Monday's higher-volume declines for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500.


The Russell 2000 outperformed in the early going, up 1%, but that was when the 10-year Treasury yield traded down to 4.51%. Then, sellers knocked the small-cap index well off highs after the 10-year yield reversed higher off its 10-day moving average. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 4.57%, up three basis points.




The Russell 2000 closed with a gain of 0.1%, ending a terrible December that saw the index swoon more than 8%. It was its worst month since September 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data. For the year, the Russell lagged the other major stock indexes with a gain of 10%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite extended its losing streak to four sessions, reversing lower for a loss of 0.9%. Volume rose again, giving the index its fifth distribution day in the past 10 sessions. The Nasdaq made a stand at its 21-day exponential moving average Friday. But after two straight declines since then, the index is close to a test of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The Nasdaq delivered a December gain of 0.5%. For the year, it jumped nearly 29%.


Â 


The Nasdaq's third distribution day in a row was enough for IBD to lower its exposure level to 40% to 60%. It was the second cut in exposure level in as many days after the S&P 500 slumped below its 50-day line Monday. Amid increasing signs of institutional selling, it makes sense to err on the side of caution and raise more cash.


The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also reversed lower, ending with losses of 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively. Declining stocks had a slight edge over advancers on the Nasdaq. Over on the NYSE, breadth was positive by about 12-7. The S&P 500 closed out December with a loss of 2.5%. For the year, it rallied just over 23%. The Dow Jones industrials slumped 5.3% in December and ended the year with a gain of nearly 13%.


The stock market is dealing with plenty of uncertainty headed into 2025. Distribution days have definitely started to cluster on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while the 10-year yield is holding on to the bulk of a 42-basis-point gain since Dec. 6.


As it stands now, futures traders at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) expect one or two rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2025. One of the bigger concerns for the stock market now is if inflation stays elevated, will it eventually curb consumer spending and slow the economy down more than expected in 2025?

Leaders Hold Up
---------------


Of course, that's not an easy question to answer now. But it does underscore the importance of monitoring distribution days in the indexes, along with the price action of stock market leaders. When it comes to the former, there are certainly reasons to be cautious. There's nothing wrong with playing defense when distribution days start to cluster on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. But when it comes to sell signals among leading growth stocks, they've been few and far between.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP123124-300x291.jpg)Recent breakouts from chip designers like **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) are holding well, while other big leaders like **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **Astera Labs** ([ALAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALAB)) are still holding comfortably above their 10-week moving averages.


Perhaps the most noteworthy development in the stock market now is the number of top-performing growth stocks that are testing their 10-week lines. The list is too long to count, but strong performers like **Vertex** ([VERX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VERX)), **GoDaddy** ([GDDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDDY)) and **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) are making key tests, along with **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).


If an increasing number of leading growth stocks start to break support at their 10-week lines, it would be another signal to raise more cash.


Bullish gainers were hard to come by Tuesday, but in the security software group, **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) made the cut. Shares jumped 4% to an all-time high. CyberArk came just short of completing a five-week flat base. Still, the stock's weekly chart looks bullish with a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) in new high ground and support at the 10-week line.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), meanwhile, fell more than 3% and undercut its 21-day exponential moving average ahead of Q4 delivery data due Thursday.

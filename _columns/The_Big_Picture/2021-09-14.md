  Stock Market Drops Broadly; Inflation News Whacks These Industries

A [cooling off in U.S. consumer prices](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) in August appeared to satisfy government bond investors on Tuesday. But the surprise economic data also let the air out of numerous top industries within the stock market today.




Except for a 1.3% decline for the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) and a 1.1% slump by SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)), the major indexes fell moderately. They ranged between losses of 0.3% for the Nasdaq 100 and almost 0.5% for the Nasdaq composite to 0.6% for the S&P 500 and 0.8% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Russell 2000 closed below its 50-day moving average.


Volume fell on both main exchanges.


But the real damage centered on financial, industrial, telecom and select commodity-linked stocks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP091421-218x300.jpg)IBD slices and dices the stock market into 197 industry groups. A few of these groups have shrunk to just a modicum of stocks and deserve less attention. But on Tuesday, selling was clearly pronounced in oil and gas exploration, telecom services and infrastructure, chemicals, banking and steel shares. At least three dozen industry groups centered around these areas slid 2% or more.


(Please go to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to see the final results of all 197 industry groups.)


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) handed new holders an unpleasant reversal.


Early gains of as much as 1.9% dissipated into a 1.4% drop. Volume jumped 42% above the stock's 50-day moving average and hit the highest level since Aug. 9.


Notice on a daily chart how progress by Goldman Sachs, a member of IBD's money center bank group since its Aug. 6 breakout past a 393.36 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an [eight-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/), looks piecemeal at best.



Market breadth among Nasdaq stocks improved in the latter half of August. But on Tuesday, falling stocks trounced rising ones by a nearly 5-2 margin.


You can monitor the Nasdaq's advance-decline line in two ways: one, via the General Market Indicators chart page at the bottom of every Big Picture; and two, by typing in "GMIAB" in MarketSmith's stock quote box.

Decliners bested gainers by more than 2 to 1 on the NYSE.


In recent months, strategists up and down Wall Street voiced their worries about inflation becoming more permanent than transitory. If inflation stays stubbornly strong, they contend, the Federal Reserve would likely begin tapering their monthly bond purchases sooner rather than later this year.


Then came Tuesday's data surprise.


A 0.1% jump in August for core consumer level prices vs. the prior month confounded [Econoday's consensus estimate](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of a 0.3% gain. It proved just how difficult it is to forecast the economy. The top-line increase, 0.3%, also came in below 0.4% expectations. Bond bulls came roaring back into long-dated U.S. Treasuries. Cboe data showed the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond sinking nearly 5 basis points to 1.27% â€” the lowest close since Aug. 23.


Stock Market Dissonance?
------------------------



The S&P 500 has now fallen in six of the past seven sessions. This suggests a few things. Either buyers are fatigued. Or, market participants are reducing their expectations for future earnings growth. (Notice that the [IBD Economic Optimism Index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/ibdtipp-poll-economic-optimism-index/) has fallen three months in a row.)


Yet the losing streak hasn't been steep enough to send the key benchmark beneath its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


The last time this happened? On July 19, the S&P 500 really fell hard. A gap down at the open paved the way for a 1.6% drubbing that day. The index also briefly pricked its 50-day line for first time in a month. Yet since then, large caps have truly shown mettle.

One could not say the same for steel producers on Tuesday.


For months, **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Ternium** ([TX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TX)) have acted as some of this year's stock market darlings. These and other materials suppliers staged nice breakouts and posted market-beating returns.



But are the bulls tiring?


The first two clipped their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Ternium is approaching its 50-day line.


Steel Dynamics and Nucor also surrendered all of the gains from their latest breakouts. Steel Dynamics ducked below a 63.28 entry point in a [shallow double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/).


Nucor boasted a 16% profit just four days into its rally out of a [cup-without-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) at 111.07. Those gains have vanished.


When a stock gives up a solid short-term gain like that, it triggers a [key IBD defensive sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/key-sell-signal-saved-stamps-com-stock-investors-from-posting-big-losses/).

Keep Watching China
-------------------



Oil prices actually rose mildly on Tuesday. But oil stock investors appeared to pay more attention to an intention by China, the world's No. 2 economy, to release some of its strategic oil reserves.


Nonetheless, many of the biggest winners in 2021 in the oil sector remain in base-building mode. Just look at **Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)), **Devon Energ**y ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)), **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) and **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)).

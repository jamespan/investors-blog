Inflation Data, Earnings
------------------------


Investors will get [monthly PCE inflation data](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-key-inflation-rate-may-trip-up-the-sp-500/) on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. December inflation data will be broken out with Friday's personal income and spending report. Wall Street expects Friday's data to show the PCE price index was flat in December, as the annual inflation rate slowed to 5% from 5.5%. Core PCE prices are seen rising 0.3%, as the core inflation rate slips to 4.4% from 4.7%.


The Fed's favorite inflation rate, the core PCE price index, eased to a 3.85% annual rate in Q4, new data released with the GDP report showed Thursday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP012623-223x300.jpg)The Commerce Department's Q4 GDP reading slowed to 2.9% annualized growth, higher than the expected 2.7% growth vs. Q3 growth of 3.2%. Meanwhile, the Labor Department's initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell to 186,000. Claims were expected to rise to 202,000 vs. 190,000 in the previous week.


EV giant **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) surged 11% Thursday after the [company's strong Q4 results.](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-amid-january-rebound-with-earnings-due/) Tesla earnings advanced 40% to $1.19 a share while revenue grew 37% to $24.32 billion. Earnings topped estimates, while sales fell short of analyst forecasts.


Fourth-quarter earnings season continued, with results from **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Mobileye Global** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) andÂ **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)).


American Airlines shares climbed nearly 2.2%, while Southwest stock declined 3.2%. Dow Jones stock [IBM beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-stock-ibm-earnings-q4-2022/), but shares fell 4.5%, closing below the 200-day line.


Shares of Mastercard lost more than 1.3% [after its Q4 report](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-stock-mastercard-report-earnings/). Mobileye shares jumped nearly 6% on strong fourth-quarter results. ServiceNow [reported December-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/now-stock-servicenow-earnings-q42022/) that topped views while revenue growth only met expectations.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%, and the S&P 500 gained 1.1%. The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.8%, as the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.7%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the prior session. The Nasdaq's sole [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) of the current uptrend fell off due to a 5% rise from the close on Jan. 18. That left just the S&P 500 with two days of institutional selling.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed nearly 1.4% Thursday as the ETF of top growth stocks made it a four-day win streak. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) jumped 5.1%, moving out of buy range from a 1,095.44 buy point.


IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) is in a "confirmed uptrend" amid strong gains since early January, when the Nasdaq signaled a [follow-through day on Jan. 6](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-powers-higher-in-first-rally-of-2023-these-groups-fare-best/). Given the market's current strength, it makes sense to methodically raise your exposure if your trades are doing well, with an invested percentage of 40%-60%. Profitable trading should push you closer to the 60% threshold, especially after Thursday's tech-fueled gains.


Looking ahead, the Nasdaq faces a key test of resistance, with its 200-day line just above Thursday's close. The tech-heavy composite hasn't been above that level since Jan. 14, 2022. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is nearing the 4100 level, which has been a resistance area in the past, namely in November and December.



Energy Stocks Outperform: Exxon Breaks Out
------------------------------------------


Crude oil prices continued to hold near their recent highs, as West Texas Intermediate futures traded above $81 a barrel. And energy stocks are benefiting from those rising oil prices.


**Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) broke out above a 114.76 buy point in a flat base, rallying 4% Thursday. The 5% buy area goes up to 120.50.


Dow Jones energy giant **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) jumped nearly 5% after the company raised its dividend and announced a [$75 billion stock buyback program](https://www.investors.com/news/chevron-returns-75-billion-to-shareholders-as-white-house-fumes/). Chevron's earnings are due out early Friday.


Other notable energy stocks include [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) stocks **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)) and **SLB** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)). Hess shares are extended past a 149.93 buy point, while SLB is just above a 56.14 entry.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Axon, Etsy, Paccar
-------------------------------------------------


Security leader Axon closed Thursday in buy range above a 189.72 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The buy zone tops out at 199.21.

[Etsy broke out](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/etsy-stock-emerges-from-a-difficult-time/) past a 137.01 buy point in a cup with handle Monday, but fell further below the entry with a 1% loss Thursday. The stock also can be interpreted to be forming a cup base with a 142.63 entry.

[Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/paccar-stock-drives-into-buy-zone-on-earnings/) Paccar closed Thursday at the top of the 5% buy range from a 107.28 buy point. Shares surged 8.6% Tuesday after the company's strong Q4 earnings and sales.


Through subsidiaries DAF, Kenworth, Peterbilt and Leyland, Paccar produces a worldwide portfolio of light-, medium- and heavy-duty semi-trucks. Paccar also designs and manufactures diesel engines and vehicle performance technology. In addition, the company provides parts distribution and financial services.

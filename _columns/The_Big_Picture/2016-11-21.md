A shortened week of trading kicked off Monday with solid gains for the major stock indexes as the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite notched all-time closing highs. Oil prices surged, and the Russell 2000 extended its winning streak to 12 sessions.


December-delivery West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $47.49 a barrel, up nearly 4%, as traders grew confident that an output-cut agreement will be reached at the Nov. 30 OPEC meeting.


The Nasdaq composite outperformed, rising 0.9%, while strength in the so-called FANG stocks helped lift the Nasdaq 100 to a 1.1% gain. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) showed gains of 1% to 4%. Facebook fared the best, up 4%, helped by news late Friday of a big share buyback.


![mpmixed112116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MPmixed112116.png)The S&P 500 added 0.7% while the Dow picked up 0.5%. The Dow was buoyed by strength in **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)). The Russell 2000 rose 0.5%, and the IBD 50 outperformed with a 1% gain. Volume on the NYSE rose slightly from Friday's levels. Nasdaq volume was lower.


Breadth was good on the NYSE with advancers topping decliners by about 3-to-1. It was much narrower on the Nasdaq, with winners topping losers by 3-to-2.


As the year winds down, the performance of the major stock indexes postelection has been impressive. The bulls like the fact that the major averages are at all-time highs, partly due to optimism about improved economic growth under a Trump presidency. Indeed, the bull argument holds water [as outlined by IBD](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-win-stocks-rise-new-bull-market/) last week.


Market bulls also like the fact that the number of new highs has expanded nicely in recent days. Banks and other financials have been well represented, but several other areas of the market are showing strength, including semiconductor stocks and oil & gas names.


Several base-building oil and gas producers are near buy points.


Among large-cap names, **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) is working on a flat base with a 98.42 buy point. **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) is also carving a flat base, not far from a 45.72 buy point. Meanwhile, smaller names like **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) and **Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)) are quickly approaching buy points.


Big gainers in the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) included **LifeLock** ([LOCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOCK)) and **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)). Shares of LifeLock surged around 15% after **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)) agreed to buy the identity-theft-protection firm for $2.3 billion. Arista Networks, meanwhile, jumped 7% after the maker of network gear for cloud computing said it received U.S. customs approval to begin importing goods related to its litigation with **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)).


Late Monday, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Jack In The Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)) fell in after-hours trading as investors weighed earnings. Palo Alto slumped 12% while Jack in the Box lost 3%.


Economic data this week include October existing-home sales on Tuesday. Orders for durable goods, weekly jobless claims, new-home sales and consumer confidence data are due Wednesday.

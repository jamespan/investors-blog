Market veterans will often tell you, watch out in January. IBD Founder and Chairman Bill O'Neil has often remarked that January is usually a good time to stay on the sidelines.


Yet for now, the message for bearish investors may be this: Watch out.


Continuing a trend of solid gains, often in heavy trade or higher turnover than the prior session, stocks followed a bullish script that really took form after President-elect [Donald Trump's stunning victory](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-win-stocks-rise-new-bull-market/) on Nov. 8.


Of course, some of the gains over the past two months may have been the result of short covering. Bearish investors who have sold index futures, ETFs or individual equities short have been no doubt taken to the cleaners. Did you notice how the short selling research firms have not been simply wrong lately, but also relatively quiet?


The Nasdaq composite beat the S&P 500 on Wednesday with a 0.9% gain, while the latter rose 0.6%. Nasdaq volume edged a touch lower. Yet given the above-average turnover seen among a host of high-quality companies (see the "Leaders up in volume" section of the Market Pulse), the action indicated that equity trading desks on Wall Street and across the nation got busy accumulating shares.


The Dow Jones industrials, a solid winner in 2016, gained just 0.3%. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.5%.


The Russell 2000, a 19.5% winner in 2016, rallied 1.6% on Wednesday.


However, the NYSE composite almost matched the tech-heavy Nasdaq's performance, rising more than 0.8%. And no wonder, considering how the rally on Wednesday was extremely broad. On the NYSE, winners pounded losers by a more than 5-1 margin. On the Nasdaq, the ratio was nearly 4-to-1.


![MP010417](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP010417-202x300.png)NYSE turnover rose slightly.


Investors did not seem too concerned about comments found in the latest minutes of the Federal Reserve's Dec. 13-14 meeting, in which the fed funds rate moved up a quarter point to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%.


As Reuters noted, the minutes showed that "many participants judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate had increased somewhat and that the Committee might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly."


In other words, U.S. central bankers are now seeing both the U.S. labor market and the economy possibly getting even hotter, which could whip up inflation from its longtime staid rate. This, in turn, could lead to faster increases in the cost of money so that the Fed does not fail to uphold its mandate of keeping the rate of rising prices in check.


While some stocks are priming for potential new breakouts from bullish bases, some big winners of 2016 are definitely in need of a rest.


Perhaps there's no better example today than **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which was one of the biggest market winners in 2016 and ran up more than 150% after breaking out of a cup with handle at 33.16 in mid-March.


As noted in a [Stock Market Today column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/nasdaq-leads-gains-apple-up-did-nvidia-just-signal-a-correction-is-near/), Nvidia traced some of the major elements of a climax run during a more-than-30% charge higher over a span of 10 trading sessions.


While the pioneering chip technology firm may not yet at all reached its ultimate peak in the stock market, the near-vertical action was unsustainable, and thus a pullback was definitely due.


Nvidia's CEO was slated to make a keynote address at the CES tech trade show in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening.


The year 2017 will certainly not be without risks. Investors need to assess macroeconomic risks in a truly global world.


Will inflation jump faster than expected? Will French and German elections later this year lead to a higher risk that the EU will unravel? How will China handle its bulging debt load? Will Trump take steps that hinder trade and give a further boost in the prices of consumer goods, overcoming the cost efficiencies that e-commerce has helped achieve?


The prudent investor never forgets the risks involved, and every stock has risk. For that reason, IBD's [golden rule of selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) — cut losses in every investment at 7% or 8% — never changes.


You'll likely see more headlines noting concern about China's heightening naval activity in the South China Sea. Pundits continue to comment and predict whether the Middle Kingdom is succeeding in transforming the economy into one that is more about consumption and innovation and less about manufacturing and exports.


Yet for now, the Chinese equity indexes have joined the U.S. market in an early-January advance.


The Nasdaq-esque Shenzhen composite roared ahead more than 2% in the first two days of the year. The Shanghai composite has risen three days in a row, good for nearly a 2% lift.


That's quite a change from the chilling drop exactly a year ago (the Shanghai comp plunged 6.9% on Jan. 4, 2015, then slid another 7% three sessions later) that helped spur a sell-off on Wall Street.

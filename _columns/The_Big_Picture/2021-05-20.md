The stock market ended higher Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rebounded from critical support levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed, but remained just below its 50-day moving average.




The Nasdaq jumped 1.8% Thursday. The S&P 500 climbed 1.1%, while the Dow Jones industrials gained 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.6%.


Leading growth stocks ended squarely higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.7%. No. 3-ranked [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) advanced 4.6%, extending a win streak to five sessions. The stock is moving closer to a 165.76 buy point. Bullishly, the stock's RS line is climbing sharply as well.


Volume ended lower on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![Market Pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP052020-227x300.jpg)Following Wednesday's tests of their 50-day support levels, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rebounded with moderate to strong gains Thursday.


Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is testing potential resistance at the 50-day line. The index has been below the line since May 10. If the tech-heavy composite is able to decisively reclaim the 50-day line, it could be a signal that tech stocks are rotating back into favor. However, if the Nasdaq fails this test, investors should prepare for further volatility.


Despite Thursday's bullish rebound, there is still a heavy amount of distribution, indicating a high amount of market risk. The S&P 500 holds seven days of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), while the Nasdaq has five. Given the high amount of selling, investors should continue to be picky about their investment choices. Keep exposure relatively limited.



Stock Market Earnings
---------------------


Chip giant **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) [easily beat Wall Street's targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amat-stock-news-applied-materials-stomps-q2-estimates/) for its fiscal second quarter and guided higher for the current period.

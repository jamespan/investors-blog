Seldom does the stock market face a week like this one, with a new policy statement from the Federal Reserve while the thickest part of [earnings season](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) unfolds. The reaction on Wall Street Wednesday was basically a whimper.




The stock market barely moved after the Fed, as expected, left interest rates unchanged and gave no sign that it's relaxing its easy-money stance.


The [policy statement was more positive this time](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/why-todays-federal-reserve-meeting-is-last-respite-for-sp-500/). It cited improving economic activity and employment trends. Even the sectors most hurt during the pandemic are looking better. While inflation has picked up, the Fed chalked it up to "transitory factors."


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note gave back gains once the 2 p.m. ET Fed statement came out and was quoted nearly unchanged from Tuesday, at 1.62%.

But once Fed Chairman Jerome Powell started his press conference, the stock market's tectonic plates started moving a bit.


Indexes added to gains after Powell said it's not time to start talking about tapering bond purchases, and that it will "take some time" to see adequate progress on the economic recovery. But indexes started reversing lower at 3:10 p.m. as Powell answered more questions. Among his comments, Powell said some asset prices are "a bit frothy."


S&P Hits Record High Even As Stock Market Eases
-----------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite closed 0.3% lower and near session lows. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1% but still made another record high during its afternoon peak.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE. Thus, the Nasdaq avoided a [second straight distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). The S&P 500's drop was far too small to mark it as a session of heavy institutional selling.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost almost 0.5%. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) gapped down despite the fact that [March-quarter results beat views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-news-software-giant-beats-views-on-cloud-computing-strength/) and the company raised guidance. Two other Dow components — **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) — added to the Dow's slump. Amgen gapped down to a loss of more than 18% after the [biotech posted declines in sales and profit](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-amgen-earnings-q1-2021/). Boeing fell nearly 3% after its [Q1 loss was worse than expected](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-boeing-earnings-q1-2021/).


Despite the limp finish Wednesday, stock market indexes are holding up amid the biggest week of earnings reports for Q1. The Nasdaq, Dow and S&P 500 are basically flat for the week so far and near highs.


After Wednesday's close, more major earnings announcement came out when **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) posted results. [Facebook topped views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-climbs-on-quarterly-results/), and [Apple smashed estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-news-apple-demolishes-march-quarter-estimates-on-big-iphone-sales-growth/) with strong iPhone sales.


Both stocks rose in extended trading, something that bodes well for Thursday's stock market. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) turned up as much as 0.5% after the close.


About 24 hours earlier, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) beat expectations and [shares of Google's parent company surged to new highs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-youtube-advertising-revenue-growth-q12021/) Wednesday.


Small Caps Outperform
---------------------


Small caps outperformed Wednesday, nominally. The Russell 2000 rose 0.1% and leads the major indexes with a roughly 1.4% gain this week.


The energy sector led the stock market. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) added 3.5% as U.S. crude oil prices climbed 1.2% late Wednesday. Breakouts in the sector are adding to its appeal.


**Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)), **Equinor** ([EQNR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQNR)) and **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) broke out of [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), including the [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Equinor and Viper, though, saw light volume. Wednesday's [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) discussed industry mates **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), **Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)) and **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)).


The sector is turning itself around after the Covid-19 pandemic dried up demand. Thus, fundamentals remain largely weak. Investing in oil stocks requires a different calculus. The [EPS Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of Wednesday's breakout stocks, for example, are in the dumpster.


Financials are making waves too. Small-cap **Everi Holdings** ([EVRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVRI)), **Deutsche Bank** ([DB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DB)), **PNC Financial** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)) and **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) made their own breakouts.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) eased less than 0.3%.

The major stock averages posted mild declines in mixed volume Wednesday. The indexes also disguised some buying activity in the medical and software sectors.

  

The Nasdaq composite, the most important index for U.S. stocks, edged less than 0.1% lower as volume trickled higher.

  

A decline in higher turnover would normally spell a distribution day for that index. But in this case, the Nasdaq did not meet the requirement for a minimum loss of 0.2%. Thus, as the Market Pulse table shows, the Nasdaq's distribution count stays at two.

  

The S&P 500 fell less than 0.4%; NYSE volume edged 4% lower.

  

The Nasdaq's outperformance has been more pronounced lately. As the top of the daily chart on Page B3 shows, the Nasdaq composite is up 8.6% since Jan. 1. The S&P 500 is up 2.1%.

  

On Wednesday, enterprise, desktop, database and gaming software stocks bucked the decline.

  

Beaten-down hospital, medical services and research equipment stocks also rallied.

  

Large caps in general are behaving well. See the "NYSE Advance-Decline Daily Line" below the price bars of the S&P 500 chart, also on B3. After the S&P 500's Oct. 2 follow-through, the A-D line rose sharply enough to halt a five-month downtrend.

  

The market's small moves came amid highly anticipated Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen. She noted a "live possibility" that the U.S. central bank will end nearly seven years of ultra-easy monetary policy with a hike in the fed funds rate in December.

  

Given Yellen's comments, will traders perhaps pay close attention to Thursday's report on third-quarter productivity?

  

Econoday currently reports a forecast for a paltry 0.1% seasonally adjusted annual rise in worker productivity. But unit labor costs are seen rising 2.2%. If that were to happen, it would help bolster the Fed's resolve to meet both its growth and inflation objectives.

  

The U.S. government bond markets also seemed to be accepting a greater possibility that rates will go up at the Dec. 15-16 Fed meeting. Watch to see if the 10-year yield, now at 2.23%, will exceed the September near-term high of 2.3%. That could signal a change in trend.

  

Bank stocks appear to be taking all the news in stride. **Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)), showcased in IBD's [New America](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/102215-776971-signature-bank-among-strongest-in-northeast.htm) on Oct. 23, is crafting a handle on a 15-week cup base. It sports a 98 Composite Rating. **Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) (99 Composite) is 7% above a 47.31 cup-with-handle entry.

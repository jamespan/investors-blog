So. Shall we call it the Great Boxing Day Rebound? Or is the bear market still far from over?


After the bears stole Christmas and at least delayed the traditional Santa Claus rally, institutional investors decided now was a good time to put some cash to work. And in terms of one-day rallies, Wednesday was quite a stunner.


The Nasdaq composite — benefiting from strong gains in FANG stocks and non-FANG big-cap growth firms (think **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and the like) — rose 5.8%. That easily marked the Nasdaq's biggest percentage move — up or down — in all of 2018.


The tech-rich Nasdaq 100 catapulted 6.2%. Mind you, that follows a four-session spill in which the index collapsed more than 9%.


The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both rallied nearly 5%. The Russell 2000 leapt 5% also. The 30-stock Dow likely ran up 1,000 points in a single session for the first time ever.

The Philadelphia semiconductor index, better known as the SOX, surged 5.8% ahead. Growth stocks certainly outperformed after getting beaten up badly for weeks. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF rose 6.3%. Oil stocks got a boost as U.S. crude oil futures jumped as much as 10%.


A Bear Market Can Show Big Up Days Too
--------------------------------------


Keep in mind, though, some sort of bounce could have been expected. A glance at the daily chart of the key indexes would have likely made most folks think that a vertical-like sell-off had to let up at some point.


As experienced IBD readers know, one such big up day alone doth not make a long-lasting bull run. There is no rule that says a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) can happen on the first day of a brand-new rally attempt. In almost every case, good follow-throughs, based on decades of research by IBD, occur on Day 4 or later of a new rally attempt. And as November showed, even correct follow-throughs themselves do not guarantee a tradeable rally for even the most nimble stock investors.


Today's [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/bear-market-stocks-big-one-day-gain/) provides additional color on how giant one-day rebounds can trap the bulls.


Nonetheless, Wednesday's action presented numerous cheery elements that might indicate that the U.S. is not yet heading into an economic deep freeze.


Growth Sectors Lead Wednesday's Buying Fury
-------------------------------------------


For starters, retail, software, internet, consumer spending and manufacturing stocks led the market's upside. An investor should prefer any and all of these sectors over mature, defensive sectors in leading the market out of its first bear market-level correction in seven years. Among the top groups today: internet retail rallied nearly 9%, shoes up almost 8% and database software ahead almost 7%.

Second, breadth showed a big bias toward advancers vs. decliners. A lasting market uptrend needs a wide breadth of issues. On the Nasdaq, winners outpaced losers by nearly 4-to-1. On the NYSE, winners led 5-to-1.


Third, a tiny yet growing cadre of leadership-quality growth companies are trying to bottom out or form the right side of new bases. Check out **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)). All four have refused to nose-dive below their key 50-day moving averages. **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), the global online marketplace for artists, jumped 8.8% in heavy volume. The [former Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) is a 2% advance away from reclaiming its 50-day line.


**McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) has made a round trip of good short-term gains following an Oct. 23 breakout past a 172.10 buy point. But on Wednesday, the world's largest burger chain rallied more than 2% and climbed back above that prior buy point. Watch for a new base to form.


Nonetheless, patience will benefit the determined investor. Trying to buy stocks ahead of the breakout is still a no-no, even after the market has endured such a steep plunge. Few would disagree that market volatility will stay high for some time.


Will These Groups Help End The Bear Market?
-------------------------------------------


Fourth, never forget about sector rotation.


No single industry group or sector can lead the major equity indexes higher forever. So, it really pays to keep a close eye on both sectors and industry groups that rise sharply in IBD's stock research tables and daily industry group rankings.


Looking at the top 40 groups — auto parts retail, telecom, ethical drugs and medical products have held up strong. Gold mining has jumped into the top 40 after ranking 135th just four weeks ago.


Despite the big jump in crude oil prices, investors picked up beaten-down shares in trucking, railroads and airlines. The Dow Jones transports rallied 5.4%.


Will Volatility Stay Strong?
----------------------------


The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) sank 17%, a day after it posted the second highest close in 2018. The VIX had jumped 75% in the prior seven sessions.


A positive holiday sales report from **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) indicates that the U.S. consumer may help keep the economy growing for some time. Low joblessness, a historic corporate and individual tax reform enacted in 2018, and relatively still-low interest rates remain positive factors for the U.S. and its major trading partners.

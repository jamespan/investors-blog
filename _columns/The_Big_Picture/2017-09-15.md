U.S. stock indexes kept to a tight trading range Friday, protecting the week's gains.


The market shrugged off a North Korean missile test and calmly awaited the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting.




The Nasdaq advanced 0.3% Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.


The blue chip Dow extended its win streak to six sessions in a row.


Volume jumped on both major exchanges. Friday was a quadruple witching day, which involves the expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, single stock futures and stock options.


The distribution day count fell as the Aug. 10 distribution day expired.


After starting the week with roughly 1% gains Monday, the indexes mostly sat on its gains.


For the week, the small cap S&P 600 rose 2.6%; the Dow, 2.2%; the IBD 50, 2.1%; the S&P 500, 1.6%; and the Nasdaq, 1.4%.


Friday provided several breakouts among quality stocks.


Chip designer **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) popped above a 174.66 buy point in twice its usual turnover. The company has delivered triple-digit earnings growth in each of the past three quarters.



**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) scored a 2.3% upward thrust as it cleared a 108.65 buy point. Volume was robust, 44% above average.


Skyworks' fundamentals are improving. After four quarters of single-digit percentage declines and advances, Skyworks delivered 16% and 27% earnings-per-share growth in the past two quarters. Revenue stepped up 10% and 20%.


Meanwhile, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) posted only its second gain in the past nine sessions. The stock remains in its 5% buy zone from an Aug. 2 breakout.



Apple is about three weeks shy of six years after the death of founder Steve Jobs. In six years post-Jobs, Apple's stock has risen about 200%, topping the Nasdaq's roughly 160% gain.


The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday with the Street expecting a standpat stance on interest rates. CME's FedWatch Tool pegs the odds of an interest rate hike at zero. The chance for rates to remain at the 1% to 1.25% range are put at 98.6%. The chance for a decrease is put at 1.4% — leaving no room for an increase.

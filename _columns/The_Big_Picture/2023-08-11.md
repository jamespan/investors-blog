The stock market mainly fell Friday after hotter-than-expected inflation data spooked investors. They will now turn their attention to the upcoming Fed minutes release and a slew of retail earnings.




The Nasdaq composite suffered most out of the major indexes, closing down 0.7%. It has now fallen [under the key 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and closed lower for the second week in a row. Its weekly loss came to around 2%. While bulls will be encouraged by year-to-date gains of more than 31%, there can be no argument â€” concerns are rising.


The S&P 500 fared a bit better with a 0.1% dip. The benchmark index suffered a moderate weekly drop and came close to a test of the 50-day line. The S&P remains up nearly 17% for the year despite recent pressure.

It is continuing to find support at its 21-day exponential moving average. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) was the top performer, while **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), which posted mixed results during the week, was hammered 3% lower.


Small caps manage to end in the green, with the Russell 2000 inching up 0.1%. The same could not be said for growth stocks, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) knifing 1% lower.


There was a noteworthy jump in treasury yields. The 10-year yield jumped 8 basis point to 4.16%, while the two-year yield also popped 8 basis point to 4.9%. The yield curve remains inverted.


With the stock market uptrend remaining under pressure, IBD is recommending investors to hold exposure at the 60% to 80% level. Keep alert to any sell signals in your portfolio, such as round-trips or breaches of the 50-day moving average.


Fed Minutes, Retail Earnings Loom
---------------------------------


Stocks came under pressure when the producer price index came in 0.3% higher for July, after holding steady in June. Year over year it was up 0.8%. It topped economist views on both metrics. Core prices, which exclude food and energy, were also hotter than expected.


With concerns about a rekindling of inflation lingering, investors will pore over the latest Fed minutes, which are due to be released Wednesday. Wall Street will be looking for clues on how Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow central bankers plan to handle interest rates.


And while earnings season is slowing down, there are a lot of key retail quarterly reports due next week, including **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)). These could give traders a deeper insight into the current strength of the consumer.

Security Software Hurts Stock Market
------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors ended the session mixed with a slight bias to the upside. Health care and energy were the best performing areas, while technology and communication services struggled the most.


As ever, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups gives deeper insight into the day's action.


Oil & gas royalty trusts, cable and satellite equipment stocks, automobile retailers and auto part stocks were among the best performers.


In contrast, office supply retailers, computer hardware plays, semiconductor equipment stocks and home furnishing retailers were among the laggards.

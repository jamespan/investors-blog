The Nasdaq extended its sell-off to a fifth straight session Wednesday, and the S&P 500 closed below the 2000 level for the first time in nearly three months.


In other words, stocks acted exactly the way they should during a market correction.


The tech-filled Nasdaq composite fell 1.1%, extending its losses over the past five sessions to 5.3%. The premier index, up 5.7% in 2015, now lies 7.6% below its all-time peak of 5231.94.

Volume climbed on both major exchanges.


As IBD noted in a front-page article Wednesday, the possibility of many small oil producers going bankrupt as credit dries up is quite high in 2016.


Chip stocks were also on the chopping block.


On Wednesday the gigantic sector suffered massive losses, particularly those that supply vital components to the iPhone and other Apple devices. Singapore's **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), a solid winner last year, gapped down for the second time in three sessions. Wednesday's 3.1% slide closed the bullish price gap produced on Dec. 3.


The bottom line? Breakouts are failing. Stocks hitting new highs are growing scarcer.


When the market is raining with sellers, it's time to exercise patience and restraint.


The last time the market went into a confirmed uptrend was Dec. 16, when the Nasdaq posted a rare Day 3 follow-through. However, the composite then slid nearly 3% in the next two sessions, quickly placing the rally in doubt.


Wednesday morning, the Nasdaq was down as much as 1.6%. North Korea's announcement that it tested a hydrogen bomb rattled the market, already on edge over the tiff between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yet investors may be equally if not more concerned with the gloomy profits picture.


S&P Capital IQ notes that as of Monday, earnings among S&P 500 firms are seen rising just 0.6% in the fourth quarter, even after excluding the energy sector.


That sector's profits are expected to plunge 68%.


Investor fear continues to rise. While the put-call volume ratio rose Wednesday (see the graph below the S&P 500 chart on B2), bullishness among newsletter editors polled by Investors Intelligence sank to a three-month low at 34.7% â€” barely above the 31.6% of those polled who are expecting a bear market to unfold.

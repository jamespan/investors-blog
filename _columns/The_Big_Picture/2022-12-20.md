The stock market bulls managed to end a wounding bear run Tuesday, but there is a long way to go to recover from recent bleeding. While a four-day losing streak came to an end, it was hardly in emphatic fashion.




The S&P 500 ended the trading day with a slender 0.1% gain. The benchmark index remains stuck below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), though it remains within striking distance. At 3821, the S&P 500 still lies down almost 7% from the recent high it made on Dec. 13.


The Nasdaq composite closed the session essentially flat. The tech-heavy index remains down almost 33% so far in 2022. It sits 3.5% below its 50-day line and is nearly 9% below its Dec. 13 peak.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best once again out of the major indexes. It managed to turn in a gain of 0.3%. For a second straight day it tested the 50-day moving average, and the Dow managed to close above it. **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) made the stoutest gains. The index may get a further boost tomorrow after **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) soared as much as 13% after hours on a better-than-expected November-quarter report.


Tuesday was a day for small caps to shine, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.5%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) closed up 0.2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP_122022-230x300.jpg)Volume was down on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. Monday. Advancers and decliners were virtually tied on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq, though gainers held a slight edge.


Investors should note that while indexes did bounce slightly, it was far from a decisive move. Given the market has drifted into oversold territory, a more powerful rally is desirable.


Stocks Boosted After Surprise Japan Bond Move
---------------------------------------------


While the rally was far from convincing, the stock market did show some resilience to shake off a surprise move by the Bank of Japan. The central bank tweaked its yield curve control policy to allow the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to move 50 basis points either side of its 0% target.


"The BOJ's yield pivot sent the dollar tumbling, which gave all risky assets a little boost," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said. "Pessimism for equities remains as earnings and credit risks remain widely in place."


While the move added to the fears over a global inflation problem, U.S. stocks moved higher as traders weighed the fact that the vast majority of central banks have already made moves to tame the issue.


Homebuilders Among Stock Market Losers On Data
----------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors closed mixed. Energy and communication services fared best while real estate and consumer discretionary were the worst areas.


The [performance of industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) within the stock market offered further insight. Gold miners, accident and health insurers and oil and gas field services plays were all top performers. Computer hardware stocks, specialty steel firms and oil and gas drillers also did well.


Auto makers, media periodical stocks, car retailers and air freight stocks were among the worst performers.



Homebuilders also fell amid weaker than expected permits data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Permits tumbled 11% to 1.34 million in November, below economist views for 1.5 million. This was the lowest level since June 2020.


Among stocks in the group, **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) fell 1.2% while **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) dipped 0.7%.

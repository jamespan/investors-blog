  Stock Market Shows 'Positive Volatility.' Will These Companies Fare Better Than The Current Chip Leader?

Roughly five weeks into 2025, [stock market choppiness](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/nasdaq-sp500-djia-google-stock-mattel-broadcom/) certainly has not abated. But volatility worked in favor of investors who are long in stocks on Wednesday.


In a relatively uncommon session in which small and midcap stocks paced the upside, all the major indexes gained ground. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% as the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed 0.7% higher. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 captured a 1.1% gain. And the S&P MidCap 400 ventured 0.9% higher.




Volume moved higher on both the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange vs. Tuesday. For bullish investors, that's music to one's ears. Investors want to see the stock market rise in higher volume, not fall in heavier turnover.


Due to time, the Dec. 27 [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) posted on both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 expired. IBD currently uses 25 trading days as the time benchmark.


Hence, the Market Pulse shows a slightly lower count of episodes of intense professional selling within the rolling 25-session count. A few more distribution days are set to fall off in coming days as well.


Eyeing the closes by large-cap indexes, Wednesday might seem as if the gains were droll. But spying the intraday action, one could definitely paint the stock market as a more exciting session. After all, the S&P 500 had fallen more than 0.5% during the first hour of trading.


Stock Market Weak Initially
---------------------------

As for the Nasdaq, the initial drop was heavier at nearly 0.8%. So, the positive reversal was welcome for growth investors. The Nasdaq 100 ended the day nearly 0.5% higher.


Look at any daily chart of the above-mentioned indexes, and you'll see that they are trading quite close to their all-time highs. This suggests that the selling hasn't really been as intense as the Market Pulse's elevated distribution day count may indicate.


The behavior in stocks may also be more remarkable given the huge train of policy changes and news coming from inside the beltway in Washington, D.C.


Key indexes started the week weak and quickly slid further as President Donald Trump declared that tariffs on select Canadian and Mexican imports of 25% would go into effect at midnight early Tuesday. Then, a mini rebound ensued on reports that both Canada and Mexico agreed to assist the U.S. in protecting their national borders. That resulted in a one-month postponement of tariffs.


Ultimately, readers of Investor's Business Daily can also view their portfolio as the ultimate litmus test of whether it's time to hold positions, increase exposure in them, or pare them back.


Certainly, as the stock market is driving through the heart of earnings season, one rule never goes out of season: [Cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) when a stock barrels more than 7% below the purchase price. Investors can almost always recover losses when they are small. Overcoming a portfolio deficit, however, when, the 7% losses pile up fast, or when paper losses are allowed to expand to 20%, 25% or even 50%, is a ton harder.


Market Internals X-Ray
----------------------


Let's view the stock market internals of the session. Breadth in the stock market? Quite good on Wednesday.


Early data showed winners trouncing losers on the Nasdaq by nearly 1,500 stocks. On the NYSE, gainers topped decliners by a whopping 5-2 ratio.

A New Chip Leader?
------------------


Amid severe sell-offs by some members of the all-important semiconductor sector, it's clear that megacap tech **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) has emerged as a current stock market leader.

On Wednesday, Broadcom sharply outperformed all of the equity benchmarks. It gapped up at the start and rallied 4.3% to 232 on the heels of news from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) that it's going to dramatically boost its infrastructure spending on artificial intelligence. Such news benefits Broadcom, a major player in high-performance semiconductors across a wide swath of industries.


Indeed, after a successful breakout from a double bottom at 185.05 in December, Broadcom also established a follow-on entry with a boost off the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) in recent days.


That said, investors would do well to keep an open mind to other strong stocks in other dynamic sectors. Where to look? Start with IBD's [Stocks On The Move table](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) and [lists of leading growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). Also, cull the best candidates from IBD's New Highs screen.


New Highs Jump
--------------



On Monday, new lows exceeded new highs 215 vs. 78. But on Tuesday, IBD counted a combined 148 new highs hitting the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. On Tuesday, stocks in the software, retail, business service and finance sectors topped the new highs list.


Among the companies making the list: **Kyndryl** ([KD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KD)), a high-growth member of the enterprise software industry group and a midcap growth stock with market value of $10.1 billion; gig economy play **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)), which reports earnings next week; and music entertainment innovator **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)), a [new half position on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/?_gl=1*v7jbqb*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2LjIyMTk3MDkzOC4xNzM4MzQ5NzAyLjE3MzgzNDk3MDE.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczODc2NTQ0NC4xOTQuMS4xNzM4NzY2MDEyLjYwLjAuMA..#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


Sure to join Wednesday's new highs list is **Fiserv** ([FI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FI)). The financial transactions technology expert bolted out of a shallow cup that could also be viewed as a flat base. Either way, Fiserv rolled past a 223.23 proper buy point with a 7% surge in heavy volume thanks to solid quarterly results.


Fiserv joined the [Leaders list of Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Wednesday.


Meanwhile, the [homepage of MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF&_gl=1*911naj*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2LjIyMTk3MDkzOC4xNzM4MzQ5NzAyLjE3MzgzNDk3MDE.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczODc2NTQ0NC4xOTQuMS4xNzM4NzY1NDUzLjUxLjAuMA..) shows a still healthy number of individual growth stocks acting well. That is, they are still trading near a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). While three stocks made the MarketSurge breakout screen, as many 33 other stocks traded near a pivot point.


A Look At Stock Market Volatility
---------------------------------


The only thing that appeared to rise in the stock market Monday following the threat of tariffs on the U.S. economy? Volatility. Don't expect the wildness to subside anytime soon.


Amid that volatility, precious metals plays continue to rally. And select growth stocks in the medical, retail, and defensive sectors of the stock market keep doing well so far in 2025. However, investors may want to tread carefully in order to avoid getting chopped up by skittish action by both big buyers and sellers.


How Trump Figures In
--------------------


Phil Pecsok, founder and award-winning fund manager of Pacific Palisades, Calif.-based Anacapa Advisors, told IBD that the second inauguration of President Donald Trump last month and the current stock market action shows that we've entered an environment of "pro-business, pro-stock market and pro-volatility." Anacapa has $60 million in assets under management.


"We look at fundamentals, technicals and psychology, and the market is a combination of all three," Pecsok said. And he sees Trump's willingness to tackle federal spending as benefitting the stock market's fundamental picture. "I think it's a really big deal to cut waste. It could be $1 trillion in the economy, even $2 trillion. I think it's half a trillion for sure."


Pecsok warns, however, against getting complacent. He's seen a number of hedge funds on Wall Street literally blow up because they took on extra-size risk by selling securities linked to options volatility. They then encountered huge short-term losses once stocks got hit hard and volatility spiked. For that reason, Pecsok noted that his firm's two funds avoid using margin and employ options in a limited fashion to limit leverage.


[The VIX](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) is currently at 15.77, down 4% for the week. That's far below the latest spike to 65.73 seen during the sell-off that took place in the first days of August, and 85.47 during the pandemic swoon in March 2020.

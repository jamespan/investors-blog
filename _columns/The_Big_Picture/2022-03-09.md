title: Nasdaq Soars 3.6% To Lead Indexes, But Is This Rally A Flash In The Pan?

Any time the Nasdaq rises 3% or more in a single day, you have to imagine your spouse, best friend, even your nemesis on the basketball court is going to sit up and take notice.




And if you're in the position to answer seemingly elementary questions like "So, is it time to buy?" or "Should I take this rally as a chance to sell short?" then you could offer either the one-word answer — No — or present a more nuanced response.


When you consider the plain fact that the Nasdaq composite, after falling more than 20% from its 16,212 peak in November, scrapes back roughly one-sixth of that loss with Wednesday's 3.6% rise, you might think that perhaps the momentum of the market is shifting.


That is, either the sellers are worn out, or more buyers are coming out from the bushes.


But as a savvy short-term trader or longer-term investor, what really is your next best move today? It just may be to sit on your haunches and watch.


Watch for evidence that: 1) The current leaders are not giving back much of well-fought ground. 2) New leadership is emerging. 3) Sellers are in fact weakening as a force within the stock market. 4) And authentic breakouts are taking good-quality stocks to new highs and making money for intrepid new buyers.


How The Nasdaq Rose So Much
---------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP030922-206x300.jpg)On a session that saw the price of U.S. crude oil futures plummet more than 12% at one point, the major indexes highlighted a return of buyers across a range of sectors. But for sure, tech led the way.


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) matched the entire composite, rising 3.6% also. Meanwhile, VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) jumped 4.3%. IBD's enterprise software industry group rose 6.5%. All of these indexes outmatched gains of 2.6% by the S&P 500, 2% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and 2.8% by the exchange traded fund iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)).


Volume fell sharply on both main exchanges.


Normally, you'd prefer to see the stock market rise decently in heavier volume vs. the prior session. Why? This simple analysis of price-volume action can give you a sense of the big boys and girls of the market — pension plans, university endowments, sovereign wealth funds, investment departments of large corporations, mutual funds and the like — accumulating shares in earnest.


News Driven
-----------


Now, given how the action on Tuesday was so frenetic amid a constantly changing narrative on the Russia-Ukraine war and highly volatile markets in key commodities and U.S. long-dated government bonds, the careful market observer would have not been surprised to see volume actually decline on Wednesday.


Yet a daily chart reveals that Wednesday marks the fourth session of gains by the Nasdaq in above-average turnover over a narrow three-week time frame. This differs from a period from Feb. 1 to 23 in which the Nasdaq saw no such up day in price in charged-up turnover.


So, is the nascent new rally attempt by the Nasdaq not yet dead? Correct. But could it go sharply higher or lower from here? Of course. Yet right now, the direction likely will hinge on a few major issues:


* How will the market digest Thursday morning's February consumer inflation report?
* What message will the Federal Reserve send to Wall Street after its two-day meeting that ends Wednesday next week?
* Could Ukraine and Russia actually negotiate a cease-fire, and quickly?


New Leadership?
---------------



Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 3.1% to stop a four-session skid. Interestingly, Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) inched up a mere 0.5%.


And its underperformance highlights the truth about the market today: From a CAN SLIM trader point of view, there truly are just mini morsels of breakouts.


Take [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), which launched in July 2011. During the heady times in both 2020 and 2021, the list featured as many as 20 to 23 names, either on the Leaders Near A Buy Point or on the Leaders list. The latter points to those that are in strong uptrends and currently not near a buy point.


The list today? A whole lot smaller. Yet interestingly, the lists show quite an amazing level of industry diversity.


How To Be A Master Watcher Of The Next Breakouts
------------------------------------------------



At this point, [the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Stocks On The Move table](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) may help you spot emerging new leaders that are forming good bases, trading near 52-week highs, and staging strong moves past the last point of technical resistance.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) name **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) took some time to surpass its own [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), and one could rightfully say it stumbled hard after clearing a 113.50 proper entry on Jan. 12. But since then, the energy play has acted bullishly. Shares got support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) en route to a gain nearing 25% from that breakout point.


At this point, watch for a potential follow-on entry, including a [healthy pop off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/). The stock, however, is still well above the 10-week line.

Beyond Nasdaq: Check The Mood
-----------------------------


The latest [Bulls Vs. Bears survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) revealed a second straight week in which bearishness among newsletter editors exceeded bullishness.


Also keep an eye out for other key psychological indicators that could point to a future rally in the market.


In the 2022 Stock Trader's Almanac, Jeffrey Hirsch and Christopher Mistal note that corrections during midterm election years often set up significant advances afterward. They note that in the last 14 midterm election years, bear markets began or were in progress nine times.


"Since 1914 the Dow has gained 46.8% on average from its midterm election year low to its subsequent high in the following preelection year," Hirsch and Mistal wrote in an article within the almanac, titled "Why A 50% Gain In The Dow Is Possible From Its 2022 Low To Its 2023 High." "A swing of such magnitude is equivalent to a move from 20,000 to 30,000 or from 30,000 to 45,000."

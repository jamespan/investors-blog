Banks, Oil Stocks Fall Again But Indexes Roar Off Lows
=======================================================

So, was it the market sell-off that ultimately refreshes? Of course, no one knows. Yet few predicted during Wednesday morning's bloodbath that the Nasdaq composite would U-turn from a 3.7% intraday drop to end the session down just 0.1%.


The S&P 500 didn't have as big a bounce. The broad large-cap index cut an early 3.7% loss to 1.2% by day's end. But the swing still rattled the Street; the CBOE volatility index spiked to as high as 32.09. (See the psychological indicators table on Page B11.)


Oil stocks dragged the S&P 500 lower as crude oil futures melted by another 6.7%; February futures hit a low of $26.17 a barrel.

Money center bank, foreign bank, auto and gaming stocks also led the downside with sharp losses.


The S&P Small Cap 600 sidestepped the damage, rising 0.3%.


Volume climbed sharply on both exchanges and will likely stay heavy as the Q4 earnings season continues unfolding.


The S&P 500's sell-off in recent days easily took out its Aug. 24 flash-crash low of 1867. But it also undercut the Oct. 15, 2014, low of 1820. That day in 2014 was significant: Stocks bounced energetically from their session lows, similar to Wednesday's session. Four trading days later, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq marked a strong follow-through rally, each up 2% and 2.4%, respectively, as volume swelled higher.


The newly confirmed uptrend gave investors good reason to deploy cash in solid growth stocks. The Nasdaq rallied by another 18% before running into choppy seas in the summer of last year.


Back to the Nasdaq's current action, chip-related stocks helped the tech-heavy index stage such a surprising reversal, even as the decades-old bellwether **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) dropped 0.7% to finish at 29.59, boosting its year-to-date losses to 14%.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index, or the SOX, rose 0 .7%.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, fabless semiconductor designers rallied 1.6%; the chip gear group was up 1.4%, the chipmakers rose 1.3%.


As today's Market Pulse shows, **Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)) attracted unusual buying demand. Its 4.5% gain to 24.31 came in volume 46% above average, and the stock avoided a collision with its long-term 200-day line.


Integrated Device, as well as medical plays **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) and **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)), may be worthwhile on a fresh slate of stocks to watch. However, the market reversal is no guarantee that even a short-term bottom is in place. Keep tracking the market's movement on a daily basis.

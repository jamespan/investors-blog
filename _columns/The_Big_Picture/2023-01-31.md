Small Caps Lead Stock Market Rally Ahead Of Fed Statement, High-Profile Tech Earnings
======================================================================================

The stock market bounced back in force Tuesday after a soft start to the week.




Futures were down sharply before the market open Tuesday but pared losses quite a bit after the Labor Department reported some Fed-friendly inflation data. The Labor Department reported its employment cost index increased 1% in the fourth quarter, less than the 1.1% consensus and slower than 1.2% clocked in the third quarter. Wages and salaries were up 1%, down from 1.3% in Q3. Cost of benefits increased 0.8%, down from 1%.


It was good data for the stock market ahead of the conclusion of the [two-day Federal Reserve meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-preview-powell-wont-break-s-wage-growth-eases/) Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%. Another quarter-point is expected in March, which would bring the fed funds rate very close to the Fed's terminal rate of 5% to 5.25%. That's where the Fed thinks it can pause rate hikes to let prior increases work their way through the economy.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Small caps outperformed, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) up 2.4%. The ETF closed at its highest level since late August and scored a monthly gain of 9.8%.


The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.7% in higher volume, marking yet another subsequent [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/). The Nasdaq closed out January with a monthly gain of 10.7%. Winners beat losers on the Nasdaq by just over 3-t0-1.

The index reclaimed its 200-day moving average after jumping above the line Friday and closing below it Monday. Chip-equipment firm **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, up 4.5%. It's near the top of  a 12-week cup base.


The S&P 500 rallied 1.5%, also in higher volume. Advancing stocks swamped decliners by 11-to-2.


**General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) was a top gainer in the index, helped by a strong [Q4 earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/gm-earnings-due-amid-affordability-crisis-gm-stock-downgraded/). GM stock gapped over a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) and its Jan. 12 high of 38.61, giving an early entry.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 1.1%, despite post-earnings drops for **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)). Weakness in these two names was offset by strength in **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)).


The stock market uptrend, confirmed by the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on Jan. 6 with big percentage gains in higher volume, continues to look strong as Wall Street awaits several potential market-moving headlines.


Besides the Fed meeting, [four FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/apple-stock-aapl-climbs-off-lows-earnings-optimism-builds-3-other-faang-stocks-dominate-earnings-calendar/) have earnings this week. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) reports Wednesday after the close. Results from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) are due late Thursday.

And don't forget about Friday's jobs report, which the Fed will be watching closely for signs of slack in the labor market. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to fall to 185,000 from 223,000 in December.


Breakouts Holding Well
----------------------


[Distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) have been virtually nonexistent since Jan. 6. The S&P 500 currently shows three, but only one had the feeling of meaningful institutional selling. That was on Jan. 18, when the index fell 1.6% in  higher volume.


The Big Picture on Friday bumped up its invested percentage to a range of 60% to 80% when the Nasdaq surged above its 200-day line.


There's still headline risk, but stocks are just flat out acting better. The crop of breakouts is expanding, along with stock market breadth. And stocks like **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and **Revance Therapeutics** ([RVNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVNC)), along with plenty of others, are holding gains after breakouts.



Homebuilders rallied after an off day Monday, helped by a strong earnings report from **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)). Like many other homebuilders, though, PHM is extended. It broke out over a 47.71 handle entry the first week of January.


IBD's homebuilding group was of the day's top performers, rising around 5%, while the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) rallied 4.6%. The ETF joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) on Jan. 20 when it reversed higher off its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Allegro Microsystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) was among a group of 10 IBD 50 components that rallied at least 3%. After reclaiming a 34.24 buy point last week with conviction, Allegro surged 11% Tuesday on strong earnings and bullish guidance. Ahead of its earnings report, the chipmaker joined Leaderboard as an earnings option trade. A monthly call option using a 35 strike price expires Feb. 17.

Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), thinly traded **Bel Fuse** ([BELFB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BELFB)) cleared a well-formed cup-with-handle base with a 37.68 buy point. The stock's prior two base breakouts yielded nifty gains.


**Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) rallied nearly 7% in higher volume. The Intel spinoff is back near highs after last week's earnings report. But after three straight weekly gains, and another one taking shape this week, it would be good to see one last shakeout before a breakout. Watch for a handle to form on the weekly chart.

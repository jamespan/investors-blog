The market confirmed a new uptrend Tuesday, as Wall Street cheered a big jump in oil prices as well as a couple of blue-chip earnings reports.


The S&P 500's 1.4% gain amounted to a follow-through day on its rally attempt. The Nasdaq picked up 1.1% and the Dow outperformed, rising 1.8%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose slightly from Monday’s levels.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index rallied 2.1% and the IBD 50 rose 1.3%.


On the NYSE, advancing stocks trounced decliners by 5-to-1. Breadth was less impressive on the Nasdaq with winners beating losers by more than 2-to-1.


**3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) were the top percentage gainers in the Dow, rising 5% each, after reporting strong earnings before the open.


March-delivery West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled at $31.45 a barrel, up $1.11, or 3.7%.

The S&P 500’s 1.4% gain didn’t exactly convey power, but it still must be respected. A follow-through day doesn’t mean the market is about to rip higher, but no bull market has ever started without one.


It’s always good to see the market serve up buy candidates on a silver platter, but the platter was mostly empty Tuesday despite a solid showing for the major averages. If the market continues to strengthen, though, they shouldn’t be hard to find in coming days and weeks.


The accompanying Market Pulse graphic showing leaders up in volume is a veritable who’s who of real estate investment trusts. CoreSiteCOR followed through after Friday’s low-volume breakout over a 60.20 buy point. Shares rose 2.5% in double-average volume.


About 20% of the industry groups tracked by IBD rose 3% or more. On the surface, that sounds good, but a look underneath the hood was disappointing.


Most of the session’s top-10 performing industry groups ranked near the bottom of IBD’s 197 industry group rankings headed into Tuesday’s session. They included oil and gas, coal, steel, mining and trucking stocks.


The market is back in a confirmed uptrend, but there’s no need to be overly aggressive, especially when there’s not much out there to buy.


As IBD says, “let the market tell you what to buy.” Right now, the market’s message is to stay patient and don’t put money to work too quickly. If the follow-through has staying power, new leadership should eventually emerge.


Start by buying a couple of institutional-quality stocks as they break out from solid patterns. If those advance a few percentage points, you can add shares and even more shares once their gains reach 5%. Such "pyramiding" helps control risk.


Growth investors will be watching for earnings from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) Wednesday and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Thursday, although both are still well below their 50-day moving averages as they consolidate gains. The pullbacks for both have been well contained but neither is near a proper buy point.

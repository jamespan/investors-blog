Techs, Small Caps Lead Stock Market Rally; Winnebago, Skyworks Give Buy Signals
================================================================================

The Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 small-cap index led another stock market gain Monday ahead of a busy week of high-profile earnings reports in the technology sector. The main question now is whether or not strong results from FAANG stocks like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) will be enough to fuel a meaningful breakout for the Nasdaq.




Meanwhile, the two-day Federal Reserve meeting starts Tuesday with a policy statement due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed isn't expected to stray much from its dovish stance that currently sees interest rate hikes on hold through 2023.


In March, the Fed raised its GDP growth forecast to 6.5% this year, up from a prior estimate of 4.2% in December. The Fed expects inflation to run slightly above its 2% target, but it also said it expects inflation to be temporary.


Stock Market Action
-------------------


The Nasdaq took out its April 16 high, rising 0.9%. The index is closing in quickly on its mid-February all-time high of 14,175. Volume on the Nasdaq came in slightly higher than Friday.


![MP042621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP042621-231x300.jpg)The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) extended gains, rising another 1% after Friday's 1.9% rally. The ETF closed above its April 6 high Monday, strengthening its chart. The SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) scored an all-time closing high, rising 0.5%.


Growth stocks generally performed well again in the stock market today. After soaring 3.5% Friday, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added another 2.4% Monday. Five IBD 50 stocks rose 5% or more, including **Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)), which joined [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Monday as an earnings option trade. Results are due May 6 after the close.


The Dow Jones lagged, down 0.2%, but **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) was a bright spot after a negative reaction to earnings Friday. After slumping nearly 2% Friday, American Express rebounded more than 4% to 150.34. It closed just below a 150.55 [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) buy point. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) also outperformed in the Dow Jones industrials, up 1.2%. It's holding support at the 50-day moving average as it forms a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


Financial stocks outperformed Monday but not because of rising interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield edged up 1 basis point to 1.57%. After hitting a high of 1.76% in late March, the 10-year yield has pulled back about 20 basis points and is testing its 50-day moving average.



Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), savings and loan **Flagstar Bancorp** ([FBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBC)) surged above its 50-day moving average, rising 6.5%, after reporting a 250% jump in quarterly profit. Revenue soared 50% to $532 million. New York-based **Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)) also outperformed, up nearly 6% to 252.83. It's still in buy range after clearing a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 250.04 entry.


Several leading stocks in the retail sector lagged in the MarketSmith Growth 250 with losses of more than 3%, including **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Citi Trends** ([CTRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRN)), **Buckle** ([BKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKE)) and **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)).


S&P 500 All-Time Closing High
-----------------------------


The S&P 500 could only muster a gain of 0.2%, but it was still good for an all-time closing high. Preliminary data showed slightly higher volume on the NYSE.


Component **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) jumped nearly 7% to 39.05 on the heels of last week's earnings report. Shares flashed a sell signal last week when the copper miner fell 9% below a 37.71 entry, but it quickly found support at the 50-day moving average.


Chipmaker **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) surged past an entry of 195.92 and is still in buy range. But the company reports earnings Thursday after the close.

The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF ([XME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XME)) rose 2.5% to 41.99. It's near the top of a flat base with a 42.08 buy point. Steel producer **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) is the fund's top holding and is breakout candidate as it trades tightly near highs. Speaking of tight trading, No. 5 holding **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) surged out of a [four-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), rising 5%.


**Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) surged past its April 7 high of 82, rising 7%. Technically, it's still inside a six-week consolidation, but the stock broke out over a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) Monday, giving an early entry. The RV maker was featured in Monday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/wgo-stock-flashes-early-buy-signal-winnebago-rvs-stay-hot/).


Stock Market Health
-------------------


When it comes to overall market health, the Nasdaq isn't showing meaningful signs of accumulation at this point, but it's not under distribution either. The S&P 500 shows three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) since April 14, but all three declines were less than 1%. The Nasdaq shows two distribution days since April 12.


Two yellow flags are excessively bullish sentiment, along with an advance/decline line for the Nasdaq that's been on a downtrend since mid-February.


On Monday, advancing stocks outnumbering decliners on the NYSE and Nasdaq by just over 2-to-1.


Bullish sentiment remains at extreme levels, according the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers. Last week, the bulls clocked in a 63.7% from 63.4% the prior week. Excessively bullish readings like this don't mean the stock market is on the cusp of rolling over, but extreme bullish sentiment has been seen at or near market tops in the past. Bullish sentiment rose for five straight weeks starting in August and hit a high of 61.5% on Sept. 1 just ahead of pullback for the market.


Despite some yellow flags, the stock market remains in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/). New buys spread out between reopen stocks, cyclical stocks and some top-performing growth stocks is perfectly fine strategy. As always, make sure positions are small to start. The market will tell you soon enough if you're timing was right.

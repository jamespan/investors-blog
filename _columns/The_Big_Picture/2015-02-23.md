Stocks ended mixed Monday in a show of resilience after recent gains.

  

The Nasdaq bounced back from a 0.3% loss to close up 0.1%. Gains in big caps **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) helped the tech-heavy index to a ninth straight gain â€” its longest win streak since September 2010.

  

It's a rare feat for the Nasdaq to move up eight or more days in a row. Monday marked the ninth time since the March 2009 market follow-through that the composite has been up eight days in a row or more. Half the time, the streaks ended with the market pulling back or turning choppy. The other half of the time, there have been declines of 5% to 19%.

  

The S&P 500 ended down a fraction and the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1%. Both scored all-time highs Friday. But the small-cap Russell 2000 ticked up a fraction. The IBD 50 climbed 0.6%, largely due to **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), which soared 15% on news of it buying **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)). (See [story](http://news.investors.com/technology/022315-740414-bmy-vrx-announce-deals-in-hot-pharmaceuticals-market.htm).)

  

Volume dropped off from Friday's pace on both major exchanges. Winners and losers were virtually even on the NYSE. Decliners edged winners by about 5-to-4 on the Nasdaq.

  

Monday's action showed sellers were not in a hurry to take profits after the market rallied for three straight weeks. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 stayed above a large trading range cleared a couple of weeks ago. But it would be good to see the market pull back to digest gains to keep things from overheating.

  

As stated in Monday's column, the market has showed improvements on many fronts, from a healthy number of new highs to growth-oriented groups leading, to a lighter load of distribution days. Another positive is the growing list of breakouts, which gives investors opportunities. More leading stocks cleared bases Monday.

  

**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) cleared a 104.02 buy point from a flat base in more than double its average volume. It broke out ahead of Tuesday's Q4 results.

  

**Medivation** ([MDVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDVN)) passed a 112.92 entry from a cup-with-handle base. But trade was subpar. The maker of prostate cancer drugs will unveil quarterly results Wednesday after the close.

  

But **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) plunged 17% after JPMorgan cut the stock to underweight from neutral. A 62% gain past a 43.59 buy point was trimmed to 34%.

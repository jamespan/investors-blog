  Nasdaq Falls A Third Straight Day; These Signals Would Indicate Stock Market Rally Is Done

Investors took more profits in stocks, particularly targeting growth companies and the Nasdaq. Yet, the overall session seemed quite normal for a market that gained more than 10% from March through May.




After falling shy of testing the 14,000 level on Friday, the Nasdaq composite continued its biggest pullback in more than two months. A 1.2% drop on Wednesday marked a third straight decline. That hadn't happened since a four-day drop from May 1-4.


Meanwhile, other indexes took softer hits.


As the S&P 500 gave back 0.5%, small caps held up even better. The Russell 2000 edged 0.2% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.3%. NYSE volume fell.


The reason behind this relative outperformance had to do with a rebound in energy stocks and other cyclical and commodity groups. Four industry groups rose 2% or more: coal, oil field services, Canadian oil and gas exploration, and wood products.


Among these four groups, only Building-Wood Products harbors a gain so far this year, up a healthy 16.9% year to date on a price-weighted basis.


Nasdaq Analysis Today
---------------------



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062123_2-240x300.jpg)So, what's notable about this latest Nasdaq slide? A 2.9% drop from the 13,864 recent peak to Wednesday's low gets closer in magnitude to a 3.6% pullback that occurred over six sessions ending on April 25. During that prior decline, notice how the index came very close to touching its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), 11,786 at the time. The index bounced from then on.


But this most recent sell-off still leaves the Nasdaq at a fairly high altitude in respect to this key technical level. At 13,502, it still stands 7% above its 50-day line.


As the Big Picture and [panelists on IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/) have noted in the past, recent market history has shown that amid a confirmed uptrend, the Nasdaq tends to cool off after rising at least 5% to 7% above the 50-day moving average.


Case in point: Go to a historical chart of the Nasdaq composite and its all-time peak on Nov.  22, 2021. At the high of 16,212, the index momentarily boasted a 6.7% rise above its 50-day line at the time.


Of course, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the decline that day featured the characteristics of a rally quickly moving in the opposite direction. The Nasdaq swung from a solid 1% gain to a 1.2% loss. Volume jumped big time vs. the prior session. And the Nasdaq closed practically at the session low.


More distribution days followed in the next few weeks. The mighty bull market off the pandemic lows of 2020 ended.


Similar action occurred on Friday ahead of the Juneteenth holiday weekend. However, much of the volume increase that session had to do with the "quadruple witching" expiration of monthly and weekly options and futures. And on Wednesday, volume on the Nasdaq fell slightly vs. Tuesday.


Nonetheless, volume on the Nasdaq jumped above average for the third straight day.


Growth Sectors Hit Harder
-------------------------



Meanwhile, selling was concentrated in the growth areas of small-cap land. A 0.9% decline in the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) exchange traded fund sharply outweighed a 0.2% pullback in iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)).


Wednesday's decline likely got the biggest spark from hawkish comments made by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell during regularly scheduled testimony before Congress on the economy and financial conditions.


Some observers highlighted the fact that the bond market believes there is just one quarter-point hike left in the central bank's agenda before it stands pat and watches future progress on the inflation battle. Chances of a 25-basis-point rise in July? High at 74%. However, CME FedWatch also finds only a 10% probability that at its Sept. 20 meeting the Fed will make another quarter-point hike and hoist the rate on overnight cash infusions to large banks to a range of 5.5%-5.75%.


That would mark the highest cost of money to financial institutions since Jan. 3, 2001, when the fed funds rate got trimmed by 50 basis points to 6%.


The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond, however, has not moved much in recent weeks. On Wednesday, the yield edged less than 1 basis point lower to 3.72%.


3 Warnings That The Nasdaq Rally Is Over
----------------------------------------


Earnings season won't pick up again until the third week of July. That's nearly a month away. Summer doldrums could set into Wall Street. So, what should investors be looking for that would indicate the tide is becoming bearish?


First, keep an eye on instances of [heavy institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


The [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) in the Market Pulse remains low for now. And among the distribution days that are currently monitored by IBD, none of them — on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 — exceed 1%.


That's a big change from 2022; from the day after Thanksgiving to the end of December that year alone, IBD counted at least seven distribution days in which the Nasdaq got pounded 1% lower or more.


Second, keep an eye out for sharp sell-offs in the leading sectors.


According to [IBD's stock tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), headed into Wednesday's session, [the top six sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jun-20-2023/) included Computer (up 28% since Jan. 1), Chips (up 40%), Apparel (up 9.56%), Building (up 25.5%), Machine (up 14.1%) and Software (up 23.1%). Stocks in these sectors have spearheaded much of the market's advance. Within the stock tables, you can click on any of these sector names and investigate the leading stocks within each sector.


Third, [look for key defensive sell signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/) among the stocks in your own portfolio.

Sell Signals To Observe
-----------------------


Few companies have reached the state of going into climax runs. But companies such as small-cap internet web browser company **Opera** ([OPRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPRA)) look ripe for at least a significant pullback after screaming above an upper price channel. In Opera's case, you can start an upper channel line from the highest price seen in the week ended March 3 on a weekly chart.


Bear markets also begin when top growth stocks fall en masse in a fury of volume. Did that happen [in the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) on Wednesday?



A quick look finds 10 of the 50 stocks showed volume climbed at least 20% vs. their respective 50-day average. Six of those 10 companies rose for the day, including **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)), **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)) and cosmetics leader **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)).


The biggest loser within the bunch? **Symbotic** ([SYM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYM)) fell almost 10% as volume jumped 54% above its average. Its gain of more than 61% over just two weeks and the shares vaulting more than 100% above the 200-day moving average are certainly signs of a climax run.


However, you normally see a climax top only after a stock has risen for at least 18 weeks after the breakout. SYM cleared its buy point at 18.34 in mid-March. Arguably, the expert in robotic systems for warehouse management is in Week 14 of its current advance.

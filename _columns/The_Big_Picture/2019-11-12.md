Nasdaq Stalls After 800-Point Rally Since October; 4 Reasons Why The New Uptrend Flashes Real Strength
=======================================================================================================

The Nasdaq composite momentarily eclipsed the 8500 level Tuesday. Growth stocks continued to show leadership poise. And defensive issues slumped further in the back seat of today's confirmed uptrend. Yet President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the Economic Club in New York failed to offer new details on an initial U.S.-China trade deal. That offered reason enough for some institutions to take some profits.




Take some profits now? Hard to object, considering when the tech-rich index was coming off an 814-point advance since the Oct. 3 low of 7700 — when IBD's outlook for stocks was still "uptrend under pressure."


"What was missing were details about progress on phase one of the trade deal with China or the status of auto tariffs which may be placed on imports from the European Union. He mentioned that the 'China deal could happen soon,' but he's said exactly the same thing in the past, so that wasn't anything new," Chris Zaccarelli, CIO for Independent Advisor Alliance, wrote in a note to clients.


"As a result, the stock market didn't seem to react very much while he was speaking since no new news was broken. Bond yields declined slightly, but not in a meaningful way," Zaccarelli added.


Bond Traders Yawn
-----------------


Indeed, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged just 2 basis points lower to 1.92% from Friday's level. The bond markets were closed Monday for Veterans Day. A positive yield curve persists, and that's good for lenders and the [greater economy](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


[Notice on a daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP_3x4_111219-226x300.jpg)](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) how both the Nasdaq (up nearly 0.3%) and the S&P 500 (up less than 0.2%) both hit new all-time highs, but ducked lower amid Trump's speech that began around 12 p.m. ET.


Both indexes finished in the lower half of the day's range. Volume rose on both exchanges, according to early data.


Such price-and-volume action pretty much defines [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), a rare form of distribution. Yet major bull markets do not end on a string of stalling days. They usually get stopped by [truly heavy institutional selling](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


The distribution count remains manageable, nonetheless. In fact, the Nasdaq zapped the Oct. 18 and Oct. 22 sell-off days from the count due to the strength of its current advance. At Tuesday's peak, the Nasdaq rallied 5% from the closing prices of those two distribution days. IBD research has found that's considered enough to make distribution days no longer relevant.


Beyond Nasdaq: 4 Reasons The Stock Market Shows Strength
--------------------------------------------------------


With the current uptrend still in place, growth stocks are showing a more bullish sheen lately.



Sure, former big winners such as **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) are still building new bases. The weak chart action lately in fellow software sector companies **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) is still glaring. Yet, growth stock lists are growing in size. More high-growth companies in the medical, consumer and retail sectors are showing clear signs of institutional accumulation.


[Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), as of Tuesday afternoon, showed six names, the highest in months.


[IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/), [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) and [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/) are highlighting a greater number of stocks that are making forward progress after breaking out.


A second reason the market remains bullish? Defensive sectors of the market have retreated sharply in the current quarter.


The Dow Jones utility average rose 0.3% on Tuesday. But at 832, it's slumped more than 5% since Oct. 1.


In contrast, the Nasdaq has romped more than 6% higher; Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is up 5.1%, the S&P Small Cap 600 up almost 4%.


Third, market internals keep improving.


The 50-day moving average of the S&P 500 has now sloped higher for more than four straight weeks. A B Accumulation/Distribution Rating for that index, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average marks a meaningful improvement since Aug. 13, the most recent [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). At that time, the indexes showed ratings of C- to C+.


Four, inflation indicators remain tame. This is generally positive for equities long term.


Crude oil, down 0.1% to $56.78 a barrel, boasts an enviable gain of 25% for the year. But the Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of commodities is up less than 7%. (See a chart and other futures data on page B18 of IBD Weekly.)


Beyond The Nasdaq: Buy Right
----------------------------



**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), which was discussed during [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) on Wednesday, gave holders a bucking bronco of a session. It did end with a solid gain of 3% in higher volume.


The past several days showed a true test of institutional buying support near the 50-day moving average following a great breakout at 47.12 in a flat base.


The key not to get whipsawed? When you buy on a [follow-on entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), try to buy as close as possible to the value of the 50-day moving average or the 10-week line. So in Horton's case, that's 51.83 and 52.41, respectively.

Poor Retail Sales Spark Broad Market Sell-Off
==============================================

The major indexes couldn't catch a break again Wednesday, although the market shaved its losses in the afternoon.


The Nasdaq was staring at a 1.4% loss, sparked by a poor December U.S. retail sales report. But a rebound in the final two hours of the trading day cut that decline to 0.5%.


The S&P 500 fell 0.6% after being off as much as 1.7%.


Volume edged lower on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE. That spelled a third straight distribution day for the S&P 500.


Roll the clock back to Dec. 31, and you need two hands to count the six distribution days that have littered the S&P 500's chart. (Only the last three count because they occurred after last week's follow-through.)


Perhaps there were two thin silver linings in Wednesday's market clouds. One, the indexes bounced well off their lows, a sign of support. The action ran directly counter with Tuesday's awful reversal that gutted early big gains.


Two, the leaders didn't show a lot of damage.


The IBD 50 as a whole hurt more on Wednesday, down 0.9%. Yet just 10 of the names in Wednesday's list saw big trade.


A few are testing vital support levels. **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)), down 4%, is testing the lows of a new base. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V))gapped down 2% and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since its Oct. 30 breakaway gap.


The market is clearly caught in a technical range. The S&P 500 has now thrust below the 2000 level for the third time since mid-December. In the prior two occasions, the index rebounded back above that level and the 50-day moving average.


The Nasdaq, meanwhile, seems to be trapped between 4600 and 4800. What does this mean?


Choppy action between price levels makes it much more difficult to make money â€” both for the longs and shorts. Even when the IBD outlook shows "uptrend under pressure," it's often better to sit atop a pile of cash and wait for a stronger trend to emerge.


Numerous pundits have exclaimed that market participants are overly optimistic about future returns. Yet bullishness among newsletter writers polled by Investors Intelligence fell to 48%, a two-month low.


The put-call volume ratio spiked back above 1.0. (See the graph on Page B3.)


Money center banks led the downside. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) tripped 3% lower in triple average trade. Its revenue from community and consumer banking fell sharply.

Small Caps Rally Again, Beat Big Caps; Are Traders Losing Their Bear Stripes?

While no sane analyst on Wall Street is likely forecasting a moon shot for equities for the rest of this year, the institutional crowd appears to be losing its penchant to sell.


Stocks of virtually all stripes rallied on Wednesday in flat trading. Yet growth fund managers clearly got to work, as a healthy dose of breakouts continued to reward investors who have listened to the market's Feb. 17 follow-through signal.


![MP060816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP060816.jpg)The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 trotted forward in lock step, up 0.3%. Even as crude oil futures surpassed the $51 threshold, the Dow utilities gained 0.8% and the Dow transports 0.6%.


For the Nasdaq, 4974 marked a closing high in 2016 and a reduction in its distribution-day count (see the Market Pulse table) to three, its lowest level since March 10.


The S&P 500, like the Nasdaq, also lost the May 3 distribution day due to time. Distribution days -- flashes of significant professional selling -- become irrelevant once 25 trading days have passed.


While five distribution days may still seem like a heavy load for the S&P 500, three of them were rather trifling in size. On June 3, the S&P slipped just 0.3%. The distribution days May 9 and Tuesday were actually stalling, in which the large-cap benchmark edged higher. IBD founder and Chairman Bill O'Neil has commented that while stalling days are important to track, it's typically big declines in heavier trade that kill a bull market.


Of course, as this column noted on Tuesday, the major indexes have now rebounded to altitudes in which the turbulence gets heavy. Yet the prudent investor does not color his or her feelings with what's happened in the past. It's far more productive to take what the market gives one day at a time, then act accordingly.


So if the stocks in your portfolio are making better gains than they had earlier in the year, it means you're buying right and could consider buying additional stocks. You're likely seeing more candidates. More than 100 stocks made 52-week or all-time highs on both the Nasdaq and NYSE on Monday and Tuesday, led by real estate, medical, banking and electronics plays. Market breadth continues to widen; on the NYSE, winners beat losers by more than a 2-to-1 ratio and almost 2 to 1 on the Nasdaq.


The continued rally by commodity stocks, from oil to coal to metals, has a lot to do with that. But so do small caps. The S&P SmallCap 600 roared 0.9%, just ahead of the Russell 2000's 0.8% climb. The former is now up 8.1% year-to-date. Put another way, small caps are on pace to finish 2016 with a double-digit gain.


**Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) perhaps exemplified best what a little bit of institutional demand can do for a high-quality small-cap play. In reaction to a strong fiscal first-quarter report (EPS up 57%, sales up 18%) issued late on Tuesday, investors sent the stock surging 10% to 46.15, well past a 42.22 cup-with-handle buy point. Watch to see if the stock pulls back lightly and comes within buy range.


The restaurant chain has done a terrific job of creating an extra avenue of growth via its high-margin games at each of its venues. Q1 after-tax margin leapt to 11.9%, a quarterly record. Dave & Buster's went public at 16 in October 2014. Its market cap has grown to $1.9 billion, still a fraction of peers **Panera Bread** ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) ($5.2 billion), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) ($12.5 billion) or **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) ($107 billion).


**Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) have also shown outstanding strength lately. Just look at their RS lines on an IBD daily chart; they've been vaulting higher lately, meaning they're sharply outperforming the S&P 500.


Some in the media have lamented the sharp slowdown in new IPOs. Others wonder how many of those unicorns running on Silicon Valley fuel will actually become profitable investments for public investors. In reality, too many low-quality new issues can be a bad thing for the market, since every new stock simply adds to the overall supply of merchandise available on the market.


Instead, it's smart to broaden your scope to highly rated names that have gone public within the past three years. That's the focus of IBD's [IPO Leaders column](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/). Even those that have gone public within the past 15 years are worth examination, especially if they hold a Composite Rating of 90 or higher and the N ("New") factor in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) is being met.

Investors arose from the three-day Memorial Day Weekend with an urge to buy stocks after a market pullback reached three straight weeks for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, and five weeks for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.




But amid what appeared to be zero progress reported on the tariff spat between the U.S. and China, the Tuesday "rally" showed the permanence of steam lifting from BBQ pork buns at a Chinese dim sum eatery.


The S&P 500 led the decline. A 0.5% gain in the first 20 minutes of the session withered into a 0.8% loss by day's end. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 0.9% as half of the blue chip index's 30 components dropped 1 point or more. They ranged from health care (**UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ))) to cyclicals (**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD))) to banking (**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS))).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP052819-220x300.jpg)Transports got whacked. The Dow Jones transportation average fell 1.3%. Trucking giant **J.B. Hunt** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) slid near 4% to 85.76, hitting levels not seen since the summer of 2017, in heavy volume.


The Nasdaq composite outperformed, falling just 0.4%, despite another bad day for chip stocks.


Volume rose on both main exchanges, reaffirming an anxiousness among institutional investors to sell shares hard and lock in profits in the near term.


Tuesday completed the 10th day of trade since IBD downgraded the outlook for stocks to "market in correction" on May 13.


Institutional Investors Go On Defensive
---------------------------------------


Was there a flight to safe havens? Yes and no.


Yes, in that prices on the long-dated end of U.S. government bonds rallied furiously, sending yields plunging.


The yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year note fell six basis points to 2.26%. That's down from 2.52% at the start of May, or roughly a quarter point in long-term interest rates.


Regarding the "no" answer, the Dow Jones utility average got smacked particularly hard.


The Dow utilities fell nearly 1.6%. That cut its year-to-date gain to 11%.



Analyzing The S&P 500 Chart
---------------------------


The S&P 500 is in a sort of purgatory state, chartwise.


Notice how the large-cap benchmark-tracking SPDR S&P 500 ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) ETF trades between its 50-day moving average (which is still rising) and its longer-term 200-day moving average (flattening out).


A healthy S&P 500, in a confirmed uptrend, rises above both moving averages and leads them higher. For several months this year, that in fact was the case after the S&P mustered a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) on Jan. 4, kick-starting a sharp rebound and a tradable rally.


Today, the S&P 500 looks poised to test the 2800 level for a third time in three weeks. It's also just two points away from taking out its May 13 near-term low of 2801.43.


Will Chips Kill The Bull Run?
-----------------------------


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) and VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) ETF exemplified the angst on Wall Street as the U.S. and China continue to wage economic war in the form of stinging import tariffs. President Donald Trump's executive order to ban U.S. tech companies from doing business with Chinese telecom gear titan Huawei Technologies certainly is weighing on this key sector in tech stocks.


"We still believe that a trade deal will be reached, although it may take many months," Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. "We must not lose sight that the Chinese government has a very definite sense of its own national destiny with a goal of surpassing the U.S. economically, technologically and eventually militarily."


Some observers note that within the tech sector, U.S. chipmakers stand the most to lose from a prolonged trade war with the Middle Kingdom.


Still, it's remarkable to note that the Nasdaq still did better than most market indexes on Tuesday. Give credit to leaders in the enterprise software, e-commerce and internet content areas of the market. Through Friday, IBD's [stock market tables showed Software atop the heap](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-may-24-2019/) at No. 1 among 33 general sectors for mid- and long-term price performance, followed by Telecom (No. 2) and Business Services (No. 7), which also has a sprinkling of tech-related firms.


Internet has fallen to No. 16, Electronics down to No. 17. The Chips sector ranks No. 25. Through Friday, the chip sector was up 9.6% since Jan. 1.


These ETFs Beat The Dow Jones
-----------------------------



Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed the key averages, ending nearly flat, but it lost virtually all of the solid gains. At 32.75, the exchange traded fund holds an 18.6% year-to-date gain. Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) rallied almost 0.9% to 20.82, extending its advance since Jan. 1 to 19.7%.

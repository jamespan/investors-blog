Stocks Fall As Dow Breaks Win Streak; Retail Sinks With Target
===============================================================

Stocks fell Tuesday, a moderate drop that left the indexes in a tight holding area near their highs.


The Dow Jones industrial average ended an unusually long 12-day win streak with a 0.1% decline. The Nasdaq lost 0.6% and the S&P 500 0.3%. For the first time since Dec. 28, the Nasdaq closed clearly below its 10-day moving average. That suggests short-term support is in doubt.


Small caps suffered the most. The Russell 2000 slid 1.5% and has given up all gains since it moved above a trend line on Feb. 10.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *The long bull market has relied on ultra-easy Fed policy. But for how much longer? The [odds of a mid-March rate hike doubled](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-hike-odds-double-as-policymakers-preempt-trump/) Tuesday as policymakers called a near-term move "compelling".*

Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, which added a distribution day for the Nasdaq and S&P. Still, with four distribution days and three on the S&P 500, the indexes are not taxed with institutional selling.


![mp022817](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP022817-165x300.png)After bursting to new highs the past two weeks, the major indexes have moderated their advance. There's no clear resistance level for the main indexes, but 1400 is shaping up as a possible ceiling for the Russell 2000.


The Nasdaq and S&P climbed about 3.7% for the month. That's a solid performance for February, which historically is a weak month, and the fourth month in a row the indexes have risen.


The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of both indexes is A and A-, which is unusually bullish. Breadth is favorable too, with the advance/decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE trending higher. The number of stocks above their 200-day moving average is at the highest since around August.


Is the market too frothy?


Sentiment gauges do indicate complacency. More than 60% of newsletters tracked by Investors Intelligence are making bullish calls. That's a level the research firm says requires investors to pare exposure. On Feb. 1, the [VIX volatility index](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) hit the lowest level in 10 years.


But sentiment indicators aren't great at timing tops, and indexes have kept climbing since those gauges hit alarming levels. More important is the amount of distribution, and on that level there's no danger.


Leading stocks are acting well enough, but their body language is vague. Among leaders with IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher breaking out the past few weeks, few are winners and most are still in the 5% buy zone. Investors might be better off buying index ETFs, unless they are exceptionally good stock pickers.


The chart of the IBD 50 illustrates the trouble with leaders: The index is near highs but its relative strength line is lagging.


Among the big winners are **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), **The Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)).


Tuesday's trading was marked with sell-offs related to earnings or other news.


**Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) plunged 12% in huge volume, touching the lowest level since August 2014. The company missed Q4 estimates, gave a weak outlook and warned its inventory is too high. Retail was day's worst sector.


In the consumer electronics retail industry, **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) slid 8% in big volume, and **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) lost more than 4%. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) said it was creating a **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX))-like subscription streaming service to access XBox games online.


But homebuilding stocks have been breaking out — an area to watch for emerging leadership.


Early Tuesday, the revised GDP for the fourth quarter was unchanged from the initial estimate. Growth remained at 1.9%, below views for an increase to 2.1%. But the market had a muted response.

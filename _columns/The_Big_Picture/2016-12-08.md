Small Caps Lead Again; Is Second Wind Ahead For Stocks?
========================================================

U.S. stock indexes struck a confident stance Thursday, raising the new-high stick another notch.


The Nasdaq pegged a 0.4% gain, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 thrust 1.6%. The indexes closed fairly high in the day's range, a bullish factor.


Volume fell slightly on the NYSE but rose on the Nasdaq. The IBD 50 advanced 0.9%.


The Nov. 2 distribution day fell off the Nasdaq because of time. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions.

The Nasdaq appeared to be shaping a stalling day Thursday, but buyers stepped in to wipe those worries away late in the day.


Small caps have been especially impressive in this uptrend, and at this juncture they may be a better gauge for the market than the Nasdaq.


The rally that began after Election Day is starting to look like it might be ready to catch a second wind. The first leg of the Trump rally ran for 15 sessions in the Market Pulse, then gave way to four days of pressure.


The uptrend resumed in Wednesday's Pulse.


The rally's first leg was impressive right from the start. In the week ended Nov. 11, the early breakouts proved their worth. Fifteen stocks in the IBD 50 broke out that week and 14 eventually scored double-digit percentage gains.


Breakouts by sector looked like this: seven banks, one savings and loan and two financials; and one each from the chip, business services, building, insurance and medical sectors.


Recent breakouts have been somewhat more diverse, in what is shaping up as a second wave of leaders.


Two banks reached buy areas this week. **Customers Bancorp** ([CUBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBI)) cleared a base Monday, and **Capital Bank Financial** ([CBF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBF)) popped above a three-weeks-tight pattern Wednesday.


Retailer **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) broke out Wednesday. **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), a housing-related retailer, is trying to find volume as it fights to clear a cup-with-handle pattern.


Luxury homebuilder **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) broke out Wednesday from a cup base. The homebuilding industry group has been a laggard. However, the industry group rose in 17 of the past 21 sessions and reclaimed its 50- and 200-day lines.


Telecom stock **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)) broke out Thursday, thrusting above a 42.60 handle.


**Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) has been a wild actor since it first cleared a 16.46 buy point in late November. But the stock has show signs of more disciplined action. The stock remains in the 5% buy zone.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims were 1% higher than expected. On Friday, the University of Michigan will release its consumer sentiment gauge for December. The Street expects 94.1, up from the previous month's 93.8.

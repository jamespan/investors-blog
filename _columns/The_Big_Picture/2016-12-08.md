Stocks Rise Broadly, Uptrend Resumes; IBM, More Blue Chips Stage Breakouts
===========================================================================

Stocks roared higher Wednesday and a few major indexes pranced to all-time highs. Even more surprising: The market acted bullishly even as sellers held the upper hand in two large sectors of the economy.


If you looked only at biotech, ethical drug and oil exploration companies in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), you might have concluded that equities had a bad day. After all, President-elect Donald Trump caused a stir by vowing to keep drug prices down. Meanwhile, West Texas intermediate crude oil futures fell more than 2% and backtracked below the $50-a-barrel level on reports that inventories spiked last week at Cushing, Okla., a critical supply hub.


Instead, a fistful of key indexes rose 1.3%, including the S&P 500, NYSE composite and the Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial firms on the all-electronic exchange. All three of these indexes beat the Nasdaq composite's 1.1% lift. The Dow transports were up 2.5%, also a record high.


![mp120716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP120716-155x300.png)The Dow Jones industrials enjoyed being king for a day among the major indexes, rallying 1.5% thanks to gains of 1 point or more in 19 of the blue chip average's 30 components.


The fact that numerous medical and oil-related issues sat out the rally makes Wednesday's session all the more interesting.


Market breadth was still bullish, with winning stocks crushing losers by a nearly 3-to-1 margin on the NYSE and 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq. The raw new-high list cracked 1,000 on a combined basis for the Nasdaq and the NYSE, exceeding IBD's [screened total](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-dec-06-2016/) of 407 screened new highs on the NYSE and 390 on the Nasdaq.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Apple and big internet stocks rallied on Wednesday, but most have been market laggards since the presidential election. Are [Apple and FANG stocks ready to join the Trump rally](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/are-apple-fang-stocks-ready-to-join-the-trump-rally/)?*

Both the S&P 500 and the Dow 30 posted all-time highs, increasing their year-to-date rallies to 9.7% and 12.2%, respectively. The Nasdaq is up 7.7% since Jan. 1. With the Russell 2000 also scraping into new high ground, the action justified a switch in IBD's current outlook to "uptrend resumes."


The outlook was downgraded to "under pressure" just four sessions earlier as the Nasdaq got saddled with as many as nine distribution days over the past 25 trading sessions, an unusually heavy load. Through Wednesday, however, that total has shrunk to seven, including a dubious distribution on Nov. 28 following the Thanksgiving holiday.


Even among the remaining seven distribution days, only two of those sell-offs exceeded 1% for the Nasdaq (-1% on Nov. 30, -1.4% in Dec. 1).


To see the Dow upend other important indexes on Wednesday is sort of like coming home to see your kids straighten their bed and clean up their room, all by themselves. That is, it doesn't happen often.


However, for market bulls, the strength of the big- and megacap plays in the stock market is just another piece of evidence that the big boys and big girls of the market — namely mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, endowments and corporate investment departments — are continuing to deploy cash into the stock market.


Individual investor, do not resist the trend.


You might see a number of stocks with mediocre ratings trading near 52-week highs and poised to break out. Just look at one of the bluest blue chip tech firms, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)). The company, which has a $156 billion market cap, has lousy ratings; the EPS Rating is a 37 out of a maximum 99; the RS is just slightly better at 58; the Accumulation/Distribution grade is likely to improve, but at the start of the day it was a middling C.


 But don't forget this: IBD's research of big winners over more than 21 bull market cycles has found that roughly a quarter of them were turnaround situations. In other words, not all potential big winners will shine with ratings of 99 EPS, 99 RS and a sterling SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) grade of A at the breakout.
The stock is in buy range from a breakout past a 164.76 entry.


Fellow blue chip **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) (70 RS, B- Accumulation/Distribution) continues to rise after its breakout past a 34.52 long cup-with-handle buy point. The 5% chase zone extends up to 36.25.


Optimism among market pundits continues to rise. The Investors Intelligence survey showed that 58.8% of newsletter editors are bullish, the highest since March 2015. The bears have dwindled to 19.6%.


While the market research firm notes that a 60% bulls figure would be "a major call to take defensive measures," history has shown that the market can run higher for months even though bullishness is unusually high. Certainly, IBD has found that the bulls-bears ratio has proved to be more effective in hinting at major market bottoms than market tops.


Meanwhile, the 0.78 put-call volume ratio posted on Wednesday (adjusted from a preliminary reading) pointed to a still-healthy level of pessimism, which is good for the uptrend. The growth in margin debt has also been relatively mild.

Nasdaq Surges 3.3%; Dead-Cat Bounce Or Start Of Something Bigger?
==================================================================

A shortened week of trading kicked off with bullish gains for the stock market Monday as fears about a trade war with China diminished, at least for a day. But to say that the market's technical health improved dramatically would be a stretch.




Nonetheless, it was a bullish close as major stock indexes ended near session highs. The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 3.3%; the Dow Jones industrial average soared 2.8% and the S&P 500 jumped 2.7%. In early-afternoon trading, small caps were lagging with the Russell 2000 up just 0.7%, but the small-cap index strengthened into the close, ending with a gain of 2.2%.


Volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE was lower than Friday's levels. That's a bit disappointing because it calls into question whether or not institutional investors were truly putting money to work.


After a trip to its 200-day moving average Friday, the S&P 500 bounced off the long-term support level. That's a positive, but the benchmark index still needs to rally about 3% just to get back to its 50-day moving average.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP032618-275x300.png)Advancing stocks on the NYSE outnumbered decliners by about 10-to-3. On the Nasdaq, winners topped losers by 12-to-5.


As noted in Friday's The Big Picture, fear was excessive in the stock market Friday as the put/call volume ratio hit 1.25. That was a sign that a bounce could be in the cards because excessive fear has come ahead of big rallies in the past.


Keep in mind that one bullish session does not mean that new highs are right around the corner. The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remains elevated, with six on the Nasdaq and eight on the S&P 500.


Last year, the indexes showed similarly high counts, but indexes managed to hold near highs. What's different this time around is the intensity of the selling. Of the S&P 500's eight higher-volume declines since Feb. 21, five showed percentage declines ranging from 1.1% to 2.5%. That's a lot different from last year, when the distribution-day counts for both indexes were high, but the percentage declines were much milder.


Inside the Dow, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) reclaimed its 50-day moving average, jumping nearly 8% in above-average volume. The strength was fueled by [positive comments from Morgan Stanley](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-gets-big-price-target-hike-adobe-downgraded/).


**Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) shrugged off a downgrade from JMP Securities to market perform from outperform, jumping nearly 6.5% in higher volume. Adobe is a member of [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) and also a Nasdaq 100 component.


Other top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) as well as semiconductor names like **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)). Gains ranged from 5.5% to 6.5%.

Last week, President Trump proposed tariffs of 25% on roughly $60 billion in Chinese imports. China retaliated with tariffs of its own, but many viewed China's response as muted. The world's second-largest economy appears ready to take steps to shrink its huge surplus with the U.S., [including buying more semiconductors from the U.S.](https://www.ft.com/content/1d56221c-30bb-11e8-b5bf-23cb17fd1498), according to a report in the Financial Times.


Gains were impressive in many IBD growth screens, including the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) which rose just over 4%. But a screen of stocks with top Composite Ratings moving higher in heavy volume yielded just five names late in the session. **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was one of them. The stock bounced nicely off its 50-day moving average, rising 4%.


Shares of **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) jumped 5% in early after-hours trading on strong earnings. The cloud software name was featured as a possible call-option trade in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/top-stocks-red-hat-lululemon-to-report-earnings/) column.


A reminder: The stock market will be closed Friday in observance of Good Friday.

  Stock Market Hits Record Highs, But Gains Fade; Powell To Speak Again

The stock market rose Thursday as Wall Street pushed major indexes into more record highs. But the Nasdaq and S&P 500 slashed solid advances and ended the day with only modest gains. Now investors will shift their attention to another speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in Washington, D.C., on Friday morning.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.3% after a 0.7% gain petered out. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed just 0.2% after advancing as much as 1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1.1%, closing just shy of the 2,100 level.

Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session. That results in a rare form of institutional selling called a [stall day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/). The action hinted at institutional players taking advantage of an intraday rally to sell into strength and take profits off the table.


That takes the S&P 500's distribution-day count to five, while the Nasdaq's remains at six.

Up next, Fed chief Powell will give the opening remarks at the [Fed Listens event](https://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/fed-listens-transitioning-to-the-post-pandemic-economy-032024.htm) that is set to start at 9 a.m. ET Friday. The event is expected to feature perspectives on current economic conditions and discuss how the pandemic reshaped the economy and the U.S. workforce.


The speech is to come two days after Powell addressed reporters following the Fed's two-day meeting. On Wednesday, Powell indicated that the Fed still sees three rate cuts by year's end.


Goldman, Home Depot Lead Dow
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones industrials, **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) were the biggest gainers, rallying 4.4% and 2.8%, respectively.


On the downside in blue chips, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) tumbled 4.1% after the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-justice-department-antitrust-lawsuit/) sued the company, accusing the consumer electronics giant of violating antitrust laws with its restrictive iPhone and App Store policies.


Among Magnificent Seven stocks, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was the biggest loser — besides Apple — with a 1.6% slide. On the upside, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rallied 1.2%, extending a win streak to four sessions.


And top growth stocks rose sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 1.6%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Blue Owl Capital** ([OWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OWL)) is breaking out past a 18.33 buy point in a flat base. Shares rallied 3.7% on the stock market Thursday, but volume was barely above average, a sign of lacking institutional demand.

What To Do Now
--------------


After Thursday's gains, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are back at record highs as the ongoing stock market uptrend continues to show strength. Despite the fresh highs, IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60%-80%, keeping in mind that a pullback now would not be surprising.


The recent, albeit brief, pullback offered a short chance for some leading stocks to form some new bases before launching higher. For example, [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list showed four stocks Thursday, including **Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)). That stock broke out past a 143.35 buy point.


Keep track of emerging bases with the [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Near Pivot" list. Currently, it shows only a handful of stocks. For example, **Ares Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)) is nearing a flat base's 139.48 buy trigger.

Stock Market Leaders: Arista, DraftKings
----------------------------------------



Among stocks to watch are **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)), **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) and **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)). All have moved into or near buy zones.


Arista shares are breaking out above a 292.66 flat-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) charts, with solid gains this week. The buy zone runs up to 307.29.


[IPO Leader Duolingo](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/duolingo-stock-ipo/) attempted a breakout Thursday but closed just shy of a cup with handle's 241.86 entry with its 0.7% gain.


[DraftKings](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/draftkings-ibd-stock-of-the-day-march-madness/) broke out past a 46.52 buy point in a short consolidation, climbing 5.7% Wednesday. Shares added 3.6% Thursday, just out of the buy area that tops out at 47.90.


Finally, after Royal Caribbean topped a 133.77 buy point Wednesday, shares tacked on modest gains in the stock market today. The cruise ship operator finished in the buy area that goes up to 140.46.

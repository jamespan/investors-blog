Stocks were reading out of different playbooks Friday, as the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average headed in opposite directions.




The Nasdaq fell 0.5%, while the Dow rose 0.3%. The S&P 500 compromised, ending just below flat. Small caps retreated 0.5% as gauged by the S&P 600.


Volume jumped on both major exchanges. Friday was a quadruple witching day for expirations, which tends to boost trade.


The conflicted action could be a sign of hesitation. Some hefty news will be released in the coming week.

Tuesday, the Fed will begin a two-day meeting. The Street expects the Fed to announce a rate hike when it wraps up the meeting Wednesday.


CME Group's FedWatch Tool pegs the probability of a rate hike at 93.8%, which is down from the Sept. 14 reading of 98.


Thursday will see the third take on Q2 GDP. The second reading was 4.2%.


Durable goods orders for August also will be reported Thursday.


Shanghai Market: Is Bear Dead?
------------------------------

The Shanghai Composite on Friday posted a [follow-through day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/). Friday's 2.5% gain in rising volume signaled a new uptrend was underway on the Shanghai.


Depending on what follows, China's bear market could be over.


Still, there weren't a lot of China-based ADRs posting big gains.


China and Canada remain stuck in their respective trade disputes vs. the U.S.


The U.S. stock market has done remarkably well in its handling of the tariff issues. The same can't be said for China and Canada. The Shanghai is down 15% year to date, and Canada's stock market is flat year to date.


America First In Stocks
-----------------------


Depending on the U.S. index of choice, America's markets are up smartly no matter what the gauge is. The Nasdaq is up nearly 16% for the year; the small cap S&P 600, 15%; the large cap S&P 500, 10%; and the Dow, 8%.


For the past week, the Dow rose 2.3%; and the S&P 500, 0.8%. The S&P 600 and the Nasdaq fell 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively.

Weak action slapped the indexes with distribution Friday but couldn't stop the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 from logging their fifth consecutive up week.


The Nasdaq dropped 0.4%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.5%. The IBD 50 also fell 0.5%.


Volume rose across the board.


The combination of losses and rising volume met the definition of distribution. Volume ran lower most of the day until a surge in the final 10 minutes.


October is known as the month of changing colors, and that's exactly what the market did this autumn.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 gained roughly 9% and 8%, respectively, for the month, erasing much of the losses in August and September.


Breakouts picked up in October, after the Oct. 2 follow-through, which confirmed that an uptrend was underway.


The follow-through day involves a strong gain in rising volume on the fourth day or later of an attempted rally.


Because the follow-through day is a confirmation, individual investors should look back a few days to see which stocks broke out just before the confirmation. (They might still be in a buy zone.)


On Sept. 29-30, **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)), **Reynolds American** ([RAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAI)) and **Universal Insurance** ([UVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UVE)) broke out. The three stocks gained as much as 14%, 12% and 29%, respectively, after their breakouts.


On Oct. 1 and 2, **CBOE Holdings** ([CBOE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBOE)) and **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) triggered buy signals. CBOE gained about 3% and has slipped below the entry. But homebuilder LGI Homes, which bounced off its 50-day line on the follow-through day, rose about 25% before pulling back. (On Friday, LGI Homes returned to its 50-day line a second time, which could lead to a new buy zone if it can rebound.)


Studies show that many leaders of a new uptrend make their moves in the first four weeks.


The bad news is that the four weeks are over. However, studies also found that leaders can break out as late as 13 weeks into the uptrend. The bad news is that some uptrends don't last 13 weeks.


What should an investor do if they misplayed October?


Avoid forcing exposure. Be patient and see what November offers in the way of breakouts.


For the week, the Big Cap 20 rose 2.3%; IBD 50, 1.4%; Nasdaq, 0.4%; and S&P 500, 0.2%.


Companies reporting in the coming week include **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and LGI Homes.

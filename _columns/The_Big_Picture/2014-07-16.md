S&P 500, Dow Transports Up But Nasdaq Shows Poor Breadth
=========================================================

The key stock averages notched modest gains Wednesday, and the popular Dow Jones industrials marked an all-time high. But a closer look shows the session was much more mixed.


The S&P 500 rallied 0.4%, stamping out Tuesday's small decline. NYSE volume edged up. The large-cap benchmark is just a few points away from painting another all-time record.


The Dow transports rose 0.6%, reflecting high demand for airline, shipping and trucking stocks. (See today's [Industry Themes](http://news.investors.com/investing/ibd-industry-themes.htm) column on Page B6 for more.) The Dow utilities rallied 0.5%.


The action by such indexes is constructive. And on the NYSE, the market breadth was fairly positive too. Oil and gas shares rallied en masse. Stocks in a few software-related industry subgroups also rose sharply.


But small caps failed to join the upside, with the S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both losing 0.2%.


While the Nasdaq composite, a market cap-weighted index, is dominated by large-cap techs, it too contains smaller issues. Their decline may have weighed on the Nasdaq index as it gained just 0.2% and finished in the lower half of the session's range.


Volume rose substantially on the Nasdaq, but due to the index's failure to reach a new high in recent sessions, it was not a stalling day.


Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq by about 15 to 11, a disappointment. You'd much prefer to see winners exceed losers as the market goes up.


The IBD 50, down 0.4%, reflected a similar divergence. Based on Wednesday's list, just 21 stocks joined the upside while 29 fell.


A week after IBD's Market Pulse noted a shift in the current outlook to "Uptrend under pressure," conditions haven't changed much for investors searching for solid breakouts. Unlike in some years, when stocks rocketed higher after posting second-quarter results, high-growth stocks appear to be moving more tentatively.


In such a scenario, it makes sense to continue keeping some of your powder dry. Cash is always the best insulation against increasing market swings.


Yet it still makes sense to stay vigilant and identify new breakout opportunities. Some stocks have surged after beating the Street's consensus view.


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) (Composite Rating 92) is a good example among firms with a market cap north of $100 billion. On Wednesday, the chip giant soared 9% to 34.65 in more than quadruple average volume. Q2 revenue growth of 8% was the highest in 10 quarters.


The stock is now up 27% past a late-May breakout past 27.34. A key IBD sell rule: In most cases, take at least some gains when a stock has rallied 20% to 25% from a proper buy point. It's been years since Intel has acted this well.

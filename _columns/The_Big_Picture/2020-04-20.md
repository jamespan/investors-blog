A historic drop in oil prices sent the stock market lower Monday, although the day wasn't a total loss for investors seeking [new buy opportunities](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/).




Stock indexes around midday were recovering from an early drop, but rolled over as selling in crude oil prices intensified. In an unprecedented day, West Texas Intermediate [futures for May delivery, which expire Tuesday, plummeted more than 100% to -$37.63 a barrel](https://www.investors.com/news/us-oil-prices-have-never-been-this-upside-down-before/). That's not a misprint; crude futures went below zero.


The more actively traded June U.S. futures slid 18% to $20.43 a barrel. The oil glut has gotten so bad, oil companies face a shortage of storage tanks.


The S&P 500, which is more heavily weighted with oil stocks, closed 1.8% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4% and the Nasdaq composite 1%. All indexes closed near session lows. The Dow Jones' transportation and utility benchmarks both fell more than 3%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE, although more by circumstance than by design. Options expirations boosted Friday's volume, making it easy for trade to decline Monday. At any rate, the market [avoided a distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP042019-274x300.jpg)Despite the gloom in the energy sector, growth investors had some reason to cheer. Indexes remained in their price uptrends, and distribution has been sparse since the April 2 follow-through bottoming signal. The S&P 500 did hit resistance at its 50-day moving average, which bears watching.


Top Stocks: Polar Opposite Vs. The Oil Market
---------------------------------------------


A few more top stocks broke out, adding to a [crop of successful breakouts](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-stocks-next-wave-of-leaders/) over the past few weeks.


**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) stormed out of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in heavy volume. The [e-commerce stock's](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-stock-rally-shop-earnings/) [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) made a new high before the stock did, which is a bullish sign. Biotech **Zai Labs** ([ZLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZLAB)) (in light volume) and software maker **Smartsheet** ([SMAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMAR)) also broke out.


After an aborted attempt Friday, **Palomar Holdings** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)) solidified a breakout past the 60.30 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). Volume was heavy, and the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is near new highs.


Notably, Palomar's base showed accumulation: a spike in volume as shares reversed higher the week of March 20. That's rare for a bear-market base, and it's even more remarkable that volume was quiet as the stock declined. Little wonder, Palomar now boasts an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/).


Add those to a list of shining breakouts that includes **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)), **Vertex** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)).


A screen of [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in the past few weeks finds 65 stocks, with an average gain from their buy points of nearly 4%. As of Friday, just 15 of the 65 were below their entries, and practically all have avoided sell signals. Nine of the best performing breakouts are in health care, including winners such as **Seattle Genetics** ([SGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGEN)), **Livongo Health** ([LVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVGO)) and **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)).


Health Care, Big Caps Leading Uptrend
-------------------------------------


The health care sector has been a leader as the stock market recovers from the coronavirus bear market. Health CareÂ Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) is up 34% since the March 23 market low. That's one of the best sector performances. It's early, but so far every health care company in the S&P 500 has topped profit and sales expectations for Q1, [according to FactSet](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-april-17-2020?utm_campaign=Insight&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=86466826&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8wwLfKpVsSTUTd4I1Sa4NbebAHKjPQ876e1RICUfV8Se0N4ufGRGUkoZQCzJGKGGFBh3kE-Z4WmeGBv3M6elzkcNJMcbZMLFv6rE7vawx-rKz3WCs&_hsmi=86466826).


The Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) is up 40%, but it was also the sector most damaged in the coronavirus bear market. It's still more than 50% off its prior high. Software, retail, technology and other sector indexes are up more than 20% since the stock market bottomed. The IBD 50 is up about 25% from the low and was off only 0.1% Monday.


Big caps have an edge over small caps in the current uptrend. The iShares Russell 2000 small-cap ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) is up 26% compared with a 29% increase for the large-cap iShares Russell 1000 ETF ([IWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWB)).


The performance gap is more pronounced when looking at the new breakouts. More than 40 of the 65 have market caps above $15 billion. Indeed, large-cap growth stocks are spearheading the new market uptrend.


One Stock Market Risk Right Now
-------------------------------


But just as investors are savoring some profits, now comes a risky period: earnings season. This week begins a torrent of first-quarter earnings report. Not only is there risk for each company disclosing their financial condition, but worse-than-expected reports from bellwethers can spill over to industry peers or even the market.


In a report Monday morning, UBS Global Wealth Management said it expects first-quarter S&P 500 earnings to decline 10% to 15%. "It will get worse in 2Q before improving in the second half of the year," senior equity strategist David Lefkowitz warned.


While a depressed earnings season is largely expected, the swift deterioration of first-quarter conditions means we could be in for bigger surprises.


"While we usually highlight how results are comparing relative to consensus expectations, the economy slowed down so quickly [that] most companies did not have time to recalibrate analyst expectations before reporting season. So results are coming in much lower than 'formal' analyst estimates," the UBS report noted. "As a result, those statistics are less meaningful this earnings season."

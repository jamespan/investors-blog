  Major Stock Market Indexes Slump Again, But Mask These Positive Elements

For yet another session, major stock market indexes played a slightly bearish tune.




However, Tuesday's action also concealed some bullish elements, even as Wall Street heads into its ninth day in correction status.


Sellers pancaked thin gains early in the day. For instance, the S&P 500 saw a 0.3% gain get squashed into a 0.2% loss. The Nasdaq's nearly 0.5% lift deflated into a 0.1% decline. For both equity indexes, Tuesday's moves marked the third day in a row of decent (if not thrilling) open, disappointing close.


As this column has been expressing since a [key downgrade in the current outlook on Sept. 30](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-ends-september-with-ugly-reversal-why-the-outlook-is-worse-today/), the careful IBD reader perhaps should expect this kind of negative day-to-day action. Anxious shareholders, eager to either cut losses or lock in gains, are selling into early strength.



Looking at the S&P 500, now at 4350, the large-cap index now stands just a handful of points above the close of its first up day in its new rally attempt, ignited on Oct. 5.


The S&P 500 Today
-----------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP101221-196x300.jpg)A daily chart of the S&P 500 clearly shows that, at least technically, institutions are in no hurry to accumulate stocks. For instance, since Sept. 20, the index has closed beneath its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) in 14 of the 17 sessions.


That's an even longer stretch of time than in September 2020, when the S&P 500 spent eight straight sessions below this intermediate-term support-and-resistance level. Back then, the S&P 500 fell nearly 11% from its then high of 3588.


This time around? As of the Oct. 4 session low, the benchmark has actually dropped less than 6% from its new all-time peak of 4545.


The Nasdaq, in turn, has now spent more than three weeks virtually on the south side of its own 50-day moving average, which has flattened. In contrast, during a steep decline for big-cap and megacap techs in February and March, it took roughly six weeks for the tech-fortified index to shake off the bears and resume its major uptrend.


Currently, an 8% correction has pushed the Nasdaq closer to a potential test of the longer-term 200-day moving average. However, seven months ago, the index had run up so strong in 2020 that a 12.5% drop did not even come close to the 200-day line at the time.


Like some panelists on IBD Live like to say, technically, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq stand in no man's land â€” that is, we see both indexes in the region between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This makes it awfully difficult, if not impossible, to determine which direction is next for stocks.


Support at the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) is generally a trait seen in long-term uptrends.



The year 2019 offers a recent example. As the stock market wrestled with issues of an increasingly thorny trade relationship between the U.S. and China, the Nasdaq suffered three notable pullbacks from April to the end of September. Yet each time, the composite index stopped short of falling beneath its 200-day moving average in a big way. A positive reversal on Oct. 3, 2019, saw the Nasdaq jump right off its 200-day line.


Led by techs, the index then went on a four-month rally before topping on Feb. 19, 2020, as coronavirus spread across the world and the economy ground to a halt.


Fast-forward to today, and Tuesday's action showed several silver linings.


Three Positive Takeaways
------------------------


First, small- and midcap stocks actually rallied. Generally, these sectors do much worse when fund managers feel gloomy about the future economy.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund gained 0.6%, taking back nearly half its losses from the two prior days. True, small caps have generally made no significant price progress since February. In fact, the ETF's action has taken the form of a long consolidation pattern. That is, it continues to digest big gains since the 2020 market bottom.


The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ETF rose 0.6%, holding a mild 1.9% gain so far in the fourth quarter.



A few other sectors, meanwhile, continue to advance nicely in October. Oil and gas stocks took a breather on Tuesday. But just like what happened in names such as **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)), **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) and **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)), the leaders in this key commodity sector fell in quiet volume after ramping up in brisk turnover.


Secondly, Tuesday's action revealed a curious divergence. For every three stocks that fell on the NYSE, four more climbed in price. On the Nasdaq, winners outpaced losers by roughly a 7-5 ratio, early data showed.


Given that the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been locked in a downtrend since June, a change in this trend would be healthy. Also, you can see that generally more leading stocks rose in heavy volume than those that fell in above-average turnover. [On the homepage of MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/), the "Stock Action" table highlights 237 stocks up on volume vs. 118 down on volume.


Third, key stock lists show a decent number of stocks that have been building bases. Others are getting support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), a key technical level after having broken out earlier this year.


Can These Stocks Still Lead The Stock Market?
---------------------------------------------


**First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) is itching to clear resistance near 107. Its solar energy group ranked first in performance among 197 IBD industries on Tuesday, up 5%. The utility scale solar power infrastructure firm is a new name in [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).


Specialty enterprise software, metal ores, ship transport, shoe, automaker, security software stocks also fared well. These industries rose well more than 1% on a price-weighted basis.



Current stock market leaders **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Bill.com** ([BILL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILL)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)), **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and cannabis real estate play **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) all are testing support at their 10-week moving averages.


Institutions put money back to work in long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year bond's yield fell 3 basis points to 1.58%. A fresh auction of 10-year notes apparently saw healthy demand. Still, yields have sprung more than 30 basis points in just three weeks.

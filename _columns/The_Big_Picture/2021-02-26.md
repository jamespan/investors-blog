Stock Market Mixed As Nasdaq's Rebound Fades; 3 Top Stocks Trigger Sell Signals
================================================================================

The stock market ended the week sharply mixed Friday as the Nasdaq's gains faded in afternoon trade, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 470 points. Top growth stocks Nvidia, Teladoc and Tesla triggered sell signals amid the week's market sell-off.




The Nasdaq rallied 0.6% after cutting a gain of as much as 1.9%. The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrials slid 1.5%.


Leading growth stocks outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.8% Friday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) soared 11.5% after [reporting strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/etsy-stock-quarterly-results-smash-estimates/) late Thursday.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and also was lower on the NYSE from Thursday's totals.


Stock Market Pullback
---------------------


![MP022621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP022621-254x300.jpg)The Nasdaq recovered a small part of Thursday's 3.5% dive, and remained below its 50-day moving average. Despite the gain, the Nasdaq closed down 4.9% for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 showed milder weekly losses of 1.8% and 2.45%, respectively.


Friday's mixed action comes on the heels of Thursday's sell-off. On Thursday, the heavy losses marked a character shift for the stock market, and so [IBD's market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) was [downgraded to "uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-routed-nasdaq-pierces-key-level-why-investors-must-change-trading-strategy/)."


The Nasdaq holds four days of institutional selling. Because volume fell on the NYSE Friday, the S&P 500 avoided a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) and also has four.


Amid the current stock market pullback, investors should continue to focus on defense. Avoid new breakouts, unless they're exceptional, and make sure to sell [any stock that falls more than 7%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) below your purchase price. Remember, you don't have to wait for the 7%-8% loss if the stock is clearly not acting well.

Top Stocks Trigger Sell Signals
-------------------------------


The past week, a number of high-quality stocks triggered sell signals, underscoring the danger in the current stock market pullback.


Chip leader **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) tripped the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule from a 587.76 buy point in a flat base. Shares are clinging to their 50-day line.


**Teladoc** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) dived 24% for the week, erasing the entirety of a 30% gain from a 236.90 entry in a double-bottom base. That caused a sell signal: When a stock [round trips a double-digit gain](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/key-sell-signal-saved-stamps-com-stock-investors-from-posting-big-losses/), it's time to play defense to avoid taking a loss.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) [plunged through its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) with a 13.5% loss, its biggest weekly decline since March 2020, during the throes of the coronavirus bear market. Weekly volume swelled from the previous week.

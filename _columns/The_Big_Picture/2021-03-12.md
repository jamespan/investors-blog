The stock market turned in a bullish performance Friday as the Nasdaq rallied sharply off lows, while the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small-cap index marked all-time closing highs.




The Nasdaq might be technically in a correction until it makes a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), but the stock market is in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) due to continued strength in the other major stock indexes.


After a nice move above the 50-day moving average Thursday, the Nasdaq composite shaved a 1.8% opening loss to 0.6% by the close. The Nasdaq 100 came close to its 50-day line Thursday but backed off highs by the close. The Nasdaq 100 also rallied off lows Friday, but still fell 0.9%, hurt by weak showings from former leaders **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) and **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)).


Avoid the pitfall of staying married to the big leaders of 2020. While growth stocks will have their day in the sun again, many former leaders won't necessarily be leaders when growth stocks start rallying again. New leadership has emerged across of a variety of subgroups and sectors, including financial, [oil and gas](http://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/), construction, mining, steel, chemical, fertilizer and travel stocks.

The message behind recent selling in the Nasdaq is pretty clear: It's going to take some time before growth stocks resume their leadership role. Remember that the best bases will come from stocks that showed contained pullbacks â€” not stocks that pulled back more than 35% off their recent highs.


**Twitter**'s ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) weekly chart shows the stock still has potential to be a stock market leader. After a bullish breakout, Twitter has been drifting lower in light volume while holding nicely above its 10-week moving average.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, rising 0.9%, helped by another strong showing from **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). After breaking out from a cup base Wednesday with a buy point at 244.18, Boeing ended with a weekly gain of nearly 21%. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) also led the Dow, helped by rising interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level in more than a year, up 9 basis points to 1.62%.


The bond market is flagging the threat of inflation amid expectations for a strong recovery for the U.S. economy. But the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it expects inflation to remain contained. The Fed has a two-day policy meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. There's been some talk the Fed could make some changes to its monthly asset purchases, but that might be a stretch with the Dow hitting all-time highs.


The S&P 500 edged up 0.1% and the Russell 2000 added 0.6%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Thursday.

The Market Pulse graphic shows a relatively high [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. A follow-through day for the Nasdaq composite would reset the distribution day count to zero, but it hasn't happened yet. Thursday's 2.5% gain for the Nasdaq had the feel of a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/), but volume came in slightly below Wednesday's levels.


IBD 50 Holds Up
---------------


After soaring above its 50-day line Thursday, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) turned in a strong showing, down less than 0.3%. **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) was a top gainer in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), up 6% to 27.06. It's been a laggard stock in the technology sector, but Dropbox soared past a 25.80 entry and ended the week still in the 5% buy zone.



IBD 50 biotech **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) is making a solid first test of its 10-week moving average for the first after a breakout from a cup base in January.


**Ingersoll Rand** ([IR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IR)) is still in buy range after a breakout from a flat base with a 47.88 buy point.



Outside of the IBD 50, construction firm **Fluor** ([FLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLR)) cleared a seven-week consolidation, rising 11% to 23.23. The stock's relative strength line hit a new high, confirming the breakout. Fluor joined a long list of turnaround stocks with seemingly weak fundamentals and sluggish ratings from IBD. But after losing $2.80 a share in 2020, analysts expect annual profit of 86 cents this year, with growth accelerating in 2022, up 50%.


Hotel operator **Marriott** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)) is in the same boat with weak ratings. But the hotel operator is trading tightly near highs after a breakout from a flat base last month.

Stocks Tumble Broadly As Market Takes A Pause
==============================================

The stock market tumbled Monday, a sign that some exhaustion is setting in after recent big gains. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 slid 1% each, their worst drops since Sept. 28. While indexes closed off their session lows, thanks to a burst of buying in the final 45 minutes, the losses still left their mark on the charts.

  

Volume fell and was below average, which indicated that institutional investors limited their selling. Of course, trading was elevated Friday because of the monthly jobs report and a jump in yields, which made an increase in volume Monday all the more difficult to obtain.

  

If volume was not a bad sign for the market, breadth surely was. Losers topped winners by nearly 4-to-1 on the NYSE and by close to 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq.

  

After the strong advance in October and early November, a market pullback is not at all surprising at this stage.

  

The Nasdaq shot 15% up from the Sept. 29 low to the peak on Nov. 3. It's unrealistic to expect any broad index to continue such a frenetic pace unabated. In fact, it would be constructive if the indexes decline gently and set themselves up to resume advancing.

  

Monday's losses might have looked scary to investors used to seeing big moves only on the upside. But in context, the declines were well contained.

  

The S&P 500 came close to touching the 50-day moving average, where chart readers would look for support.

  

At Monday's low, the Nasdaq was less than 2% from its Nov. 3 high. If indexes can continue to glide gently during future down days, it would be a good sign that they are stabilizing.

  

It is also smart to remain vigilant. With Wall Street in a profit-taking mood, some of the winners of autumn are in retreat.

  

**Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)) skidded 6%. The airline had soared 50% from an Oct. 8 breakout. **CDW Corp.** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)) has given back nearly 8% the past two sessions. **Total System Services** ([TSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSS)) is 5% off its Oct. 29 peak. Its pullback has been smooth, a good sign. The payment processing firm had jumped as much as 14% from a 48.18 buy point.

  

By and large, the leaders are not surrendering much at all of their winnings. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Western Alliance** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) and **Intercontinental Exchange** ([ICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICE)) remain firm.

  

The IBD 50 fell 0.8% Monday. But **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) plunged nearly 10% after a weak outlook. The sell-off hurt a leisure sector that has been a market leader.

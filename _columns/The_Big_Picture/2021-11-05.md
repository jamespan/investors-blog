The stock market rally continued apace Friday as indexes roared to new highs once again. A positive jobs report and strong earnings have emboldened the bulls, with the upward charge still not letting up.




The Nasdaq composite climbed for a remarkable 10th day in a row, adding 0.2%. Its [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on Oct. 26 was removed after the index climbed more than 5% above that day's close. The broader S&P 500 also flexed its muscles, gaining 0.4% as it carried on its own seven-day winning streak.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq, and NYSE volume rose slightly.


For its part, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the top major index of the day after rising 0.6%. It has managed to hold comfortably clear after closing above 36,000 for the first time the past week, the sixth 1,000-point milestone of 2021.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP110521-265x300.jpg)But consider this: The Nasdaq is now about 6% above its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 is about 5% above this key level. This suggests both are getting extended.


While it might seem like the bears have gone into hibernation early this fall, they could easily be getting ready to ambush overconfident investors.


So stay engaged with the market, keep cool if a pullback does occur and have a plan in place for your holdings to protect gains.


These Key Factors Boost Stocks
------------------------------


A strong earnings season has arguably been the key driver in helping stocks continue to outperform.


So far in Q3 of 2021, FactSet data shows 81% of firms in the index have reported a positive EPS surprise. In addition, around 75% managed to outperform on revenue. The sample size is large, with 89% of S&P 500 companies reporting to date.


For now the S&P 500's blended earnings growth rate stands at 39.1%. If this can be maintained, it will be the index's third-highest earnings growth rate since 2010.


Enthusiasm was also raised Friday by a [strong jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-october-2021-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-dow-jones/). The Labor Department revealed U.S. nonfarm employers added 531,000 workers in October, up from the revised number of 312,000 workers hired in September. This stomped on economist expectations for 450,000 new jobs. It also saw the unemployment fall to 4.6%, down from 4.8% in September.


Earlier in the week the Federal Reserve finally announced its long-telegraphed tapering of bond purchases. If it proceeds as expected, it will end asset purchases around June-July of 2022. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was at pains to emphasize tapering does not mean interest rates will rise any time soon. This dovish approach soothed Wall Street and further helped boost the bullish picture.

Growth Stocks Rally As Stock Market Fizzes
------------------------------------------


One interesting aspect of Friday's action was the performance of the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)).


In contrast with the broader indexes, this bellwether lagged before rallying to a gain of 0.3%. It managed to rise 2.5% for the week, but was only up in three out of five sessions.


**Confluent** ([CFLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFLT)) was the top performer, rising more than 27% for the day. The data analytics stock spiked on results, but there is no entry in sight. **Bill.com** ([BILL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILL)) was also strong, rising around 14% in another high-volume move.



On the downside, **Dynavax** ([DVAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVAX)) struggled, plunging 22%. The vaccine maker was dragged lower on news of **Pfizer**'s ([PFZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFZ)) antiviral pill, which the company said slashes risk of severe Covid-19 by 89%.


Breakouts Thin On The Ground, But These Leaders Excel
-----------------------------------------------------


Among a few breakouts Friday, data storage stock **Smart Global** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)) closed below its cup-base [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 58.49, despite posting a gain of 2.8% for the day.



[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) closed near session highs, surging about 13% following a positive earnings report. It sprinted past its 20% profit goal from its 152.86 entry, and is also clear of its buy zone from a 177.06 alternate entry.


**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) had been faring even better than Airbnb initially, but ceded some early gains following an explosive gap-up. It closed with a gain of just over 11% following robust quarterly results. The cloud analytics play has now sprinted well clear of its 20% profit goal from a 140.38 buy point.

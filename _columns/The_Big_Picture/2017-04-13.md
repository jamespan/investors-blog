Nasdaq Breaks Support: 5 Factors To Drive Market
=================================================

U.S. stock indexes sagged Thursday, forcing the Nasdaq to join the S&P 500 and the Dow under the 50-day moving average.


The Nasdaq deflated 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each lost 0.7%. The small cap Russell 2000 ratcheted down 1%. Volume ran lower on the Nasdaq. Early figures showed lower NYSE volume. Quiet volume was no surprise on the eve of a holiday.


The U.S. stock market will be closed for Good Friday and reopen Monday. Exchanges in China and many exchanges in Europe will also be closed Friday and Monday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP041417-229x300.png)Blue chips were mostly down Thursday. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) suffered the biggest losses in the Dow, dropping about 3% and 2%, respectively, in lackluster volume. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), which is testing its 50-day moving average, rose 0.2% in subpar volume.


Banking stocks got off to a decent start but then reversed lower. [A handful of banks](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/nasdaq-steps-higher-jpmorgan-up-on-solid-results/) reported Q1 results that beat the Street's earnings estimates.


For example, **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) beat views on earnings but couldn't hold their early gains. Each rose about 2% in the first 50 minutes of trade and then reversed lower to close in the red.


The bank sector not too long ago was No. 1 or No. 2 among 33 sectors. Going into Thursday's session, it had faded to No. 6.


Among stocks doing repairs after severe damage, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) rose 1% in average volume as it cleared the 5% buy zone from a late March breakout. The breakout came from a bottoming base. Chipotle saw its earnings growth drop to 7% in 2015 and then skid to a 91% decline in 2016. But Chipotle could become a major turnaround story.


The Street expects Chipotle to rebound to 517% earnings growth this year and 44% growth in 2018. Chipotle will report first-quarter results after the close April 25. The Street expects earnings to roll in at $1.27 a share, up from a loss of 88 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.


Chipotle's stock could get help from an improving trend in restaurant stocks. Among 197 industry groups, restaurants rose to No. 27 going into Thursday's session, up from No. 103 six weeks ago.


In economic news Thursday, the data were bullish.


First-time jobless claims were almost 4% lower than the Street's consensus estimate. And the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge for April was 98 vs. views for 97.


Five Factors That Could Spur The Stock Market
---------------------------------------------


What would it take to get this uptrend a get-out-of-jail card, or on the dark side — a longer sentence under pressure or worse? Five items are hanging over the market.


No. 1, seasonality: April is traditionally a good month for the stock market. Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, recently pointed out that April has been the strongest month over the past 20 years. Detrick noted that most of the gains traditionally come in the second half of the month.


So, don't give up on April yet.


No. 2, earnings season: The Q1 results will pick up in the coming week. Companies reporting include **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) and some banks, including **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **M&T Bank** ([MTB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTB)).


No. 3, pressure: The uptrend is currently under pressure. Historically what has been [the market's next move](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/what-the-stats-say-about-the-stock-markets-next-move/) — to correction or back to uptrend? In eight of the past 10 instances, the market outlook went bullish, to confirmed uptrend.


No. 4, Republican politics: The House is Republican. The U.S. Senate is Republican. And President Trump is Republican. So why can't they agree on an ObamaCare replacement, Dodd-Frank rollbacks, and a revamping of corporate and individual taxes? And the burst of business optimism that occurred  after Trump's victory has since faded, hurting the so-called Trump plays — banks and infrastructure stocks.


No. 5, international events: Trump has no shortage of international problems or events to deal with, including China and North Korea, the bombing of Syria, Russia, France's election April 23 and the bombing of ISIS forces in Afghanistan on Thursday.


Any one the above factors could drive stocks either north or south.

title: Indexes Slip, Small Caps Lag, But IBD 50 Stocks Shine Again

The Nasdaq composite's nine-session winning streak came to an end Monday as all three major stock indexes ended with mild losses. Volume was light due to the Columbus Day holiday.




The Nasdaq and S&P 500 eased less than 0.2% each, while the Dow Jones industrial average gave back less than 0.1%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.4%.


Big movers in the Dow included **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)).


Retail bellwether Wal-Mart jumped nearly 2% ahead of its analyst day Tuesday. Sentiment was also positive after the company said it's starting a new service in November that will make it easier and faster to return merchandise bought from the store.


Wal-Mart has been hugging the 50-day moving average as it works on a new flat base with an 82.09 entry.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP-100917-192x300.png)It was a different story at Dow component General Electric, which slumped nearly 4% after JPMorgan said management and board changes suggest that "core fundamental challenges are worse than consensus is currently discounting."


Price action in the major stock indexes might've been dull Monday, but it wasn't dull in the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), with 14 names up 1% or more. Headed into Monday, the index of leading growth stocks was up 27% year to date, nearly doubling the performance of the S&P 500.


IBD 50 member **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) was a big winner, up 6% to 135.90, as China stocks turned in strong performances again. China Lodging has been on a tear since it cleared a flat base in July with an 88.18 buy point.


Also in the IBD 50, thinly traded small-cap **Jupai Holdings** ([JP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JP)) soared 11%. The China-based wealth manager hasn't looked back since a September move to new highs.


Meanwhile, IBD 50 component **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) added 2% to 185.39. It's slightly extended from a 174.66 buy point. The chip firm's weekly chart shows a three-weeks-tight alternate entry at 191.30, but it's generally best to see the add-on pattern form after a meaningful gain from the breakout. Nvidia mustered a 9.5% gain from the breakout before shares reversed lower in higher volume during the week ended Sept. 22.


If you're holding some strong performers, now is the time to look closely at all of them. For those that are up 20% or more, consider taking partial or full profits, even if sell signals aren't clearly apparent. It's still a market where playing defense makes sense in some cases.


Of course, the larger the gain, the easier it is to hold through normal market pullbacks.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) took a gain of around 20% in **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) Monday, not because of obvious sell signals but because some new highs came in light volume.


Regarding overall market health, distribution days for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 — basically higher-volume declines or instances of stalling action that point toward institutional selling — have been dropping off the count quickly lately, helping the market tide continue its positive flow.


Tight trading near highs, which the indexes have been doing lately, has been a welcome sight for the bulls. The bears, meanwhile, continue to scratch their heads, wondering how the market can keep going higher amid plenty of uncertainty, mostly on the geopolitical front.


It's a safe bet that part of the market's strength is in anticipation of another strong earnings season. Quarterly reports from a couple of high-profile financial stocks are due later in the week from **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)).


Citigroup is a leader in IBD's money-center banking industry group, but it's well-extended in price. JPMorgan has been a decent performer, but a breakout over a 95.32 buy point hasn't gone very far, and the stock is still in buy range.


Recent new highs for the indexes could also be in anticipation of continued improvement in the economy with contained inflation, putting concerns about meaningfully higher interest rates in 2018 and beyond on the back burner for now. Low rates tend to spur M&A activity, and that certainly has been the case lately.


The 10-year Treasury yield is currently at 2.36%. Money has been flowing out of bonds since early September. That's when the 10-year yield was around 2.03%.


The market is growing more confident about one more rate hike before the end of the year but remains unsure about the timing of future hikes. The Federal Reserve has signaled three rate hikes in 2018.


Recent IPO **Despegar.com** ([DESP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DESP)), an Argentina-based online travel firm, cleared an IPO base with a 33.50 buy point, but an 5.6% intraday gain faded to 3% by the close. Shares ended at 33.30. Despegar.com went public last month at 26.


**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) notched its ninth straight gain, many of which came in heavy volume, as shares rose 2% to 39.59. The stock is still well within buy range from a 39.35  entry. Similar to Despegar, the software name has the ["new"](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/new-product/) going for it. It's been a publicly traded company for less than two years.

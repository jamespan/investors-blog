Indexes Again Fall Modestly, Stay In Narrow Range
==================================================

Stocks edged lower Tuesday but the major indexes kept holding tightly to their recent gains.

  

The Nasdaq eased 0.1% and the S&P 500 was down only a fraction. Volume rose modestly across the board.

  

It was the Nasdaq's third straight decline, but the brief descent has been mild. The composite hasn't lost more than 0.1% each of the past three days, and it has closed in the upper part of its daily range four sessions in a row.

  

The S&P 500 has closed near session highs nine of the past 12 days.

  

Even if the market isn't soaring, such buoyancy in the indexes is a good sign as the market tries to build on a week-old rally confirmation.

  

Also significant is the fact that the market has avoided distribution days after the May 27 follow-through. That's kept the market clean of institutional-sized selling.

  

Some market indicators seem to be turning the corner.

  

The IBD Mutual Fund Index is still about 4% off its high but has broken a downtrend. That's a sign that institutional-favorite growth stocks are getting back in style.

  

But the Accumulation/Distribution Rating of the Nasdaq is still low, even while the ratings of the S&P 500 and Dow have improved.

  

The advance-decline line of the NYSE is solid, as shown on the chart here of the Dow industrials.

  

But the Nasdaq's line is slipping after making a sharp rebound in the second half of May. Indeed, the Nasdaq, which lagged the S&P 500 during the correction, is still trailing it since the follow-through.

  

There was good news for the tech-tilted Nasdaq on Tuesday, when several chip stocks made strong gains in heavy volume.

  

**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) rallied 6% to a new high after the company raised its current-quarter outlook, citing strength in the Internet of Things. That simplistic-sounding term describes home devices and appliances that can be controlled remotely from smartphones or PCs. It's an emerging trend in personal computing that other tech companies have cited as a growth field.

  

**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) jumped 4% on bullish analyst comments. **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) broke out of a flat base in heavy trading.

  

Small-caps have some question marks of their own: The Russell 2000 is still below a downward-sloping 50-day moving average. Yet some small-caps are breaking out.

  

**G-III Apparel Group** ([GIII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIII)) soared past the 77.32 buy point of a flat base. The company beat profit expectations and raised its full-year guidance.

  

**Knightsbridge Tankers** ([VLCCF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLCCF)) cleared resistance near 14.50. Argentina-based **Banco Macro** ([BMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMA)) vaulted past the 32.76 buy point of a flat base. Both rose in active volume.

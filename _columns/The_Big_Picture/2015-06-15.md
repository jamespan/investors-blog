While stocks finished lower Monday, they showed resilience by closing well off the worst levels of the day. The Nasdaq ended 0.4% lower after falling as much as 1.3% intraday. It closed above its 50-day line, as well as well the 5000 level after breaching both key areas during the day. Solar and software stocks were areas of strength for the composite.

  

After falling 1% in the morning, the S&P 500 ended the day with a 0.5% loss. The index bounced back after nearly testing last Tuesday's low, keeping inside a recent trading range.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 took the least damage, losing 0.3%.

  

Equities stumbled early on news of a breakdown in talks between debt-ridden Greece and creditors. (See [story](http://news.investors.com/economy/061515-757345-financial-markets-increasingly-think-grexit-is-best-option.htm).)

  

Volume ended higher on both major exchanges from Friday's dull pace. The increase in trade along with losses in the main indexes marked a distribution day for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.

  

But considering the day's bounce, investors shouldn't give this distribution day too much weight. Both major indexes actually displayed positive action.

  

Another positive was the action in leading stocks. The IBD 50 rose 0.2%, thanks in part to a couple of cybersecurity stocks.

  

**Vasco Data Security International** ([VDSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDSI)) hit a multiyear high in nearly twice its average trade. The stock is up 13% since clearing a 28.27 buy point from a cup-with-handle base.

  

**CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) climbed back above a 69.10 buy point from a cup-with-handle base in more than twice its average trade. The stock slumped 10% below the 69.10 entry last week, marking a sell signal. But it also found support at its 10-week line.

  

In a sideways market, investors are prone to getting whipsawed. But it's fine to buy a stock once it clears a buy point again after triggering a sell signal.

  

**Papa Murphy's Holdings** ([FRSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRSH)) is not an IBD 50 stock, but the thinly traded issue blew past a 20.10 entry from a consolidation. Turnover was more than 3-1/2 times its average, showing solid demand.

  

While stocks partly dismissed Greek worries, attention now shifts to the Fed, which will meet Tuesday and Wednesday. Officials are expected to hold back from raising interest rates at this meeting, but a hike is expected in September. Fed fund futures at the CME Group currently signal a 26% chance of a rate increase at the September meeting.

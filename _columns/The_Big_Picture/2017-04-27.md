U.S. stock indexes notched small gains Thursday, while semiconductor-related issues scored big gains.


The Nasdaq rose 0.4%, hitting a new all-time high intraday, while the S&P 500 added 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat. Volume fell on the Nasdaq. NYSE volume was flat.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 gained strength throughout the session, which is a bullish sign.

Chip stocks scoring big gains included **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) which had a wild day. After reporting quarterly results late Wednesday, the stock fell 4% early Thursday and then reversed to a 3.5% gain for the day.


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) rose more than 1% in busy volume, marking its ninth consecutive up session. The chip giant reported quarterly results after the close, beating the Street's consensus number narrowly and revenue coming in just below views. Guidance was solid


However, Intel and several other chip-related plays fell sharply in after-hours trade.


**Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)), a chip equipment play, swept almost 8% higher in heavy volume. The midcap company supplies automation equipment for testing and industrial applications. Teradyne reported quarterly results. Earnings rose 42%, topping the Street's target by 16%. Revenue advanced 6%, topping consensus estimate by about 4%.


The day's biggest gainer among 197 industry groups was the mortgage group, largely because of two stocks that gapped up.


Online lender **LendingTree** ([TREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREE)) zoomed 13% higher in heavy volume despite an earnings miss. The small-cap company reported a 27% gain in earnings vs. views for a 36% gain. Revenue topped the Street's consensus number by about 6%.


**HFF** ([HF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HF)), a thinly traded small cap that provides commercial real estate services, broke out with an 11% gain in heavy volume. The company reported Q1 results late Wednesday. Earnings trounced views, 61% higher than expected. Revenue rose 18%.


The day's worst-performing group was oil and gas drillers. The group dropped 5% as the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil dropped closer to $49 a barrel.


Other stocks gapping up Thursday included online provider of takeout orders, **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)), internet search engine **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)), **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)).


Besides Intel, stocks reporting after the close included **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).

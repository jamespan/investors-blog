It was a tale of two stock markets Monday as blue chips lagged, but the Nasdaq composite turned in a day of outperformance with another new high, helped by strength in Nasdaq 100 names **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).




 Breadth has been strong recently as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have been able to overcome daunting signs of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in early February. Just look at the Nasdaq's advance/decline line, which shot into new high ground Monday.


The Nasdaq composite ended with a gain of nearly 0.4%, helped by new highs for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


The Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.6% and got turned away at the 50-day moving average, perhaps hurt by lingering trade-war concerns. The blue-chip index was weighed down by weakness in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), which ended with losses of 2% to 3%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP031218b-211x300.png)Dow component **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) fell just over 1% after the Wall Street Journal reported last Friday that the chip giant [could make a bid](https://www.investors.com/news/intel-could-hijack-qualcomm-takeover-by-buying-broadcom-wsj/) for **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), which is trying to buy **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) in a hostile takeover.


The S&P 500 eased 0.1%, with the 2800 level a potential resistance area to watch. Small caps eked out a modest gain, with the Russell 2000 up 0.3%. Volume on the Nasdaq came in slightly above Friday's level. NYSE volume fell. The Nasdaq's Feb. 21 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) was deleted because of gains the index has made since then, leaving the composite with just two distribution days.


The market uptrend resumed Friday thanks to bullish gains in higher volume for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, but if you've been paying attention in recent weeks, it's not hard for a negative headline to unleash a wave of selling. For this reason, half positions might be warranted for some new buys.


That means if you normally like to start off a position with a $10,000 investment, a $5,000 starter position might be warranted in some cases. Risk management is always paramount in the stock market, especially during times of heightened volatility.


Similar to Friday, more breakouts emerged Monday in lukewarm volume. In the chip space, **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) and **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) cleared buy points in soft trade. Among financials, **SEI Investments** ([SEIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEIC))and **Raymond James Financial** ([RJF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RJF)) topped buy points in weak turnover.


The exception was small-cap **HollySys Automation** ([HOLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOLI)), which jumped nearly 4% to 27.61 in fast trade. It's a more speculative name but still well within buy range from a buy point at 27.29.


Enterprise software names were mixed Monday after Mizuho hiked price targets on a number of stocks in the group. **Salesforce.com**'s ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) price target was raised to 160 from 140, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) to 190 from 160, **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) to 120 from 110, and **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)) to 270 from 250.


Elsewhere, **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) snapped back after falling 1% Friday in heavy volume. Shares jumped 9% to 59.37 in heavy volume. It cleared a 49.99 alternative entry last week after it had broken out of a double-bottom base with 47.08 entry. It is well-extended from both buy points. In fact, the gain has already hit 20%, which means investors who bought at those levels can think about taking profits.


**China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) turned in an impressive performance, reversing higher after a 2.8% intraday drop. It's finding support at the 50-day moving average as it works on a late-stage [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 161 buy point. China Lodging was featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/) column, which highlights potential earnings options trades each week.


Shares of **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), meanwhile, slumped 3% to 321.30 after [short-seller Citron Research said the stock was overvalued](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-pressured-by-short-seller-citron-after-huge-run-up/) and that shares could be shorted down to 300.


In merger news, **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)) jumped 4% on word that it's acquiring **Oclaro** ([OCLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OCLR)) for $1.8 billion in cash and stock. A Piper Jaffray analyst said "the combined entity will represent [the largest optical component company with expertise in a variety of sectors](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lumentum-to-buy-oclaro-is-industry-consolidation-on-horizon/)." Shares of Oclaro soared 27.5%.


The current week is busy in terms of [economic data](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). The latest reading from the consumer price index will be out Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Producer Price Index (wholesale prices) is due Wednesday along with February retail sales. Key manufacturing data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve and the Empire State manufacturing index will be out Thursday, with February housing starts and consumer confidence data due Friday.

Stocks battled to erase early losses Thursday, but couldn't avoid a finish in the red. The Nasdaq lost 0.4% after being down 1.7% in late morning trade. The S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The IBD 50 slid 0.9%. Volume rose on both major exchanges.

  

Bears slapped the major indexes with another distribution day, marking a total of five each and the fourth such violation in the past six sessions. Distribution involves a significant loss in rising volume, which is a sign of institutional selling. Such action is especially bad when it is clustered over a short period.

  

About a week ago, the Nasdaq tried and failed to retake its 50-day moving average. Since then, south has been the dominant direction.

  

A test of the August closing lows might be ahead for the Nasdaq. The index is about 5% above those closing lows now.

  

Such a test might be useful, potentially shaking out weak holders and clearing the way for a confident rebound.

  

With the uptrend under pressure, buying stocks carries considerable risk. This is clear from two factors: Breakouts are scarce and those that occur generally show weak follow-up action.

  

Most breakouts this month have faded after an initial thrust. Some tripped the 8% sell rule.

  

For example, **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) retook a 39.27 entry Sept. 15, but triggered the 8% sell rule Thursday. Building products maker **Apogee** ([APOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APOG)) broke past a 57.43 buy point in a double-bottom base Sept. 15, but tripped the 8% sell rule two sessions later.

  

Drugmaker **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) broke out a little more than a week ago and has since faded 4% under the entry. That's not enough to trigger a sell signal, but it is enough to make bulls cautious.

  

An exception to this trend is **B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS)), a dividend stock that broke out Sept. 3 on news that it was buying some businesses from **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)) and is 11.6% above a 32.77 buy point.

  

On Thursday, **Coca-Cola Bottling** ([COKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COKE)) broke out on news that it was acquiring bottling plants from **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)). The stock rammed 7% higher in volume 50% above average. The pattern, though, is late stage, and the stock is thin.

  

Economic news was mostly positive Thursday, but it didn't help the market much.

  

First-time jobless claims were fewer than expected, and new-home sales for August topped the highest estimate in the range.

  

Durable goods for August fell 2%, but matched views.

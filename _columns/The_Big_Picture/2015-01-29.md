Stocks Stage Bullish Reversal, But Indexes Still 'In The Box'
==============================================================

Stocks scrambled to a hard-fought win Thursday as the indexes battled back from morning losses.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rose 1% after being down 0.8% and 0.6% respectively.


The IBD 50 also added 1%.


Volume was little changed on both major exchanges.


Despite the generally positive action, the uptrend remains under pressure.


The market has been stuck in choppy, rangebound trade since Nov. 28, when the Nasdaq marked a fifth new high in a row. In the two months since then, neither the bulls nor the bears have found much encouragement from [the market's action](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today).


Thursday could serve as a microcosm for the past two months.


The major indexes overcame a jagged morning and then reversed and found traction. Weak starts and strong finishes are regarded as bullish. However, there also have plenty of negative reversals in recent weeks.


A choppy, indecisive market is difficult to play.


Take a look at the index charts at left. Draw two horizontal lines: One touching the S&P 500's 2079.47 and the second 1972.56. Or draw a line from the Nasdaq's 4810.86 and then its 4547.31 mark. The boxes you've sketched say it all. There's neither consistent nor sizable money to be made trading inside the box.


Until this market breaks out of the box, either on the upside or on the downside, an individual investor is wise to stay cautious.


Stocks can be bought, sold or held where appropriate, but expectations should be reined in.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, homebuilders and airlines were among the strongest performers for the day. On the downside, oil drillers and gold miners took the hardest hits.


Sector leadership remains somewhat defensive, with tobacco and utilities riding high. However, the chip sector has stayed near the top and retail has risen.


In economic news Thursday, first-time jobless claims came in about 12% lower than expected. However, pending home sales of existing homes for December fell far short of the consensus view. The Street expected a 0.9% rise but got a 3.7% decline.

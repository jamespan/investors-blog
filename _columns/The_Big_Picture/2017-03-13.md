Another merger in the semiconductor space didn't stir much excitement in the stock market Monday ahead of a busy week of economic data and the two-day Fed meeting, where an interest-rate hike is widely expected.


Money flowed out of bonds again Monday, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield up 5 basis points to 2.63%. But it didn't exactly flow into stocks, as major stock indexes ended mixed and mostly unchanged.


The Nasdaq composite added 0.2%, the S&P 500 rose fractionally and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1%. The Russell 2000 gained 0.4%, but the small-cap index is still below the 50-day moving average after giving up that support level last week.


Breadth was OK on the NYSE and Nasdaq as advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both by about 3-to-2.  Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in 10% lower than Friday's levels.

Intel has been lagging pretty badly after a breakout attempt in January over a 37.44 buy point. Shares fell 2% Monday to 35.16. Shares of Mobileye, the maker of autonomous-vehicle technology, surged 28%, helping the IBD 50 outperform with a 1% gain.


But strength in chip stocks was offset by weakness in retail stocks, particularly department store operators, which remain in lengthy downtrends. Homebuilders and airlines also lagged.


Homebuilding stocks haven't been hurt by the outlook for higher interest rates, which is telling. The group on Friday marked its six weekly gain in the past seven weeks. Perhaps it's because the Fed has stated repeatedly that rate increases will be at a measured pace so as not to disrupt housing demand and the overall economic recovery.


Back to the 10-year yield, it's at its highest level since Sept. 2014, perhaps in anticipation of more hawkishness from the Fed Wednesday.


What would a breakout in the 10-year Treasury yield mean for the stock market? It remains to be seen, but rising interest rates aren't necessarily a bad thing. Rising rates tend to go along with an improving economy, and that certainly has been the case lately, especially after Friday's better than expected jobs report.


An improving economy with contained inflation, which the Fed is expecting, is generally a good environment for stocks. And if money is flowing out of bonds, causing yields to rise, it has to go somewhere. Both scenarios fit well with the bull thesis.


Not only does the two-day Fed meeting conclude Wednesday, but it's a busy week of economic data, with reports due on wholesale and consumer inflation, retail sales, manufacturing, housing starts and consumer confidence.


For now, the Fed is optimistic about a continued recovery, although its economic growth projections are calling for tepid growth of around 2% for the next couple of years.


But what if the sharp rise in the 10-year Treasury yield over the past two weeks is the market's way of saying that inflation could be hotter than expected in coming months? If this scenario plays out, it could force the Fed's hand to raise rates quicker, which could cause problems for the stock market.


In the end, watch daily price and volume in the major stock indexes and the action in leading growth stocks. The distribution-day count remains contained — good news for the bulls. But it is getting harder and harder to find stocks to buy. The market has been running higher for some time now, resulting in a lot of extended stocks.


Some names continue to set up in the chip space, but with several big breakouts already in the sector, one has to wonder if the true leadership has already been established.


**Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) is near the top of a flat base with a 91.86 buy point, but it's a later-stage base. Meanwhile, an Accumulation/Distribution of D and up/down volume ratio of 0.9 indicate sluggish demand for shares.


After four straight low-volume gains, Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) tried to clear an 867.10 buy point Monday, but volume was weak.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) added 1.7% to 105.18 in strong volume after Yahoo detailed plans for a holding company to account for its Alibaba stake. It's been trading near a 104.67 cup-with-handle buy point for several weeks but on Monday made a strong move above it.


Small-cap new issue **SiteOne Landscape** ([SITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SITE)) rallied 1.5% to 40.67 ahead of its earnings report Wednesday before the open. It's working on an odd-shaped base with a 41.07 buy point.

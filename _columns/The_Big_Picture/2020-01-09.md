The stock market hit more record highs Thursday as it looks to put the U.S.-Iran conflict in the rearview mirror. Midday, the major stock indexes sharply pared their gains after [reports surfaced](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-crash-caused-russian-made-iranian-anti-aircraft-missile/) suggesting the Ukrainian Boeing 737 jet in Tehran was shot down by an Iranian missile.




President Donald Trump commented that "something very terrible happened" and doesn't believe the crash was the result of mechanical failure.


But the major stock indexes soon recovered from those headlines, closing near their session highs. The Nasdaq composite closed with a 0.8% gain, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 211 points, or 0.7%. The S&P 500 ended the session with a 0.7% advance. The Dow rose on the back of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL))'s 2.1% advance. All three major indexes hit all-time highs. Volume was mixed: It was modestly higher on the Nasdaq while preliminary data showed slightly lower trade on the NYSE.


Stock Market Rally Hits More Highs
----------------------------------


The Ukrainian crash news came a day after a crisis that threatened war between the U.S. and Iran quickly de-escalated. Stocks have recovered from those worries.


With the major stock indexes recording all-time highs Thursday, the current [stock market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) continues on track. The Nasdaq is already up 2.6% in the first six trading sessions of the new year. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively, in 2020.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP010920-252x300.jpg)On Wednesday, the S&P 500's Dec. 2 distribution day [fell off the count](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-breathes-relief-iran-strike-sp500-nasdaq-hit-new-highs/) due to time. (After 25 trading sessions, distribution days are considered no longer relevant to the current stock market action.)


Amid light institutional selling, investors should feel free to remain on the offensive. However, be sure to follow trading rules. Take at least some profits in stocks that rise 20%-25% from the correct buy point to lock in gains on the upside.


IBD 50: Align Technology Jumps 3.7%
-----------------------------------


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), one of numerous IBD screens of top growth stocks, rallied 1%. The IBD 50-linked [Innovator IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/ibd-indexes/ibd-etf-indexes-ibd-50-etf-leaders-breakout-stocks-etf-ffty-ldrs-bout/) ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is breaking out past a 35.52 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Among IBD 50 stocks, **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) was the top winner with a nearly 4% advance. Align stock followed through on the Jan. 2 breakout above a 281.67 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a deep cup with handle. A flaw is the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/): It is well off its 52-week high, but is hitting a short-term high.


On the downside, FANG stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) was one of the biggest losers, falling more than 1%. Shares are trying to break out past a new buy point at 338.10, as a result of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). Netflix stock closed below the buy point, at 335.66. Similar to Align, the RS line is lagging. It is well off its 52-week high.


3 Top Stocks To Watch: Costco, StoneCo, Vertex
----------------------------------------------



Top stocks to watch include today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/costco-stock-offers-two-buying-opportunities/), **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), as well as [IPO stock leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-warren-buffett-stoneco-stock-buy-point/) **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)).


Costco shares moved up 1.6% Thursday after the company reported strong holiday sales figures late Wednesday. The stock is approaching a 307.20 buy point in a flat base, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The retail stock leader is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) member.


StoneCo looked to reclaim an alternate 41.98 buy point Thursday. At the day's 43.32 peak price, the Brazilian payment processor gained nearly 3.5%. Shares almost gave up the entirety of the day's gains, closing at 41.88 and back below the entry.


Meanwhile, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is pulling back to a 225.76 buy point in a [four-weeks-tight formation](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/vrtx-stock-breaks-out-riding-wave-carrying-biotech-stocks/). The top biotech stock trimmed losses to 0.4% and is holding about 2% above the entry in the wake of Wednesday's breakout. The RS line is nearing new highs. Vertex also found support at the 10-week moving average, a different type of entry.

Investors were not in a buying mood Monday; instead, the market suffered a bout of moderate selling. The Nasdaq gave up 0.4%, closing near the lows of the day. But the index again found support near 5100 and continued the mostly sideways movement seen for more than a week.


The S&P 500 fell 0.5% after giving up a 0.2% at the open. Reports of slightly lower sales at brick-and-mortar retailers over Thanksgiving and Black Friday weighed on the benchmark index. Four of the day's 10 worst-performing industry groups were from the retail space.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average and the small-cap Russell 2000 each gave up 0.4%. The latter ended a five-session win streak.

Those off around 2% or more in above-average trade included **Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)), **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)), **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)). Ulta reports Q3 results after Thursday's close.


Volume was obviously higher on both major exchanges Monday compared with Friday's abbreviated session. The increase in trade along with the losses of 0.2% or more in the major indexes made for an easy distribution day. Monday's turnover was also higher compared to Wednesday's session.


Breadth was negative, but not too bad. Losers beat winners by about 9-to-7 on the NYSE and about 9-to-8 on the Nasdaq.


The stock market digested a couple of uninspiring economic reports. Factory activity in the Chicago area contracted and pending home sales rose much less than expected in October.


Monday's weakness may be due to nervousness ahead of other key reports. The ISM manufacturing survey will be out Tuesday and the all-important monthly jobs report will be out Friday.


Also, a barrage of Fed officials are due to speak every day of the week, starting Tuesday. Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be speaking Wednesday and Thursday. All this will come before the last Fed meeting of the year in two weeks, when central bankers are expected to raise interest rates from record low levels set during the hard times in late 2008.

Monday marked the end of a volatile month of November, when the Nasdaq and S&P 500 gained 1.1% and 0.1%, respectively.

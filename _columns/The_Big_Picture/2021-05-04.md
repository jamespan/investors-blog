After selling off Tuesday, the stock market suddenly finds itself in a tight spot, with the major indexes falling to key support levels.




After reaching record highs last week, the stock market is back to its diverging ways, with technology and growth underperforming while value and cyclical indexes hold up better.


The Nasdaq, which is half weighted with technology shares, sold off 1.9% Tuesday. The composite dropped as much as 2.9% before it pared losses. The composite was left testing its 50-day moving average. The [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), where the Nasdaq found support in April, provided no such relief this time. The composite closed 1.5% below it.


The S&P 500 got some help from industrial, financial and energy stocks. It closed 0.7% lower and in the upper third of the day's price range. It is now testing the 21-day line, and Tuesday's partial afternoon recovery served as a positive sign for a continued rebound.

The Dow continues to hold above its 21-day line. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 1.3% and is also testing its 50-day line.


Change In Stock Market Outlook
------------------------------


Volume surged 25% on the Nasdaq and also rose on the NYSE, adding a fourth distribution day to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past few weeks. That — plus the fast deflation in the Nasdaq — caused IBD to lower its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure."


This means investors need to change their investing strategy. Be more picky buying stocks, and curtail adding to existing holdings. Taking some profits is smart, too. Margin should be avoided. Above all, be sure to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% below the purchase price. Stocks faltering at new buy points could be sold even with a 3% loss.


The stock market was already soft Tuesday around midday, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen rattled Wall Street. The Federal Reserve, she said, may be forced to raise interest rates to keep the U.S. economic recovery from getting too hot.


"It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat," Yellen said at an economic summit. President Joe Biden has proposed trillions of dollars in new spending programs, while the economy rebounds swiftly from the pandemic.


The benchmark yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose on the Yellen headlines, but still traded modestly lower from Monday's levels, at around 1.59% late Tuesday.


Stock Market Sensitive To Interest Rates
----------------------------------------


The stock market sell-off reflected how sensitive investors are to interest rates. Earlier this year, inflation worries sparked selling in stocks, and Yellen's remarks Tuesday fanned those fears.



Banking and financials stocks rose on the prospect of higher yields, even if Treasury yields hardly moved. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) was one of the best-performing sector ETFs Tuesday, up 1.6%. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) reversed higher and made an all-time high.


Several regional bank stocks topped buy points. **Bancorp** ([TBBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBBK)) gapped above the 24.62 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) in heavy volume following the bank's earnings. **Citizens Financial Group** ([CFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFG)) broke out of a flat base, but volume was light.


The bank sector helps this stock market from being a total mess. Cyclical and value stocks also offer some investing opportunities. Steel producers **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) and **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) are heading to new highs. **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) added to new highs. The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) rose 0.1%.


The S&P Materials sector rose more than 1%, while the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLI)) added 0.4%. Health care and energy sectors rose modestly.


Homebuilders continue to laugh off the market's weakness. **Beazer Homes** ([BZH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZH)), **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) and **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)), which is in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), are stars in a hot industry.

  Stock Market Shrugs Off Disappointing Economic Data; Facebook, Lam, PayPal Tumble On Earnings

The stock market shrugged off disappointing economic data to notch modest gains Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 set record highs. Some top growth stocks suffered setbacks Thursday, as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Lam** **Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) stumbled on earnings.




On the upside, chip giant **Advanced** **Micro** **Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) followed through on Wednesday's breakout.


Early Thursday, the Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy grew at a 6.5% annualized rate in the second quarter, missing the consensus estimate for 8% growth.


[Economists expect growth](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-gdp-economic-growth-first-quarter-2021-11627508180?mod=hp_lead_pos3&mod=hp_lead_pos1) to remain strong, fueled by job gains, pent-up spending and continued fiscal support. Still, many say growth likely peaked in the second quarter, vs. weak 2020 comparisons, and will cool as the initial boost from reopenings and fiscal stimulus fades.


![MP072921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP072921-226x300.jpg)The Nasdaq cut gains to just 0.1%, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.7%.


Leading growth stocks ended with modest gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.4% Thursday but well off session highs. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) surged 5.5%, breaking out past a 24.87 buy point. But shares closed just below the new entry. The 5% buy range goes up to 26.11.


Volume dropped on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The Nasdaq added to Wednesday's solid action with modest gains and is just shy of last week's record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 hit new highs Thursday, after two straight days of minor losses.


Keep in mind that the [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remains at an elevated level. The S&P 500 has six distribution days, while the Nasdaq's count remains at four. With a confirmed uptrend, investors have the green light to buy strong breakout moves. But investors should be cautious during earnings season. Less-than-impressive results or weak guidance can send shares tumbling.

Facebook, Lam, PayPal Tumble On Earnings
----------------------------------------



How top stocks handle earnings season can help you determine the strength of market uptrend. Top growth stocks Facebook, Lam Research and PayPal all tumbled on earnings results. But **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) and **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) both surged past new buy points.


Social media giant Facebook [reported strong Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-at-high-ahead-of-earnings/), but warned of slowing revenue growth. The stock declined 4% Thursday. During the third and fourth quarters of 2021, Facebook said, "We expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth." Facebook also warned of a significant deceleration in revenue growth when it posted first-quarter results.


Lam Research slid 2.4% Thursday even though the [company topped analyst estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lrcx-stock-lam-research-tops-june-quarter-targets/) for the June quarter and guided higher. Shares fell further under their 50-day line, but they continue to trace a flat base with a 673.90 buy point. The stock's RS line is starting to deteriorate, indicating worsening performance vs. the broad market.


PayPal tumbled 6.2% after [missing Q2 revenue targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-paypal-earnings-q22021/) and reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 revenue guidance. Shares gave up their 296.11 buy point and are now testing the 50-day line.


On the upside, Align Technology surged 8.9%, ending out of the 5% buy zone above a 629.45 buy point in a cup with handle. Align [reported strong results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/algn-stock-align-technology-earnings-q2-2021/) late Thursday. Tempur Sealy soared over 15% on [better-than-expected Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/tpx-stock-tempur-sealy-earnings-q2-2021/). Shares recaptured a 41.14 entry in a flat base and are now extended.

Breakout Stocks: AMD, Roku
--------------------------


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Advanced Micro Devices surged out of a buy range Thursday, rallying over 5% to close at 102.95. Shares broke out Wednesday following the company's strong Q2 earnings results, moving above a 95.54 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), according to [IBD MarketSmith chart analysis.](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)


[IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/leaderboard-10-year/) stock **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) fell below its double-bottom with handle's 463.09 buy point. Shares closed down 4%. According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Roku stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-roku-inc-cl-a-roku.aspx) shows a solid 93 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).


Following last Friday's breakout move, shares have been unable to add to those gains. Earnings are due out Wednesday after the close, offering a reason for current investors to be more defensive.


Amazon Earnings
---------------


Late Thursday, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) reported [weaker-than-expected Q2 sales results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-on-watch-with-quarterly-earnings-due/). Amazon shares slid about 5% in extended trade.


The stock closed Thursday in the 5% buy area from a 3,524.96 buy point in a cup with handle following a July 6 breakout.

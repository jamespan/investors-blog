These Sectors Are Fueling Nasdaq's Run To A New High
=====================================================

The Nasdaq composite extended its win streak to eight days, the highlight of an otherwise muted stock market Tuesday. Nonetheless, the session saw good action from leading stocks.




The composite rose 0.5% after erasing early losses, and also made a record high at 3:30 p.m. ET, eclipsing the June 9 peak of 6341.69.


The S&P 500 rallied into the close, but ended with a gain of less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 is still looking to add to Friday's new high. It certainly doesn't want to repeat what happened last time it made a new high: It took about four weeks for the S&P to make another new high.


The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 0.3%, a loss that rested mainly on the shoulders of **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)). The investment bank cost the price-weighted index some points Tuesday, after Goldman shed 2.6% in nearly double its average volume.


The company's Q2 results beat expectations, but its results added doubts about trading revenue and net interest margin for the banking industry. Still, Goldman Sachs remained above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages as it continues to develop a smooth-looking base so far.

Often, the first few major companies to announce serve as a bellwether for the rest of the sector. Thus, a big surprise in one company can spill over to its peers. So investors have to be guarded not just with their own holdings but other relevant names.


The Russell 2000 fell 0.3%. The small-cap benchmark lagged, just one day after it inched its way to a new high. The index does not seem quite ready to snap out of its funk.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Nasdaq breadth was weaker than its gain would suggest: Losers led winners by 9-to-7. NYSE losers narrowly led winners.


As the Nasdaq reached a record high, it also broke a brief pattern of lower lows and lower highs. Technically, that puts the composite in better footing as the major indexes try to extend an already productive 2017 for equities.


The Nasdaq is up nearly 18% for the year, and the S&P 500 almost 10%. The indexes have made those gains despite a low-volatility environment and lagging performance by small and midcap stocks.


Throughout those conditions, there have been various sectors that have emerged as leaders. Today, Chinese companies, fiber optics and semiconductors are some areas to probe for potential winners. Much of that bloc benefits the Nasdaq, which is nearly 45% tech stocks.



The superior end of Tuesday's performance was consumer-heavy, with leisure, retail and mortgage groups leading. The movies group was No. 1 thanks to **Netflix**'s ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) stellar gap, which sent its shares soaring 13.5% to 183.60, into an all-time high and out of a flat base.


Netflix joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) as the ninth member early Tuesday after spending a brief time on the premium service's watch list.


Still, apparel and department store chains were down in the dumps. Homebuilders were broadly weaker also, with the average stock in the group down 2.4%. **MDC Holding** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)) is faltering, with shares about 1% below the 36.09 buy point three weeks after the breakout. The [July housing market index](http://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) from the National Association of Home Builders was 64, below forecasts for 68, Econoday said.


Internet, solar, chip equipment and fiber optics also led and helped Nasdaq outperform. Nasdaq-listed **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) (up 2%) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) (up 1.4%) hit record highs while Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) added 1%, showing that the FANG quartet is far from finished.


Leading stocks in general outperformed. The IBD 50 climbed 0.6%.

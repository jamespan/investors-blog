  Stock Market Battered As Inflation Hits New High; Investors Go For Gold

The stock market had its clock cleaned as inflation data came in worse than feared Friday. Many investors attempted to flee to safety as hopes of a slowdown in ballooning prices failed to materialize.




Moves were heavily skewed to the downside. The Nasdaq was the index that suffered the most, dropping 3.5%. Its weekly loss came in at 5.6%, sending it back near lows for the year.


The S&P 500 also had a tough time, falling 2.9% Friday. It is now back below all its moving averages after it ended the week down 5%.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was telling, with every single one ending the day negative. Consumer discretionary and technology were the worst performers. The defensive utilities and consumer staples areas held up best.


While the Dow fared a bit better in percentage down, it closed down 880 points, or 2.7%. Chemicals play **Dow Inc.** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) and banking giant **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) were the worst laggards here.


Small Caps Suffer; Market Outlook Changes
-----------------------------------------


Small caps were also viciously mauled by the bears, with the Russell 2000 dipping 2.7%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ended the day down 2.5%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP061022-300x269.jpg)The gloomy action saw IBD's market outlook change once again, this time to "market in correction." Now is the time to be cutting one's exposure to stocks.


The lone crumb of comfort is the fact the market did not hit new lows, though it could easily test them next week. All gains from the May 26 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) are gone.


Inflation Surge Hits Sentiment
------------------------------


Stocks were given a severe spanking after the consumer price index came in at levels [last seen in December 1981](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-shock-new-40-year-high-dow-jones-futures-fall/).


Sentiment suffered after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a year-over-year increase of 8.6% in consumer prices May. This was above the Econoday consensus for an 8.2% increase. It was also higher than April's 8.3% rise, dealing a blow to the thesis that inflation had peaked.


Stifel Nicolaus chief economist Lindsey Piegza said in a note to clients that such hopes appear "to be unfounded, or at the very least premature."


With energy and the cost of shelter making up a major part of the weighting, the path ahead remains challenging for the CPI.


Some analysts are now predicting the Fed will hike rates by as much as 0.75% next week. Both Barclays economist Jonathan Millar and Jefferies economist Aneta Markowska made this call.


This would be a shock because Fed members had previously floated the idea of two more 50-basis point rate rises over the summer.

Investors Go For Gold; These Other Areas Shine
----------------------------------------------


Industry group activity was telling on Friday. The areas that fared best were all defensive in nature.



It was a good day for gold, silver and gemstone miners and confectionary makers. Outpatient medical plays and drugstores also squeezed out gains.


**Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) ended the day with a solid 4.7% gain, punching above the [200-day line in the process](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/). Among ETFs, the SPDR Gold Trust ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) ended the session up 1.3%.


Travel booking stocks, plastics makers, desktop software firms and casinos were among the areas that suffered most.

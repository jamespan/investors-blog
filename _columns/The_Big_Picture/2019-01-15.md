  Major Indexes Reap More Upside, But Stock Market Needs More Of This

Perhaps you've seen or heard the Home Depot ad that uses catchphrases such as "more doing," "more saving," and so forth. When the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, think along the same lines.




You want to see more indexes and industry sectors participating in the upside. More growth stocks [constructing bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). More [stocks making new highs](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/). And, of course, more stocks [breaking out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Wall Street has been embracing this "more" theme.


But as for breakouts, IBD readers will need more patience. This is fine. A mere seven trading sessions have passed since a [follow-through rally](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) took place on Jan. 4 — the first "news" that a tradable rally may be underway.


It can take weeks, even months, for a market uptrend to really gain traction.


FANG Stocks Are Jamming So Far, But This Hasn't Happened
--------------------------------------------------------


On Tuesday, the major indexes did a pretty good job of clearing more rubble away from the wealth destruction caused by the late 2018 sell-off. [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) and leaders in the computer, internet, consumer and medical sectors helped the Nasdaq composite push 1.7% higher. That big advance plowed away losses of 0.2% and 0.9% in the prior two sessions.


The Nasdaq also closed above its 50-day moving average for the first time since Oct. 3.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MP011519-255x300.jpg)The Nasdaq 100 rallied 2%. It too crossed above the 50-day line, following what the Philadelphia semiconductor index (often called the SOX) had done on Jan. 9.


It's worth reiterating how strongly most big-cap techs have rebounded so far in 2019.


Among the four FANG plays, the average year-to-date gain of 15.3% pounds the advances of 5.8% by the Nasdaq composite and 4.2% by the S&P 500. Yet none of the FANGs are in breakout mode yet.


Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is up 4% year to date. Good news: Alphabet is rising nicely above its 50-day moving average, which is showing signs of leveling out. But Alphabet is still nearly 40 points underneath the long-term 200-day line.



The S&P 500 gained 1.1% on Tuesday. The Russell 2000 advanced 0.8%, and the S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.6%. Volume grew nearly 6% on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, a sign that institutions are hungry to accumulate shares.


On the NYSE, composite turnover fell slightly, despite another big boost in volume in the shares of Californian utility **PG&E** ([PCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCG)), which announced it's planning to file for bankruptcy. The utility faces huge potential liabilities related to devastating wildfires destroying the city of Paradise, Calif., late last year.


PG&E shares hit a new multi-decade low of 5.07 on Tuesday. That's 93% below a September 2017 peak of 71.57.


Stock Market Internals: More Favorable
--------------------------------------


Check out the NYSE advance-decline line, found within the large daily chart of the S&P 500 in the General Market Indicators PDF at the bottom of every Big Picture column, as well as in IBD Weekly. The NYSE A-D line has risen for three straight weeks. Ditto for the Nasdaq's advance-decline line, which is not shown on the big charts PDF.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has yet to record a down day in above-average volume in 2019. The Nasdaq has seen just one decline in above-average trade, namely the **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL))-inspired 3% sell-off on Jan. 3.


So overall, it's in sharp contrast to the selling bloodbath witnessed in December.


Keep An Eye On The Financials
-----------------------------


A small miss by **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) on the [bottom line](https://www.investors.com/news/jpmorgan-earnings-q4-jpmorgan-stock-wells-fargo-earnings/) in the fourth quarter and the largely expected defeat of a Brexit package proposed by British Prime Minister Theresa May did not thwart the bulls. In fact, bull markets have a habit of brushing off negative news.



These days see no shortage of worries for investors. The federal government shutdown, a flattening of the yield curve in U.S. Treasuries, lingering fear that the Federal Reserve may go too far in raising the cost of money, and a slowdown in China's and Germany's economies provide some proverbial bricks that form a continual wall of worry.


The media have hyped up concerns that portions of the Treasury yield curve, mainly between the one- and five-year bonds, showed a reversion. But market research has found that it can take many months before a recession could hit the economy. Judging by the strength in shares of JPMorgan and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) following their latest quarterly results, the market seems to be more confident in the U.S. economy going forward.


"There seems to be technical reasons for the inversion between the two-year and five-year Treasury bonds," Rich Sega, chief investment strategist at the global asset management firm Conning, told IBD. Sega thinks some investors likely engaged in offsetting some credit hedging trades to remain duration-neutral.


He says to focus instead on the spread between much more liquid debt such as one- and three-month T-bills and the 10-year Treasury note, which finished Tuesday at 2.72%, up 6 basis points year to date. The spread between three-month T-bills and 10-year notes is currently at 27 basis points. That's thin, but it still can lead to more lending and the global carry trade, Sega adds. He also does not expect the U.S. central bank to embark on an aggressive path of monetary tightening, saying "their actions may not be as negative as their rhetoric."


A Raft Of Bank Earnings
-----------------------


JPMorgan suffered from lackluster fixed-income trading results. "Markets and investor services" revenue slipped 11%. But the Wall Street giant also saw nice numbers in many other parts of its gigantic business. Average core loans, excluding those used in investment banking, expanded 6%. Credit card sales volume jumped 10%, with debit card volume up 11%.


Watch for more quarterly results later this week by **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) (earnings seen rising 34% to 63 cents a share)  and **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)) (EPS estimate 92 cents, up 19%), both on Wednesday.


Besides these money-center banks, superregionals **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)), **KeyCorp** ([KEYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYC)) and **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)) are also set to dish out results this week. (See the [entire earnings calendar at Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/).)



The market is in fact seeing more growth stocks working on [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), including data analytics leader **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)), marketing software innovator **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) and **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) in the software and medical fields.


Incyte became the newest member on [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).


Vertex recently rejoined the Leaders list on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), advertising platform **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), and **Fox Factory** ([FOXF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXF)) represent budding strength and breakout potential within the retail and consumer spending areas of the economy.


How Will Breakouts Fare In January?
-----------------------------------


With few breakouts occurring right now, few failures are also taking place so far. Yet **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) dove back into its base after a tentative [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past 72.10. A 9% fall from that [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) meant that a new holder should [cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). That's [the golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


For now, the chicken-wing chain remains above its rising 50-day moving average.

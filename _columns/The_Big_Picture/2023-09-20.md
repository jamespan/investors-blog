  Stock Market Grows More Bearish After Fed Decision

The stock market expressed a meaningful ouch to the Federal Reserve's latest announcement to leave interest rates unchanged. As a result, the market's outlook is more bearish.




The sell-off appeared to be tied to a growing expectation that the U.S. central bank will not only keep the cost of money at a higher level longer than originally thought. Investors also apparently showed disappointment at the [dimming possibility that the Fed will sharply cut rates next year](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cut-hopes-dim-as-hawks-take-over-sp-500-slips/) — if the economy falls into recession.


The bond market did not move much, ironically. By day's end, with the fed funds rate standing pat at a 5.25%-5.5% target range, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in fact edged down by 1 basis point to 4.34%.


Still, the announcement and the later Q&A session that Fed Chair Jerome Powell held with the media spurred investors to stuff their portfolios with more cash.


"The Fed's projections did show less rate cuts in 2024, which gives the Fed more optionality to keep policy rates higher for longer should the economy fail to materially slow," Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said in a note emailed to IBD.


Stock Market Today: Key Indexes Sink
------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.5% and closed just 2 points above its session low of 13,467. At one point, it held a 0.4% intraday gain before the Fed news.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP092023-273x300.jpg)The S&P 500 sank 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell only 0.2%. Gains of 3 points or more by a trio of beaten-down names — including health care plays **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) — offset losses of 2 points or more in at least seven of the index's 30 components. Amgen, up 4% for the week, is breaking out of a 10-month cup with handle with a 268.24 buy point.


Volume grew on the Nasdaq vs. Tuesday and fell on the NYSE. This resulted in a [fifth distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq, or heavy institutional selling session, over the past 25 trading days. The average size of the drop among these five sell-offs? Quite heavy at 1%, including the Aug. 31 stalling day.


Also, the overall technical action has turned ugly since the stock market initiated a new rally attempt in mid-August.


On Aug. 29, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied well enough to produce a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-powers-higher-on-jolts-data-unlocks-this-key-shift-apple-stock/). As longtime IBD readers know, the [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) offers the earliest signal that a genuine stock market bottom has set in. However, IBD research also finds that not all follow-through days work out.



Head-fake rallies do emerge, and they will appear in the future as well. After all, the market is not only driven by fundamentals. Greed, fear, hope and despair also drive changes in stock prices.


On that follow-through day, the S&P 500 finished the session at 4497.63. On Wednesday, the large-cap benchmark not only finished below the Aug. 29 close, it also ducked below that session's low of 4431.68.

Investment Status Change
------------------------


[Research by IBD Market School](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/market/marketschool) has found that when a major stock market index undercuts the low of a follow-through day, it's almost certain to take out the low of the current rally attempt as well. In other words, chances are very high that stocks will inevitably breach the recent correction low.


For the S&P 500, the Aug. 18 low of 4335.31 will be a technical level to monitor. The S&P 500 closed Wednesday at 4402.20, just 1.5% above that Aug. 18 low.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq also slumped below its Aug. 29 follow-through day low of 13,677.06. At Wednesday's close of 13,469.13, the tech-reinforced index would only need to fall an additional 2.3% to take out its Aug. 18 near-term low of 13,161.76.


Given this new sell-off, plus the lack of convincing breakouts made by leading growth stocks lately, it makes sense to downgrade IBD's current outlook for the stock market to "correction" from "uptrend under pressure." The outlook changed to the latter status on Sept. 7. (With the market in a downtrend, the number of distribution days is not included in the Market Pulse.)


Also, IBD recently introduced a specific percentage-based guideline for how much capital investors should deploy into stocks within their portfolios. Given Wednesday's outlook change, IBD now cuts such guidance to a 0%-20% range, down from 20%-40%.


Amid a correction, investors should not make new buys. Instead, raising cash by locking in gains and cutting losses carries paramount importance.



Top growth stocks including trendy cosmetics and skin care products firm **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) and enterprise software giant **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) need to be monitored closely. The former has sharply undercut its 10-week moving average after bouncing from the line multiple times, triggering [a sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/). The latter still trades on the north side of its 10-week line, a good sign for now.


Size Of The Stock Market Correction
-----------------------------------


Indeed, in terms of the indexes' action, the pullback has been relatively mild for the Nasdaq composite (now at 6.8% off the 14,446.55 high) and the S&P 500 (off 4.5% from its 4607.07 peak). However, both of these indexes are market cap weighted. The surprising strength of the megacap techs, dubbed the Magnificent Seven, has a lot to do with this.


For another view of how the stock market is really doing, check out an equal-weighted view of the key indexes.


The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund fell just 0.5% on Wednesday. However, it also slid below the long-term 200-day moving average and posted the lowest close since June 26. RSP has seen its year-to-date gain shrink to a dull 3.1%. That's a whole lot less than what 10-year U.S. bonds yield, of course.


Meanwhile, small-cap stocks have gotten punched harder.

Near An Intermediate-Level Correction
-------------------------------------



The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fell 1% on Wednesday. That yanked the popular small-cap index fund 9.5% below its July 31 peak. IWM shows a middling 53 Relative Strength Rating. Its relative strength line has been sinking fast for six straight weeks.


Such action among small caps implies that investors are fearing the potential consequences that the higher cost of money may have on these companies' ability to grow sales and profits.


At 4.34%, the 10-year yield has climbed from 3.81% at the start of the third quarter. Meanwhile, two-year Treasury bond yields have gone up from 4.87% to 5.12% over the same time frame.


Plus, the stance by the Fed on the economy, interest rates and inflation can obviously have a serious impact on both the short- and long-term direction of the stock market.


Exactly one year ago, the Fed raised the fed funds rate by three quarters of 1 point to a target range of 3.75%-4%. And the U.S. central bank signaled to the stock market that more increases to the cost of money "will be appropriate." On Sept. 21, 2022, the Nasdaq responded by reversing morning gains to a 1.7% loss. The composite index also suffered a 3.7% drubbing over the next five sessions.

"Although the Fed appears to be taking the optimistic view that recession may be avoided, the full impact of rate hikes takes time to permeate into the real economy," Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, said in a note emailed to IBD. "As a result, higher rates and tightening credit conditions still put the U.S. economy at elevated risk of recession into late 2023 and early 2024."

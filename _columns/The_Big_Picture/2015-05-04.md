Stocks kicked off the week in dull fashion, but for the bulls, dull is perfectly fine.

  

The Nasdaq gapped up and rose 0.8% early, helped by strong earnings from **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)), but gave back early gains. It closed 0.2% higher. The S&P 500 added 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks rallied 0.4%.

  

Advancing stocks had a slight edge over decliners on both major exchanges.

  

Price action in the IBD 50 was better as 11 names rose 2% or more. After a tough last week, the index of leading growth stocks outperformed, rising 0.5%.

  

IBD 50 component and IBD Sector Leader **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) jumped nearly 5% in strong volume ahead of its earnings report Wednesday before the open.

  

Despite its volatile nature and iffy chart, the China-based auto website has several positive straits. For starters, it's a new issue, which means the company is still in the early stages of growth. Second, the company shows explosive earnings and sales growth in recent quarters.

  

Autohome was one of the top percentage gainers in the IBD 50 Monday, along with **Taser** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) and **Macom Technology** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)).

  

It's been a difficult earnings season for growth stocks in general. Some have responded positively, but plenty of others haven't. After the close, **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), an emerging leader in IBD's security software industry group, plunged 27% on a revenue miss and weak outlook.

  

So what's the best way to handle a growth stock ahead of earnings? Consider **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) which reports Thursday after the close.

  

Investors who bought Monster when it cleared a flat base in October are sitting on a nice profit. Some might choose to lock in partial profits before the report, while others might decide to ride earnings out.

  

For those who bought recently, though, it's a different story. As of Monday's close, Monster was 1.5% below a 144 buy point cleared April 27. Again, some might choose to sell half the position before earnings. More risk-averse investors might choose to cut ties with the stock entirely, especially in light of how many higher-multiple stocks have been responding poorly to earnings lately.

  

An early breakout looked good for a while Monday but faded. **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)) gapped out of a flat base with a 64.79 buy point but ended well below the entry. Shares still rose 6% on positive results.

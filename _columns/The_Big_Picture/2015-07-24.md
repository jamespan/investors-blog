Stocks staggered lower Friday as the indexes notched a fourth straight down day. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each tripped 1.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.9%. The IBD 50 matched the major indexes with a 1.1% slide.


Volume rose slightly on the NYSE and fell narrowly on the Nasdaq.


A cluster of distribution days during the week brought the pressure label back to the uptrend.


The S&P 500 knifed under its 50-day moving average and closed near the low of the day. The big-cap index's components suffered a torrent of outsized losses. According to preliminary data, 90 stocks in the S&P 500 logged a loss of 2.5% or more.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq closed low in the day's range but just above its own 50-day line.


Overall, the market appears to be repeating a familiar pattern: U-turns after short sprints up or down.


For all the noise made Friday, only a few top-rated stocks moved in strong volume. Some of the moves, though, carried mixed signals.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) popped 5% higher at the open and then gave back all but 1%. Trade was twice its usual pace as the market reacted Friday to upbeat quarterly results released after hours Thursday.


Small-cap **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) scored the biggest percentage gain in the IBD 50, a 2% pop in average turnover, but it found resistance for the second straight day at its 50-day line.


On the downside, three top-rated medical stocks slid south in fast trade, including **Biogen**'s ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) 22% gap down on weak guidance.


Despite a tough week for the market, the bank sector continued to show signs of leadership. Banks topped the tally of new highs with 31 Tuesday, 29 Wednesday and 26 Thursday before slipping to just five Friday.


Economic news Friday was mixed. The Purchasing Managers Manufacturing Index was slightly better than expected, but a similar gauge in China was weaker than anticipated.


New home sales for June missed the consensus estimate by 12%, taking a chunk out of homebuilder stocks.


For the week, the Nasdaq shed 2.3% and the S&P 500 2.2%. The Dow slouched 2.9%, while the small cap S&P 600 lost 3%. The IBD 50 declined 0.6%.


Earnings season will gain momentum in the coming week. Among stocks in the S&P 500, about 40% have reported already. An additional 30% are expected to report this week.


They include **Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)).

Stocks advanced for a third day in a row Friday, as the Nasdaq posted its fourth straight weekly gain.


The Nasdaq rose 0.6% Friday while the S&P 500 and the IBD 50 each added 0.5%.


Volume fell across the board.


An economic report before the opening bell provided some fuel for the bulls. Payrolls rose 217,000 in May, edging above views for 213,000. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.3%, which was a tick better than expected.


The economy's participation rate, though, remained at 62.8%, the worst trough since 1978.


Meanwhile, big money's participation rate in this uptrend appears to be improving.


Breakouts in strong volume continued to dribble in Friday.


Plasma and protein-therapies provider **Grifols** ([GRFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRFS)) and China-based search engine **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) cleared buy points, though strong morning trade faded to a modest spike for Baidu.


Meanwhile, auto-components maker **BorgWarner** ([BWA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWA)) finally found big volume â€” two days after crossing a buy point.


China-based online discount retailer **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) found big volume a day after clearing a handle.


Some breakouts in this uptrend, though, are too extended to buy.


While that might frustrate individual investors who were slow to act in time, it's good news for those who pulled the trigger. Positions become easier to hold with a modest cushion.


Unfortunately, the cushions are mostly single-digit percentage gains so far.


If an investor studies the top-rated stocks that have broken out since the May 27 follow-through, the biggest gain came from sensor designer **OmniVision Technologies** ([OVTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OVTI)). The stock is up 13% from its ideal buy point, thanks to a 12% gap up on May 30. Other leaders are up in the 6% to 8% range or lingering in the 5% buy zone.


Still, the market's tone has turned somewhat more bullish.


The small-cap S&P 600, which can serve as a gauge of aggressiveness, gained 2.8% for the week, outperforming the major indexes. This marked the first time since early April that the S&P 600 outperformed both major indexes for the week.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively, last week. The IBD 50 tacked on 0.9%.


With a slow but steady parade of breakouts and modest gains after the breakouts, how should the individual investor play this uptrend?


At this point, the standard IBD approach of locking in profits when they reach 20% seems unduly optimistic.


Cautious investors might consider setting profit targets lower, until this uptrend proves that strategy wrong.


Meanwhile, if a small gain threatens to turn negative, sell before the position becomes a loss.

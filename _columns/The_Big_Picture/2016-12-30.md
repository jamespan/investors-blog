U.S. stock indexes remained stuck between two key areas Friday, as the stock market logged its second weekly loss in the past three weeks.


The Nasdaq dropped 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 retreated 0.4%. Volume in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) was up across the board, but the comparison with the previous session was all too easy. Trade has been below average in the past nine sessions. The market will be closed Monday.


![mp12301616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP12301616.png)The major indexes picked up a distribution day, a sign of institutional selling. However, the trend of low volume is clouding the message.


Resistance has developed around 5,500 for the Nasdaq and 2,275 for the S&P 500. But the indexes also could be positioned to test the 50-day lines for support. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are only 1% to 2% above the 50-day lines.


Those are the areas to watch to determine if the rally will perk up in early 2017 or crumble into a pullback.


For the year, the small-cap S&P 600 rose 25%; the Dow, 13%; the S&P 500, 9%; and the Nasdaq, 7%. However, most of the gains came after the presidential election.


With President-elect Trump poised to take charge, the stock market will have plenty to price in and price out in 2017. Trump's economic policies are expected to be starkly different from those of President Obama.


A rising stock market and a sluggish economy have been the characteristics of the Obama era. In some ways, the sluggish economy was a continuation of the George W. Bush era. The last time the economy posted annual real GDP growth above 3% was 2005.


Although the free-market camp didn't care much for either Bush or Obama's economic policies, Wall Street can hardly complain about Obama. The Nasdaq rose in seven of the eight Obama years and the S&P 500 climbed in six of the eight years. Losses were small in the down years.


But politics and the action of the major stocks indexes don't have a simple cause-and-effect relationship. Innovation matters more to the stock market, and [industry-group performance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-trump-revive-reagans-stock-market-magic/) reflects that reality.


From the vantage point of industry groups, Obama was better for the stock market than his predecessor. About 30% of the stock industry groups posted a negative return over Bush's eight years. About 9% did under Obama.


If individual investors want to profit handsomely in the Trump era, they will have to put aside political convictions and focus on the market and its potential catalysts and inhibitors. Here are nine factors worth pondering for 2017.


* **News is likely to play a bigger role in 2017.**  Dodd-Frank bank regulations and ObamaCare could face the ax, or at least some surgery. A cut in the corporate tax rate appears likely. All of this is good news for the free-market camp. But on the negative side, tariffs and trade wars — for decades unthinkable — could return under Trump. Few bulls would regard that as helpful.
* **The pessimists will beat on the glum drum again.** Last year, the worry was recession. It didn't happen, but the federal debt can always be counted on to feed collapse scenarios. One factor that has received little attention is federal government asset sales. In April, Art Laffer, a former economic advisor to President Reagan, said the Trump team was correct when it said asset sales were one way to pay off part of the national debt. Selling assets when faced with overwhelming debt is a standard business technique.
* **Buybacks are poised to play a smaller role.** Company stock buybacks were major drivers of the stock market in the Obama years. The Federal Reserve's policy of low interest rates combined with a weak environment for business made buybacks a prudent use of cash. According to FactSet Research, Q3 marked the second consecutive drop — on a year-ago basis — of buybacks in S&P 500 companies. At some point, the stock market will have to find a more conventional driver, such as earnings and revenue.
* **Earnings will be pivotal in 2017.** A better atmosphere for business would mean more companies with rising earnings and sufficient cash flow to finance capital projects. On Dec. 23, FactSet said fourth-quarter earnings growth for the S&P 500 will be 3.2%. However, that represents a downward revision from Sept. 30, when the estimate was for 5.2% growth. The estimated sales growth rate for Q4 is 5.1%, vs. 5.3%, as of September.
* **Noise is just noise.** Media chatter is swirling around the all-time highs that indexes have recently pegged. Sometimes the fuss comes with the insinuation that risk is also at a high and the situation is scary. But put in perspective, the recent highs are neither impressive nor scary. For example, the Nasdaq recently posted new all-time highs, surpassing the March 2000 high of 5,132. But adjusted for inflation, the Nasdaq would have to advance to about 7,087 to make a real all-time high and presumably generate the euphoria that goes with it.
* **Bull markets don't carry expiration dates.** A bull market's age doesn't matter. Recessions, not time, kill bull markets.
* **Amateur investors still haven't returned.** Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, says that when a Starbucks barista starts talking about how much money he or she is making in stocks, the market top is near. Some say the meltdowns of 2000 and 2008 have permanently scared off the amateur investors. Don't believe it. The dumb money will return when making money in the stock market begins to look easy.
* **The money supply matters.** Growth in Divisia M4 including Treasuries, the broadest gauge of the money supply, averaged 2% in 2014, 3.3% in 2015 and 5% in the first 11 months of 2016, according to the Center for Financial Stability. The money supply has no immediate relevance to the stock market, but the increase in the money supply is bullish for the economy, and that usually helps stocks.
* **Stay focused on the market itself.** The stock market is constantly sending messages. When stocks are breaking out and then stalling in the 5% buy zone, that says something important. When stocks break out and quickly become too extended to buy, that also says something important. Individual investors should strive to expect no more than the market is offering. Strategies should be calibrated to what is currently happening. But be ready to adjust when the market changes its reward-and-punishment pattern.


Finally, approach investing with humility. A winning stock often says more about the market itself than it does about the investor's stock-picking skills. Stay on the right side of the trend and potential problems will be either lessened or avoided.

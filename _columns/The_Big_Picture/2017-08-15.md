Indexes Cool, Small Caps Slammed; This Sector Still Sees Fervent Selling
=========================================================================

The major indexes barely budged Tuesday in a session that featured low trading volume, as to be expected in the middle of August. But the story for many retail companies followed a much darker script.




Former huge market winners such as **Coach** ([COH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COH)), which round-tripped its recent gains from a breakout at 41.80, to other former leaders including **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) and **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)), reaffirmed the challenges that many brick-and-mortar chains are having in the era of e-commerce. The three stocks dropped 15%, 20% and 23%, respectively.


The sell-off in many retailing companies has gone on for months. Yet for now, the broadly diversified S&P 500 showed little impact, giving up just 1 point, or less than 0.1%, as a combination of consumer- and defense-oriented stocks helped offset the slide in store chains. Gaming, meat, nonalcoholic beverage, credit card and payment processing, medical systems and tobacco firms led the upside.


The Nasdaq composite was off just 0.1% as the megacap techs made piecemeal moves. The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial firms, ended practically flat.


Volume edged lower on the Nasdaq and grew by 3% on the NYSE. Due to the minimal decline seen by the S&P 500, no new distribution day was added to the count.


Still, that does not change the fact that the past few weeks have seen a little more intensive profit-taking by mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, pensions, insurers and the like. As noted in the Market Pulse table, seven distribution days still count on the Nasdaq, an unusually high number. Remarkably, most of these sell-offs have been minor in scope.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP081517-182x300.png)The chances of a market uptrend withering into a correction are still significant, even if the latest round of economic data shows the U.S. is still in decent shape and even though the Federal Reserve is being very cautious about raising the cost of money. North Korea's nuclear threat, the potential for more terrorist acts both in the U.S. and Europe, and policies that hinder cross-border trade all could spark a more pronounced sell-off.


Breadth was negative Tuesday. Losing stocks edged winners by a nearly 2-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq and 9-to-5 on the NYSE.


Looking at the leading stocks, many are indeed still in fine uptrends. But breakdowns below the 50-day moving average would mean that new bases are likely to appear. That's why buying only on solid high-volume breakouts from good bases remains the best strategy.


Among other sector-specific indexes, the S&P SmallCap 600 got hammered 1%. The Russell 2000 fell 0.8%. As has been the case all year long, large caps have been outperforming their small-cap brethren.


The 500 shows a very respectable year-to-date gain of 10%, while the 600 is now down 0.4% since Jan. 1. Keep in mind, though, that small caps had a rip-roaring 2016; the S&P 600 gained 24.7% that year, smashing the 500's 9.5% dividend-excluding return.


IBD readers who track the action of the industry groups and sectors via IBD's Data Tables and IBD Weekly have known to steer clear of most retail names for a long time. When a stock shows poor industry group or sector rankings, the chances of a successful breakout are greatly reduced.


Looking at the latest IBD Weekly edition, Retail ranks a lowly No. 28 out of 33 sectors. Its 8.1% gain since Jan. 1 is solid, yet lags the major indexes.



Advance Auto, at 87.08, is now 57% below its 201.24 all-time high. Dick's, which reported double-digit EPS and revenue gains for the fiscal second quarter but disappointed the Street with weak same-store sales, is also 57% below its own all-time peak.

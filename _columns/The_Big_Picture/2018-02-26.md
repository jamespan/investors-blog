The stock market gave new evidence Monday that it's gotten past last week's wobbly few days.


Major indexes rallied into the close for a second straight session, as the Nasdaq composite effectively wiped away all losses from a rocky first half of February. It closed at 7421.46, above the 7385.86 close on Feb. 1, which was the last day before the Nasdaq and other indexes started to tailspin.




 The Nasdaq added more than 1.1% Monday and closed 1% away from a new high. Like it did in 2017, the Nasdaq is outpacing the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500.


The S&P 500 climbed 1.2% and gave itself some breathing room above the [50-day moving average](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). That's significant because not only is the 50-day line a price-trend indicator, but the S&P 500 had gotten bogged down at that line during last week's wobbly sessions.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP02261818-202x300.png)During the weak spell, indexes reversed lower and had a tendency to close low in the day's price range. That's evidence of a tiring market. Since Friday, however, indexes have behaved much better.


The Dow also elbowed its way above the 50-day average, up 1.6% on the day thanks to solid gains by several components. **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) rose 3% while eight other components added about 2%.


It was a broad band of technology, consumer, finance and industrial companies leading the Dow, which often has just one or two stocks to thank on days when it outperforms the main indexes. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Cisco to 50 from 46 and maintained an overweight rating. Nomura Instinet raised its price target on Intel to 60 from 50.


The breadth showed up elsewhere, as advancers led decliners by 2-to-1 on the NYSE and the Nasdaq, according to early data. Among industry groups, only 12 of 197 finished more than 0.5% lower.


Technology, consumer and transportation sector led the broad market. Transportation and semiconductors shined also. The Dow transports rallied 1.8% as the index's airlines carried the average. IBD's airlines industry group rose 2%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index jumped 2.2%.


The old Dow theory says that if transports confirm the Dow's advance, it's a sign the economy is humming and investors should expect good returns. The thinking behind that is that companies will keep shipping companies busy to feed a growing economy.


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq, and was higher on the NYSE.


Investors may look at the index charts and see breakouts. But chart patterns work best with individual stocks rather than indexes. Besides, the market gave its most important signal Feb. 14, when it made a [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/). At that point, investors should have been adding some exposure to stocks.


But if there was a sore spot in Monday's trading, it was the lagging performance of a few leading stocks. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lagged with a 0.5% gain. Much of that was due to **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), a Chinese education service provider that tumbled 5%.


TAL pared losses and closed above its 36.26 buy point. Other Chinese stocks were weaker, including IBD 50 members **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) and **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), after the ruling Communist Party proposed [eliminating the presidential term limit](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/ibd-50-stock-tal-education-sinks-tests-buy-point-rival-loses-support/).


Homebuilders also were among the laggards, after U.S. [sales of new homes surprisingly fell](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/new-home-sales-tumble-to-slowest-pace-since-august/) in January to the lowest level on an annualized rate since August. The industry group first started to buckle Jan. 25 and remains in a sandpit.


Wall Street's troubles earlier this month began with worries that rising inflation would force the Fed to increase interest rates faster than it had strategized. To wit, Tuesday's testimony of new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before the House Financial Services Committee is sure to be watched closely. But Powell is not likely to rattle markets just a few weeks into his new job.

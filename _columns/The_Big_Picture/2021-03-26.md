title: Stock Market Rallies Late, Extends Rebound As Leading Stocks Improve

For much of the day, the stock market struggled to make a second straight advance. But a late rally cemented increases of more than 1% and brightened a week that started poorly.




The final five minutes were particularly impressive, with the Nasdaq picking up a quarter of its 1.2% increase. Following Thursday's bullish price reversals, Friday's surge strengthened the market's rebound.


The S&P 500 vaulted 1.7% and closed at session highs as it made a record closing high. The index found support after gliding to its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) during the week. The 50-day line has become a trusted support level for the S&P 500, even after a dive below the line on March 4.


The Nasdaq composite added 1.2% after digging itself out of a 0.8% afternoon hole. The Nasdaq had to battle weakness in biotechs and relative weakness in some major components such as **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).


![MP032621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP032621-241x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4%, making an all-time closing high and extending a bounce off support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was rose on the NYSE. Advancers led decliners by 7-to-2 on the NYSE and by 12-to-7 on the Nasdaq.


The sharp stock market gains gave the look of a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). The S&P 500's gain in higher volume qualified as a follow-through. Leading stocks performed well â€” much better than earlier in the week. With new strength in indexes and top stocks, the market uptrend resumed, as far as IBD's market outlook goes.


Just on Wednesday, IBD's outlook weakened to "uptrend under pressure" as negative signals piled up. But it would have been foolhardy to continue with a bearish stance given the Thursday-Friday rebound.


Can Stock Market Sustain Direction?
-----------------------------------


Such is the nature of the stock market the past many weeks, lacking sustained direction and making it difficult to make money in stocks. A handful of stocks plummeted the past week, underscoring the unsettled undercurrent. **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) plunged 22% before erasing almost the entire loss. It lost more than 31% for the week as Chinese stocks sold off. Some media stocks also had a rough week, such as **Discovery** ([DISCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DISCA)) and **AMC Networks** ([AMCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMCX)).


With an uptrend in place, investors can relax the shackles on their trading and devote more capital to stocks. Can this rally last more than a few days? Your own investing can be your best guide. If stock buys produce results, you can increase exposure. In a choppy market, [cutting losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) is a valuable strategy.



On Friday, **Ubiquiti** ([UI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UI)) broke out powerfully from a [narrow cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and joined [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)), another Leaderboard member, is in a new buy area after finding support at the 10-week moving average.


The IBD 50 surged 3.6% Friday. The index is rising from its second pullback to the 200-day moving average this month. Technology leaders led the IBD 50. **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) climbed 6.3% and is near a 110.47 entry. **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) bounced 5.5% but remains below the 50-day line.


The Dow Jones transports index rose to a record high with a 2.3% gain. The Russell 2000 added 1.8%.

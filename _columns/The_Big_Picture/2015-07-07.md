Stocks Reverse Higher After Soft Start; Volume Rises
=====================================================

The stock market got off to a rough start Tuesday, falling hard in the morning, but major averages recovered nicely into the close, perhaps helped by news the eurozone is considering a proposal for interim funding for Greece.


After falling 1.8% early, the Nasdaq showed a gain of 0.1% by the close. For the S&P 500, a 1.2% loss morphed into a 0.6% gain. The Dow added 0.5%. Volume rose nicely from Monday's levels.


The S&P 500 pierced its 200-day moving average but closed above line. It was the first trip below the long -term support level for the index since October. The technical bounce was an encouraging development for the bulls, but one that didn't exactly remove doubts about the market.


Growth stocks were generally left out in the cold again as defensive areas of the market like utilities and food stocks were among the best gainers. The IBD 50 fell less than 0.1%.


Despite the market's upside reversal, not much has changed for growth investors. When it comes to top-rated growth stocks, price action remains largely sluggish.


Institutional investors might have been doing some of the buying Tuesday, but they've been mostly quiet in recent weeks, sitting out the uncertainty. That makes it tough for a growth portfolio to make headway.


The bears have been pointing toward poor market breadth for a while now, and it was more of the same Tuesday, at least for the Nasdaq, where declining stocks outnumbered advancers by a 4-3 margin. Breadth was a little better on the NYSE as winners topped losers by less than 2-1.


On Page B4, check out the NYSE advance/decline on the S&P 500 chart. It's been in a downtrend for several weeks now. The Nasdaq's A/D line isn't as bad, but breadth has been weakening since late June.


Meanwhile, the bloodbath in China stocks continued. The **iShares China Large-Cap ETF** ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) lost 4% more. Since hitting a high of 52.85 in late April, it's down close to 21%.


The Fed has taken a back seat for now to Greece and weakness in China stocks, but the International Monetary Fund chimed in again Tuesday, reminding the Federal Open Market Committee that premature rate hikes could stall a U.S. economic recovery. The IMF made a similar comment in early June.


In related news, the economic outlook component to the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism index fell to a 10-month low Tuesday. Last week, the June employment report showed more job growth, but the labor participation rate fell to the lowest level since 1977.


Despite a sluggish environment overall for growth stocks, some names continue to act well, including Sector Leader **Blackhawk Network** ([HAWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAWK)). It's trading tightly and holding near highs after a recent base breakout.


Meanwhile, Big Cap 20 member **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) tried to clear a cup-with-handle pattern with a 147.40 buy point but volume was average. It closed pennies above the buy point.


**Lennar**'s ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) breakout from a cup-with-handle base looked a little better. It cleared a 52.60 buy point in heavy volume. It, too, ended just above the buy point.

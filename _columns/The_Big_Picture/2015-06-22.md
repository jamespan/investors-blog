Stocks rose Monday, extending last week's gains. But some leaders struggled. The Nasdaq climbed 0.7% to an all-time high, thanks to strength in biotech and software stocks.

  

Strength in financials helped the S&P 500 to a 0.6% gain. The benchmark index has yet to clear its May 20 record high, but came within about five points short on Monday.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 did put in a new high, gaining 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average also rose 0.6%.

  

Hopes that debt-ridden Greece will reach a deal with creditors drove most stock markets around the globe higher. The Athens Stock Exchange surged 9%, while Germany's stock market rallied 3.8%.

  

Volume in U.S. trading dived sharply from Friday's hectic pace, which was boosted by quadruple witching. Breadth was strong across the board. Winners beat losers by nearly 5-to-3 on the NYSE and about 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

  

Monday's move appeared to be a continuation of improvements in the stock market. The Nasdaq has come out of its trading range and into new-high ground. Accumulation/Distribution Ratings on both major indexes have inched higher. About two weeks ago, the S&P had a worst-possible E rating, while the Nasdaq held a C-.

  

But action among leaders was lackluster Monday. The IBD 50 rose just 0.1%, lagging the major averages. Its lagging performance was largely due to **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), which crashed 21% in record volume.

  

The stock had been displaying signs of a climax top:

  

In recent weeks, the stock's rate of ascent accelerated. Shares bolted almost 80% in the past six weeks. At Thursday's high, the stock was more than double its 200-day moving average. And on June 12, the stock had the biggest one-day point gain of its run.

  

**Synaptics** ([SYNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNA)) was also a drag on the IBD 50, losing nearly 5% on a report from DigiTimes that **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is making its own touch and display products for its next generation of iPhones.

  

Also, **Synchronoss Technologies** ([SNCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNCR)) turned tail after clearing a 50.95 buy point from a cup-with-handle base.

  

On the plus side, **Outerwall** ([OUTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OUTR)) and **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI))hit new highs in fast trade. Both leading stocks are showing better action from breakouts. The former is still in buy range from a 78.04 buy point in a cup base. Ellie Mae is extended from a 67.10 buy point.

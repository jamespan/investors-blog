Stock Market Rally Intact As Nasdaq Approaches New Highs; Amazon, EBay Near New Buy Points
===========================================================================================

The stock market ended Thursday with mixed action, as the Nasdaq composite rallied as much as 1% before sharply cutting gains in afternoon trade. Nasdaq came within a couple of points of all-time highs before fading.




The Nasdaq ended up just 0.3%. Still, the tech-heavy composite put in a better showing than the other major stock indexes, as tech leadership re-emerged. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded down 0.3%, weighed down by an 11% dive in shares of **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)). Meanwhile, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) advanced 1.8% to hit all-time highs.


The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.2%. Leading growth stocks sharply outperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied 0.4%. Inside the IBD 50, **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) was one of the top performers with a 4.5% advance, but it remains below its 50-day moving average. On the downside, **PennyMac Financial Services** ([PFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFSI)) tumbled nearly 9%.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq, and NYSE volume was indicated lower as well.


Nasdaq Resilient, Nears Record High
-----------------------------------


The Nasdaq snapped back from Tuesday's 1.7% sell-off with a two-day win streak.


![MP081320](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP081320-242x300.jpg)The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both have three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), a modest amount of institutional selling. However, the Nasdaq came close to logging a stall day, but volume ended lower. So far, the few distribution days haven't slowed down the stock market rally. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are within striking distance of record highs.


Meanwhile, top technology stocks continue to demonstrate strength. Tech giant Apple hit an all-time high, while a number of high-profile growth stocks — like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) are close to setting up new buy points.

Stock Market Earnings: Applied Materials, Baidu
-----------------------------------------------


After the stock market close, top chip stock **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and Chinese internet giant **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) reported quarterly earnings.


Applied Materials reported [better-than-expected fiscal Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/applied-materials-earnings-q3-2020-amat-stock/) late Thursday with strong guidance. In extended trade, shares rallied about 1.5%. The stock ended Thursday in the 5% buy zone above a 62.43 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).


Baidu topped earnings estimates and only met sales estimates late Thursday. In response, shares of Baidu tumbled about 5% in after-hours trade.


Shares are tracing a bottoming cup with handle with a 135.54 buy point, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. A potential flaw is a weak [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/).



Stocks To Watch: Amazon, Dollar General, EBay, Visa
---------------------------------------------------


Bullishly, a number of top growth stocks are forming new bases, offering [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), as the current stock market uptrend continues.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Amazon is on the verge of a [five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). The new formation will display a buy point of 3,344.39, or 10 cents above the July 13 high. An aggressive entry at 3,247.57 is also available. Shares have found resistance around the 3,247 price level three times since July 21. A surge above that resistance area could lead to new price highs.


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows Amazon stock has a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the top tier of growth stocks.


Value Play Dollar General Dips
------------------------------


**Dollar** **General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) is in the 5% buy zone past a 197.94 buy point after decisively clearing the entry on Wednesday. Shares dipped 0.4% Thursday. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) tops out at 207.84.



EBay is close to forming a flat base with a 61.16 buy point. Shares found much-needed support at their 50-day line this week and are rebounding in light volume. EBay is a recent addition to [IBD SwingTrader.](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader)


[Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/visa-stock-hurdles-buy-point-payment-stocks-charge-higher/), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), is trying to break out past a 202.28 buy point in a flat base. An early entry at 201.05 is also in play. Shares tried to break out on Aug. 11, but were turned away during that day's stock market reversal. Shares are about 2% away.


A potential flaw is the stock's sharply lagging RS line. Investors should normally focus on stocks outperforming the broad market.

The month of September started with another record high in the Nasdaq composite, but an afternoon fade sapped some strength from stock market bulls.




Indexes drifted down in the final couple of hours of trading, though they still closed a bit higher. Despite a lackluster technology sector, the Nasdaq added 0.3% for its eighth advance in the past 10 sessions. The S&P 500 rose a fraction after being up as much as 0.3%.


Higher volume on the Nasdaq confirmed a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-recognize-topping-in-stock-market/) for the index. That's an unusual type of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), but still counts as a third day of institutional selling for the composite. NYSE volume fell.


Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain in solid uptrends, with moderate distribution over the past several weeks. The Nasdaq recorded its 33rd record close of 2021. For now, there's reason for investors to be long on stocks and ETFs.

The Nasdaq closed Wednesday 4% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The composite also is poking above a trendline, touching the index highs in April, July and August.


The S&P 500 is getting closer to touching its own upper channel line, and closed nearly 3% above the 50-day average. A normal drawdown would not be surprising at this point.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a trendless day with a loss of 0.2%. Small caps resumed their rebound, with the Russell 2000 up 0.6%. The index is up about 8% from its Aug. 19 low.


Stock Market Rotation Key To Gains
----------------------------------


In this year's oscillating stock market, investors have found success finding the stocks and industries moving into favor with each market wave.


Today, homebuilders are one industry to watch. With a 0.3% gain Wednesday, it was by no means a leading industry. But the group has climbed from No. 100 six weeks ago to No. 45 [in IBD's ranking of 197 groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-aug-31-2021/). More interesting, one builder broke out Wednesday and many others are [forming bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).



**M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) rose above the 67.78 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of another [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) base. Volume jumped more than three times its average over the past 50 sessions. Having consolidated since May, M/I Homes' [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) had fallen below the desired minimum of 80. But that changed after Wednesday's action.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is heading in the right direction. But it also could use improvement.


Also in the group, **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **Tri Pointe Homes** ([TPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPH)), **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) and **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)) are nearing buy points. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF ([XHB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XHB)) is also trying to break out past a 78.87 buy point in a cup with handle.


The real estate sector in general was the best performing within the stock market Wednesday. Real Estate Select Sector SPDR ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) rose 1.7%. It just completed its ninth straight monthly gain.


Two real estate investment trusts also broke out.



**Digital Realty Trust** ([DLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLR)) climbed 1.6%, clearing a 13-month high. Buy points can be seen at 164.14 and 164.35. **Industrial Logistics Properties Trust** ([ILPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILPT)) cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/). Both REITs' fundamentals are weak, however.


Some consumer stocks continue to attract buyers, too.


**PVH** ([PVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVH)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in heavy trading. Shares are in buy range from the 116.79 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Late Tuesday, the parent company of the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein apparel brands beat profit and sales expectations for the July-ended quarter and raised its full-year outlook. Revenue in international businesses topped the 2019 pre-pandemic levels.

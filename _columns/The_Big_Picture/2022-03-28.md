  Stocks Today: Nasdaq Pulls Indexes Higher; Are Leaders Showing A Reversion To The Mean?

[Stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) pretty much showcased many of the elements of a healthy confirmed uptrend. Yet Monday's trading featured one curious twist.




Strong finish by the key indexes? Check. Many, if not all, of the recent breakouts making at least some progress for the plucky investor who bought at the [correct entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/)? Check. And do stocks today still show the character of absorbing bearish news with bullish resolve? For the most part, yes.


Chip and software firms helped give the Nasdaq composite a 1.3% boost. At 14,354, the market cap-weighted index marked its highest close in more than six weeks.


The S&P 500 rallied for the fourth time in five sessions and for the eighth time 10 days. A 0.7% ascent gave the large-cap benchmark further distance above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), meanwhile, poked above the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since Jan. 18.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.3%, finishing less than 24 points below its flattened 200-day moving average. Volume fell on both main exchanges.


But the breadth of Monday's advance was less than ideal, with losers mildly beating winners on both exchanges, mostly hurt by a sell-off in oil and gas stocks.

West Texas Intermediate oil futures slumped more than $10 to $103.45 a barrel, according to oilprice.com. That marked oil's lowest close since mid-March.


Some Ag Stocks Cool Off
-----------------------


Investors also took profits in the fertilizer sector. The leaders in IBD's Agriculture-Chemicals industry group have made a tremendous run, so the sell-off in some names comes as no surprise.


Small cap **Intrepid Potash** ([IPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPI)), down 5% in heavy trade, still shows a healthy cushion above its rapidly rising 21-day exponential moving average.


Yet while the [Stocks On The Move table](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) at Investors.com showed a larger number of companies falling for the day in above-average volume vs. those rising, many of the top guns in the oil and gas sector did not see huge turnover. In short, institutions did not dump oil shares with abandon.


**Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)), **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)), **Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) and **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) all fell Monday in turnover that came in below their respective average levels over the past 50 sessions.



**Civitas Resources** ([CIVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIVI)), which broke out of a five-month consolidation pattern near 60 on Friday, gave back a little more than half of its gains in the prior two sessions. Volume started out briskly in the morning, but shriveled by day's end. More than 917,000 shares exchanged hands, or 13% below its usual level.

Stocks Today: Will Tech Continue To Rebound?
--------------------------------------------


Without question, the sell-off in the tech space has been harsh. VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) had fallen as much as 25% from its November peak. IBD's enterprise software group, now near the bottom of the IBD 197 industry group rankings, has a lot of damage to repair on its own chart. Few of its members populate key computer-generated screens at Investors.com. For weeks, not a single technology stock has joined [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


But if more companies from these and related industry groups retake key technical levels, they're not simply correcting a short-term oversold condition.


More of these firms could actually find space on your watchlist — especially if they fell no more than 30% to 40% off their peaks. The fundamental leaders in these areas of the market should have the wherewithal to erase that kind of shareholder wealth destruction.


The meme stocks of 2021 and big winners from 2020's do-everything-from-home rally certainly got hit harder. And so these issues need to rally 100% to 150% or more just to get within striking distance of their new highs. Tough task indeed.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) shows a broader view, industry-wise, of the current leadership.


One Growing Worry About 2022
----------------------------


Meanwhile, more market analysts are expressing bearish concern about how an inversion within the U.S. Treasury yield curve may impact stocks today.


While the benchmark 10-year bond yield dipped 1 basis point to 2.47%, it's now almost 10 basis points below the shorter-duration 5-year note's yield of 2.56%.


The two-year note finished Monday at 2.35%, only 12 basis points below the 10-year yield.


Veteran mutual fund and portfolio manager Louis Navellier noted in his Daily Market Notes report that with the 5-year note's yield spiking to 2.63% overnight, it marks the first 5-and-10-year yield inversion since 2006.


Navellier calls this phenomenon a "traditional hallmark of recessions in the past." The Covid-19 shutdown of big cities in China certainly isn't helping the cause for the global economy or full loosening up of supply chains. But he added, "offsetting all these negative trends is the reality that growth forecasts of both overall earnings and GDP remain positive for the next several quarters on the strength of the post-pandemic opening."

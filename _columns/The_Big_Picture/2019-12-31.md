Stock Market Caps Bullish Year With Modest Gains; Which Sectors Will Lead In 2020?
===================================================================================

The stock market ended 2019 on a quiet note Tuesday, as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended near session highs with gains of around 0.3%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index also rose 0.3%.




But make no mistake, it was a very bullish year for stocks. The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 35.2%. The S&P 500 rose 28.9% and the Dow Jones picked up 22.3%. The Nasdaq 100 had its best showing since 2009, up 38%.


For the S&P 500, it was the index's best gain since 2013, when it rose 29.6%. A year later, it was up 11.4%. Since 1991, the S&P 500 has delivered an annual gain of least 25% six times. The following year, the index was up an average of 15%.


Stock Market And The Fed
------------------------


Indeed, the pieces seem to be in place for another solid showing for the stock market in 2020. And why not? The federal funds rate, currently at 1.50% to 1.75%, isn't headed higher anytime soon unless the U.S. economy suddenly kicks into overdrive, raising the threat of inflation. But that's not a likely scenario.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP123119-263x300.jpg)The Fed expects GDP growth of 2.2% this year, 2% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021, with core PCE inflation (the Fed's preferred inflation gauge) at 1.6%, 1.9% and 2% over the same time.


The stock market likes economic growth, even if it's a bit slower than normal, as well as a healthy jobs market with low inflation. And there's no reason to think that won't continue into 2020, along with a healthy corporate earnings environment.


There's plenty to like about the current state of the stock market. While a pullback for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is inevitable at some point, it would take some pretty dire headlines for both indexes to break their 10-week moving averages with conviction.


A 3.2% pullback for the Nasdaq would take it down to its 10-week line, and a 9% pullback would bring it down to its 40-week moving average.


Tuesday's session served up some nice movers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), including **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)). A 39.45 buy point is still in play for the Brazil-based fintech, but a new base may be in the works as the stock gets support at the 10-week moving average.


Meanwhile, sell signals in high-Composite Rating stocks like **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals** ([ARWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARWR)), **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), **Lululmeon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) just aren't there.


What Sectors Will Lead The Stock Market?
----------------------------------------


IBD's telecom, semiconductor, building, aerospace and software sectors led the way in 2019, with gains ranging from 37% to 51%. While it's possible that new sectors could assume leadership roles in 2020, it's premature to say that chips stocks and software stocks are ready to surrender their leadership.


After a breakout in October, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) found support at its 10-week line in early December.

And several chip stocks are still in buy range or setting up in new bases. Dow Jones stock **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) is still in buy range from a 59.23 buy point. In the chip equipment group, **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) are setting up in new bases, while **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) is still trading near a 50.25 entry.


Among the fabless chip firms, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) is setting up in a new base.


In the software sector, stocks with leadership potential include **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).



Of course, new leadership could come from new sectors in 2020. Keep your eyes peeled on the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/), the [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and the MarketSmith Growth 250 to spot emerging trends.


Distribution Days Shrinking
---------------------------


Volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE rose from Monday's level.


The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count has gotten a lot lighter in the Market Pulse graphic.


As noted in Friday's Big Picture, a total of four distribution days fell off the count last week. The Nasdaq lost three. [On Monday,](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rises-dow-leads-boeing-disney/) the Nov. 20 and the Dec. 3 distribution days fell off the count. [On Thursday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rally-nasdaq-tops-9000-apple-stock-record-high-shopify-oled-break-out/), the Dec. 2 distribution dropped off. Lastly, the S&P 500's Dec. 3 distribution day dropped off Friday after a 5% gain from 3093.20 (the S&P 500's closing price on Dec. 3).

The two distribution days left on the S&P 500 are Dec. 2 (-0.9%) and Dec. 30 (-0.6%). The three remaining distribution days on the Nasdaq are Dec. 9 (-0.4%), Dec. 18 (+0.05%, stalling) and Dec. 30 (-0.7%).


With limited signs of institutional selling in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, and leading growth stocks generally acting well, it's too early to adopt a bearish stance on the market.


But the possibility of some volatility in January is certainly there in light of strong gains for the stock market since October. Don't be afraid to take at least partial gains in some nice winners and cut laggard stocks loose.

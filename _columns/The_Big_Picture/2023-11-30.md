  Stock Market Mixed As Inflation Continues To Cool; Nvidia, Tesla Slide

The stock market ended mixed Thursday after the Federal Reserve's primary inflation rate showed that core price pressures cooled further in October. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) skidded amid the company's Cybertruck delivery event.




Stock market leader **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) selection **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) are stocks to watch in the ongoing uptrend.


The [personal consumption expenditures](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/key-fed-inflation-rate-slides-sp-500-futures-rise-with-rate-cuts-in-sight/), or PCE, price index was unchanged in October, while the annual inflation rate fell to 3% from 3.4% in September, cooler than 3.1% forecasts.


Typically, Federal Reserve decision-making puts more weight on core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. The core PCE price index rose 0.2% in October, as expected. The core 12-month inflation rate eased to 3.5% from 3.7% in September, matching Wall Street expectations.


Further, the Labor Department's first-time unemployment claims rose to 218,000 vs. 209,000 in the previous week.


"The Fed is on hold for now but their pivot to rate cuts is getting closer: Inflation is clearly slowing, and the job market is softening faster than expected," said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank in a research note.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the indexes finished sharply mixed, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.5%. The S&P 500 moved up 0.4% and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dropped just over 0.2%, bouncing a bit after both indexes staged bearish reversal days Wednesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP113023-217x300.jpg)Finally, the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.3%. The index met resistance at its 200-day moving average Wednesday.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That gives the Nasdaq its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) since Nov. 9, which was already made moot due to index gains.


The equal-weighted index ETFs outperformed their cap-weighted counterparts. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) closed up 0.8%, while the Direxion Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) inched higher. That indicates some targeted selling among big technology stocks, in particular the so-called Magnificent Seven.


There were some bearish signs among those big seven stocks. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) tumbled nearly 3%, giving up its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and 476.09 double-bottom entry.


Tesla stock skidded 1.7% as the EV giant delivered 12 Cybertrucks during its [delivery event Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-begin-four-years-after-ev-unveiled/) at its Austin, Texas, factory with pomp and circumstance as Chief Executive Elon Musk outlined key specs for the hotly anticipated vehicle.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) lost 1.9% to close below its 50-day line, while **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) declined 1.5% and closed below is 21-day line.



Inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average, **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) jumped 3.4% to retake a 546.78 handle buy point. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) jumped 9.4% Thursday, breaking out past a 228.79 buy point in a double-bottom base. And the breakaway gap yielded a buy point at 252.50. The software firm gave a [strong earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-earnings-q32023/). Of the Dow's 520-point rally Thursday, Salesforce accounted for 142 points and UnitedHealth 118, which helped explain the industrials' outperformance.


On the downside, **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) fell nearly 0.2% to hit a new 52-week low.


And top growth stocks rallied, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 1.7%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **ImmunoGen** ([IMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMGN)) soared nearly 83% after **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)) [agreed to buy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/imgn-stock-abbv-stock-biotech-acquisition-elahere/)ImmunoGen for $10.1 billion in cash.

What To Do Now
--------------


IBD recommends an exposure level of 80% to 100%, as the stock market continues its steadfast advance. If you're making progress in your portfolio, then the top of that range makes sense. However, if your breakout stocks have stagnated, then it's also OK to be more conservatively positioned.


Finally, it's also OK to reduce exposure by taking some profits when leading stocks hit their 20%-25% profit zones.


Keep in mind that the Nasdaq continues to face potential resistance in the 14,149-14,446 zone, highlighted by Wednesday's downside reversal day. It wouldn't be surprising for the tech-heavy index to extend its recent breather around these levels. That would be give leading stocks more time to consolidate before another potential move higher.


Meanwhile, more and more leading stocks are breaking out. And a great resource for daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks that are breaking out past new buy points. Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows stocks nearing buy points in bases.

title: Sellers Scorch Nasdaq Again; Why Cash May Be A Better Play Than Trash Stocks

A nearly 4% thrashing of the Nasdaq composite on Tuesday reaffirmed the importance of two things.




One, a downgrade in IBD's current outlook for stocks matters. Two, cash may not always be king for growth investors, but it can serve a princely role in market downturns.


With the exception of a handful of cyclical (think mainly commodities) stocks, no sector in the market escaped the bear's sharp claws.


Nasdaq Leads A Selling Bonfire
------------------------------


The Nasdaq undercut its March 14 low of 12,555 and ended at its lowest closing level since Dec. 14, 2020. At 12,490, the market cap-weighted composite index is 23% below an all-time peak of 16,212. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF lopped off 3.8%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 got stung with a 2.8% loss. At 4175, the large-cap benchmark now sits 13% below its all-time high of 4818.



While the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.4%, a close at 33,240 means the blue chip index still sits in the territory of an intermediate correction â€” that is, between 10% and 19% off the all-time high. But small caps are in far worse shape. Just look at iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), down 3.2% to its lowest close since Dec. 3, 2020. At 187.67, the ETF has also fallen 23% below its all-time peak.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP042622-260x300.jpg)Volume grew on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 5 basis points to 2.77%.


On Friday, IBD issued its [third change in the market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-falls-hard-again-hospital-coal-steel-mining-stocks-thrashed-kimberly-clark-surges/) to "correction" from "uptrend under pressure" since Jan. 1. So, for the seasoned IBD reader, the relatively modest rebound on Monday, followed by Tuesday's fresh salvo of institutional-quality selling, probably came as no surprise.


IBD downgraded the outlook to correction on Jan. 18 and Feb. 23 as well.


You don't need a Ph.D. in quantum mechanics to appreciate the fact that roughly three out of four stocks generally follow the general market's trend. Yet on Tuesday, the breadth of selling turned out far wider. Initial data from ThinkOrSwim showed falling issues outpacing rising ones by a nearly 5-1 ratio on the Nasdaq (3,927 vs 856), and about 5-1 on the NYSE (2,763 vs 557).


(See the final numbers on the General Market Indicators page, a link at the bottom of every Big Picture column or at [Market Trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) on Investors.com.)


So, while a 3% rebound in West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures to $101.70 a barrel helped draw some buyers back into energy plays earlier in the session, even the most stalwart names within the leading oil and gas exploration industry group faded into losses by day's end.


An initial look at IBD's 197 industry groups showed just three groups up 1% or more on Tuesday: coal (up 9.3%, according to early readings); paints (4.1%) and office supplies (1%).


As noted among the panelists in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live), many market technicians had been waiting to see if the key indexes would undercut their March near-term lows. By doing so, the increasingly weakening action could trigger a spike in fear and climactic selling action that could lead to a new bounce in equities.

Beyond Nasdaq: Market Psychology Today
--------------------------------------


Are we at extreme levels of fear, however?


The [weekly bulls vs. bears ratio from Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) indicates that a vast majority of stock newsletter editors have thrown in the towel. That's good. When bearishness hits extreme levels, the market tends to bottom out and prove nearly everyone wrong.


But the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) (VIX), while roaring nearly 22% on Tuesday, is still far from eclipsing its year-to-date peak of 38.94. Don't forget that ultra-spike in 2020 during the coronavirus bear market. At that time, the VIX muscled to 85.47, the second highest reading since at least 1990.


In short, capitulation-style selling may not be taking place yet.


IBD reported on Monday that the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall), which compares the total activity of typically bearish put options vs. usually bullish calls, hit 1.08 that day. We've just learned that the ratio marks the prior day's action, not the current day. This makes sense, considering how Friday's session gave stocks quite a wallop.


The data delay notwithstanding, sentiment indicators only offer a secondary indicator of the market direction. Let the stock market itself continually act as your primary guide.


In time, a [genuine follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), fortified by good breakouts in heavy volume by companies with superior fundamentals, will offer that primary signal that it's time to deploy at least some of your hard-earned capital into individual names with conviction.


Cash Vs. Trash
--------------



Unsurprisingly, Tuesday's action featured a dearth of new breakouts.


Trash hauler **Waste Management** ([WM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WM)) acted as the exception in the market's decline. Shares rallied 5% to 164.15 after the company's earnings report. Volume was also impressive, surging 81% above the stock's 50-day moving average. Yet the stock backed off its 165.95 buy point in a five-month [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/).


Breakouts this late in the cycle have worked among defensive issues and a few other cyclical areas. Some issues in the candy, beverage, aerospace fields have made some upside progress.


Yet for now, for the investor looking for truly dynamic stock market winners, cash still sits atop the throne.

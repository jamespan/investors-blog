The stock market ended a tough week on a high Friday, with stocks of all stripes surging higher.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was the star of the day as it rose 2.7%. It paddled its way out of danger to post a 0.55% gain for the week, while finding support at the 50-day line. Its next major challenge will be to take the 200-day moving average, though [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) could be a tough hurdle to overcome.


The S&P 500 helped itself to a chunky 1.9% gain, paring its weekly loss to 0.7%. The benchmark index is just a hair above its 200-day line but it has struggled to clear the barrier. The bulls will be hoping it has been taking a breather so it can push past this key level next week.


![Market Pulse Jan 20 2023](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP012023-288x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned in a gain of 1% for the day, but lost 2.7% for the week. Big cap bulls will be disappointed it failed to hold onto its 50-day line, though it is well above the 200-day moving average. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) were among the day's top components.


Small caps had a positive session, with the Russell 2000 jumping 1.7%, though it declined 1.1% for the week. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) did even better, booking a 2.3% gain. However, it remains stuck below declining moving averages.


Job Cuts Help Google Stock, Big Tech
------------------------------------


One reason the Nasdaq benefited: the continued labor bloodletting among Big Tech stocks.


This time it was Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), hitting the headlines after announcing a 12,000 job cut. [Microsoft announced major layoffs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-software-giant-discloses-layoffs/) and a cost-cutting plan on Wednesday. The tech sector as a whole has now shed over 100,000 jobs, according to Bloomberg.


With earnings season ramping up. a wide variety of companies are set to report next week. The likes of aerospace giant **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), rail firm **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) and Big Tech plays **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and Microsoft are all on the horizon.


EV play **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is also releasing results Wednesday. Earnings calls with CEO Elon Musk are always a seasonal highlight for investors.


With encouraging action at week's end, it makes sense for investors to have 40% to 60% market exposure. But given the risky environment, be ready to reduce this to 20% to 40% if bears regain the upper hand.

Netflix Stock Helps This Group Flourish
---------------------------------------


All of the S&P 500 stock market sectors moved higher Friday, with communication services and technology making the best gains. The defensive utilities and health groups lagged.


The relative performance of the IBD industry groups offered a more granular view for investors.


Superregional banks, paint firms, database and desktop software plays were among the biggest winners. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) earnings also gave the Leisure-Movies group a big boost.


On the downside, dairy products, department stores, a variety of food groups and diversified medical plays were the worst performers.

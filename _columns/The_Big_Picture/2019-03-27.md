Sellers were back in the stock market Wednesday, but major stock indexes ended off their worst levels of the session. The S&P 500 index recovered from a 1.1% intraday loss, helped by strength in homebuilders. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, significantly pared a 1.4% drop even as software and semiconductor stocks lagged.




At the close, the Nasdaq composite lagged, falling 0.6%. The S&P 500 index lost 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrials eased 0.1%. The Dow Jones came close to its 50-day moving average but buyers came in and offered support. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which added a distribution day to the count. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly higher than Tuesday.

Falling Bond Yields
-------------------


Bond buying was the culprit again when indexes were at their worst levels of the session. The 10-year Treasury yield fell around 7 basis points intraday but was later trading around 2.38%, down 4 basis points.


Worries about an [economic slowdown in the U.S.](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/inverted-yield-curve/) are out there, which is why money has been flowing into the bond market since early March. The chances of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve by the end of the year have increased substantially, another reason why interest rates have been heading lower. The stock market seemed to move in lockstep with interest rates Wednesday.


S&P 500 Index Leaders
---------------------


**WellCare Health Plans** ([WCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCG)) was the top gainer in the S&P 500 index on news [it's being acquired](https://www.investors.com/news/centene-merger-wellcare-obamacare-health-insurer-giant/) by **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) for $17 billion in cash and stock. WellCare stock jumped 12% on the news. Centene stock slumped 5%.


Homebuilders also outperformed in the S&P 500 index as Wall Street weighed earnings from **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) and S&P 500 component **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)). Helped by lower interest rates, the group has been working its way higher through IBD's 197 industry group rankings. As of Tuesday's close, it was No. 20, up from No. 83 six weeks ago.


The homebuilding group pared gains but still rose more than 1% Wednesday, helped by a strong showing from Lennar. Lennar gapped up over the 50 level, ending at 51.67, up nearly 4%. Shares of KB Home rallied nearly 3%.


Software Stocks Pressured
-------------------------


Software stocks lagged as four software-related groups in IBD's database fell around 2%. But several software names, many on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com), aren't flashing sell signals yet. Security software stock **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) gave back nearly 2% Wednesday, but it's just testing short-term support at the 10-day moving average.


Not all software stocks are healthy, though. After a breakout over a 153.37 handle buy point, **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) rallied 8% from the buy point, but the stock gave up its 50-day moving average Wednesday, falling 2.7% to 155.12.


What Happened To The Chip Stocks?
---------------------------------


Last week, the bulls were optimistic that strength in semiconductor stocks would be another catalyst for the stock market. Indeed, a breakout for VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) looked good on March 15, helped by strong earnings from **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)). The exchange traded fund looked even better on March 21 after **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) reported earnings. But the fund has fallen sharply in three of the past four sessions. It's not a failed breakout yet, but it's a breakout that's clearly under pressure — along with the broad market.


Besides Micron, other big decliners in the Nasdaq 100 Wednesday included **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) and **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)).


The market outlook was lowered a notch to uptrend under pressure last Friday, when the Nasdaq composite plunged 2.5% in higher volume. With the market uptrend under pressure, it's perfectly fine to take some profits in some top performers, especially if a stock has rallied 20% or more after a breakout from a base.


In after-hours trading Wednesday, shares of **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) jumped 10% after reporting [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-q4-2018-lululemon-stock-buy-point/). A breakaway gap for Lululemon could be in the cards Thursday, so the stock bears watching.

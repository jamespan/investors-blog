Stock Market Reverses Sharply Lower; This Time Losses Come In Higher Volume
============================================================================

The stock market reversed sharply lower Thursday, as the major stock indexes declined for a second day in a row. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite gave up a short-term support level, so further weakness could be impending.




As the stock market tries to maintain its uptrend, there are still stocks to consider. Three leading stocks that are in or near buy zones include [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)), **Inspire Medical Systems** ([INSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSP)) and **Toast** ([TOST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOST)).


Jobless Claims, Earnings Results
--------------------------------


In a market where the Federal Reserve's monetary strategy remains closely tied to job market performance, investors are closely watching the Labor Department's initial unemployment claims. Claims rose to 196,000 vs. 183,000 in the previous week, higher than Wall Street's 192,000 estimate. That helped stocks open higher Thursday.


**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) [earnings topped Wall Street's estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-earnings-proxy-war-expected-to-bruise-results/), sending the stock sharply higher at the market open. But the stock closed down 1.3% in heavy turnover.


Other earnings reports that moved stocks Thursday included **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)), **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)), **Axcelis Technologies** ([ACLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACLS)), **Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)) and **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)).


AbbVie gained 2.8% on its [Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abbvie-stock-abbvie-earnings-q4-2022/), while [AstraZeneca](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/azn-stock-astrazeneca-earnings-q4-2022/) rallied nearly 5%. Axcelis advanced 5.8% after [beating expectations for the fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/acls-stock-axcelis-beats-q4-targets-guides-higher/). Impinj pared most of its gains after beating [Wall Street's targets for the fourth quarter.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/impinj-stock-chipmaker-tops-q4-goals/) Lastly, PepsiCo shares climbed almost 1% after beating earnings estimates, raising its dividend and announcing a new stock buyback plan.


New issue **Nextracker** ([NXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXT)) [debuted Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nextracker-ipo-tops-expectations-as-solar-company-raises-638-4-million/), closing nearly 27% above its IPO price of 24. The company raised $638.4 million with an initial public offering that exceeded expectations Thursday, making it the largest IPO since **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) went public in October.


The company makes solar power tracker systems that help to maximize the performance of large-scale utility systems. Trackers adjust and align solar panels throughout the day to always face the sun at the optimal angle.

Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MP020923-250x300.jpg)On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7%, and the S&P 500 lost 0.9%. The Nasdaq declined 1%, as the small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 1.4%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the prior session. Indexes had avoided [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the greater part of January and this month. But Thursday's declines in higher volume gave the S&P 500 a second distribution day, while the Nasdaq received a fresh session of institutional selling.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.4% Thursday as the ETF of top growth stocks dropped for a second straight session. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) surged more than 10% after the company's earnings. The chip leader is nearing a 541.49 buy point.


IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) is in a "confirmed uptrend" amid strong gains this year, with the Nasdaq up 12.6% through Thursday's close. Given the market's ongoing strength, it makes sense to maintain an exposure level of 60%-80%. But the Nasdaq did close below its 10-day moving average for the first time since the Jan. 6 follow-through day, so investors could be in store for more downside.

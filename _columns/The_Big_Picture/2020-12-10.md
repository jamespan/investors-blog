Nasdaq Reverses Higher While Dow, S&P 500 Fall; Airbnb IPO Soars 113% In Debut
===============================================================================

The major stock indexes ended mixed Thursday, as rising jobless claims weighed on the stock market. The Nasdaq composite took the lead, shrugging off early losses and rebounding from Wednesday's sell-off. The Airbnb IPO more than doubled in its debut.




The Nasdaq rallied 0.5%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.1%, though it closed near session highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved down 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1.1%, easily outperforming.


Leading growth stocks also sharply outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.2% on Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) was a top performer, with a nearly 5% advance. Shares remain below their 50-day line, as a new base looks set to take shape.


Volume was 13% lower compared with Wednesday's session on the Nasdaq, and appeared to be lower on the NYSE also.


Nasdaq Reverses Higher
----------------------


![MP121020](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP121020-228x300.jpg)On Thursday morning, the Nasdaq looked to continue lower following Wednesday's sharp sell-off, which [added a distribution day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-a-hit-stimulus-talks-drag-on-doordash-soars-in-debut/) to the Nasdaq and S&P 500. But the Nasdaq quickly reversed into positive territory.


Amid a modest distribution-day count — the Nasdaq has two days of institutional selling, while the S&P 500 has four days over the past few weeks — investors should still have exposure to stocks, though Wednesday's weakness could lead to further downside. However, investors should still be disciplined to avoid extended stocks, while focusing on some of the latest breakouts.


New issues continue to see strong demand. On Thursday, **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) skyrocketed nearly 113% above its [IPO price](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/airbnb-ipo-initial-public-offering-valuation-doordash-abnb/) of 68.


On Wednesday, the **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) IPO surged 85% above its 102 [IPO price](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/doordash-ipo-initial-public-offering-pricing-uber-dash/) to close at 189.51. Shares fell nearly 2% Thursday, although they had been as low as down 8.9%. In another sign of the strong IPO market, **C3.ai** ([AI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AI)) soared more than 120% above its 42 [IPO price](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/c3-ai-ipo-initial-public-offering-pricing-trades-ai/) to close at 92.49 Wednesday on its debut. Shares of the new issue jumped another 40.5% Thursday. C3.ai provides services to build enterprise-scale AI apps.


Despite the hype surrounding these new issues, IBD investors should know to wait for an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) to form. The framework of a good IPO base is simple. The decline from peak to low usually doesn't top 20%, but the most volatile markets have produced declines of up to 50%. The length is often less than five weeks and can be as short as seven days, so these three new issues could be actionable soon.



New Breakouts: Academy Sports, Asana, Twilio
--------------------------------------------


The presence of new breakouts continues to be an encouraging sign. [IPO Leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-retail-leader-academy-sports-outdoors-stock-approaches-new-buy-point/) **Academy Sports & Outdoors** ([ASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASO)) tried to break out above an 18.17 buy point in a short consolidation, but closed below the entry. The stock ended the session 3.7% below the new buy point.


Meanwhile, **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)) surged past a 30.06 buy point in a cup base following the [company's Q3 earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/asana-ipo-asan-stock-pops-earnings/), but also closed below the buy point. Shares advanced as much as 14.7% before paring gains to just 2.7%.


[Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/twilio-stock-nears-buy-point-sales-momentum/), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), broke out above a 333.72 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis, with a 7% advance. The 5% buy zone goes up to 350.41.


Twilio [displays an 88](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-twilio-inc-cl-a-twlo.aspx) out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).

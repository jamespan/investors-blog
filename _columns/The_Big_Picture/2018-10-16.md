Stocks roared more than 2% higher Tuesday, giving investors new hope that the market correction has turned a corner. The Dow Jones industrial average added 2.2%, or 547 points.




The Nasdaq composite led Tuesday's smashing advance, up 2.9% for its best gain since March 26. The beaten-up technology sector rallied, with semiconductor, software and internet stocks among the best performing. The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 3.3%. Biotech and other health care groups pitched in to bolster the Nasdaq. Nasdaq volume rose 22%.


The S&P 500 surged 2.1%, also its best showing since March 26. Significantly, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed a few paces above their 200-day moving averages. That was another good sign in the market's rebound.


Small caps, which slid more than the major indexes, saw the Russell 2000 vault 2.8%.

Habitual readers of The Big Picture may wonder if Tuesday's surge amounted to a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). The short answer is no. A follow-through must feature not only a big index rally, but it must occur at least four days from an index low. On Tuesday, indexes were only three days into a rally attempt.


So investors should not increase exposure to stocks just yet. Still, a follow-through signal certainly is possible in the coming days. A lasting bottom needs a few days to develop and to get short-covering out of the way. But when it does, treat it with respect. Every major market bottom has come with a follow-through, even though not all follow-throughs work.


Just about everything else was positive about Tuesday's stock market. Breadth was impressive. Advancers led decliners by a more than 5-1 ratio on the NYSE and by more than 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


It was curious that there were no good breakouts despite the big market gains. **Imperial Oil** ([IMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMO)) reversed after topping a 34.39 buy point. **Freshpet** ([FRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRPT)) had weak volume, and it's a thinly traded stock. When the market follows through, at least several good breakouts happen on the same day.


That may be due to the nature of the market's correction. The indexes fell sharply in early October, and other times when there's been abrupt breaks like that, the market often makes a couple of short-lived rallies before it settles into a lasting uptrend. Last February was an example of that.


Factor this into the market analysis, too: Indexes seemed overdue for a rebound. Sentiment indicators — namely the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) and the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX — flashed bottoming signals in the past several days.

Also, take into consideration the condition of leading stocks. Many are barely recovering from steep declines, so breakouts will need to wait. About half the IBD 50 stocks remain below the 50-day line.


Leading stocks on the whole were strong, with the IBD 50 up 3.5%, the best day since March 26. A dozen components rose back above the 50-day moving average.


A handful of top stocks are rising from support at the 50-day moving average, such as **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) and **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)). In a new market uptrend, those could be the earliest buy opportunities.


If the market truly is bottoming, health care is one sector to watch. Many medical stocks are acting well, and the sector got a boost with [Johnson & Johnson's better-than-expected earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dow-jones-stock-johnson-and-johnson-earnings/) Tuesday.


Earnings Tuesday mainly were good and provided some relief. After the close, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) rocketed after the video streaming company beat subscriber expectations and gave a sunny outlook. Netflix, one of the 12-largest Nasdaq components, should give the market a boost Wednesday.


**IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), however, fell in extended trading after [revenue missed expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-third-quarter-earnings/).


Some traders cited economic data for the market's jump. The job-openings and industrial-production reports came in positive. It was as if the market forgot about worrisome inflation and retail numbers that came out in the past few days.


As market veterans know, when the market gets its appetite back, it eats. And on Tuesday, it feasted.

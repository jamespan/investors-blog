The stock market was little changed Monday as it started a week that may look much different by the time it's over.




Stocks made tentative moves Monday, seemingly waiting for a catalyst. The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed essentially flat.


Since indexes fell below their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) last week, the stock market uptrend has broken stride. Although indexes held above their 21-day lines Monday, there are several indications that justify raising some cash right now.


The three major indexes last week also fell below trend lines drawn from their January lows. The Dow now teeters at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


The Nasdaq's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) has weakened to D-. The S&P 500's A/D Rating is down to C. At the start of March, those ratings stood at B and A-, respectively.


The eight distribution days on the Nasdaq and seven on the S&P 500 are another reason for investors to be more guarded. IBD's [recommended exposure is 40%-60%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now).


Stock Market No Longer Favors Growth
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP040824.jpg)The Nasdaq outperformed the S&P 500 through the beginning of March. Since then, the S&P is beating the Nasdaq. Sector rotation explains some of it, notably among growth and value stocks.


In January and February, the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) climbed more than 10%, while iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) rose 3%. But since the start of March, the value index is up nearly 3% and the growth index is down 0.1%.


The IBD 50 index — a proxy for growth leaders — had outperformed with a 15.2% gain in the first two months of the year. It is down about 0.4% since March 1.


Gold, energy and materials sectors are providing some opportunities. Breakouts for **Eldorado Gold** ([EGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGO)), **Carpenter Technology** ([CRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRS)), **Alamos Gold** ([AGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGI)) and **SeaDrill** ([SDRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SDRL)) are examples of that trend.


Very little in the tech sector has been breaking out. And the majority of breakouts in the [MarketSurge 250 index](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/) over the past couple of weeks are stalled near their buy points or below them.


Meanwhile, small caps have been an enigma all year. The Russell 2000 is in a trend of higher highs and higher lows, yet it has met resistance around 2,100. Since mid-February, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) has been making lower lows and lower highs.


On Monday, the Russell 2000 led the stock market with a 0.5% increase.


Market Gets Inflation, Earnings Reports
---------------------------------------


On Wednesday, the consumer price index for March is due to be released. The report could have even greater significance than usual, after some Fed officials downplayed the chances of an interest-rate cut.


On Thursday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said that if inflation continues to move sideways, it would make him doubt that any rate cuts are needed at all this year. Also last week, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic wrote that businesses may "pounce" on the first rate cut. And that could reignite inflationary pressures. He cautioned there may be fewer than the three rate cuts the Fed has penciled in.


Kashkari is [scheduled to speak Monday evening](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


Bond traders now put the odds of June rate cut at about 50-50 vs. 57% a month ago, and odds have also diminished for the July and September meetings. For the end of the year, the bond market puts a 32% chance of a rate cut and the same for no rate cut at all.


On Friday, several major banks will announce the first wave of first-quarter results. Earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to climb 3.2% in Q1, which would be the third straight quarter of profit growth, according to FactSet.


Stock Market Faces First Earnings Wave
--------------------------------------


But before anyone celebrates, FactSet notes the number and percentage of S&P 500 companies issuing negative profit guidance for the first quarter are both above their five- and 10-year averages. And then there's the Magnificent Seven effect, which shows just how much the S&P earnings picture rests on the biggest stocks.


The five Magnificent Seven stocks that should report earnings growth in the first quarter are expected to drive all, or more than five percentage points, of the total increase in S&P 500 EPS, said Jeffrey Buchbinder, Chief Equity Strategist at LPL Research, in a report Monday.


"As a group, the Mag 7 are expected to report earnings growth near 40% year over year, while the rest of the S&P 500 — the 493 — will need to deliver some healthy upside just to match the earnings from the year-ago quarter," Buchbinder said.

Stock Market Mixed In Volatile Trade After More Hot Inflation Data; Why Merck Is A Market Leader
=================================================================================================

The stock market finished mixed in a volatile session that saw the major stock indexes hit new correction lows before rebounding. The Nasdaq composite dived as much as 2.25% before a dramatic final hour of trade sent the tech-heavy index into positive territory.




The 10-year Treasury yield declined for a fourth-straight session, closing at 2.81%, despite another elevated inflation number. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield traded as high as 3.16%, its highest level since November 2018.


The producer price index rose 0.5% in April from March and 11% from the year-ago figure. The inflation rates slowed from 1.6% and 11.5%, respectively, in the previous month. While the monthly increase met the Econoday consensus estimate, the annual increase was above estimates of 10.7%.


On Wednesday, a report said April's consumer price index rose at an annual pace of 8.3%, down vs. the previous month's 8.5%, but higher than economists projected.

Coffee shop chain **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) and **Rivian** ([RIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIVN)) also reported earnings. BROS stock crashed nearly 27%. And [Rivian shares](https://www.investors.com/news/li-auto-rivian-earnings-q1-outlook-will-be-key-tesla-rivals/) surged 18%, but it's still on pace to lose more than 15% this week after the company maintained its 2022 production guidance.


New Stock Market Rally Attempts Start
-------------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slashed losses to 0.3% Thursday, but still extended a losing streak to six sessions. The S&P 500 cut its loss to 0.1%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 1.2%.


The Nasdaq composite reversed from sharp losses to move up less than 0.1%. With an intraday decline of more than 31% from its prior high, the Nasdaq surpassed the loss during the pandemic sell-off of March 2020 on a closing basis. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the composite plummeted 30.1% in the Covid crash from highest to lowest close.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


The S&P sectors finished sharply mixed, with communication services and health care rising 1.2% and 1%, respectively. Technology and utilities were the worst performers, both selling off 1%.


Growth stocks also reversed from sharp losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) finished unchanged after hitting a new 52-week low. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC))dived 6% after the company's largest investor — **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) — sold a part of its stake. ABC stock slashed through its 50-day moving average, which is a [key sell signal.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/)


Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 marked the first day of [new rally attempts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). The Nasdaq's upside reversal is a standard Day 1. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 finished down for the day, but closed in the upper half of the session's trading range, which also qualifies as a Day 1. If these indexes undercut Thursday's lows, the rally attempt will end.

Drug Giants Eli Lilly, Merck Are Market Leaders
-----------------------------------------------



If the market were to continue to rebound, Dow Jones pharmaceutical giant **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), for example, is one of the top stocks to watch after closing Thursday above a [cup-with-handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) 89.58 buy point. Shares rallied nearly 2%, extending a win streak to three sessions. The [5% buy area](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) goes up to 94.06, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [MRK stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-merck-and-co-inc-mrk.aspx) boasts a 98 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Meanwhile, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) skyrocketed to more new highs this week, as the [drug leader](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/merck-in-spotlight-after-earnings-beat-and-big-covid-pill-sales/) bucks the market downtrend.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) is another one of the top stocks to watch following Thursday's 1.8% gain. Shares are holding just above a prior cup base's 284 buy point and are trying to maintain their 50-day line.


Remember that the current market conditions are not conducive to new purchases. Still, both stocks are holding up extremely well, so they should be added to watchlists.

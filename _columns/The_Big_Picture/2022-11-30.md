title: Stock Market Powers Higher After Powell Confirms Pivot To Slower Rate Hikes; China Stocks On Fire

The stock market indexes rallied strongly on Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a gathering at the Brookings Institute that it "makes sense" to moderate the pace of rate hikes. However, he still expects rates to rise to "a sufficiently restrictive level."




Powell added that a slowing of hikes [could happen as early as the December Fed meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chief-jerome-powell-stays-hawkish-but-sp-500-rises/). Major benchmarks posted spectacular gains.


Big Tech stocks led the upside, powering the Nasdaq composite 4.4% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2% while the S&P 500 gained 3.1%, lifting to a two-month high. The Russell 2000 small-cap index nearly matched blue chips, up 2.8%.


The S&P 500 closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since April.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq went ballistic, booking double-digit percentage gains compared to Tuesday, signaling widespread participation.


The S&P 500's Oct. 31 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) was removed because the index has climbed more than 5% from that day's close. That left the S&P with just one distribution day and the Nasdaq with a still-moderate three.


The 10-year Treasury yield went south after Powell's comments, dropping to 3.70%.


Crude oil continued to recover, settling around $80.50 per barrel.


In crypto-related trading, **Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) jumped more than 6% after dipping toward the Nov. 21 all-time low. Bitcoin surged above $17,000 to a three-week high.


The 2023 Stock Market
---------------------


Stock market players speculated for weeks about the Fed pivoting to slower interest rate hikes, ifÂ  Central bankers are now crystal clear they're pointed in that direction, setting the stage for a 50-basis point hike in two weeks, and a more-nuanced Fed policy in 2023.


Wednesday's surge now raises expectations the stock market rally will reignite, and fourth-quarter historic resilience seems to support that thesis. The S&P 500 closed higher in November, up for two months in a row for the first time this year.

However, the second phase of Fed tightening could signal a long period of market malaise and even lower stock prices.


Employment is holding up well but that's normal in the early phase of an economic contraction. Employers don't want to hand out pink slips during the holidays and new budgets don't kick in until January.


But job cut announcements have bombarded the newswires in recent weeks, especially in the tech and services sectors. So the first quarter is likely to produce some very bad monthly job reports.


Economic data is warning us about this development, with the majority of leading indicators pointing to a sharp 2023 slowdown. The November Chicago purchasing managers index on Wednesday was the latest report to sound the alarm, posting a 37.2 reading that missed estimates by a wide margin. Any sub-50 reading marks contraction territory.


Real job losses are almost inevitable at this point and they're likely to damage market sentiment, at least in the early phases. Which is why many analysts predict that 2023 will mark a painful continuation of the stock market's struggles.


China Stock Rally May Not Last
------------------------------


China stock markets have taken off this week, fueled by the Communist Party's backtracking on its zero-Covid policy in reaction to protests.


World markets move on spreadsheets, not social or political causes, so higher prices don't predict how protesters or locked-down citizens will fare in this conflict. But it does raise hopes for a more rapid economic recovery that fuels world demand and a faster recovery.



**Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) highlights the damage done to these stocks since the mid-2020 rally, down 82% into the October 2022 low. But it's bounced in the last six weeks and lifted nearly 16% in the last five trading days.


Despite the surge, BABA stock is trading below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and needs weeks of positive price action to enter a new uptrend.


**KraneShares CSI China internet ETF** ([KWEB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KWEB)) has become a popular play for the short-term trading crowd this week. It rose nearly 8% on Wednesday and has gained more than 18% since last week.


The fund sliced through the 2013 low at 25.85 in the first quarter of this year, hitting an all-time low at 17.22 on Oct. 24. That marked the culmination of an 84% 19-month decline.


It's been testing that low since March but [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) still can't identify a well-organized basing pattern.


The good news: The fund is trading above the 200-day moving average for the first time since the second quarter of 2021.


The bad news: Conflict at this moving average can unfold over months, not days. As a result, it's wise to curb your enthusiasm on China stocks and not get in over your head.

Stocks In Focus
---------------



Cybersecurity firm **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) fell 14.8% in Wednesday's stock market after beating Q3 estimates but lowering sales guidance. Stifel lowered the firm's rating from buy to hold, dropping the price target to 120. I.T. departments tend to cut spending on security issues when budgets are tightened.


IBD 50 component **TotalEnergies** ([TTE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTE)) surged into the buy zone of a four-month cup base, gaining 2.3%. The chart also could be interpreted as a double bottom with a 55.08.


Dozens of oil and gas stocks have made this list in 2022, but recent performance has been spotty, at best. However, the group and commodity may have bottomed out for now, with China hopes back on the table.

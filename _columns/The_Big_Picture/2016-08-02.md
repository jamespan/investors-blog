The five-week rally is in need of a serious break. It certainly got one Tuesday.


Stocks fell en masse amid another heap of news -- including lackluster U.S. vehicle sales in July and a weaker-than-expected increase in personal income in June -- that seemed to further affirm the dull growth going on in the U.S. economy today. Volume rose.


The Nasdaq composite, which has led the rebound that began after the June 23 Brexit surprise, fell 0.9%. The market-cap-weighted index rebounded a degree in the early afternoon, yet still finished in the lower half of the intraday range.


The S&P 500 slipped 0.6% while the Dow industrials fell 0.5%. Other indexes fared worse. The Russell 2000, a popular gauge of small-cap stock action, fell 1.4%. Dow Jones transports got slammed 2.1%.


![MP080216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP080216-196x300.jpg)Higher volume on both major exchanges clearly signaled an eagerness among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, pensions and the like to take profits off the table. Prior to Tuesday's sell-off, the Nasdaq had rallied as much as 13.7% from its June low, while the S&P 500 gained 9.1%, and the Dow industrials 9.1%.


Over the prior five weeks, the overall complexion of the stock market improved dramatically. Before Tuesday's sell-off, the Accumulation/Distribution ratings of both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 showed a positive C+ grade. Mine the IBD 6000, and you'll see that more than 3,800 stocks showed an Accumulation grade of A or B, indicating heavy buying by the institutional crowd. In contrast, fewer than 1,100 stocks showed a D or E.


(You can see the latest numbers by clicking on the link at the bottom of this page; stats on the IBD 6000 are found in the left-hand side of the Nasdaq daily chart.)


However, Tuesday's decline certainly differed in tone from other distribution days in which the major indexes fell 0.2% or more in higher volume. The Nasdaq's drop far exceeded its 0.4% and 0.3% declines on July 19 and 21.


Check out the NYSE advance-decline line, found just underneath the price bars of the S&P 500 chart on the general market indicators page. After months of a slow-yet-steady rise, the line has begun to flatten out. This means that the gap between rising stocks and falling ones has virtually closed.


Should the advance-decline line hold steady, it would be a blessing for the bulls.


**General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) slumped more than 4% after the auto and truck giant reported a 1.9% drop in sales for July. The stock closed below its 50-day line in volume 82% above average. But don't paint a completely drab picture for the industry. **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)), which got spun off from the owner of the Jeep and Dodge brands, **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)), galloped ahead 1.6% in heavy volume for a third straight gain after reporting solid revenue and unit sales growth in the second quarter.


Unlike GM, **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), **Toyota** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), Fiat Chrysler and **Honda Motor** ([HMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HMC)), the well known maker of luxury sports cars has broken through long price downtrends. Since hitting a low of 31.66 on Feb. 11, Ferrari has rallied 47%, climbing back above its 50- and 200-day moving averages in the process. The stock is now less than 24% below an all-time high of 60.97. The Street is expecting Ferrari's earnings to rise 24% to $2.09 a share this year.


Will Ferrari become a market leader?


Too early to tell. Don't try to predict what the market will do. Instead, make patience a virtue. Every great stock will complete a well-formed base and break out to new highs. Predictions are unnecessary. The same goes for even past big winners such as **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), which climbed sharply Tuesday on reports that some pharmaceutical giants may have considered making a bid for the high-class biotech and maker of a top MS treatment, Tecfidera.


However, your chances of success with growth stocks will likely rise if you focus on companies that show quarter after quarter of high double-digit or even triple-digit growth. The **[IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)** and the **[Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/)** are good places to begin your search.


As you determine whether to sell and take partial profits in a stock or to exit with as little loss as possible, keep an eye out for action near round numbers. China's **Yirendai** ([YRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YRD)) is a case in point. The new consumer loan marketplace and IBD 50 member ran up just above 30 early Tuesday before crashing lower, ending at 25.22, off nearly 11% in huge volume. Notice how on the daily chart, the intraday high and low exceeded the range of the prior day. Known as an "outside day," such action tends to mark a change in trend.


With a gain that topped 100% since its breakout past a 14.97 entry, Yirendai is certainly ready for a rest. Yet other market leaders, such as **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)) and **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) showed mild action in their pullbacks on Tuesday. **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) had trouble rising past 200; now that price level could act as a support area.

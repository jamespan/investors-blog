  Stock Market Rally Continues, As This Top Growth Stock Breaks Out

The stock market rally continued Monday, as the trading session ended with modest gains. All three major indexes — the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials — reached record highs.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the trading day with a 0.2% gain. The other major stock indexes fared a bit worse. The S&P 500 edged higher, held back by weakness in the energy sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 27 points, or 0.1% — weighed down by investment banks **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) in the wake of **Citigroup's** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) [earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/citigroup-earnings-q2-2019-citigroup-stock/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP071519-237x300.jpg)Volume on the Nasdaq was lower compared with Friday's trading. Preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume as well.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index continued to underperform, falling 0.5% Monday. While the other major stock indexes hit record highs today, the Russell 2000 remains 10% off its all-time high — set on August 31, 2018. The small-cap index contains riskier assets and is widely considered a key measure of investor risk appetite.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq with a solid 0.4% gain amid mostly positive action. A broad array of strength among top growth stocks more than offset the pervasive weakness in financial stocks.

Current Stock Market Rally
--------------------------


All three major stock indexes notched record highs early Monday after modest gains.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq still has only three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), showing that institutions aren't heavily selling at current levels. Be on the lookout for sharp downside reversals and clustering distribution days. These could be early signs of impending future weakness.


Another insightful way to analyze the current market is to check the action among the top growth stocks. If high-quality stocks are breaching their key support levels in above-average volume, then the stock market could be deteriorating. Instead, Monday showed more positive action with a high-profile breakout from cybersecurity leader **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)). Meanwhile, others may be putting the finishing touches on bases, like **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)).


Broad Strength Among IBD 50 Stocks
----------------------------------



Chinese stocks perked up Monday with IBD 50 stock **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) closing with a 2.3% advance. Shares triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) from a 98.09 buy point last week, but are rebounding from their 50-day support level. The Chinese education provider is a Leaderboard watchlist stock idea.


Digital payment stocks continue outperform amid the stock market rally. Brazilian payment processor **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) gained as much as 4.9% to 45.66 before trimming gains to about 1% at the close. The recent [IBD Stock of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/pagseguro-digital-stock-time-to-sell/) is well above the 20% to 25% profit-taking level from a 31.74 cup entry.



On the downside, top financial stocks **NMI Holdings** ([NMIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMIH)) and **Essent** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) declined 5.8% and 3.4%, respectively.


Meanwhile, **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) stumbled about  3.5%. The stock may be adding a handle to a cup base with a current buy point of 48.82, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


Top Stocks Nears Buy Points: CyberArk, Salesforce, Twitter
----------------------------------------------------------



Despite a modest overall day in the stock market, a number of high-quality growth stocks made big upsides moves, placing a bullish filter on Monday's action.


Top cybersecurity stock CyberArk [surged to a breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/cyberark-stock-twitter-stock-salesforce-stock-match-stock-autodesk-stock-near-buy-points/) above a 138.83 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). The stock surged more than 6% on a 150% increase in volume, signifying strong institutional demand at these prices. The stock's strong move placed it back on the IBD [Leaderboard Leaders](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) list.


**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) moved up 1% and is approaching a 163.09 entry in an odd cup with handle. Shares are just 3% away from the entry. But the stock's [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) leaves much to be desired. It is well off its highs amid the near-three month correction.



IBD 50 stock Twitter is [nearing a 41.02 buy point](https://www.investors.com/research/twitter-stock-buy-now/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). Shares are within striking distance of the entry after Monday's 2% advance. A potential flaw is the stock's lagging [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Investors use the RS line to find stocks that are beating the general market and can be potential stock market winners. Shares rose 2.25% Monday.


Lastly, Zoom Video is working on the right side of a new base. The stock advanced nearly 7% in heavy volume. Shares are still about 7% from their highs.

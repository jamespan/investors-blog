title: Stock Market Continues Losing Streak; December Witching Dead Ahead

The stock market failed to attract buying interest on Wednesday, dropping all major indexes into the red. S&P 500 fell for the fifth day in a row but selling pressure feels washed out, with lopsided technicals raising odds for an oversold bounce into next week's quadruple witching options and futures expirations.




Big Tech stocks underperformed once again, dropping the Nasdaq composite 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower by just two points while the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index split the difference, down 0.3%.


The S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average for the third day in a row but is holding support at the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), at least so far.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE volume nearly matched Tuesday levels, according to early closing data. Trading ranges narrowed, signaling apathy and indecision.


The 10-year Treasury yield continued to slump, down to 3.41%. Crude oil got pummeled once again, dropping to a 52-week low at $72.30 per barrel.


In crypto-related trading, **Coinbase Global** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) fell more than 2% and is testing November's all-time low. It now expects 2022 crypto-related revenue to decline "by 50% or more." Bitcoin settled near $16,800.


Stock Market Rally At Risk
--------------------------


The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 have all reversed around their 200-day moving averages. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is outperforming the broad market, still situated well above that critical level.


All major indexes will need to hold their 50-day moving averages to gather enough strength to start another rally attempt.

Bull markets need widening participation in order to survive. That hasn't happened in the latest rally attempt, at least so far, so a more defensive posture may be needed. The inverted yield curve seems to support this view, predicting weaker economic conditions in 2023.


However, major benchmarks are around May's levels, grinding sideways in potential basing patterns. That suggests current prices are close to fair value, given what we know right now. Many old-timers insist that price is the best leading indicator because the market discounts all that is known and unknown about the future.


So, at least from that viewpoint, we could be on solid footing.


Witching Options, Futures Expiration
------------------------------------


December index futures will roll into the March forward month later this week, signaling the start of the last options expiration of 2022. This period will culminate on Friday Dec. 16 with the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock futures, stock index futures and stock index options contracts. That's why it's commonly called "quadruple witching."


The month or so between November and December expirations traditionally marks a period when fund managers adjust their portfolios to make annual results look more appealing to investors. This tweaking process is popularly known as [window dressing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/windowdressing.asp).


Managers also use December witching to lock in annual gains or losses, so they can head out for the holidays and not worry about losing their shirts in a year-end bear raid. As a result, volume should decline precipitously after expiration even though there will be 4-1/2 more trading days until Christmas.


Many investors avoid the run up into year's end completely, taking off until January. However, trading opportunities can be numerous in these thin conditions because the mice like to play when the cat's away.

Wednesday Stocks In Focus
-------------------------


**PayPal Holdings** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) surged 3% in Wednesday's stock market after saying it is on track to grow revenue approximately 9% this year, better than 6.6% estimates. The fintech noted that earnings were ahead of estimates as well. The rally could signal the low of a 78-day-old consolidation pattern.


PYPL stock has lost 61% so far this year.



IBD 50 component **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) powered back into the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) after a pullback to the 50-day line. It first entered that territory after mounting the 148.94 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) of a monthlong consolidation. WING stock gained 2.7%.


The relative strength line has turned higher after a weeklong downturn, adding a positive note to the bullish setup.


The fast food upstart is expected to post double-digit earnings growth in 2023, despite higher commodity prices.

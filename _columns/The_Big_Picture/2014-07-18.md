Nasdaq Delivers Best Gain In Two Months, But Volume Fades
==========================================================

Stocks rumbled higher in lower volume Friday, turning the major indexes positive for the week despite two days of heavy-volume selling.


The Nasdaq advanced 1.6%, its best gain in more than two months. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1% and 0.7%, respectively.


The IBD 50 surged 1.8%.


Volume shrank on the NYSE and the Nasdaq. Friday was an options expirations day, making the lower volume somewhat surprising.


A distribution day fell off the count because of time. Distribution, which points to institutional selling, becomes irrelevant to current conditions after 25 sessions. The June 12 round of distribution on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached the stale level.


With the market uptrend under pressure, individual investors should remain cautious. The goal is to buy the best stocks at the best time, and this is not the best time to be buying.


Still, for the past couple of years, the market has shown the ability to avoid even a 10% correction. The last such retreat was from September to November 2012, when the Nasdaq pulled back 12%. Earlier this year, the Nasdaq came close, dropping 9.7% off its high. Most pullbacks have been in the 3% to 7% range.


For individual investors, this trend means that the current headwinds could be brief. The retreat from the Nasdaq's July 3 high was 3%, and it's possible that's as bad as it will get. Even a pullback to the 50-day line would take only a 4% draw off the high. A pullback to the 200-day line would need an almost 8% drawdown.


Gains in the indexes — after a light pullback — also have been restrained.


Like it or not, investors are forced to play a game of small ball.


It doesn't take much to turn the trend, but it isn't so much a stampede as it is a stroll from one side of the field to the other.


The chipmaker **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) is a good example of how hard it is to play a winner in this atmosphere. An investor who bought Skyworks when it broke out in mid-January could have a 73% gain through Friday's close.


Yet the investor would've had to sit tight as Skyworks corrected 5% after the breakout, 13% off a high in March, 9% in May, 8% in June and 6% in July.


Sitting tight isn't easy to do when the general market keeps sending uncertain messages.


Economic news was light Friday.


The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey and U.S. leading indicators both fell short of the Street's estimates.


For the week, the S&P 500 added 0.5% and the Nasdaq 0.4%. The Dow gained 0.9%, but the IBD 50 dropped 0.6%.


Q2 earnings season will remain in high gear in the coming week, with reports from **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) on Monday, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) on Tuesday and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) on Wednesday.

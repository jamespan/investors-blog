The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 269 points on Thursday, as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to its highest level since early March in the wake of strong GDP data. Up next, the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation indicator, the core PCE price index, is due out Friday morning.




As the stock market uptrend pulls back from its 2023 highs, these three stock market leaders are in or near buy zones: [IBD Leaderboard watchlist](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)).


Early Thursday, first-time jobless claims from the Labor Department unexpectedly dropped to 239,000 vs. 264,000 in the previous week. They were estimated to rise to 270,000. Further, the Commerce Department's final estimate of first-quarter GDP rose to 2%, higher than the expected 1.4% increase.


The strong economic data pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to 3.85%, closing at its highest level since March 9. Meanwhile, investors now see a nearly 87% chance of a quarter-point hike at the Fed's July meeting, per [CME FedWatch Tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) That's up from 74% one week ago.


Friday's personal income and outlays report for May will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. While the overall PCE inflation rate could slip below 4% for the first time since March 2021, core prices, excluding food and energy, are seen rising 0.4% on the month. That would leave the core inflation rate near April's 4.7%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062923-249x300.jpg)On Thursday, **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **McCormick** ([MKC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKC)), **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)) and **Simply Good Foods** ([SMPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMPL)) were key earnings movers. Meanwhile, Dow Jones component **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) reported after the close. Nike shares fell around 2% in extended trade.


Micron stock sold off more than 4%, while McCormick slid 5.5%. Paychex shares reversed from early gains to fall 1.3%. SMPL stock jumped 3.4% but remains stuck below the 200-day line.


Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Leads
-----------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the stock market higher, rallying 0.8%. In the Dow 30, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) slid 2%, falling further below its 33.84 buy point. So far, however, there is no sell signal.


On the upside, **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) were big gainers. Goldman shares rallied 3% but remain below their 50-day line. JPM stock advanced 3.5%, bouncing off the 50-day line and again topping a flat base's 143.37 entry.


Market performance varied by index. The S&P 500 climbed nearly 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite ended slightly lower. The small-cap Russell 2000 moved up 1.2%, with help from rising regional banks.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE from the prior session. The [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remained at three apiece, which is a manageable number.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.4% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) took a well-deserved rest after solid gains from a May 3 breakout move. Uber stock declined 3.8% Thursday.


This week, the Nasdaq successfully defended support at the 21-day exponential moving average, which should offer a shot of confidence to investors. With the ongoing stock market pullback still in normal shape, IBD's recommended market exposure still sits at 60%-80%.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Chipotle, Lam Research, MongoDB
--------------------------------------------------------------



Chipotle passed an early entry at 2,092.51 on Wednesday and is approaching a flat base's 2,139.88 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


[Per Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), all of the key moving averages are rising steadily, a good technical sign. Since March, volume on the upside has mostly dwarfed turnover during price drops. In recent weeks, the up/down volume ratio was at a ridiculously bullish level of 2.6 before cooling off some.


[Lam Research](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/lrcx-stock-lam-research-seen-getting-ai-spending-lift/) moved above a 615.80 early buy point and a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 630.72 entry during this week's gains.


Last week, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis raised his price target on LRCX stock to 575 from 475 but kept his equal-weight, or neutral, rating. The "AI wave" will boost spending on leading-edge semiconductor capital equipment, lifting sales for Lam as well as Applied Materials and KLA, Curtis said.


[MongoDB is trading tightly](https://www.investors.com/research/ai-stock-mongodb-eyes-buy-point-after-mdb-stock-surges-on-earnings/) after its recent earnings-fueled gap-up, offering a new entry. The three-weeks-tight formation shows a buy point at 398.89, and shares are in the buy zone that goes up to 418.83. Further, aggressive investors could have used a trendline-entry around 386.

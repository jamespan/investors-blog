  Dow Leads Gains, But Stock Bounce Leaves Much To Be Desired

Stocks rose Tuesday but recovered little of the prior session's losses as the market gave enough mixed signals to keep its outlook unclear.




The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.5% increase thanks to eight components that rose about 1% or more. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) had the largest percentage gains, but Boeing, which closed at 337.63, did the heavy lifting for the price-weighted Dow.


The Nasdaq climbed 0.3% and the S&P 500 rose 0.1%. Those gains paled in comparison with Monday's losses of 1.4% to 1.8%. The Russell 2000 closed nearly flat as weakness in regional banks weighed on the small-cap index. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Still, the Nasdaq has something to build on after it found support at its 50-day moving average Monday. The S&P 500 and Dow remain below their 50-day lines, contributing to a mixed picture in the broad market. The S&P climbed back above its 50-day earlier this month, but the Dow hasn't quite gotten that far.

**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has plummeted 9% this week, sinking below the 50-day line. Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated rules related to [user data that made its way to the Trump campaign via an analysis firm](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-data-leak-failure-will-bring-fierce-scrutiny-regulatory-risk/).


**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) plunged 9% after the company's latest results showed a slow transition to cloud businesses.


It's been three months since **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) moved from the NYSE to the Nasdaq, and it hasn't done the Nasdaq any favors. The soft drink and snack giant sold off in early February and is 10% below its Jan. 23 high, so count it among the index's drags.


The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) on Monday rose more than 20% above its 10-day moving average. That's a bottoming signal that previously occurred in the March 2 market bottom. The put-call volume ratio has not spiked the way it did during the early-February and early-March bottoms, depriving the market of another positive sign so far.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain in a pattern of higher highs and higher lows. So in the longer term the trend is still positive. The more immediate question is whether distribution that's cropped up lately poses a larger threat. Investors certainly have some items to weigh before committing fully to equities.


On Wednesday, new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will likely preside over the first interest-rate hike of his new tenure. While investors are expecting a quarter-point increase, they'll be focusing on any hints about future hikes. Foreign [trade policy](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tariffs-on-china-make-steel-fight-look-minor/), geopolitics and deregulation are other key considerations.


While the major indexes left something to be desired, leading stocks handled themselves splendidly Tuesday. Even in Monday's market tumble, the leading stocks performed relatively better. That's an important foundation if the market should attempt new highs.


The IBD 50 climbed 1.3%, with all but five stocks rising on the day. **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) did the best, surging 11.5% to a new high after the health-savings-account administrator beat profit expectations. IBD Leaderboard also beat the S&P 500.


Energy stocks were some of Tuesday's best after crude prices climbed 2.2% to settle at a three-week high of $63.40 a barrel. Traders expect President Trump to crack down on Iran following a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.


Monday's heavy selling on Wall Street caused IBD to downgrade its market outlook to uptrend under pressure. Investors should be limiting stock purchases and taking some profits.

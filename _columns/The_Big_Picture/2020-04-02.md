title: Stock Market Jumps, But Bullish Day Comes With Caveats

Stock market bottoms often come when they're least expected and when headlines are the most dire, so it wasn't a huge surprise to see the S&P 500 make a bullish move Thursday.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 led the way with gains of 2.2% to 2.3%. The Nasdaq composite added 1.7%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index rose 1.3%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was higher on the NYSE.


The combination of the S&P 500's price gain and higher NYSE volume resulted in a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). But it was a follow-through day with plenty of caveats, including the fact that all of the S&P 500's top percentage gainers hailed from the beaten-down oil patch. In the early stages of a new bull market, the strongest leadership tends to come from stocks breaking out of well-formed [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) — not stocks near 52-week lows.


U.S. crude oil futures settled at $25.32 a barrel, up nearly 25%, after President Donald Trump said he expects Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut output to stabilize oil prices.


Where's The Leadership?
-----------------------

Be patient, and let setups take shape. There's still a large number of stocks that need more time to reach buy points.


It also bears mention that follow-through days that occur after a sharp break below the 50- or 200-day moving average (like in February) often need time to find their footing. In other words, sometimes they don't work. For now, it's OK to try a stock or two on for size, but start small until the uptrend solidifies.


Also keep in mind that it can take several weeks for leadership to emerge after a follow-through day. When the S&P 500 followed through on Jan. 4, 2019, **Mastercard**'s ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) breakout from a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) base didn't occur until the week ended Feb. 1.


Stock Market Rallies As Jobless Claims Soar
-------------------------------------------


The stock market looked past two very negative headlines Thursday.


The first was that weekly jobless claims soared to 6.6 million in the latest week from 3.3 million the prior week. The 6.6 million print was well above the highest estimate of 4.5 million. The data came ahead of Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls in March down 150,000. But the consensus range is very wide — as high as a loss of 1.25 million jobs to a gain of 100,000. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 3.9% from 3.5%. But the consensus range is wide here as well, stretching from 3.6% to 5.2%.

Meanwhile, Thursday's bullish showing for the stock market came as the coronavirus continues to spread in the U.S. and abroad. Confirmed cases worldwide topped 1 million Thursday, according to [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries), while new cases in the U.S. continue to rise rapidly. The good news is that while Italy's death rate remains high, new cases have leveled off.


The stock market has rallied nicely off lows in anticipation of a recovery for the economy in the second half of the year. That's also in line with Federal Reserve Jerome Powell's line of thinking. President Trump and his coronavirus team are still modeling a flattening in new U.S. cases by the end of April, with new cases slowing to a crawl by early July. If that scenario doesn't pan out, and the U.S. recession extends into the third quarter, then a test of lows for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 certainly isn't out of the question. For now, Thursday's follow-through day must be respected.


Leaders Under Pressure
----------------------


Despite bullish gains for the stock market Thursday, some leading growth stocks came under selling pressure.


After three straight declines, big sellers were in **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)). After a solid breakout over a 107.44 buy point, Zoom could be poised for a test of its 50-day moving average, which happens to correspond to the stock's last buy area. Zoom's videoconferencing platform has seen booming use in recent weeks, but the company is under scrutiny over its data privacy and security practices.


**DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) slumped nearly 9% and closed just above its 50-day moving average. Shares fell more than 8% below the 92.65 buy point. A breakout attempt Tuesday faded, but DocuSign was added to Leaderboard when it cleared a trend line on Monday.


**GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)) pared early losses but still closed lower by nearly 6%. The China-based provider of online after-school tutoring services has huge annual earnings estimates along with triple-digit sales growth. But shares fell in sympathy with **Luckin Coffee** ([LK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LK)), another China stock with triple-digit sales growth. Luckin crashed more than 70% after its chief operating officer was accused of fabricating sales.


Top performers like **Palomar** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) also lagged.


Watchlist Names
---------------


Stocks with leadership potential that should be front and center on the watchlist include **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **Vertex** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) and **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)).

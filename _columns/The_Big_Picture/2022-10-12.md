title: Stock Market Sinks Again On Hot Inflation Data; Why Bearishness Isn't Extreme Yet

Is the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) possibly getting "inflation-numb"?




Surely, Wednesday's action followed a bearish script. Gains in the major stock market indexes evaporated. But rather than fall off a cliff, the benchmarks kept losses on the much smaller side.


Perhaps Wednesday's report that showed prices at the wholesale level rose sharply in September — both on a month-on-month basis and year over year — just did not provide enough "shock and awe" power? Or, perhaps Wall Street's true reaction to the latest news on U.S. inflation comes on Thursday, when monthly CPI data arrives at 8:30 a.m. ET, an hour before the market open.


In September, the producer price index showed a meaningful 0.4% rise vs. August. That blasted the [Econoday consensus forecast for a 0.2% rise](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Plus, it reversed a trend of sequential declines in July and August. Year over year, the PPI index jumped 8.5%. It was a tiny slowdown from an 8.7% jump in August, yet it beat views.


Econoday currently estimates that consumer prices rose 0.2% in September vs. the prior month and core prices climbed 0.4%. But year-over-year gains may stay intense.


A Quiet Day
-----------


The Nasdaq composite, for the most part, flitted up and down within a relatively narrow range. At the day's high, it gained almost 0.7%. The tech-heavy index closed 9 points lower, off less than 0.1%.


The probability that the Federal Reserve will jack up short-term interest rates by 75 basis points for a fourth straight meeting is now at 84.8%. The Fed's next meeting on the fed funds rate takes place on Nov. 1-2.


Notice on a Nasdaq composite's daily chart how Wednesday's action perfectly illustrates the chart concept of an [inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/) in the stock market.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 eased 0.3%, matching the fall in the Russell 2000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1% lower. All of these indexes traced inside days of their own as well.


Yet with the S&P 500 registering a sixth straight decline and, at 3576, posting its lowest close since Nov. 20, 2020, conditions remain severely bearish.


Elsewhere, energy markets cooled. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures lost 2.5% to $87.10 a barrel. Natural gas fell 2.4%. Bargain-hunting resumed in long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the key 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 3.90%. But that's not far from a year-to-date high of 3.99%.


How To View The Stock Market
----------------------------



Mark Minervini, two-time winner in the U.S. Investing Championships, commented in [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://get.investors.com/ibd-live/) that he doesn't see these major indexes as a true representation of what to invest in or trade. They're simply stock market benchmarks. For Minervini, who will mark his 40th year of trading stocks next year, it's all about finding growth stocks that have both excellent fundamentals and unusually good action on their charts.


And judging by what's happened in the past few weeks, he's not hopeful for a major turnaround in opportunities for the adroit individual investor in the near term.


"We're probably in the seventh inning (of the bear market)," Minervini said. "But watch out for the last step. It could be a doozy."


"This is a market where you can buy stocks perfectly and get penalized," he added.



Breakout Attempts Today
-----------------------


Just looking at the names found in the accompanying Market Pulse underscores Minervini's points.


Among stocks that are flexing outperformance vs. the major benchmarks, more continue to fall in heavy turnover. And fewer stocks are rising in active trading. Good breakouts are rare. A 6% slide by insurance firm **Palomar** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)) on Wednesday sent the stock back below a new handle [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 90.07 within its monster-size cup.


**Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)), falling 3.5% in accelerating turnover, gave back two days' worth of nice gains. The [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) looks headed toward a third test of the 50-day moving average. On the bright side, the current chart action resembles a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/), a time-proven pattern of unusual strength in shaky markets.

Not making the "Leaders down in volume" portion of the Market Pulse: **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)). The reason is simple: Volume came in 3% below its 50-day average. But notice on a daily chart how the entertainment play is struggling to jump above its latest buy point of 75.33 within a [nearly seven-week cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


Until IBD begins to see more stocks rising in heavy turnover, retaking key technical levels including the 50-day moving average and the 200-day line, and forming sturdy bases, the signal to buy growth stocks will remain dark.

Stock Market Pessimism Still Dwarfs Optimism
--------------------------------------------


Every Wednesday, IBD receives a fresh reading on sentiment through the eyes of newsletter pundits. For much of the year, they've been bearish — and rightly so.


The latest [Investors Intelligence survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) noted a jump in bearishness to 44.1% vs. 41.8% a week earlier. The bulls ratio edged lower, from 25.4% to 25%. Moreover, the survey notes this is a new low since early 2016.


In multiple past bear markets, when the bulls vs. bears ratio was this negative, it often pointed out that a market bottom was near. But Minervini thinks that amid a negative interest-rate environment, bullishness must fall further and bearishness grow even more extreme before we reach a true inflection point.


In other words, the market may need to see something as extreme as October 2008 — when the bulls plunged to 21.3% and the bears soared to 54.4% — before it gets to the point that the crowd is truly wrong at an extreme level in the actual stock market.


MarketSmith users can view charts of bullishness and bearishness levels by punching in 0BULL and 0BEAR (those are zeros) on MarketSmith to view those readings.

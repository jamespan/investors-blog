<div class="single-post-content post-content drop-cap crawler"><p>The stock market flexed its muscles as it made a strong upward move Tuesday, buoyed by positive economic data. Growth stocks had a particularly good session while airline plays soared on sunny guidance from <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL" target="_blank">DAL</a>).</p>

<p>The show of strength after the recent pullback was encouraging. The Nasdaq composite ended the day with a meaty 1.7% gain. The tech-heavy index powered up from its 21-day exponential moving average and closed just shy of the 10-day line.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 turned in a 1.2% gain and also bounced away from its 21-day line. Moving decisively back above the 10-day moving average will be its next task.</p>
<p>Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on both main exchanges, a sign of bullish sentiment.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the weakest performer among the major indexes despite a 0.6% gain. A disastrous day for <strong>Walgreens Boots Alliance</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA" target="_blank">WBA</a>) weighed, with the stock falling more than 9% after management slashed guidance amid waning demand for Covid-19 vaccines. This overshadowed solid sessions from the likes of <strong>Intel</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC" target="_blank">INTC</a>), <strong>Boeing</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA" target="_blank">BA</a>) and <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT" target="_blank">MSFT</a>).</p>
<p>Small caps regained some recent ground lost to the bears, with the Russell 2000 popping 1.5%. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM" target="_blank">IWM</a>) now sits near a first-stage cup-with-handle entry of 189.24, <a href="https://marketsmith.investors.com/">MarketSmith analysis shows.</a></p>

The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY" target="_blank">FFTY</a>) popped 2.6% for the day and is now up almost 14% for the year.</p>
<p>With the market still in a confirmed uptrend, IBD recommends 60% to 80% exposure for now. Be sure to continue seeking actionable stocks while also keeping a tight grip on any sell signals in your portfolio.</p>
<h2>Data Boosts Stock Market; Hurdles Loom</h2>
<p>A battery of positive economic data helped to push stocks higher. New orders for durable goods vaulted 1.7% in May after April's revised 1.2% increase, while shipments of manufactured goods jumped 1.7% after dipping 0.6% in April.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important of all was the Conference Board's consumer confidence report. The index spiked 7.2 points to 109.7, its highest reading since January 2022.</p>
<p>"The strong consumer confidence report will likely suggest expectations are not for the labor market to deteriorate quickly, which should confirm expectations that a recession will not happen this year, but most likely next," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the latest Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index is due Friday. This, particularly the core measurement, is the Fed's favored inflation gauge. A surprise here could help propel the markets higher or send them lower.</p>
<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell is also appearing at a policy panel discussion at the European Central Bank Forum in Portugal Wednesday. Fedspeak always has the potential to move markets.</p>

<h2>Delta Stock Boosts Airlines</h2>
<p>Nearly all S&amp;P 500 sectors of the stock market ended the session in the green Tuesday, with only health care losing ground. Consumer discretionary and technology were the top performers.</p>
<p>Despite this, it was no surprise that airlines were one of the best performing IBD industry groups Tuesday, rising 5.1%.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns medium-8 leftchart"><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=DAL"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The group was boosted after Delta Air Lines surged 6.8% after guiding full-year EPS of $6. This was near the top of its previously forecast range, with CEO Ed Bastian telling CNBC that demand is "off the chain."</p>
<p>Other airline stocks also got a lift in the stock market. <strong>American Airlines</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL" target="_blank">AAL</a>) popped 5.5% and broke out of a cup-with-handle base. <strong>United Airlines</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL" target="_blank">UAL</a>) rose 5.1%. UAL was Tuesday's <a href="https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/united-airlines-stock-flies-past-buy-point-on-rival-industry-guidance/">IBD Stock Of The Day</a> after it cleared a 54.05 buy point in strong volume.</p>
<p>Other groups that had strong sessions included specialty consumer plays, integrated telecom services, trucking companies and department stores.</p>
<p>On the downside, drugstores, periodicals, biotechs and medical research equipment all lagged.</p>

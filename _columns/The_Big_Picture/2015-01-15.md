Stocks wheezed through Thursday's session as world news and economic data took more oxygen out of the struggling uptrend.

  

The Nasdaq and the IBD 50 each dropped 1.5%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.9%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

Although the indexes avoided a distribution day because of the lower volume, five straight losses have left the bullish camp with nothing to cheer.

  

The uptrend remains under pressure, and buying stocks in [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) is risky.

  

Two pieces of international news emerged Thursday, but only one garnered significant stateside attention.

  

India provided some encouraging news, as its central bank cut interest rates. Fading inflation allowed the move. The benchmark Sensex stock index posted a 30% gain last year. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his seven-month-old administration are pushing India in a pro-business direction.

  

News from Switzerland, however, made a bigger splash.

  

The Swiss National Bank ended a program to support the euro vs. the franc, which sent the euro reeling and created more nervousness in the U.S. markets.

  

Uncertainty seems to be the current tone of the market. Take a look at the charts of the indexes at the left. Action since late November has been choppy — sinking below the 50-day line three times and rising above it twice.

  

Support has emerged at the 1972-1992 level in the S&P 500 and resistance is established just under 2100.

  

Opportunities for longs and shorts are likely to be scarce until the market breaks decisively through one of those levels.

  

Breakouts were scarce Thursday, though two stocks stirred.

  

India's **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) broke out of a flat pattern, clearing a 54.84 entry in huge volume.

  

**Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) popped above resistance at 22.74 in volume 261% above average.

  

In other developments:

  

•The put-call volume ratio closed at 0.98 Thursday after closing at 1.06 Wednesday. This is near a level often associated with short-term lows in the indexes.

  

•New lows dominated new highs for a second day in a row, which is bearish.

  

•Defensive groups led the market Thursday — gold miners, food and utilities.

  

Friday is an options expiration day, which could add volume and volatility.

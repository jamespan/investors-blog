Is The Stock Market Vulnerable As Earnings Season Kicks Into Gear?
===================================================================

Sellers came into the stock market during the final minutes of trading Wednesday as small caps continued to lag. But it wasn't a bad session for the bulls as the Dow Jones continues to hold comfortably above its 10-day moving average. The Nasdaq composite is testing the same short-term support level while the S&P 500 gave up the line Wednesday.




The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small-cap index fell about 0.7% each. The Dow Jones industrials gave back 0.4% and the Nasdaq lost 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell slightly less than the major market indexes, off 0.3%. It's been working its way higher after reclaiming a 34.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The stock market soured a bit Tuesday as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 [suffered mild distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). Sentiment weakened after President Trump said the U.S. is still a long way from a trade deal with China. He also said that more tariffs on Chinese imports is a possibility.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP_4x3_071719.jpg)Headed into Wednesday, the Market Pulse showed four [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq and three for the S&P 500. In other words, indexes are not under heavy distribution at this point. Of the Nasdaq's four distribution days, two showed declines of only 0.2% to 0.4%.


After soaring 1.8% Tuesday, the Dow Jones Transportation Average slumped 3.6%. A weak earnings report from railroad operator **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) was the culprit. Sluggish results at CSX came on the heels of a solid earnings report from **Canadian Pacific** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)) Tuesday. IBD's railroad group plunged more than 4% Wednesday.


Stock Market Sentiment Bullish
------------------------------


In other news, the [latest survey of newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) showed bullishness on the rise again. Bulls rose to 58% from 56.7% the prior week. (The charts typically get updated once a week after the close on Wednesday.) Bullish sentiment hit a high of 56.4% in late April, early May â€” around the time major stock indexes started to pull back.


The survey is a contrarian indicator because excessive bullishness has been seen near several market tops in the past. Conversely, excessive bearishness has been seen at market bottoms.


Amid increasing bullishness, it makes sense to examine current holdings. Give your winners room to run, but if a new buy isn't working out, don't be afraid to cut it loose. **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) offers a good example. A breakout over an alternate entry of 52.14 looked good for while, but the stock showed abnormal price action Tuesday, reversing its off in strong volume. It extended losses Wednesday. In this case, cutting losses short from the 52.14 entry makes sense.



For stock market bulls, what trumps increasing bullishness among the pundits is the continued healthy price action of leading growth stocks. [Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) and **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) continue to hold near highs after recent breakouts.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), carving out a spot in the [Leaderboard watch list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist), jumped to an all-time high Wednesday after retaking a 354.72 entry Tuesday.


Stock Market Earnings
---------------------



Q2 earnings has gotten off to a reasonably good start with financial stocks dominating the headlines. Earnings from **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) were generally viewed as positive, although the results failed to spur fresh rounds of institutional buying. That's not surprising, as a low interest rate environment hurts net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability for banks.


After the close, FANG stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) got smacked lower after reporting disappointing [subscriber growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-earnings-q2-2019-netflix-stock/). Shares were down 10% in after-hours trading.


[Semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) started off on solid ground, helped by strong earnings from **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)). The chip designer reclaimed a prior 210.97 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) with conviction, rising 6% to 217.67. It's [still in the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).


Meanwhile, **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) faded after a strong start. Shares soared early after the Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to pause the enforcement of a recent antitrust ruling against the mobile chip giant.


VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) picked up 0.4% to 114.39. It's just below a 116.06 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

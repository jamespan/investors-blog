Dow Jones Lags Nasdaq Rebound; 5 Stats Hint A New Bear Market Is Not Here Yet
==============================================================================

Investors breathed some relief Tuesday on news that America's largest tech companies can, for a while, still do business with a China giant in the telecom equipment space. The Nasdaq and small caps beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Despite solid gains of more than 1% by some equity indexes, the current outlook for stocks holds at "market in correction."




The "correction" status, as published in the accompanying Market Pulse table, has been in force since May 13, when the major indexes buckled under a [heavy load of selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


On that day, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both notched a [sixth distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) — a clear indication that large fund managers enthusiastically took profits off the table after the stunning V-shaped market recovery in the first quarter of the year.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP052119-221x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite led the way on Tuesday as its gain of 1.1% topped an advance of 0.8% to 0.9% for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, respectively. The Russell 2000 did even better: Its 1.3% gain recouped roughly two thirds of its losses suffered in the prior two sessions.


Late on Monday, the White House walked back its decision last weekend to ban American companies from doing business with China's Huawei Technologies, providing a 90-day reprieve. With Huawei giving numerous top U.S. technology companies a lot of business, the government appeared to quickly realize that the latest salvo in the battle for economic supremacy between the U.S. and China was like a stab in the foot.


Yet it appears that fund managers are keeping a cautious approach. Volume fell on both exchanges, according to early data.


What's Next For The Nasdaq, Dow Jones
-------------------------------------


Technically, the ultimate size of this new market correction remains a big unknown.


Ron Sanchez, the New York-based chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Company International, believes the market is correctly pricing in the risk of an aggravated U.S. trade war with China. While the major indexes currently show a drop of 4% to 6% from their recent all-time highs, that's certainly not the case with companies that have a large chunk of business in the Middle Kingdom.



**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which is betting big on China, mustered a gain of nearly 2%. Volume fell 11% below average. But at 186.60, the iPhone and Macbook giant is trading 20% below its all-time peak, and nearly 14% below a near-term high of 215.31.


"Both sides are acknowledging the importance of reducing the trade deficit. The more complicated issues are intellectual property and access to China's markets," Sanchez told IBD in a phone interview. "I'm not sure if markets have priced in the worst scenario" of the trade war.


Apple continues to trade beneath its 50- and 200-day moving averages, a sign of weakness for now.



In contrast, check out the top 10 names [in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). All 10 trade on the north side of their 50-day lines. **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) is making its first pullback to the 50-day moving average after a rocket-like run from a 47.14 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Not A FAANG Stock, But Doing Better Lately
------------------------------------------


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is not in [the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), but the computer and gaming hardware, business software and cloud computing behemoth is doing a Lou Gerstner-authored "Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?" move since its breakout.



The Nasdaq megacap rolled past a 113.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a five-month base that resembles a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on March 12.


So far it hasn't looked back. The gain has reached 16%; the 50-day line continues to chase the stock higher.


Companies that show excellent management, good execution, and the drive to [meet the N in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) attract new institutional dollars. Microsoft's RS Rating is now a 93, up from 86 eight weeks ago. According to [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-microsoft-corp-msft.aspx), the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is positive B on a scale of A to E, hinting at net accumulation among institutional investors over the past 13 weeks.


5 Key Stats That May Keep The Bears At Bay
------------------------------------------


**No. 1:** If American companies can continue to avoid an earnings recession, that would definitely bode well for equities. No doubt, it would be a supreme feat; the 2018 profits got goosed higher in part due to a sharp tax cut that year. But John Lynch, chief investment strategist at **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)), argues that "our base case remains that we will get a trade deal with China early this summer and consensus expectations for S&P 500 earnings growth in 2019 of 3%-4% may prove to be conservative."


**No. 2:** Action by market leaders remains healthy overall. The Sector Leaders shows a price-weighted gain of 30.5% since Jan. 1. When the market gets beaten down very badly, it's common to see the Sector Leaders list shrink to one, two or three names. That's not the case for now.


[The IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) also is demonstrating a continued degree of outperformance.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 1.3% to 33.24. It's up 20.3% since Jan. 1.


**No. 3:** Some measures of investor sentiment show pessimism rising and optimism fading. That's good. It means a further rise in stock prices could encourage investors to redeploy cash. Sanchez of Fiduciary Trust believes that the Q4 sell-off drove a lot of investors back to the sidelines, accumulating a lot of cash. His team's research estimates roughly $80 billion in net outflows from global equity funds into bond and money market investments.


But even as the stock market rebounded, Sanchez says they still saw a continued outflow, and not inflow, of money from equity-based funds.


The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) recently spiked above the key 1.15 threshold. [Bulls as a ratio of market newsletter editors](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) surveyed each week by Investors Intelligence still holds below the 60% level that usually signals over-exuberance among market pundits.


Yet the market itself has yet to give a [primary signal that a new market uptrend is underway](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/).


Beyond The Dow Jones: GDP, Philly Fed, Jobs Data Still Matter
-------------------------------------------------------------


**No. 4**: The U.S. economy may be on a mild acceleration path, whereas China is on a decelerating path.


An initial reading on first-quarter U.S. GDP showed annualized growth of 3.2%; that exceeds the eight-quarter average of 2.75% from Q1 of 2017 through Q4 last year.


More recently, last week's Philadelphia Federal Reserve monthly index that surveys business conditions showed a sharp jump in May to 16.60.


That number throttled past the [Econoday consensus view](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 9.3 and the April figure of 8.5. The estimates for May ranged from 5.8 to 11.0.

**No. 5**: Low interest rates give the S&P 500 a comparative advantage in terms of yield.


The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield rose to 2.43%, perhaps placating investors in commercial and regional banks. That 2.43% figure now tops 2.39% for three-month T-bills. A positive-sloping yield curve helps banks get revenue in their interest-rate-sensitive business.


Yet data from Ed Yardeni Research shows a 2019 earnings estimate of $174.81 for S&P 500 companies on a per-share basis. This gives the S&P 500 a forward earnings yield of 6.1%, far better than Treasuries.

The major stock indexes experienced a sharp sell-off Friday, ending the week on a down note. Top growth stocks were hit hard and the Nasdaq fell through a key support level, resulting in a stock market downgrade.




The Nasdaq tumbled 2%, while the Russell 2000 declined 1.6%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.9% and 2%, respectively.


Leading growth stocks performed in line with the major stock indexes, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 1.9% Friday. But in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 45-ranked **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)) rallied 2.7%. Shares are again nearing a 519.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Thermo Fisher is an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/).


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE from Thursday.


Rally Turns Into Sell-Off
-------------------------


![MP012921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP012921-268x300.jpg)The Nasdaq gave up its critical [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), a key indicator of short-term direction. The 21-day line had served as a support level since the index's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) in early November. This weak price action caused a downgrade to the market trend.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since Nov. 4.


For the week, the Nasdaq declined 3.5%. The S&P 500 dropped 3.3%, while the Dow 30 also lost 3.3%.


One silver lining: the key indexes avoided a new distribution day due to lower volume. The Nasdaq maintains one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), but the S&P 500 still carries a higher count.


Due to the recent weakness, it would be a great time to play some defense. Weakness can snowball, so it's usually best to get off margin to avoid out-sized losses. Meanwhile, you can reduce some exposure by cutting positions that show a loss after recently breaking out.


Focus on stocks that show [strong relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) during this week's sell-off. They could be some of market's leaders if the indexes are able to rebound.


Stocks To Watch: Grayscale Bitcoin, PayPal
------------------------------------------


The price of Bitcoin advanced about 5% Friday to $34,400, according to Coindesk. The price of Bitcoin topped out Friday at $38,020, about $3,900 shy of its all-time high of $41,940.


The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ([GBTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBTC)) cut gains to 3% Friday, as it continues to rebound from the 50-day support level. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF was discussed in this week's [Investing with IBD podcast](https://www.investors.com/videos/charles-harris-how-to-navigate-market-speculation-around-amc-gamestop-stock/).


In Bitcoin-related stock plays, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) mostly shrugged off the stock market weakness Friday. Shares slipped 1.5%, as they continue to rebound from a test of their 50-day line, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


[Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/wst-stock-stares-down-buy-points-covid-vaccines-push-demand/), **West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)), is trading just under a 305.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a cup base following a breakout on Jan. 8. Shares are also eying a 309.14 and 312.22 entries.

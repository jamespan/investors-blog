title: Why The Bulls Would Like To See More Nastiness From The Bears

U.S. stocks finished the week on an uncertain note Friday, as the market awaited the Fed's two-day meeting.


The Nasdaq retreated 0.1%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.4%. Secondary indexes were a sea of red with the exception of the Dow Jones [utility](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/utility-leaders-sep-15-2016/) average which rose 0.8%. The IBD 50 inched up 0.1%.


Volume was higher on both major exchanges.


The S&P 500's sizable loss in rising volume was enough to slap the index with distribution. But Friday was a quadruple witching day, and quarterly expirations boost volume, leaving an asterisk on this distribution day.

So far, the indexes have pulled only about 3.5% off recent highs, not enough for a true shakeout.


Nasdaq pullbacks in May and July fell 6% and 8%, respectively, and from December to February nearly 19%. The latter pullback is the kind that can best serve as a prelude to good gains.


A rally off that February low brought an 18% advance, erasing most of the prior decline.


But keep in mind two things: IBD-style investors don't ride a decline down but cut losses quickly, and investors playing quality breakouts found some decent breakouts in February and March.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *With the major averages trading sideways and then testing their 10-week lines, it's no surprise to see many leading stocks doing the same.

**Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) rose 23% from a breakout; **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), 22%; **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)), 26%; **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) 64%; and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), 48%.


The current market needs a good flushing to set up a similar situation.


One thing an investor needs to avoid is substituting wishful thinking for realistic observations. The IBD approach revolves around confirmations, not predictions. The follow-through day is a confirmation. A switch in IBD's market outlook is a confirmation that something has changed. A breakout in strong volume is a confirmation that funds are actively buying a stock.


The rule is to let the market determine the individual investor's stance.


Right now, sharp daily price swings in the indexes aren't building a convincing case that anything has changed.


For the week, the Nasdaq rose 2.3%; the IBD 50, 2.2%; and the S&P 500, 0.5%.


**COMING UP**: Several housing-related reports are due Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday. The first presidential debate will be held Sept. 26. The final take on Q2 GDP will be released Sept. 29.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/BIGPIC-022916-iStock.jpg)Stamps.com was among the week's breakout stocks. 









Stocks stalled Friday, capping the week with the first sign of institutional selling since the market went into a confirmed uptrend.


The Nasdaq inched up less than 0.2% Friday, while the S&P 500 subtracted less than 0.2%. Small caps did best, with the Russell 2000 gaining 0.5%.


The IBD 50 fell 0.6%.


Volume rose across the board.


The day's action was enough to slap the Nasdaq with distribution in the form of stalling. IBD’s stalling rule can be complicated but essentially it involves an intraday rise above recent sessions, higher volume and a close near the session low.

The S&P 500 escaped distribution because its loss was too small.


Despite the stalling, there were other developments Friday and during the week that suggested the stalling day was worth little more than a shrug.


Consider the overall context:


-- Stalling is a negative but this represents the first instance of distribution since the market’s Feb. 11 low.


-- The S&P 500 retook its 50-day line Thursday and held above it Friday.


-- Breakouts among quality stocks have started to emerge in the most bullish way possible -- gap ups. **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)), **Domino’s Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **Motorola Solutions** ([MSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSI)), **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)) and **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) each leapt over buy points.


--Losses also could be positive, if they point to rotation. Conservative plays such as **Storage Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)), **Hanover Insurance** ([THG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THG)) and **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) showed bad action Friday -- including a gap down and negative reversals.


Another conservative gauge, the Dow Jones utility average fell 2.9% Friday.


Overall this could be a sign of money moving out of the conservative plays and perhaps into something more aggressive.


-- Oil has rebounded a bit. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil jumped almost 11% for the week, removing some of the market's gloom. Recently the market has been moving pretty much in step with crude oil.


-- Economic news also appears to be improving. The second reading on fourth-quarter GDP was revised up from 0.7% to 1%, which was far above the Street’s view that it would be revised down to 0.4%.


This undercut the theory in some quarters that the U.S. is headed toward a recession. The improved number also sits well with the broadest gauge of the money supply -- Divisia M4 including Treasuries -- which has averaged 4.1% growth over the past three months.


For IBD-style investors, however, tracking the price-and-volume action of the market itself remains the most accurate scale for weighing the uptrend.


Small caps scored the biggest gain for the week as the S&P 600 rose 2.8%. The Nasdaq added 1.9%, the S&P 500 1.6% and the IBD 50 only 0.5%.

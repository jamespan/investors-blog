Stocks Hardly Budge, Acacia Cools; Still Constructive Action For The Bulls?
============================================================================

There were numerous reasons to be bullish about Wednesday's stock market action, even if you couldn't see it by the way the major indexes fared.


Judging by how the S&P 500 (off less than 1 point) and the Nasdaq composite (up less than 0.2%) practically did nothing, one might think that some equity traders still haven't gotten back from the Labor Day weekend.


However, a look underneath the market's hood revealed deliberate action by institutional investors to put more cash to work.


For starters, small caps roared higher again. The Russell 2000 did the market's heavy lifting, rising 0.6%. That stretched its year-to-date gain to 11%, 400 basis points above the S&P 500's nearly 7% gain since Jan. 1. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied nearly 0.7% and is up 14% since Jan. 1.


![MP090716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MP090716-154x300.jpg)When small caps outperform, it can mean that institutions are growing their appetite for higher-risk assets. Or fund managers believe smaller stocks are undervalued. Or both.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell on the NYSE.



While **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rounded up most of the financial media's attention with its new iPhone 7 unveiling, the big boys and girls of the stock market quietly picked up shares in a wide range of industries, from automakers (check out **Ferrari**'s ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) breakout at 49.21) to **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) (double-bottom breakout at 55.70) in the fabless chip space.


Airlines, travel booking, mortgage services, restaurant, biotech and building maintenance stocks also outperformed. As a result, winners handily beat losers on both exchanges by a nearly 3-2 ratio.


Pair that with the soft drop for the S&P 500, and it's a welcome divergence for market observers.


The third nice thing going on? New highs are rising. On Tuesday, a combined 445 stocks made IBD's screened list of Nasdaq and NYSE 52-week highs, the most in recent memory. When new highs increase, so do the likelihood of convincing breakouts. (Go to Stock Lists at Investors.com, then click on **[IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/)** to see the entire list each day.)


The fourth nice thing? IBD's stock lists of leaders look pretty healthy. Consider the IBD 50. When the market shows fragility and has the look of a junkyard of broken breakouts, the 50 can look like a caretaker list of such names. But that's not the case today. The list is quite deep with strength, not unlike the bench of winning UCLA basketball teams managed by famed Coach John Wooden decades ago.


For instance, **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) of China continues to find support near or at the key 50-day moving average following a light-volume breakout past 33.01 in mid-March. **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) is showing some of the mojo it had in the 1990s. And new business software play **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) (No. 43) may be forming a new base on top of its six-month cup with handle that yielded a 26.94 entry.


Wednesday's action at an individual level largely did not disappoint. Sure, there were exceptions. Fiber-optic technology play **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) failed in its second attempt to clear a rare high, tight flag pattern with a 125 buy point. The stock showed a negative reversal in heavy volume despite making an all-time high. Good flag bases are rare; in Acacia's case, the narrow two-week length of the flag may be a flaw, even though the flag itself showed a tidy decline of less than 20%.


All of these positive angles seen within the overall market prism are normal when the market shows enough strength to shake off periods of selling pressure. On Tuesday, as this column noted, IBD's current outlook got upgraded to "Uptrend resumes" from "Uptrend under pressure" after the tech-rich Nasdaq muscled its way to an all-time closing high.


On Wednesday, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams made some highly insightful comments in addition to declaring that a possible hike in interest rates is on the table at the upcoming Sept. 20-21 FOMC policy meeting. During a talk with reporters in Reno, Nev., he noted that low productivity and the aging demographics of the U.S. may limit the economy's potential to grow in the longer run. Thus, Williams does not expect the next phase of monetary contraction to go quite as long or strong as before.


During the last regime of rate hikes, the Fed took the fed funds overnight loans rate up from 1% to 5.25% from June 2004 to June 2006.


If future growth in the economy isn't going to be like the Roaring 20s or the Go-Go 80s, then what does this mean for the individual investor? Over the long run, will hunting for **[CAN SLIM-quality stocks](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749)** or **[swing trading](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/)** prevail? Perhaps both.

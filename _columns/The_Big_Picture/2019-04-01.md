  Stock Market Jumps More Than 1% And What That Means For Market Outlook

The stock market stumble in March may feel like all but a memory now after the S&P 500 climbed above its March high, causing a rethink of the market's outlook.




Indexes closed at session highs Monday as the S&P 500 jumped 1.2% and rose above the March 21 high. On that date, the market started a pullback on worries about global growth. But Monday's broad gains showed the market and leading stocks are finding their stride again.


Thus, IBD changed its market outlook to confirmed uptrend. That ended a period of just over a week in which the market outlook was placed at "uptrend under pressure." With risks lowered, investors should refresh their watch list of top stocks and consider increasing their exposure.


The Nasdaq composite didn't quite conquer its March high but still rose 1.3%. Semiconductor and software stocks aided the Nasdaq's advance. The Philadelphia semiconductor indexes rallied 2.5%, its best day since March 21. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) is back above the 189.33 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP-040119-228x300.jpg)The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](http://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis) matched the Nasdaq's 1.3% climb and topped the March high as well. The Dow closed above 26,000 for the first time since March 1 and has a chance to rise past resistance around 26,277, the intraday high seen on Nov. 8.


Volume fell from Friday's totals, but breadth was positive. Advancing stocks led decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by around 3-to-1 on the NYSE.


Distribution Trimmed
--------------------


The Feb. 25 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) by the S&P 500, a rare stalling session, no longer gets included in the overall count because plenty of time has passed since then. As seen in the accompanying Market Pulse table, that left the number of distribution days at six each for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.


Economic data helped the market get back on its feet Monday. The Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing Index rose 1.1 points in March, thanks to increases in new orders, production and employment. The market welcomed such news given that in March investors grew frightened by signs of economic slowing.


In China, the manufacturing purchasing managers index rose for the first time in four months. The Shanghai composite leapt 2.6% and the tech-centered Shenzhen composite soared to a 3.6% gain.


Some Chinese Stocks Rise
------------------------


**Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **Huazhu Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) and **Tencent Music Entertainment** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) were some Chinese ADRs that rose sharply Monday. **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), pared most of its loss and is still [extended](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) past its 96.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


With most Chinese stocks still recovering from sharp declines, [China-tracking ETFs can be a way to invest in a China stock rebound](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/5-ways-play-big-rally-china-stocks-etfs/). For example, iShares MSCI China ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) and Direxion Daily China 3x Bull Shares ([YINN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YINN)), which tries to triple the daily performance of the FTSE China 50 Index, are rising from pullbacks to the 50-day average.


Can Stock Market Extend Gains? A 2011 Case Example
--------------------------------------------------


After a superb first quarter for the stock market, are we done with the market's gains for the year?


The Nasdaq amassed a 16.5% increase in Q1, the best since Q1 of 2012, while the S&P 500 rose 13.1% for its best quarter since Q3 of 2009.


With the Nasdaq up 18% from Jan. 1 and more than 26% from its December low, it seems like asking too much for the composite to keep rising.


Yet the rebound from the 2011 correction — the last time indexes fell more than 20% — suggests the market still has some room to run. After the Nasdaq corrected 20.4% in 2011, it rebounded more than 36% over five months.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 1.1% to stay abreast of the broad market. The weakest parts of the index were real estate investment trusts and **Kirkland Gold Mining** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)). That indicates that investors are not so interested in defensive stocks anymore.


Retail sales fell 0.2% in February, or 0.4% excluding autos. Restaurants, discount chains and supermarkets showed weakness. But the surprising drop in sales didn't hurt the overall sector so much. SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) rose 0.6%, though the sector lagged compared with most others.


Casino stocks rallied on [better-than-expected Macau gaming revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/gaming-stocks-las-vegas-sands-stock-wynn-stock-rise-on-macau-revenue/) and strong Chinese economic data. **Melco Resorts** ([MLCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLCO)) rose past the 24.28 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) residing inside a much larger consolidation.

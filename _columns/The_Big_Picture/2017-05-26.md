 Investors on Friday grabbed their lawn chairs early, as the indexes barely moved in the run-up to the Memorial Day weekend.


The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 settled barely above the break-even line. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was a sliver lower. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.1%.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume.

Friday's market got two pieces of good news before the open.


First, the second reading on first-quarter GDP was stronger than expected. The consensus called for 0.8% but it rolled in at 1.2%.


Second, durable goods orders for April weren't as weak as expected — down 0.7% vs. the consensus target of minus 1%.


While the data beat the Street's forecasts, this was more of an appetizer for the bulls than a meal.


Also a report on Q1 corporate after-tax profits came in at 12% vs. 22.3% in Q4. A Reuters report said the decline was partly due to government penalties tied to mortgage-backed securities. The penalties were slapped on the U.S. subsidiaries of Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank and amounted to $5.6 billion in Q1.


Overall, the major stock indexes barely budged, staying in a tight range throughout the day. But for the week, the Nasdaq added a solid 2.1% and the S&P 500 1.4% as both reached record highs.


A handful of stocks showed exceptional gains Friday on positive quarterly results.


Chip designer **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) jumped 4% in busy volume.


Medical software provider **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) gapped up 8% in heavy volume.


Apparel marketer **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) gapped up 19% in heated volume as it broke out.


**Lions Gate Entertainment** ([LGFA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGFA)) gapped up 9% in fast trade.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) gapped up 3% but had been up almost 6% following its earnings report.


For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.3%, and the small cap Russell 2000 1.1%. Weekly volume was below-average for the indexes as well as the NYSE and Nasdaq.


Coming up in the week ahead: The market will release a routine mix of data, including personal income Tuesday; housing data Tuesday and Wednesday; the Challenger job cut report Thursday; and the closely watched Employment Situation report Friday.

Stabilization in China stocks brought buyers in from the sidelines Tuesday as U.S. major averages rallied impressively in higher volume. Sentiment was positive before the open after a 5% intraday loss for the Shanghai composite turned into just a 1.7% loss by the close. But U.S. stocks hiccuped on news of a dismal reading on consumer confidence at 10 a.m. ET. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 90.9 in July, well below the consensus estimate of 99.6.


It didn't take long for buyers to regain control.


The S&P 500 halted a five-session slide, rising 1.2%, as beaten-down energy and transportation stocks outperformed. The Dow added 1.1%, and the Nasdaq reclaimed its 50-day moving average, rising 1%. Small caps lagged a bit, with the Russell 2000 up 0.8%.


The IBD 50 turned in a solid performance, rising 1.25%, as names like **Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) and **NewLink Genetics** ([NLNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NLNK)) did the heavy lifting.


NYSE breadth improved as winners beat losers by more than 2 to 1. Breadth was a bit less bullish on the Nasdaq, with advancers topping decliners by less than 2 to 1.


Tuesday's gains were nice to see, but it doesn't mean that new highs are right around the corner, especially when much of Tuesday's strength came from lagging industry groups.


An elevated distribution count in the S&P 500 and a recent development in the S&P 500's monthly chart still give pause: Draw a trend line connecting the major lows since the March 2009 bottom, and you'll see that the index has broken its uptrend, which strengthens the bear case.


It's still not an easy environment for making money in stocks, and it's particularly difficult during earnings season, when it's anyone's guess how a growth stock will react after it reports.


With several yellow flags out there, buying stocks aggressively doesn't make much sense. Protect profits if you have them and be sure not to let losses snowball.


The two-day Fed meeting concludes Wednesday. The market expects a 0% chance of a rate hike this month. A rate hike in September is still on the table, but expectations have faded due to market turmoil in China and a big drop in oil prices this month.


Crude oil snapped a four-session slide, rising 59 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $47.98 a barrel.


In stock news, the health care sector served up three breakouts.


Sector Leader **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) cleared a 191.11 buy point in solid volume, rising 4%. 


**Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) jumped 4% in fast trade. It closed near its high for the session but ended just below a 173.70 entry. Earnings are due Thursday after the close.


And **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) blasted out of a 19-week base after reporting strong earnings. It cleared a 72.50 buy point with conviction.


Tuesday's after-hours session had plenty of fireworks. **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) soared 7%. Earnings missed estimates, but investors focused on a 4.2% rise in same-store sales at company-owned restaurants. The stock was 12% off its high ahead of the results, working on the right side of a consolidation that started in February.

Stocks rose for a third straight session Wednesday, but gains were meager overall.

  

Small caps failed to rise in unison with their larger brethren, a troubling sign.

  

On Wednesday, the S&P 500 outperformed the field, rising 0.5%. Give credit to the energy sector. Oil and gas stocks made up many of the top 10 performing industry groups (see the Industry Groups table at the bottom of page B2).

  

Movie, managed health care, auto and home furnishings stocks also led the upside.

  

The Nasdaq rose less than 0.3%. As on the S&P 500, the gains were not strong enough to send the index back above its key 50-day moving average.

  

Declines in the biotech and generic drug sectors weighed on the tech-rich index. Yet chip stocks shined. The Philly SOX index rose 1.1%.

  

But the Russell 2000 lost 0.4%, and the small-cap S&P 600 fell 0.3%. Perhaps these data help explain why, within the Nasdaq, losing stocks actually beat winners by nearly a 4-3 ratio.

  

The IBD 50 gained 0.3%.

  

Volume fell slightly on both exchanges, a hint that large fund managers were not energetically scooping up shares.

  

When the funds' action is sleepy, individual investors would be wise to remain cautious. All eyes appear fixed on Thursday's widely expected announcement from Europe's central bank of new steps to inject life into the region's economy.

  

Without question, a series of major monetary moves by the Federal Reserve to ease credit have helped hoist the U.S. stock markets to new highs. The S&P 500 has rebounded from a low of 666 in March 2009 to 2093 in late December last year, a whopping 214% lift.

  

But will a similar strategy by the ECB work? The market appears less enthused. Both the French and German equity markets are battling to exit an intermediate correction that began in June.

  

Investors looking for breakouts might have noticed that many of the strongest moves have been coming out of defensive areas such as the property REITs (real estate investment trusts). For proof, see IBD's new high list in the past several days.

  

**BioMed Realty Trust** ([BMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMR)), featured in the Jan. 12 IBD's Income Investor [column](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-income-investor/010815-733864-biomed-realty-deal-for-illumina-campus.htm), jumped past a 22.12 handle buy point on Jan. 5 and ramped up 10% in just 10 days of work. That's a stunning gain for a company that normally attracts attention for its 4.3% annual dividend yield.

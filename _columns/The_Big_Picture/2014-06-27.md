Stocks scrambled higher Friday as the annual Russell indexes rebalancing boosted volume.

  

The Nasdaq popped 0.4%, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. Small caps surged 0.7%.

  

The IBD 50 inched up 0.15%.

  

Volume ran lower most of the day but surged late on Russell index revisions, as funds bought and sold stocks to ensure their index funds match the changes.

  

Although the late volume added artificial excitement, the day's overall tone was quiet. The pace of breakouts for the week was the slowest in five weeks.

  

Only a handful of stocks with Composite Ratings of 90 or better cleared buy points.

  

Recent breakouts are missing strong follow-up gains. For example, **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) and **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) cleared buy points but remain in the 5% buy zone. Bulls would prefer to see a stock shoot through the buy zone quickly, but this uptrend appears to be laying speed bumps after the breakouts.

  

Some stocks suggest profit-taking. Oil stocks had been riding high, but many lost ground for the week. The refiner group lost 2.4%, while U.S. explorers and producers trimmed 1.2%, according to preliminary data.

  

Other groups are losing their speculative fever. Tobacco lost almost 5% for the week. The group is rich with speculation about possible mergers. Some institutional investors apparently decided money in the pocket is worth more than a wish and a maybe.

  

With the pace of breakouts slowing and profit-taking appearing in some areas, how should the individual investor handle his or her portfolio?

  

"It depends" are the last words anyone wants to hear. However, if an investor bought on recent breakouts **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), **GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Sanchez Energy** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)), the gains range from 9% to 17%.

  

More common, though, are the stocks still trying to clear the 5% buy zone. Investors holding such stocks are feeling more pressure.

  

Uptrends differ in character. This uptrend has been sort of like a C student â€” an occasional flash of brilliance but mostly a producer of mediocre work.

  

In this environment, individual investors need to lower their profit-taking zones and exit a losing or stagnant position more quickly.

  

The stock market is only a little more than a week away from the start of Q2 earnings season, which could fire up or douse the uptrend.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq rose 0.7% and the IBD 50 0.5%. The S&P 500 and the Dow trimmed 0.1% and 0.6%, respectively.

  

The coming week will be a short one with the market closing for the July 4 holiday. However, the economic calendar will offer some data for the market to chew on.

  

On Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index will be reported. Thursday's releases include first-time jobless claims and payrolls, plus the unemployment report.

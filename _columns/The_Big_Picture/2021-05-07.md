Stock Market Rallies Despite Weak Jobs Report; S&P 500, Dow Hit Record Highs
=============================================================================

The stock market rallied Friday in the wake of a weak jobs report, as Treasury yields briefly dived before recovering. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hit record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq continued to rebound from a key level.




The Nasdaq rallied 0.9% Friday. The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, while the Dow Jones industrials also gained 0.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.35%.


Leading growth stocks sharply outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 2.3% Friday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) climbed more than 4%, as the stock battles to regain its 50-day moving average. The payments leader reported strong earnings results late Thursday.


Volume ended lower on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE compared with Thursday's figures.

Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP050321-1-258x300.jpg)Early Friday, the [U.S. economy added](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-shocks-with-just-266000-payroll-gain-dow-jones-techs-soar/) just 266,000 jobs in April, far less than the 998,000 total economists were expecting. The unemployment rate rose to 6.1% last month vs. expectations for a decline to 5.8%.


The bad miss sent the 10-year Treasury yield diving as low as 1.47% before completely erasing losses and heading higher. The 10-year Treasury yield late Friday was around 1.57%, after trading at 1.56% late Thursday.


The stock market, by comparison, rose from the open. The Nasdaq added to Thursday's bullish reversal with more gains Friday. The tech-heavy composite is rebounding from its key 50-day moving average, which is positive action following a recent four-day losing streak. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrials hit record highs for a second straight session, while the S&P 500 also set more all-time highs. The Nasdaq 100 barely regained its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


With two major stock indexes at record highs and the Nasdaq 100 back above a key level, IBD's stock market outlook was upgraded from "uptrend under pressure" to "confirmed uptrend." This means investors can increase some exposure to stocks.


Still, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have four days of [higher-volume declines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).

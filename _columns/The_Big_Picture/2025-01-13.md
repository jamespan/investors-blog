  Nasdaq Sinks For The 4th Straight Session, But These Indexes Rally

The Nasdaq composite veered clearly into negative territory for the year with its fourth-straight loss on Monday. At the day's close of 19,088, the index is down 1.2% year to date. Yet things looked more lugubrious near the start of the session as opposed to the end.


Plus, the Nasdaq stood virtually alone in the losers column among [stock market indexes on Monday](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).




While the Nasdaq closed nearly 0.4% lower for the day, stretching its four-session loss to almost 4% since the Jan. 6 close, the tech-weighted index at one point fell as much as 1.7% Monday. Closing at or near the session low of 18,831 would have indicated that sellers took the upper hand all day.


Fact is, they did not.


Nasdaq And Stock Market Today
-----------------------------


After an initially sharp sell-off, the Nasdaq bounced around for more than two hours, then bottomed out just after noon in New York. From there, bargain hunters emerged, and the Nasdaq finished the day almost at its session high.


Pretty much the same dynamics between buyers and sellers took place in the S&P 500. Down 1% in the early going, the large-cap index rebounded in the afternoon. Unlike the Nasdaq, however, the S&P 500 eked out a small gain of just under 0.2%.


Volume on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange fell vs. Friday's levels.


The small-cap Russell 2000 did the same pricewise, matching the S&P's gain. The NYSE composite also rallied off its lows to finish up 0.4%. And the S&P MidCap 400 index rose 0.8%, staying above its long-term [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) and notching its biggest gain since Jan. 3.


But the day's big winner? It was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, last year's laggard index. The 30-stock price-weighted Dow rose almost 0.9% on the back of gains of 2 points or more by at least 10 of its components.

Strength In The Dow Jones
-------------------------


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP011325-194x300.jpg)UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), part of [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), and construction and mining equipment behemoth **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), did the heavy lifting. The two stocks rose for a combined 31.95 points, or nearly 200 of the Dow's 358-point increase.


Keep in mind that the biggest point gainers within the Dow industrials are not necessarily the largest winners on a per-share percentage basis.


The Dow's gain certainly cast a shadow over the Nasdaq. It suggested money shifting away from Big Tech and into perhaps value-oriented stocks.


Consider **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), also in the Dow industrials. The biotech titan rallied almost 8 points, or 3%, to 270.19. But the stock is nowhere near an IBD-style [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Even after Monday's lofty gain, Amgen still lies well below its downward-sloping [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Amgen's 18 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) also suggests it needs to rise a lot more before positioning into a new leadership role, both within the Nasdaq and the stock market.


In 2024, the Dow industrials' 13.7% advance paled vs. a 28.6% rip higher by the Nasdaq composite.


Even amid Monday's positive moves outside the Nasdaq, the session does not change the market's overall complexion for investors. The [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) is very elevated for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. A sharp drop by **Constellation Energy** ([CEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEG)) on Monday after a strong gain on Friday signals that breakout stocks are proving to be challenging to hold.


Also, the sell-off in long-dated Treasury bonds offers some stiffer competition for dollars vs. stocks. On Monday, the yield in the 10-year U.S. government note hit a new multimonth high of 4.80%. That's the highest close since 4.87% on Oct. 31, 2023.

Leading Stocks In The Nasdaq
----------------------------


Volatility also remains very high for those that have scored superior gains in recent months.


**Aris Water** ([ARIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARIS)) bolted past a couple buy points in different bases on Nov. 5 after posting solid Q3 results. After rising more than 50% to a high of 27.94, the expert in helping clients reduce their water and carbon footprints made a normal pullback to the 50-day line. Yet the big drop below the key level on Thursday was strong enough to shake out many investors. Aris, however, finished off its session low of 21.93 before springing higher in the past two days.


**MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)), meanwhile, a big winner in 2023 to 2024, has so far not shown the same rebounding power as Aris Water after splitting its 50-day moving average with a 5% drop on Friday. The India-based online travel firm slipped another 5% in accelerating volume Monday.


More pullbacks among leading stocks, both in the Nasdaq and on the NYSE, may lead to more charts that look like the one inÂ **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) lately. After a wild reversal on Nov. 13 on huge earnings and sales for the third quarter (up 150% and 39%, respectively), the Mediterranean cuisine-focused fast-casual restaurant chain has already transitioned into base-building mode.


Cava is trading in between the 50- and 200-day lines, which for now makes it difficult to decipher whether the current price trend in the stock is up or down.

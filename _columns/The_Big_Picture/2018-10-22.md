Sellers Dictate Action As Indexes' Gains Fade; Software Stocks Rally
=====================================================================

A stock market in correction mode didn't see much improvement Monday as the Nasdaq composite more than halved a nearly 1% gain. China stocks today were a catalyst early for the Nasdaq thanks to strength in the Shanghai composite and Hang Seng overnight.




The Nasdaq ended with a gain of 0.3%. The Nasdaq 100 rallied 0.5%, helped by strength in Chinese stocks today like **Ctrip.com** ([CTRP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRP)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)).


The Dow Jones industrial average erased a 0.5% gain, falling 0.5%. Dow components **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) lagged with losses of more than 2%. The S&P 500 also reversed lower, ending with a loss of 0.4%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in lower than Friday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MP102218.jpg)The Shanghai Composite soared 4.1% Monday on hopes of [additional stimulus measures](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/china-technology-stocks-rally/). In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng rose 2.3%. But similar to U.S. indexes, Asian indexes are still in the early stages of a rally attempt that hasn't been confirmed yet. In other words, the trend is down until proven otherwise.


Underlying Market Health
------------------------


For the bulls, Monday's session was a disappointment. The bears, meanwhile, got another signal that sellers are still around.


The stock market remains in a correction, with actionable charts few and far between. Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com), **Core-Mark** ([CORE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORE)) closed at the top of a six-week cup-shaped base. Same with **Grand Canyon Education** ([LOPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOPE)).


When bullish chart patterns are nowhere to be found, the stock market is sending a pretty clear message to growth investors: Favor cash until setups appear. Rest assured, they will appear at some point in powerful stock screens like Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


Top Stocks Today
----------------


Shares of **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) jumped 4% to 148.80, but like most other Chinese stocks, a lot of technical damage has been down that will take some time to repair. That said, a breakout over a trend line (found by connecting the stock's highs since June 14) is possible for Alibaba. That could create an aggressive entry.


Elsewhere, [FANG](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) stock and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) outperformed ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. Compared to other technology stocks, Amazon's pullback has been fairly well contained. It's only about 12% off its high. Note that the stock's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) has slumped to E, an indication of heavy institutional in recent weeks. It made a sell signal a couple of weeks ago, when it fell below the 10-week moving average in 83% higher weekly volume.


It's also been a relatively tame pullback so far for enterprise software stock **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)). Shares popped 1% in heavy volume as the stock found support at its 200-day moving average. ServiceNow's chart looks very similar to Amazon's, with shares trading below the 50-day moving average but above the 200-day line.


Security software stocks outperformed after technology news provider [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/) reported that **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has expressed interest in acquiring a security software firm.


Shares of **CyberArk** ([CBYR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBYR)) rallied just over 2%. It's only 11% off its high.


Besides security software, four other software-related industry groups ended with gains of 1.4% or more, but actionable names are hard to find after nasty sell-offs.


IBD 50 Leaders
--------------


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which tracks the performance of the IBD 50 index of top growth stocks, outperformed with a 0.8% gain. Top gainers in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) included **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) and **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)). All three are below the 50-day lines.


Earnings from Advanced Micro Devices are due Wednesday after the close. The chip leader was featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/option-trading-centene-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/) column as a possible bullish earnings option trade.


Heavy-volume gainers included **Jacobs Engineering** ([JEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JEC)). Jacobs gapped up impressively above its 50-day moving average, rising more than 6%, on news it's selling its energy, chemicals and resources businesses to Australian firm WorleyParsons for $3.3 billion.

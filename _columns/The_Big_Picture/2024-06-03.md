[The stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) started the new month with mixed colors. A late-afternoon rally boosted the Nasdaq to a decent gain and a close in the upper half of its intraday range. But some sectors got rocked.




The Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.6%. At the session high, the index came less than 91 points from retaking the 17,000 level. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) rose 0.5%.


Overall volume fell on both main exchanges.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Meanwhile, the S&P 500's move on Monday somewhat mirrored a rising and falling yo-yo.


Initial gains turned into a loss of more than 0.8%. But buyers stepped in at around 1:15 p.m. ET and hoisted the large-cap index to a 0.1% gain by day's end.


For the second straight session, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 erased intraday losses to finish higher. In the context of the confirmed stock market uptrend, such action was indeed bullish.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP060324--227x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a three-day losing skid on Friday with a solid gain of 1.5%. So, Monday's drop of 0.3% to 38,571 could also be seen as mild. But the Dow Jones index also finished beneath its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the fifth straight session.


You generally would like to see a broad array of stock market indexes trading above their 50-day lines, not below them.


Watch The Economy
-----------------


But investors also seemed to react negatively to a new sign of economic softness.


The ISM manufacturing survey, which hit the wires at 10 a.m. ET, came in at 48.7 for May. An index below 50 signifies contraction in the nation's factories.Â [According to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), Wall Street had expected the ISM to edge up to 49.8 vs. a 49.2 reading in April.


The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 11 basis points to 4.40%.


No wonder, then, that some industrial sectors within the stock market weakened.


The Dow Jones transportation average slid nearly 1.1% to 15,074. This translates into a 7% drip lower for the second quarter. Trucking and shipping companies have done badly in recent months. One good example: **Old Dominion Freight** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)). After collapsing 11% in massive turnover on April 24, the less-than-truckload firm has been truly a stock market laggard.


Old Dominion's earnings rose 4% in the first quarter to $1.34 a share on a 1% rise in sales to $1.46 billion.


Those are not the kinds of growth rates you seek in a top stock.


Small Caps Lag On Monday
------------------------


Small caps, meanwhile, continue to underperform in 2024.


The Russell 2000 fell 0.5%. Midcap stocks fared worse.


The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund lost 0.8%. At 541.58, it shows a solid gain of 18.2% over the past 12 months, [according to MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF). However, that pales vs. a 23.3% rally by SPDR S&P 500 ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)). However, an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, the Invesco S&P Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ETF, has gone up just 14.7% over the same time frame.


The QQQ Nasdaq 100 ETF has kept the pole position among these indexes, up 27.8%.


Conclusion? The rally over the past year has been far from evenly distributed across various stock market sectors. So, individual stock picking has benefited, too.

Stock Market Sector Also Struggles
----------------------------------


Amid an OPEC+ decision over the weekend to lengthen production cuts, investors in the stock market clearly saw the news as negative. Why? It suggested that the world's biggest oil exporters, save the U.S., are feeling less confident about the global economy.


Ultimately, the stock market provides invaluable feedback on the financial health certain companies, industries and sectors months down the line.


Check out the sharp declines in heavy volume in **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)), **Oceaneering International** ([OII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OII)), **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) and **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)).



Tidewater, part of IBD's oil and gas field services industry group, fell 6.7% to 96.39 in volume that rushed 48% above average. The midcap stock market leader just posted its biggest single-day point loss since a March 1 [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past 77.53.


That's a sell signal.


Another sell rule triggered by Tidewater? The stock fell sharply below the 50-day line for the first time since the breakout.

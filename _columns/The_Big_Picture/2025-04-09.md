If George Lucas decided to make a movie about the battle for global economic dominance, he might have titled Wednesday's stock market action, "The Bulls Strike Back."


Or was it simply a huge session of short sellers covering their positions? Or perhaps both? No matter the answer, Tuesday's rip higher underscored just how sensitive equities and bonds have become to a deliberate shake-up by [President Donald Trump](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-tariffs-90-day-pause-reciprocal-tariffs-china-sp-500/) to change America's fortunes in trade with the rest of the world.




Stock Market Today: Key Indexes Still Under Water
-------------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite soared 1,857 points, or 12.2%, to 17,124 as a gaggle of tech, retail, energy and cyclical sectors led the day's upside. The S&P 500 rallied 9.5% to 5,456. Small caps weren't far behind as the Russell 2000 gained 8.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 7.9%.


All of these key indexes are still under water for the year. The Dow is faring best for now, down 4.6% since Jan. 1, while the Nasdaq is off 11.3%. The S&P 500 is down 7.2%.


Volume vaulted. On the New York Stock Exchange, 9.4 billion shares exchanged hands, up 9% from the prior session. Nasdaq turnover ramped up 8% to 13.48 billion shares. Days in which the Nasdaq exceeds 10 billion shares are extremely rare, for now.


Wednesday's tariff announcement overshadowed the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates held on March 19. Amid speculation that China and leveraged hedge funds might be selling off U.S. Treasuries to raise cash, the yield on the key 10-year U.S. bond spiked 13 basis points to 4.40%. That's the highest close since Feb. 21, according to Cboe data. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury also jumped sharply, hitting a three-month high of 4.93%.


The overall catalyst for today's huge move: Trump's decision to push back reciprocal tariffs on imports into the U.S. for 90 days. For now, Trump is keeping a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the nation's ports, regardless of origin. But he turned the screws harder on China, threatening to raise the overall tariff rate of 125% on goods from one of the world's largest economies.


The Stock Market Now Vs. 2020
-----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MP040925.jpg)Has the stock market begun a new uptrend? Everyone, of course, wants to know. Stock market history shows two things to help us answer this question.


First, big up days by themselves do not guarantee an end to the bear market. Decades of stock market action prove this. Let's go to the two-month period of March and April 2020. As the global Covid-19 pandemic shut down economies around the world, the Nasdaq plunged from a then-high of 9,838 to 6,631, a 33% shellacking. Near the end of that decline, the Nasdaq posted a flurry of huge up days. But none of them alone turned the market around.


On March 10, 2020, in the middle of the stock market's selling avalanche, the Nasdaq composite jumped nearly 5%. But then the index dropped hard the next two sessions. The next day, bargain hunters propped the Nasdaq up 9.4%. Two days later on March 17, the index leapt 6.2%. Volume was intense.


None of the above-mentioned up days proved to be the stock market bottom back then.


Eventually, sellers got exhausted. The Nasdaq bottomed out at 6,631 on March 23. That session showed a big intraday swoon. But curiously, by day's end, the tech-rich index finished only 0.3% lower. It also finished nicely in the upper half of the day's trading range. Put another way, the tide began to show signs of turning from a heavy supply of shares from willing sellers to emerging demand from hungry buyers.


Clues To A Stock Market Turn
----------------------------


But what is the key to understanding when to selectively begin to add stocks? Watch for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). Five years ago, that arrived on April 6, Day 10 of a new rally attempt that started with an up day on March 24. New growth stocks then broke out. Companies such as **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)), **Zoom** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) and dozens of others made 52-week and all-time highs to spearhead a market move higher.


In the meantime, reactions to Wednesday's rebound by stock market veterans generally reflected a cautious tone.


"Even if the administration decides to de-escalate global trade wars and shift their focus to other policy areas, we're still not out of the woods," Christian Hoffman, head of fixed income at Thornburg Investment Management, wrote in comments emailed to IBD. "Our attention will move away from the president's tweets and back to economic data to assess the damage that's been done."


The CNN Fear and Greed Index, headed into Wednesday's rebound, stood at the "Extreme Fear" zone at 3 on a scale of 0 to 100.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


While no one knows what day or what month the stock market will actually produce a tradable rally over weeks and months ahead, now is the best time to build an excellent watchlist of stocks.


Notice the upside section of [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?_gl=1*z7tpn8*_gcl_au*NDAzMjM1NjE4LjE3NDE2MzUwMDAuMTE5MDk3ODQ5NC4xNzQzNjMwODUwLjE3NDM2MzA4NDk.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0NDIyNzYxMy41MDEuMS4xNzQ0MjI4ODMyLjU2LjAuMA..) at Investors.com showed a hefty number of companies that rose significantly in above-average volume. If this continues, take this news as a subtle hint that institutional investors are beginning to redeploy capital back into the stock market.


Second, keep a close eye on stock market breadth indicators.


On Wednesday, the [homepage of MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) showed 3,168 stocks that advanced in above-average turnover while only 39 companies fell in big volume. Such a wide margin between winners and losers is ridiculously rare. Yet in general, you want to see more stocks participating in a rally among the major indexes.


Midcap stocks also enjoyed a big rebound. The S&P MidCap 400 rallied 9.3%. Yet like the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials, the midcap index dropped well below its own 200-day moving average. Once a true confirmed market uptrend gets underway and shows some legs, expect to see these indexes cross above the 200- and 50-day lines, then keep climbing.


Early data on Thinkorswim showed advancing stocks on the Nasdaq surpassed decliners by a more than 5-1 ratio. On the New York Stock Exchange, winners beat losers by nearly 10-to-1.


Beyond the stock market, other financial instruments piggybacked on the surge in stocks.


The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index rallied 7.2% to $82,289.72 to snap a four-day losing streak, according to Dow Jones. The index remains down 11.9% since Jan. 1. Gold futures rose more than 3% and hit a session peak of $3,118 per ounce. Silver moved 4.3% higher to $30.95; copper springboarded 7.5% higher to $4.46 a pound.

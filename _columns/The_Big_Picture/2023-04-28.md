Stock Market Ends April On Bullish High. Will Fed Chair Powell Spoil The Party?

The stock market ended the day, week and April on a high as stocks were lifted by encouraging Big Tech earnings. But with the latest Federal Reserve meeting next week, the question now is whether Fed Chair Powell will rain on the bulls' parade.


The Nasdaq composite ended the day up 0.7%, helping it to a weekly lift of 1.3%. It ended April with a mere fractional gain. Nevertheless, the tech-heavy index is up nearly 18% so far this year.


The benchmark S&P 500 did even better, popping 0.8%, helping it to a weekly gain of 0.9%. It rose 1.6% for April, climbing to highs reached in February. It also pulled further clear of the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Gainers outnumbered decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was also higher.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average muscled 0.8% higher for the day and 2.5% for April. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) led the upside while **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) was the worst laggard, though its loss was slender.


Small caps managed to outperform the major indexes, with the Russell 2000 closing up 1%. However, it remains rooted below its major moving averages. Growth stocks fared best of all, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lifting 1.2%.


Fed Meeting Looms, Will Powell Fight Bulls?
-------------------------------------------


The next meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to kick off Tuesday, with an interest rate decision on Wednesday afternoon.

At the moment, the stock market is pricing in a quarter-point rate hike at the meeting. The big question is whether central bankers will feel emboldened to continue tightening due to sticky inflation. With the U.S. consumer continuing to be resilient and ongoing strength in the labor market, the Fed has a tricky path to navigate.


Bulls are keen for the Fed Chair Powell to indicate the end of the tightening cycle is in sight, but bears fear the FOMC may end up going higher for longer.


At the moment, the stock market uptrend remains under pressure, despite the positive close to the week. With the Fed meeting dead ahead, investors should err on the side of caution and maintain exposure in the 20% to 40% range. Capital preservation and avoiding a bull trap are key for now.


We will be watching for a decisive close above recent highs before switching the market outlook to "uptrend resumes."

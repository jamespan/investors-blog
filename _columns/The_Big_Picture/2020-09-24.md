The stock market rebounded from solid losses to end with modest gains Thursday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended with moderate gains in a volatile trading session that saw the index fall over 1% at the open.




The Nasdaq led the major stock indexes higher with a 0.4% gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 inched higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrials followed with a 0.2% rise.


Leading growth stocks also rallied, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) moved up 0.3%. In the IBD 50, **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) and **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) advanced 3.1% and 1.9%, respectively. Both stocks are trying to retake their 50-day moving averages.


Volume was slightly lower on the Nasdaq, and was indicated lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Rally Attempt Continues
------------------------------------


Despite the [new stock market correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-another-hit-apple-amazon-netflix-slump/), Thursday is Day 4 of a rally attempt. This means that a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) — and a new uptrend — could occur any day. The first day of the rally attempt was a "pink rally day" on Sept. 21. During that session, the Nasdaq erased most of a sharp drop to close near the highs of the day.


![MP092420](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP092420.jpg)Since then, the Nasdaq has not undercut its Sept. 21 low, so the rally attempt remains intact. Meanwhile, S&P 500 undercut its recent lows, so Thursday was Day 1 of a rally attempt on that index. The stock market needs a follow-through day on only one index to shift the stock market trend; however, strong action across multiple indexes can help increase your confidence in a new uptrend.


A follow-through day gives investors the green light to start buying stocks breaking out past [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). And right now, there aren't a whole lot of new breakouts.


If a follow-through signal occurs, don't plunge immediately into the market. Not all follow-through days lead to sustained uptrends, so start with a few stocks.


Amid worsening [general market conditions](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/action-plans/), investors should be more focused on playing defense than buying new breakouts. Watch for stocks that are exhibiting strength in a weak stock market; they could be the leaders of a new uptrend.

Stocks To Watch: AMD, Nvidia, Tesla
-----------------------------------


Amid the current stock market weakness, tech giants **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) snapped back with solid gains Thursday. These three stocks could again be stock market winners during a potential new uptrend.


AMD stock is trading just below its 50-day line after Thursday's 1.5% advance. Shares are testing the 50-day line for the first time since a July 22 breakout above a 59.10 buy point.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [AMD stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.aspx) boasts a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


Nvidia continues to hold above its [critical 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), according to a [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The stock rallied nearly 2% Thursday.


On Monday, the stock hit a new buy area, as it rebounded from its 50-day line. However, with the stock market trend in a correction, all new buys are off the table.


Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) is just off its old highs. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500.



Tesla stock again found support at its 50-day line. Shares fell as much as 7.6% Thursday before closing with a nearly 2% gain.


According to Leaderboard commentary, "Tesla erased a big gain from its last buy point, a sell signal. The stock is rebounding off the 50-day moving average, but it's a riskier entry amid increasing volatility."


Nvidia also is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock.


Stock Market Earnings: Costco Falls
-----------------------------------


Retail giant Costco [reported mixed fiscal Q4 earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/costco-earnings-digital-sales-costco-stock/) late Thursday, and shares dipped about 2% in extended trade. Costco earned $3.13 per share, while revenue rose 12.5% to $52.28 billion. The Street expected earnings per share to rise 6% to $2.85. Revenue was seen rising 10% to $52.47 billion.


Costco stock ended Thursday above a 331.59 alternate buy point, and is now finding support at its 50-day line.

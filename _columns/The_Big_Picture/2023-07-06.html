<p>As the stock market uptrend pulls back from its 2023 highs, these three stock market leaders are near buy zones: <a href="https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard">IBD Leaderboard </a>stock <strong>Rambus</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS" target="_blank">RMBS</a>), <a href="https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader">IBD SwingTrader</a> stock <strong>Dynatrace</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT" target="_blank">DT</a>) and <b>Alphabet</b> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL" target="_blank">GOOGL</a>).</p>
<p>A flood of economic data hit the markets Thursday. First, ADP's June National Employment Report showed a projected 497,000 surge in jobs vs. estimates for an increase of 235,000. ADP showed a gain of just 278,000 jobs in May. ADP's report offers a preview of Friday's June payrolls report from the Labor Department.</p>
<p>The Labor Department's first-time claims for unemployment assistance rose to 248,000 vs. 239,000 in the previous week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the S&amp;P Global Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.4, above the 54.1 estimate. The June Institute for Supply Management services index climbed to 53.9 vs. the 50.8 estimate. Finally, the Labor Department's JOLTS (job openings and labor turnover survey) report showed that job openings fell to 9.824 million for May vs. April's 10.1 million.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>

Meanwhile, investors now see a more-than-92% chance of a quarter-point hike at this month's Fed meeting, per <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CME FedWatch Tool.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-stakes-rise-as-10-year-treasury-yield-bolts-above-4-sp-500-falls/">Friday's employment report for June</a> will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to grow 213,000, down from May's 339,000 growth. Wall Street expects the unemployment rate to edge lower to 3.6%. Wage growth is seen slipping to 4.2% from 4.3%.</p>
<h2>Stock Market Today</h2>
<p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.1%. In the Dow 30, <strong>American Express</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP" target="_blank">AXP</a>) skidded nearly 2.7%, just as it was getting close to the 177.04 buy point in a cup with handle.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite both lost 0.8%, well off the session lows. The small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 1.6%.</p>
<p>Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE from the prior session. The <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/">distribution-day count</a> for the S&amp;P 500 increased to five after a second consecutive day of institutional selling. Wednesday's 0.2% loss on the S&amp;P 500 should have counted as a distribution day despite Monday's half-day volume. Thus, two distribution days are added today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq's distribution day count increased to four, still a manageable number. However, Thursday's losses were definitely more severe than previous sessions.</p>
<p>The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY" target="_blank">FFTY</a>) dropped 2% Thursday. In the <a href="https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/">IBD 50</a>, <strong>Chipotle Mexican Grill</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG" target="_blank">CMG</a>) declined for a third-straight day, with a 1.3% drop. Shares are about 2% below a 2,139.88 flat-base entry after a short-lived breakout.</p>
<p>Despite Thursday's sharp losses, the stock market uptrend remains intact. So, IBD's recommended market exposure still sits at 80%-100%. Still, investors should be prepared for the market to pull back some more. Make sure you take some profits into strength and quickly sell any losers, like <strong>Monday.com</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY" target="_blank">MNDY</a>). The software leader hit a 7% sell signal Thursday, although it's testing support at the 10-week moving average.</p>

<h2>Leaders To Watch: Rambus, Dynatrace, Alphabet</h2>
<div class="small-12 columns medium-6 leftchart"><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=weekly&amp;symbol=GOOGL"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Rambus passed an early trendline entry at 61 last week, but gave up that buy point during Thursday's 3.2% decline. Shares continue to build a consolidation above their 50-day line, according to <a href="https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith">IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard">Per Leaderboard</a>, after two miserable years for the bottom line in 2018 and 2019, the designer of chips for the memory, security and display markets has been on an earnings roll, although Q1 earnings and revenue growth decelerated from Q4.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dynatrace-stock-finds-technical-support-amid-nasdaq-pullback/">Software maker Dynatrace</a> has formed a three-weeks-tight chart pattern, representing a brief consolidation in which institutional investors pause their buying. Shares are about 3% away from their latest entry at 52.99.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/google-stock-google-fends-off-microsoft-bing/">Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day</a>, Alphabet, is trying to find support around its 50-day line. This week, investors could have used Friday's high of 121.08 as a <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/">buy point</a>. But shares are below that buy trigger after Thursday's nearly 1.4% loss. Plus, Alphabet shares could have a <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/">proper base</a>&nbsp;in another week.</p>

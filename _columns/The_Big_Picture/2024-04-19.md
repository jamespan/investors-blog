The stock market ended the day and week firmly lower Friday amid more Iran-Israel tensions and a post-earnings **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) sell-off. A new inflation reading and a deluge of key company reports are set for the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite got a beatdown from the bears, as it plunged 2.1%. Its weekly decline was even more severe at 5.5%. The index has now fallen for six sessions in a row and is roughly 5% below the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Much of the tech-heavy index's gains for the year have evaporated, though it remains up 2% so far in 2024.


The S&P 500 ended in slightly better shape, but still fell 0.9% Friday. It has crashed 3% below its 50-day moving average, a bearish look, and gave up 3.1% for the week. The benchmark index now holds a 4.1% gain for the year.


The fact that advancers led decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and held a slender edge on the Nasdaq exchange suggests a rotation may be taking place.


Nevertheless, with the S&P 500 falling below the psychologically important 5,000 level and the Nasdaq composite losing further ground on its 50-day moving average, the current outlook is being downgraded to "market in correction." The recommended exposure level has also been cut to 0% to 20%.


Leading Stocks Breaking Down
----------------------------


The fact that leading stocks such as artificial intelligence darling **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) and **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) are all breaking down further bolstered the case for changing the market outlook.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP041924.jpg)Instead of buying stocks, investors should concentrate on raising cash. Sell your weakest performing stocks first and take extra care to watch for sell signals. If you have great conviction in a stock and the luxury of a profit cushion, you can consider holding through the correction.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed as it gained 0.6%. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) outperformed following strong earnings while **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) lagged.


Small caps held up too, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.2%. But the bears feasted on growth stocks, and the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund dropped 2.2%.

Iran-Israel Tensions; PCE Inflation Data Looms
----------------------------------------------


The stock market was looking shaky overnight after Israel attacked Iran, though worries eased as it emerged it was a more limited strike than initially feared. This bolstered hopes for a de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East, which could help ease pressure on stocks.


For the coming week, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, due Friday, is the key data point to watch. PCE in March is seen rising 2.6% year-over-year, which would be a 0.1% rise on the previous month. But Core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, is expected to come in at 2.7%. This would be a 0.1% decline on February's figure.


Other data set to drop in the forthcoming week includes new-home sales for March and the U.S. Manufacturing PMI, both due Tuesday. Preliminary first-quarter GDP is set for release on Thursday.


There are also a slew of important [earnings reports due](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/meta-stock-holds-strong-earnings-dexcom-earnings/). AI leaders **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), Leaderboard stock **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are all on deck.


These Stock Market Areas Hold Up
--------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors closed mixed Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) despite the negative action at index level. Technology and communication services were hit hard. However the defensive utilities area and financials held up the best.


Once again, the relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's industry groups gave a more granular view of what happened on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/). Drugstores, hospital stocks, Northeast regional banks and health insurance plays all had strong sessions. By contrast, computer hardware stocks, fabless chip companies and food wholesalers suffered most.



Another laggard was the leisure-movies group. This was weighed down by the performance of **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).


Netflix flashed a sell signal by crashing below its 50-day moving average in mammoth volume amid a disappointing outlook. Investors also seemed displeased that the firm will stop reporting subscriber growth in its quarterly reports next year.


Friday represented Netflix stock's lowest close since Feb. 13, and its biggest percentage decrease since April 20, 2022, when it plummeted 35.12%.

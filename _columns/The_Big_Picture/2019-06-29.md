You'll often hear on a Friday that "investors didn't want to go into the weekend short." That was particularly true Friday as a round of late buying lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite to session highs. Sellers were kept at bay in the stock market as Wall Street awaited the outcome of trade talks Saturday between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping.




Early Saturday, the two leaders agreed to hold off on new tariffs and [revive China trade talks](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-eases-huawei-ban-reviving-china-trade-talks-dow-jones-futures-rise/). President Trump also said he would allow U.S. companies to sell some product to Huawei, a Chinese telecom giant that the U.S. deems a security threat.


The U.S. has imposed 25% tariffs, or import taxes, on $250 billion in Chinese goods. President Trump has threatened to target another $300 billion.


Friday's Stock Market
---------------------


Gains were muted in the indexes for most of Friday's session, despite a strong showing from financial stocks. The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, the Nasdaq composite added 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrials picked up 0.3%. But the real strength was in small caps again. After jumping 1.9% Thursday in higher volume, the Russell 2000 gained another 1.3% Friday. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in sharply higher than Thursday, mostly due to the rebalancing of the Russell indexes.


In the first six months of 2019, the S&P 500 rose 17.3%, its best first-half performance since a 19.5% gain in the first half of 1997. But looking back at the six corrections of 20% to 30% since 1980, the prior five averaged a gain of 34% in the six months after the bottom. By this measure, [this year's rally is lagging](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-next-six-months-2019/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP062819-255x300.jpg)Banks passed their stress tests Thursday and many announcedÂ [share buybacks and increased dividends](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-pop-amid-jpmorgan-others-stock-buybacks-dividends-stress-tests-2019/). **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) were top gainers in the Dow Jones, up more than 2.5% each. Goldman plans to hike its quarterly dividend by nearly 50% to $1.25 a share. JPMorgan said it will raise its quarterly dividend to 90 cents a share from 80 cents.


Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3x ETF ([FAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAS)) picked up 3.4% to 73.98. A 74.10 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is still in play for the triple-leveraged exchange traded fund. But whether or not the financials can provide sustained market leadership is questionable, especially in a low-interest rate environment.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


Overall, market technicals look pretty good. The Nasdaq closed 1% below its June 20 high of 8088.88. A move above this high with conviction would qualify as a breakout. The other indexes find themselves in similar situations. The Russell 2000 ended the week about 4 points below its recent high of 1570.74.


But it remains a challenging environment for growth stocks. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed Friday, up 0.8%. But the proxy for leading growth stocks slumped 1.9% Tuesday amid more signs of profit-taking in leading [software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/). **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) recently flashed a sell signal after a breakout attempt from an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/), but outside of that, sell signals among leading software stocks have been few and far between.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Buyers stormed into new issue **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)), fueling a breakout over a 45.85 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares ended at 46.38, up 2.8%.



Another recent IPO, **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)), gained 3% to 43.81. It's approaching a new buy point of 46.43.


Meanwhile, **RealReal** ([REAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REAL)) soared in its debut after pricing Thursday night at 20. Shares opened at 28 and closed at 28.90. The company is an online marketplace for authenticated, consigned luxury goods.

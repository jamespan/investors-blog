The stock market endured another volatile session Tuesday, but the bulls eventually won out as major stock indexes rallied sharply into the close.




The Dow Jones industrial average added 1.6%, helped by strength in **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)). All three ended with gains of 3% to 4%. The S&P 500 picked up 1.3% and the Nasdaq composite rose 1%. Nasdaq and NYSE volume fell from Monday's levels. The volume was good news for the bears and not so much for the bulls because it indicated a lack of conviction behind the buying.


The Dow Jones Transportation Average also turned in a solid showing, helped by strength in [airline stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/delta-air-lines-forecast-lifts-united-airlines-southwest-airlines/). The index jumped around 2%. Small caps held their own, with the Russell 2000 up 1.3%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP040318-261x300.png)Tuesday's rally wasn't a big surprise because fear was on full display Monday when indexes sold off. The put/call volume ratio registered an elevated reading of around 1.28, indicating investors were buying more bearish puts than calls. Elevated readings in the put/call ratio have come ahead of market rallies in the past.


Is Stock Market Ready To Rally?
-------------------------------


Amid various calls by market pundits recently to buy the dip, IBD readers know that it's premature to do so. At some point, the major stock indexes will flash a sign of strength, indicating it's OK to nibble at some fundamentally and technically healthy stocks. Until then, it's best to sit tight and watch the volatility from the sidelines, especially with so many leading growth stocks below their 50-day moving averages.


But sitting tight and watching from the sidelines doesn't mean you should be twiddling your fingers. In fact, now is the time to be building watch lists of stocks holding up well.


In the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www..marketsmith.com), for example, **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) continues to hold above the 50-day line and its most recent buy point, while security software names **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) are also showing resilience.


IBD lowered its market outlook to "market in correction" March 27 after the Nasdaq composite plunged 2.9%. Several leading growth stocks have come under severe pressure, including the so-called FANG names: **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). Of the four, Netflix has shown the most resilience, but support at the 50-day line is still in question after the video-streaming giant made a pretty good case for support at the line Thursday.


Amazon reversed higher, rising 1.5%, after falling 1.2% intraday.


Automakers reported monthly sales data Tuesday, and **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) was a bright spot. Shares jumped 9% to 21.79 on news that sales in March jumped 14%, well ahead of expectations . Fiat Chrysler's recent pullback has been tame as the stock holds above the 20 level. But it's still below the 50-day line.


Among the day's movers, **Spotify Technology** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) ended near its session low at 149.01 after opening at 165.90. The music-streaming giant opted for a [direct listing with a reference price of 132](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nyse-sets-a-placeholder-price-on-spotify-ipo-at-132-a-share/), rather than an initial public offering.


Money flowed out of bonds Tuesday, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield by 5 basis points to 2.78%. The 10-year yield has backed off considerably since hitting an intraday high near 2.94% on March 21. That stands to reason as money hasÂ  flowed out of stocks and into bonds over that time.

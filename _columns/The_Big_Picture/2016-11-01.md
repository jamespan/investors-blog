Small Caps Lead Stocks Down; Is A Rebound Due? Apple Falls Hard

The stock market continued to weaken in a broad retreat Tuesday, although a few signs suggest the indexes could snap back in the near term.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell for the sixth day in a row, down 0.7% each. For the Nasdaq, it was also the fourth [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) amid that losing streak, as the main exchanges registered higher volume.


Indexes have piled up eight distribution days in the past several weeks. That's growing evidence of institutional investors cutting back on stocks, and it's a bearish trend reflected in other significant ways.


The Nasdaq composite undercut the Oct. 13 low, and the S&P 500 sank below the September lows. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are now making a narrow series of lower highs and lower lows, the definition of a downtrend. Both remain below their 50-day moving averages, too.


![MP110116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP110116-215x300.png)Small caps came out in worse shape, with the Russell 2000 burrowing 1.1% lower. Not to be outdone, the Dow utilities skidded 1.8% Tuesday, giving back essentially all of Monday's rally.


Losing stocks led winners by more than 3 to 1 on the NYSE and by 7 to 3 on the Nasdaq.


It's all adding up to a gloomier picture.


Wall Street has some angst to cope with, including an announcement Wednesday afternoon from the Federal Reserve. The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates until December, but its policy statement always causes some tension.


There's also new uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and the balance of power in the Senate. In any normal election, Wall Street would favor the Republican candidate. But this time, Donald Trump's support for trade barriers has much of the business community concerned. The IBD/TIPP Poll found that more [investors favor Hillary Clinton](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/why-do-investors-seem-to-favor-hillary-clinton-ibdtipp-poll/), whose ties to Wall Street are closer than her rhetoric may suggest.


Earnings season has gone badly for many leading stocks, and that's another worry. Even a slight miss in results or forecasts is vastly magnified. An earnings report effectively can become weaponized, destroying an investor's hard-earned profits in a stock with the effectiveness of a laser-guided bomb.


Investors, thus, need to seek shelter by keeping exposure to stocks moderate. Consider taking profits before a company issues its quarterly results, especially if your profit cushion is thin.


Investor fear is running feverish. As seen in IBD's new ["Psychological Market Indicators" page](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) at Investors.com, the put/call volume ratio spiked above 1.2 Tuesday and was 1.16 Friday. Yet, it is precisely in such high levels of fear that the market often finds a bottom. Readings above 1.15 on the ratio have coincided with at least short-term market lows. This contrarian indicator has been reliable for more than a year, and it is illustrated in the market-trend file linked at the bottom of this page.


Another indicator, the [CBOE Market Volatility index](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), also signals that indexes could be ripe for a bounce. The index is more than 20% above its 10-day moving average, which has done its job in flagging market lows.


On another level, some price momentum indicators are flashing oversold signals for the market.


In many cases, eight distribution days have been enough to signal a market top. But the market can shake it off too. On May 17, the Nasdaq had nine distribution days and IBD's market outlook held at "uptrend under pressure." The market snapped back to a confirmed uptrend five days later.


The IBD 50 dropped by 1.3% Tuesday; 42 of its components fell. About 20 of the 50 are now trading below the 50-day moving average, including many that dropped below that line within the past couple of weeks.


Medical research equipment company **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) tumbled 3.6% Tuesday, making its first close below the line since Sept. 19. The health care sector has been hit hard this earnings season. **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) made a bearish reversal despite news that the chip designer beat profit estimates and raised its Q4 sales forecast.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is not an IBD 50 member, but the tech and consumer goods bellwether helped move the market lower with a 1.8% drop to 111.49. It closed below the 50-day moving average for the first time since Sept. 9 and is quickly erasing gains from a breakout past a 110.33 buy point.

  Stock Market Ends 2018 With A Bang; Dow Jones Scores 1.1% Gain

The stock market closed out 2018 with a bang Monday as a late round of buying pushed the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite to session highs by the close. While the major stock indexes are making a case for a bottom, it's not a convincing case yet as the stock market heads into 2019 still in correction mode.




The Dow Jones industrial average led the way Monday, up 1.1%. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 small-cap index ended with gains of around 0.8%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in about 5% to 10% lower than Friday's levels.


Some "window dressing" was likely seen near the close as fund managers bought some strong-performing stocks at the end of the quarter to make their portfolios look good.


Wall Street started off the week in a good mood on optimism about China trade talks. In a tweet Saturday, President Donald Trump said he had a "very good call" with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

For both indexes, it was the biggest annual loss since the financial crisis in 2008. But the losses for each index were much more severe a decade ago, when the S&P 500 crashed 38.5% and the Dow Jones nearly 34%.


The Nasdaq composite fell 3.9% in 2018, also its worst annual decline since 2008 when it plunged 40.5%.


Stock Market News
-----------------


The Dow Jones rose 1.1% early, but near 12 p.m. ET, the blue-chip index was back to near break-even. Buyers eventually regained control. Strong gainers in the Dow Jones on Monday included **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)).


Goldman's outperformance came even as the 10-year Treasury yield fell an additional 3 basis points to 2.68%. Futures traders aren't expecting any rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2019, but Fed committee members envision two rates hikes in 2019.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) were the best gainers in the Nasdaq 100 on Monday, rising 4.4% and 3.6%, respectively.


But if the stock market confirms a new uptrend in the early part of 2019, don't expect leadership to come from Netflix and AMD. After unequivocal signs of institutional selling, both stocks are far off their highs. New leadership often comes from stocks that are much closer to highs â€” stocks with top fundamentals that are poised to break out of well-formed bases.


Watch For New Stock Market Leaders
----------------------------------


A recent IPO certainly has leadership potential. **Tencent Music** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) is working on a first-stage base with a 14.85 buy point. The company is already profitable and shows big sales growth in recent quarters.


Stock Market Forecast
---------------------


Meanwhile, the debate rages over what kind of year 2019 will be for the stock market. Instead of getting married to a bear thesis or bull thesis, continue to watch the price action in the major stock indexes. Currently, there are setups out there that could work nicely if new institutional money starts to come in from the sidelines.


The stock market is still in the early stages of a new rally attempt. Another big percentage gain in higher volume for the indexes could be enough to put the market back in a confirmed uptrend. Time will tell. If it happens, make sure there's no shortage of actionable setups among leading growth stocks. The more, the merrier.


You can find these setups in daily columns like [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-analysis/), [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) and [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/)


Stock Market News
-----------------


In stock market news today, IBD [Sector Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) cleared a cup-with-handle base with an 89.92 buy point but gains faded. Shares of the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock closed at 88.98, up 1.6%.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com), software leader **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) outperformed, rising nearly 4% to 89.30. Twilio rallied 13% from a prior buy point of 88.98, but it erased the entire gain amid weakness in the broad market.


Also in the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) today, **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) extended gains after a solid bounce off the 50-day moving average last week. A strong early gain faded, but Spirit still managed a 0.7% gain. Airlines have generally been strong performers over the past six months, but the group has been under a lot of selling pressure lately.


Speaking of industry groups, the only group in IBD's database that shows a gain over the past four weeks is the Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems group. IBD ranks 197 industry groups based on six-month price performance. Headed into the Monday, the group ranked 47th, up from 130 six weeks ago.


Economic News
-------------


In [economic news](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), the December jobs report looms large on Friday. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to increase by 180,000 with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7%. The economy created 155,000 jobs in November, below expectations.

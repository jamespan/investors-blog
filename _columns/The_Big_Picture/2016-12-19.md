Nasdaq Fades But Manages Small Gain; Uptrend Still Intact
==========================================================

The stock market managed modest gains Monday, although the Nasdaq closed in the bottom half of its intraday range for the fourth straight session.


Similar to the Dow and the 20,000 level, the 5,500 level for the Nasdaq has been a tough nut to crack.


The fact that the Dow and Nasdaq are seeing some selling pressure at these round numbers is not a red flag and reason to be bearish. Instead, call it a yellow flag, along with the seven distribution days in recent weeks for the tech-heavy index. Distribution days, or days of institutional selling, have been much less prominent in the S&P 500.


![mp121916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP121916-169x300.png)The Nasdaq rose 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2% each. Small caps did well again, with the Russell 2000 up 0.5%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in well below Friday's levels — not a big surprise following Friday's witching session and the approaching Christmas holiday. Breadth was pretty good, with NYSE advancers outnumbering decliners by about 8-to-5. Nasdaq winners topped losers by 4-t0-3.


Stocks drifted lower for a brief time in late-morning trade on geopolitical jitters after Russia's ambassador to Turkey was shot and killed in Turkey. After that, nerves were again rattled on news that several people were killed in Germany when a truck drove into a crowded Christmas market.


When it comes to overall market health, clearly it's not a market under stress, but the Nasdaq composite added a couple of distribution days to the count last week. The index stalled a bit on Thursday, closing higher but ending in the bottom half of its intraday range in higher volume. It showed mild distribution Friday, falling 0.4% in higher volume, but volume was unusually heavy in the market Friday due to options expiration.


It's hard to get bearish when looking at charts for Nasdaq 100 names like **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). All three are breakout candidates.


With limited signs of meaningful distribution in the broad market, it's still OK to look for new buys. Be careful not to chase extended stocks and keep your attention focused on institutional-quality names. Heavy volume is always good to see at a breakout, or when a stock finds support after a pullback, but that might be a lot to ask when volume is typically light in the market.


Homebuilders outperformed early but faded. Before the open, **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) reported another solid quarter but erased an early 4% gain. Shares fell 0.02 to 43.40. The stock offers a good example of what resistance, or selling pressure, looks like on a weekly chart. It's been getting resistance near 45 for more than a week and remains in a downtrend.



The homebuilding group has been strengthening lately, although much of the strength has come from smaller, more speculative names like **Beazer Homes** ([BZH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZH)), **William Lyon Homes** ([WLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLH)) and **M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)).


Semiconductor stocks, retailers and real estate investment trusts also outperformed.


Gains haven't been huge for **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **KLA-Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) after their breakouts, but all three are trading tightly and holding near highs.


In the REIT space, **LaSalle Hotel Properties** ([LHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHO)) is holding gains and trading tightly after a breakout over a 29.20 buy point. Industrial REIT **Prologis** ([PLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLD)), meanwhile, is approaching a buy point at 54.89 as it works on the right side of a base.


Monday's session was light on breakouts but **Supernus** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)) was an exception. It soared past a 24.85 cup-with-handle buy point in heavy volume, rising 1.90 to 25.65.


In the medical services group, **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)) jumped out of a cup-shaped base with a 21.78 buy point, rising $2 to 23.20. The stock garners high ratings from IBD, but it's a thinly traded speculative name with a market capitalization of $640 million. Stocks like this can work, but they can also be quite volatile.

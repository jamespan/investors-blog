  Stocks Rebound Meekly; Will These Sectors Save The Trump Rally?

Is the Trump bump over?


 


That question likely lingers in the minds of both individual investors and equity trading desks around the world, especially given how sellers dominated the scene on Tuesday.


Now that the market's mind seems to be shifting away from earnings results and the Federal Reserve, one may be right to think that the headlines coming out of Capitol Hill will direct short-term moves. But at this point, given the double-digit gains enjoyed by the major indexes since the Nov. 4 lows, one would be justified in expecting the market to take a longer break.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP032217-168x300.png)On Wednesday, an afternoon rebound helped calm the nerves of traders as the Nasdaq composite rose 0.5%, taking back a modest chunk of Tuesday's 1.8% thrashing. Big cap techs dominated as the Nasdaq 100 gained nearly 0.7%, recovering less than half of the prior day's 1.5% purge.


The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher as NYSE volume fell. That's even less appetizing a rebound when you consider that Tuesday's 1.2% drop came in higher volume. If it weren't for the mauling of sports apparel giant **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), gapping down more than 4 points, or 7%, to 53.92 in quadruple average turnover, perhaps the Dow Jones industrial average would have also ended higher.


The blue chip index lost 7 points. Yet for now, like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, the popular index remains above its key 50-day moving average, a sign of strength.


Volume also dimmed on the Nasdaq, perhaps due to Wall Street's desire to see how the Republican party's alternative to former President Obama's Affordable Care Act will pass muster during a vote in the House Thursday.

Without question, the market's complexion has changed in the course of just one day. The major indexes have suffered their biggest single-day declines since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections, adding a fifth distribution day to the books. And unlike the prior four instances of serious professional selling, Tuesday's decline showed real teeth.


Will the sell-off deepen? One step is to keep monitoring the distribution-day count in the Market Pulse table. Second, keep an eye on the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the major indexes. After Tuesday's heavy selling, the rating dipped to a B for the S&P 500 and a B+ for the Nasdaq. In a long uptrend, grades of C or better are desirable.


Through Tuesday, 3,807 stocks within the IBD 6000 index scored an A or B for Acc/Dist, vs. 1,314 with a D or E. (Track these stats by going to the daily Nasdaq chart in the link at the bottom of this article.)


In the Nasdaq's prior four distribution days, the average decline was a modest 0.3%, including the March 17 stalling session, in which it ended flat.
Just look at the top dogs in the banking and finance sector, responsible for a huge part of the market's rise over the past four months and multitudes of new highs.


In the superregional bank space, **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) showed a nice reversal, gaining nearly 1% to 66.97 in volume that bulged 17% above average. However, that turnover pales when compared with the sell-offs taken on March 17 (volume screamed 94% above normal) and Tuesday (volume up 92%). Plus, the stock needs to rise an additional 4.7% just to return to its 50-day moving average at its current level.


Industry peer **PNC Financial** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)) lost just a nickel on Wednesday, but is now 10% below its 131.83 all-time high. Cincinnati-based **Fifth Third Bancorp** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)) is now more than 14% below its 28.97 peak.


The superregional bank group is No. 4 among 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance.


The health care and big-cap biotech stocks are still a mess. The hospital giants are trading well below their 50-day lines. It may indeed be up to other sectors in the market, such as semiconductors, software and the internet, to do more of the heavy lifting to keep the uptrend intact.
Names such as **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) and **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), which together combine for $290 billion in market value, continue to sculpt lovely long-term uptrends. They represent the future of our economy and business in such fields as the Internet of Things, digital commerce and wireless communications.


Four of the five techs mentioned above are in [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


At the individual stock level, numerous leaders are holding above or at the 50-day lines, a positive. The IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Stock Spotlight and IPO Leaders screens can help you spot leading small, mid- and large-cap names that may find solid support at the 10-week lines and offer a secondary buy opportunity.

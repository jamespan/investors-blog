Judging by the 24/7 barrage of media headlines, the bulls would seem to have a lot to worry about. So do the bears. Yet one thing is certain for now: The market wants to keep climbing the wall of worry.




Major indexes posted small gains as NYSE and Nasdaq volume inched higher. Yet for a market in a confirmed uptrend, sometimes under pressure, since a rare Day 3 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) flashed on Wall Street on June 30, 2016, there was certainly little to grumble about in the stock market Wednesday.


In addition to the North Korean nuclear missile challenge, the increasing military presence by China in South Asian waters, and the debate over whether President Trump's tax cut proposal will pass through Congress, market watchers are now sounding the alarms over what Catalonia's quest for independence from Spain could mean for the EU and the European economy.


And on this side of the Atlantic, you're also now seeing headlines about whether U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators working for a revised NAFTA trade deal could produce something that may hurt the three economies in the future.


None of these issues, though, prevented the major indexes from posting all-time closing highs.


The Nasdaq composite got a boost in part by upgrades and raised price targets among the [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) and ended a relatively tame session up nearly 0.25%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials felt the tailwind of gains from a broad array of commodity, retail, transport, banking and tech issues as both advanced 0.2%.


Sure, the gains weren't much. But the key benchmarks brushed off light losses after the market open and finished at or close to their intraday highs. That's bullish. In a weak market, you tend to see the opposite occur (good open, bad close).


The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, released its minutes from a Sept. 19-20 meeting on interest rate policy. The general consensus appeared to be that policymakers at the U.S. central bank are closely watching inflation data, which in turn will impact the rise in the cost of money going forward. Yet the minutes on Wednesday seemed to hardly sway the market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP101117-212x300.png)Investors already got the message soon after the September meeting, when Fed chief Janet Yellen made a strong case for raising the fed funds rates by 25 basis points to a 1.25%-1.50% level in December. On Wednesday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond hovered around 2.35%. That's still well below this year's peak of 2.62% witnessed in mid-March.


Still, this question will linger for the rest of the year: How much of a negative impact could more rate hikes in 2018 and 2019 have on the U.S. economy?


No one can provide a definitive answer. But numberswise, it's clear that institutions have good reason to keep putting money to work in stocks.


With the U.S. economy accelerating, the manufacturing sector humming, and economies in other countries growing as well, investors seem to be comfortable with paying a so-called risk premium in equities. Third-quarter earnings and revenue for S&P 500 firms are seen rising in total 4.8% and 5.7%, respectively, according to S&P Capital IQ's estimates as of last week; full year earnings will likely rise 10.4%.


Despite the remarkable rise of the S&P 500 since bottoming at 666 in March 2009, its components still pay a decent dividend. The S&P 500's overall annualized yield is around 1.89%.


Virtually no one expects to see a hyperactive rise in U.S. interest rates, at least in the short term. The strength of debt-heavy utility and certain transportation stocks reflect this thinking. The Dow utilities are up 12.6% year to date. The Dow transports, up 0.5% on Wednesday following another gain in the airline group, are up 10.3% since Jan. 1.


Meanwhile, bullishness among newsletter editors jumped to 60.4%, a seven-month high, based on the weekly survey produced by Investors Intelligence. An unusually high level of bulls has proved over the past 24 months to precede pullbacks in the indexes. (View the bulls-bears stats and other important sentiment indicators by going to the Market Trend section at Investors.com, then click on [Psychological Market Indicators](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/).) But a long-term study of this indicators shows that the market can continue to rise even though bullishness stays high for a prolonged period.


Such was the case in both 2003, parts of 2004, and parts of 2014.


An investor should never use a single sentiment indicator to determine buy and sell decisions for individual stocks. Measures of market psychology are secondary indicators of strength and weakness, not primary ones.


Instead, stay focused on the day-to-day price-and-volume action of the major indexes. Counting bases, watching how breakouts turn out, and spotting pronounced selling among the leaders in a top industry group or sector are critical to keeping your gains and minimizing losses.


If and when the market finally suffers its first correction of at least 5% to 10%, you'll see a few things happen. Genuine distribution days, or sessions of intense institutional selling, will pop with the same fury as the wildfires plaguing Napa and Sonoma counties in Northern California. Top stocks in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [Global Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/global-leaders/) and [Stock Spotlight](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) will tank hard in heavy turnover. Many bases will look terrible; many breakouts will fail.


When the market shifts into "Uptrend under pressure" or "Market in correction," that's the time to decide on whether to raise some cash, cut your worst performers and take some gains. But you don't have to necessarily go from 100% invested to 100% cash in a matter of minutes.


Each stock in your portfolio deserves an individualized decision.



Consider **Kemet** ([KEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEM)), currently No. 11 in the IBD 50 and member of the market-leading Electronics sector. Astute IBD readers are wondering: Did this small-cap leader break out of a flawed cup base, or is it simply making new highs after a bullish bounce off the 50-day moving average less than three weeks ago?


The answer: yes and yes.


The recent correction from a former high at 24.64 to 19.17 on Sept. 13, or 22%, was deep enough for a new cup or double bottom base to form. But the cup that completed on Oct. 6, followed by a breakout the next session, was flawed because it did not meet the minimum requirement of six weeks in length.


So, Monday's move past the left-side lip of the cup was not a time to buy.


It's justified to view Kemet's pullback from March 21 to May 5 as meeting the criteria for a six-week flat base. On May 8, the stock catapulted past a 12.75 entry, or 10 cents above the base's left-side peak of 12.65. If you accept that as a primary buy point, then the Sept. 27 jump off the 50-day line near 19.68 served as a chance to add a smaller amount of shares to an existing position or create a new position.


Has the stock issued a sell signal? Not yet. Will it form a new base? Possibly. Monitoring the stock regularly is the best move.

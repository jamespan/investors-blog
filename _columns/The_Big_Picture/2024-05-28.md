The Nasdaq composite marked an all-time closing high in the stock market Tuesday as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) continued its post-earnings rally. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped nearly 0.6% and breached its 50-day moving average, weighed down by weakness in health care names like **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)).




Amgen looked like it was ready to clear a 322.60 handle entry when shares jumped 2.5% on May 15. But sellers have been in the stock since then, and it is now below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and is testing the 300 level. Merck, meanwhile, had been setting up in a shallow flat base, but slumped below its 50-day line Tuesday in higher volume.


Overall, the stock market held up relatively well even as the 10-year Treasury yield broke out of a downtrend and cleared the 4.50% level. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 4.54%, up 7 basis points.

The next piece of inflation data for the bond market to ponder will be in Friday's Personal Income and Spending report for April. On a year-over-year basis, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index is expected to come in at 2.8%, unchanged from March. This is the number the Federal Reserve wants to see closer to 2%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.6% and topped the 17,000 level for the first time. But breadth was weak as Nasdaq declining stocks outnumbered advancers by about 4-to-3. Volume rose from Friday's light, preholiday level.

The index showed bullish price action with another all-time high and a close above Thursday's high. But the invested percentage in the accompanying Market Pulse stays at 60%-80%. With most growth stocks still acting quite well, favoring the 80% side makes sense. Just keep in mind that there's a large number of extended stocks out there. Avoid the pitfall of chasing the strongest performers that are well past proper entries.


The Nasdaq 100 gained 0.3%, but the weak breadth was also seen in the First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)), which slipped 0.8%.


After soaring 15% last week, NvidiaÂ rallied another 7% in the stock market today. It's well past the 5% buy zone from a 922.20 handle entry. Nvidia is also 27% above its 50-day moving average, which means the stock should not be chased at current levels.


The S&P 500 rose fractionally, also in higher volume, but the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) gave back 0.7% and is testing its 50-day line. Breadth was about 2-to-1 negative on the NYSE.


Market Movers
-------------


Oil and gas stocks, along with mining stocks, outperformed.


Inside the drilling group, **Seadrill** ([SDRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SDRL)) rallied more than 3%. It's near the top of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 53.58 buy point. In the oil machinery group, **TechnipFMC** ([FTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTI)) poked above its 50-day line, rising 1.7%. The stock is holding near highs after a breakout from a base in mid-March.



Among mining stocks, **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) rallied 4%. The copper miner is still on a strong uptrend after topping a 40.99 entry on March 13.


Meanwhile, several stocks in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com) have followed through, or are following through after recent breakouts, including small-cap **MoneyLion** ([ML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ML)), **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)), **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) and **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)).


Cruise line operator **Viking** ([VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)) shot to a new high ahead of its earnings report Wednesday before the open. Viking cleared an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) last week. Retail leader **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) also reports early Wednesday.

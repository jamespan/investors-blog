The stock market powered higher Friday as stocks enjoyed more weekly gains. Now, testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the latest jobs report are on the agenda for investors.




The Nasdaq composite hit all-time intraday and closing highs as it ended the session up 1.1% at just under 16,275. The fact that it finally topped its November 2021 high of 16,212 is an encouraging sign. It has now gained in 16 of the past 18 weeks and sits clear of all its [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). The tech-heavy index is now up more than 8% this year.


It was also a noteworthy day for the S&P 500. The benchmark index rose 0.8% and closed above the 5,100 mark for the first time. It is more than 5% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and nearly 14% above the 200-day line. The benchmark index holds a gain of nearly 8% in 2024.


Advancers outnumbered decliners by less than 2-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq exchange. Volume was lower on both stock market exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week 0.1% lower despite a 0.2% daily gain. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was strongest. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) lagged [amid reports of takeover talks](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-in-talks-to-buy-troubled-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-22e0db4e?mod=hp_listb_pos2) for supplier **Spirit AeroSystems** ([SPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPR)).


Small caps also gave the bears a bloody nose, with the Russell 2000 rising 1.1%. Growth stocks fared even better, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund popping 1.8%.


Powell Testimony, Jobs Report Up Next
-------------------------------------


The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index slipped to 47.8 in February, which was more than economists expected. It was also down 1.3 points from January's 49.1. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 76.9 for February. This was weaker than expected and below January's reading of 79.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP030124.jpg)Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could move the stock market with expected testimony before Congress in the coming week.


Powell is due to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday before speaking to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. His appearance could give further clues as to the future path of interest rates.


The strong labor market has been a defining recent feature of the economy. A slew of new data is set to drop on this, with job openings figures and the latest ADP employment report coming Wednesday. But Friday will be the day when key U.S. nonfarm payrolls data for February is released by the Department of Labor. Economists are expecting 210,000 new jobs to have been created.


There will also be some noteworthy [earnings reports in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-tech-stocks-crowdstrike/), including [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) name **GitLab** ([GTLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLB)), **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) .


These Stock Market Areas Shine As Investors Snack On Chips
----------------------------------------------------------


Most of the [S&P 500 sectors closed higher Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Technology and energy were the best-performing areas. Only financials and the utilities, the latter a defensive area, gave up ground.


As ever, the relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's industry groups gave a deeper insight into what happened on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).



Data storage plays, computer hardware stocks and a variety of chip-stock industry groups were among the strongest performers. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) ended the day with a market cap of more than $2 trillion.


The oil-and-gas field services group was also a top performer, with Weatherford International joining the prestigious [IBD Leaderboard list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).Â  It bullishly pulled away from a 102.65 entry.


In contrast, toy stocks, office supply retailers, security software firms and long-term medical plays were among the biggest laggards on the stock market.

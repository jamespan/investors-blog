Semiconductor Stocks Lead Stock Market Rally; Small Caps Surge
===============================================================

Another busy day of earnings wasn't much help to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Wednesday. But a strong showing for semiconductors in the stock market today helped lift the Nasdaq composite to a gain of 0.8%, good for an all-time closing high. The S&P 500 also scored a record closing high, rising 0.5%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index surged 1.6%.




The Nasdaq strengthened in the afternoon and closed near its session high. **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up more than 7% to 129, after the company reported [better-than-expected earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/texas-instruments-earnings-q2-2019-txn-stock/). The chipmaker broke out in light volume ahead of earnings. That means Wednesday's open price of 126.50 could have been used as an alternate entry.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor index vaulted 3.1% to an all-time high, bringing its monthly gain to 11.3%. That's on the heels of a 12.6% gain in June.


Chip equipment firm **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) gapped up over a 49.87 entry, soaring 21% to 57.94 on strong earnings. Since it gapped up well past the buy point, the open price of 53.38 was a legitimate [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It's now past the 5% buy zone.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP072419-208x300.jpg)Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) jumped 4.5% as it approaches a 101.45 buy point.


**NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) is nearing a 108.61 entry, but a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 76 doesn't stir much excitement.


Dow Jones Movers
----------------


The Dow Jones industrials gave back 0.3%, hurt by weak performances from **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)).


Caterpillar slumped 4.5% on a [big earnings miss](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-earnings-q2-2019-dow-jones-stock/). Meanwhile, Boeing shares gave back 3% as Wall Street weighed [a loss of nearly $5 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-max-jetliner-fourth-quarter/) in the company's commercial aviation unit. On the bright side, Boeing's defense and services units were profitable.


Facebook, Amazon Recover
------------------------


Early Wednesday, sentiment was negative around the [FANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) on news the Department of Justice will examine possible anticompetitive practices of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services. But **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) recovered well off session lows.


Facebook started higher in after-hours trading after [the company reported Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-earnings-second-quarter-outlook/). But the stock later went lower. Results from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and Amazon are due Thursday after the close.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The Nasdaq's June 25 distribution day fell of the count Wednesday because of the index's strong gain since that day.


Three distribution days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 aren't much concern to the bulls at this point, especially amid healthy price action in leading growth stocks. Those two factors indicate a lower-risk environment, and they are reason for investors to continue with a high exposure to stocks.

Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 1.1%. It's up 29.6% year-to-date compared with a 20.4% gain for the S&P 500.


Indeed, the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) continue to serve up a steady diet of winners.


IBD 50 chip firm **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) jumped nearly 4% to 132.14 as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base. But shares slumped late Wednesday after [the company reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/xilinx-earnings-q1-2020-xilinx-stock/) as sales slightly missed views.


**Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) gained 5.6% to 93.72 as it approaches an alternate entry of 94.62. It is back above an 88.70 cup-with-handle buy point, too.


Other Stock Market Movers
-------------------------


In other [stock market news](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) jumped more than 5% to 777.96. Late Tuesday, the company reported a nice earnings beat and also a 10% rise in same-store sales, marking the sixth straight quarter of accelerating growth.


Chipotle was an earnings options trade on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) ahead of its earnings report late Tuesday. A call option with a 732.50 strike price offered a trade with minimal downside risk.


**Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) was another earnings gainer, up 18.8% to 17.61, after the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss and a big sales beat. It found support in a pullback to the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), but the stock is out of buy range now.

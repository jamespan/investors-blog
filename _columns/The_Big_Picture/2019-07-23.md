Tuesday's action reaffirmed a bull market still in motion. That's not all.




The bulls were likely encouraged by nice moves in a small herd of blue chips. Dow Jones Industrial Average component **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) (115.67 aggressive [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) (29.95 entry), **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) (119.08 alternative entry) and Dow 30 stock **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) (50 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [long saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/)), broke out of [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) or padded their gains after a recent [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Take a close look at the monthly chart of Coke, which now is aggressively selling coffee-based beverages. As [MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks) shows, it's been quite a long while since the stock showed some real fizz. Coca-Cola beat profit expectations.


While their rallies might not equal some of the breathtaking gains seen by those featured in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) or [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) stock lists, their participation in the market upside suggests that the skeptical and the short sellers will eventually throw in the towel.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP072319-221x300.jpg)On a day in which companies in industries such as hand tools, lodging, auto parts, transportation equipment, airlines, airfreight and gaming did quite well, no wonder that the S&P 500 beat out the Nasdaq's 0.6% advance with a 0.7% lift. The Russell 2000 matched the S&P 500's gain.


The S&P MidCap 400 hustled almost 1.1% higher. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.9%.


Stock pickers can show passive investors a number of reasons why active management can still be a profitable venture.


Why Active Portfolio Management Is Winning In 2019
--------------------------------------------------


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) and Innovator Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) didn't move up much on Tuesday, but they're still having a heck of a good year so far. At 35.38, the IBD 50 ETF now holds a 28% advance since Jan. 1. That exceeds the S&P 500's year-to-date gain by more than 900 basis points.


The Breakout Opportunities ETF, at 21.36, has rallied 22.8% over the same time frame.


The IBD Mutual Fund index, viewable in the [General Market Indicators page](https://services.investors.com/pdf/IBD2207152614GMI2.pdf), is beating the Dow Jones' return so far as well.


One simple reason? Broadly diversified indexes contain plenty of deadweight.


Tuesday's broad advance concealed weakness in certain industries such as [residential and commercial builders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/pultegroup-earnings-fall-pultegroup-stock-homebuilder-stocks/), grains, solar, gold miners, database software and movies, all of which fell 1% or more.


The action also disguised strength in a wide range of tech and cyclical industries, from toys to lodging and airlines, from semiconductors and fiber optic gear to automakers and shoes.


In fact, according to preliminary data, no fewer than 39 IBD industry groups beat the Nasdaq composite's 0.6% gain with rallies of 1.5% or higher.

Three More Reasons Why The Bears May Suffer More In 2019
--------------------------------------------------------


The second-quarter earnings season, which began in earnest this week, has not led to any nasty bumps yet.


Last week, reports hit the news wires noting a growing chance that S&P 500 earnings may turn a touch higher in the second quarter, rather than drop vs. a year ago as analysts expected.


Generally Positive Bull Market Internals
----------------------------------------


The NYSE advance-decline line has tread water in recent days. But it generally is keeping a slow and steady uptrend.


One concern is the number of new highs vs. new lows. As seen in [Monday data](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jul-22-2019/), the latter actually topped the former. You'd prefer the opposite.


A Yield Advantage Over U.S. Treasury Bonds
------------------------------------------


Based on estimates provided by Yardeni Research, the forward 12-month profit estimate for S&P 500 firms of $176.27 as of July 18 means that at 3005, the S&P now shows an earnings yield of 5.9%. That smashes a 2.08% yield for 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds (as of Tuesday) and 2.61% for 30-year bonds.


After the close, [Leaderboard stock option play](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/earningoptions) **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) gushed more than 3% higher on [strong quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-stock-drops-ahead-chipotle-earnings-q2-2019/). Ditto for [Texas Instruments](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/texas-instruments-earnings-q2-2019-txn-stock/).



Don't forget your profit-taking sell rules. IBD 50 mighty mite **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)), down 9% in triple its average volume, proved why as it [slashed through the 50-day moving average Tuesday in vigorous turnover](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


On the offense side, one could have begun selling shares as Innovative Industrial reached a 25% profit zone following a superlative breakout past 93.34 in what IBD founder Bill O'Neil might call a "no-nothing" base.


On the defense side, taking gains when a stock cannot rebound soon after cutting either the 50-day line or the 10-week moving average is [savvy portfolio management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).

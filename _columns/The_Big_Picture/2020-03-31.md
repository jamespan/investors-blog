  Nasdaq Posts 2nd Smallest Drop In March; Compare This S&P 500 Number With Your Stocks

Years from now, you might remember the first three months of this year as the [Great Coronavirus Stock Market Crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/).




But, at least from the point of view of the major equity benchmarks, the first quarter of 2020 could also be remembered this way: If you weren't down 20% or more since Jan. 1, you outperformed.


Ah, that's about as pleasing as a cold, wet noodle.


Since IBD called the "market in correction" across its [ETF timing strategy](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), [Market Trend page](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), and [Feb. 25 Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/), the numbers that have encased price changes and volume have simply been big. The S&P 500? Whacked 35.4% from its 3393 peak during a waterfall decline that lasted just 23 days. The Russell 2000? A 43% cratering from its near-term Feb. 20 peak of 1698 in just 19 sessions.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP033119-242x300.jpg)Meanwhile, the first two weeks of March painted a parade of misery as thousands of stocks on the Nasdaq and the Big Board (a moniker of the NYSE) posted new 52-week or all-time lows.


With these grim numbers in mind, then, did Tuesday's decline feel a bit strange? In a sense, well, yes. The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%. During the halcyon days of 2017, this sort of decline would have felt jarring. But in 2020, it registers as only the second time in March that the S&P 500 fell less than 2% in a single session.


An Unusual Day For The Nasdaq
-----------------------------


The Nasdaq composite did better. Its nearly 1% retreat marked the third lightest single-drop this month. And the tech-centered index gave back just a third of Monday's stout advance.


The lightest drop this month? Only 0.3% on March 23.


The Russell 2000 fell less than 0.5% on Tuesday. Volume grew on both main exchanges.


Amid this barely one-month-long bear market, the Nasdaq's March 23 session is critical in two regards.


First, that day marks the lowest point within the correction in stocks, for now. But as noted in the [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) last week, it marked a rare pink rally day. Since the Nasdaq closed well within the upper half of its intraday range, jumping well off that day's lows, you could visualize the serious buying by institutions as they propped stocks higher.


So, for now, March 23 remains the first day of the Nasdaq's new rally attempt.


The next step is to wait for a [confirmation that this rally attempt can show legs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


At this point, selling the market short would most likely be too dangerous and too late. The weakness in U.S. equities is too obvious. The best move to make for [CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) is to assemble a new team of potential big market winners.


As you [build a fresh watchlist](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/), you'll want to focus on companies that have 25%-plus growth in earnings and sales in at least the most recent quarter. For large caps, mild double-digit profit growth may suffice. Don't ignore stocks that rank within the top five or six sectors in the [IBD stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-mar-30-2020/). Lately, Telecom, Chips and Software stand out. And jot down those tickers of stocks that are retaking their 10-week moving averages (red line on the weekly chart) or at least bouncing hard off their 40-week lines.

Key Number For The S&P 500
--------------------------


Finally, pay attention to how far a stock is trading in relation to its 52-week high.


Once a stock has done concrete work on the right side of its base, expect it to muscle to within 5% to 15% from the 52-week peak. That's a good zone in which a [mild, downward-slanting handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) may form. And that handle should show instances of light turnover. This means the last disgruntled holders are finally getting out. Shares are getting transferred to sturdier hands on Wall Street.


Right now, the average S&P 500 stock is trading 35.3% below its peak. Are the stocks on your watchlist doing better than that?



On the upper end of this scale, S&P 500 members **Citrix Systems** ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), and a few of the FAANG stocks are all trading 10% off their highs or less.


**Apache** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)), **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)), **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)), **Alliance Data** ([ADS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADS)) and **Norwegian Cruise** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) lie 80% or more below their 52-week highs.

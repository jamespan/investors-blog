  Stock Market Cheers Falling Inflation As U.S. Hurtles Toward Debt Cliff

Stock market indexes ticked higher Wednesday following a relatively benign April inflation report. Big Tech led while blue chips and small caps lagged, following a pattern we've seen frequently in recent months.




Watch out because the light at the end of the tunnel could be an oncoming train as complacent investors head into a potential collision with the June 1 debt ceiling deadline.


The [consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4%](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559229&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) in April and 4.9% on an annual basis, close to expectations. Odds the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged at its June meeting rose to 93.9% at the stock market close, according to the [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html).


The 10-year Treasury yield fell 8 basis points to 3.44%. The benchmark yield has traded in a range between 3.25% and 3.64% for the last two months.


Bulls have been stymied by a series of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) and the failure of stock market indexes to climb the wall of worry on strong and broad-based buying interest. Just three weeks away, the debt ceiling deadline is starting to have an adverse impact on the ticker tape as big money builds hedges on worst-case outcomes, and retail investors worry about getting stuck in sudden downdrafts.


Stock Market Outlook Changes
----------------------------


However, there was enough positive action Wednesday to justify a change in IBD's market outlook to "confirmed uptrend."


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP051023-1-213x300.jpg)Foremost, the Nasdaq composite rallied 1% Wednesday to the highest high since August 2022. Most indexes continue to trade well above fourth-quarter 2022 levels. In addition, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials continue to hold above their 50- and 200-day moving averages.


However, the stock market still has soft spots, and that's why IBD's recommended exposure is unchanged, at 20%-40% in recognition of adverse factors.


[Breadth continues to lag](https://www.investors.com/research/nasdaq-is-up-20-why-its-no-guarantee-of-a-bull-market/), with the advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq near 12-month lows even as the index hit a new high for 2023. While the S&P 500 rose 0.5% Wednesday, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) was flat.


Stock Market In Crosshairs As Debt Crisis Nears
-----------------------------------------------


April CPI numbers would have triggered a broad-based rally just a few months ago.


But the session's whipsaws may signal growing anxiety about the debt ceiling and potential failure of political parties to reach an agreement before the U.S. "officially" can't pay its bills on June 1.


[Congressional leaders met with President Joe Biden Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-flat-as-kevin-mccarthy-makes-debt-ceiling-pledge-palantir-stock-rockets-on-ai-claim/), letting both sides stake out their hard-line positions on the developing crisis. Officials will meet again on Friday.


Republicans have gained leverage and stubbornness in recent weeks, with polls showing Biden at the lowest approval rating of his presidency. Adding to the drama, Republican senators have formed a group that should effectively block Democratic vetoes during this process.


Now the fun begins.


Unfortunately, neither side has reason to fear a market sell-off because the stock market is well off 2022 lows and volatility has dropped to 20-month lows.


For their part, investors have grown too complacent, downplaying default fears, assuming both sides will be reasonable and forge an agreement. It's especially tough for those with cash on the sidelines, afraid of missing out while fearful the bottom will drop out when a bad headline comes along.


Wednesday Big Movers
--------------------



IBD 50 pick **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) [soared nearly 20% Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/research/celsius-stock-energy-drink-leader-soars-above-buy-point-on-record-sales/), breaking out past a [cup base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) 122.34 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The stock is extended past the 5% buy zone, which goes up to 128.46.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit a new high, confirming the energy drink maker as a market leader. **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) is an 8.5% owner and many CELH owners hope the snack giant makes them an offer they can't refuse (for the rest of those shares).



Chinese EV SUV automaker **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) surged almost 14% on the highest volume since November after beating Q1 estimates and raising Q2 revenue guidance. IBD technical and fundamental ratings are mediocre, but that makes sense after months of pandemic lockdowns.


What Should Stock Market Do Now?
--------------------------------


The Russell 2000 is the outlier, flashing the most bearish market signals, mostly stuck under the 50- and 200-day lines since late 2021. It's a problem because emerging growth companies that fill many IBD watchlists dominate this index.


We must now add the debt ceiling debate to the market's chronic wall of worry. Hopefully, it will resolve quickly.


But more likely, our leaders in D.C. will need a plummeting stock market to send shock waves that let them make unpopular decisions, like it did in 2008 and 2011.


Bottom line: Go ahead and look for new opportunities, but exercise strict risk management skills because your wealth depends on it.

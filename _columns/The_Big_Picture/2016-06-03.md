Stocks collided with the worst payroll report in years Friday, but somehow the indexes came away with only minor dents.


The Nasdaq dropped 0.6%, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.3%. The IBD 50 carved off 0.5%.


![MP_060316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP_060316.jpg)Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE. The S&P 500 picked up a distribution day, while the Nasdaq dodged a distribution day, thanks to the lower volume.


The April 28 distribution day fell off both indexes because of time, so the count stayed at six for the S&P 500 and fell to five for the Nasdaq.


Advancers led declining issues on the NYSE by a 7-6 ratio. On the Nasdaq, losers led by a 5-3 pace.


Six words are enough describe the market's action Friday: It could have been far worse. Rarely is the Street fooled as badly as it was on the payroll numbers.


Nobody expected the nonfarm payrolls to come in at 38,000, a figure that looked like a typo but truly was the weakest number since 2010. Put another way, the figure was 65% lower than the lowest estimate in analysts' range.


Revisions also were gloomy. March and April numbers combined were revised to 59,000 less than first reported.


Meanwhile, the Institute of Supply Management's service sector survey for May fell short of the consensus estimate and undercut the lowest estimate in the range.


Factory orders for April were the only bright spot, and it took some contortions to see the positive angle. Orders rose by 1.9%, not quite even with the consensus for 2%, but the prior report was revised upward. March's gain was initially pegged at 1.1% but was revised up to 1.7%.


Still, the payroll data threw the market off-balance. Thursday's ADP payroll number was a normal looking 173,000 vs. the government's surprising 38,000. This raised a question: Whose yardstick is more reliable?


Analysts on the Street had no answer to that, but the stock market decided the ambiguity was worth a minor sell-off in mixed volume.


Top-rated stocks logging gains were scarce Friday.


Chip designer **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) broke out, clearing a 159.75 buy point in fast turnover. Retailer **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) rose for an eighth consecutive session and marked a 52-week high.


Utilities, sensitive to interest rates, also did well. The Dow Jones utility average popped 1.6%, it's best percentage gain in about four months. Dividend-paying utilities are now benefiting from the radically reduced odds for a Federal Reserve rate hike when it meets June 14-15.


CME Group's FedWatch gauge pegged the probability of a June rate hike at 34% not too long ago. On Friday, the needle dropped to less than 4%.


**Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) has benefited from a trend of a different sort -- booming firearm sales. However, firearm background checks, a rough gauge of industrywide sales, dropped 13% in May vs. April. The stock plunged 7% in heavy volume, cutting under its 50-day moving average.


For the week, the IBD 50 rose 0.5% and the Nasdaq, 0.2%. The S&P 500 was flat.


Coming up: Companies reporting during the week will include a handful of retailers: **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), **Michaels** ([MIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIK)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Francesca's** ([FRAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRAN)).

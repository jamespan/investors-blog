Stock Market Takes Bullish Jobs Report In Stride; Vertex Pharmaceuticals Finds Support After Earnings
======================================================================================================

The stock market took a much-needed break Friday as investors digested a red-hot July jobs report, more earnings reports and a big jump in the 10-year Treasury yield. The confirmed uptrend looked pretty good by the close as buyers pushed indexes well off session lows.




The economy created [528,000 jobs in July](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-heats-up-as-unemployment-rate-ties-half-century-low-dow-jones-futures-fall/), more than double the 250,000 consensus. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 3.5%, while job gains for May and June were revised higher by a combined 28,000.


Investors sold bonds on the news, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield by 16 basis points to 2.84%. Before the data, federal funds futures traders pegged the chances of a 75-basis-point hike by the Federal Reserve at next month's meeting at 40%. But that percentage rose to just under 70% by the close.


Stock Market Today
------------------


After coming close to its early-June high, the S&P 500 fell 1.1% early but pared its loss to 0.2% by the close. Declining stocks had a slight edge over advancers on the NYSE. Preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume.


The Nasdaq composite fell as much as 1.5%, but the index shaved its loss to just 0.5%. Breadth was positive, with winners beating losers by around 3-to-2. Nasdaq volume fell.


The advance/decline line for the NYSE and Nasdaq composite has been trending higher for about three weeks.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, helped by a strong [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vrtx-stock-vertex-earnings-q2-2022/). The stock bounced off its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 5% in higher volume.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed higher for a gain of 0.2%. Strength in **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) buoyed the blue-chip index.


Confirmed Uptrend Still Looks Healthy
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP080522-300x300.jpg)The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) outperformed and poked above Wednesday's high. It also flashed an outside day, rising 0.8%. The SPDR MidCap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) paid a visit to its 10-day moving average and found support, rising nearly 0.6%.


It was another resilient performance for the stock market Friday, making the bulls feel pretty good about the confirmed uptrend. With the market tide flowing positive, investors have the green light to increase exposure, but keep positions small to start. If a new buy starts making headway, go ahead and increase exposure conservatively. There's still plenty of uncertainty for the stock market to navigate, so having a fair amount of cash on hand still makes sense.

Oil and gas stocks dominated the upside in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). **Vermilion Energy** ([VET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VET)) bounced off its 50-day line, rising 4%. But support comes after a failed breakout from a cup base. Meanwhile, **EQT Corp**. ([EQT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQT)) jumped 2.5%. It's holding support at its 50-day line as it forms a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/).


The Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) added 2% as oil prices edged higher. XLE is still holding above its 200-day line after getting turned away at its 50-day line. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $89.01 a barrel, up 0.5%. For the week, oil tumbled nearly 10%.


It's still a challenging environment when it comes to buying technical breakouts, but **Constellation Energy** ([CEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEG)) delivered one, helped by strong Q2 revenue growth and positive comments from UBS. The stock gapped out of a 16-week consolidation after UBS upgraded shares to buy and raised the price target to 97.


In the oil and gas space, **Chart Industries** ([GTLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLS)) closed out the week near the top of the 5% buy zone from a 193.03 entry. It's still trying to break free from a long consolidation that started in late September.

  Stocks Plunge As Market, Leaders Face New Troubles

After Monday's rousing advance, you'd have expected stocks to extend gains at least a little more. Instead, the market gave it all back Tuesday and flashed new signs of trouble.




The Nasdaq composite plunged 2.9% and undercut Friday's low. The S&P 500 slid 1.7% as both indexes reversed lower and effectively wiped away Monday's once-promising rally.


Both indexes' price ranges Tuesday exceeded the prior day's — a bearish behavior that's known as an outside day. Even the more sedate Dow Jones industrial average suffered an outside day, down 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost nearly 2%.


Not only did stocks fail to build on Monday's strong gains, but selling returned in broad form. Declining stocks led advancers by nearly 11-to-5 on the NYSE and by about 10-to-3 on the Nasdaq. Volume eased on the Nasdaq and was higher on the NYSE.

The market last stood in this status for four trading sessions, from Feb. 8 to 13.


Tuesday's deflating action sharply contrast the lows on Feb. 9 and March 2, when the Nasdaq immediately followed up with continued gains and a [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) rally on Feb. 14, which confirmed a new uptrend in place.


So what's next? The S&P 500 is nearing its 200-day moving average, where the index found support Friday and where a bottom is still possible. For its part, the Nasdaq will need to hold above the 7000 level. Will institutional investors come back into stocks?


For individual investors, it's now time to harden the defenses. First, sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% below the purchase price. This is the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). In some cases, it makes sense to cut losses even less than that, at perhaps 3% or 4%. Raise cash by taking profits, mainly in stocks that have earned you profits of at least 20%. When the market gets choppy, such as today, consider taking profits when the gains reach 10% to 15% from a proper breakout point.


Margin trading is especially risky now. If you buy any stocks, be extremely selective.


The Nasdaq reflected weak action in technology firms as internet, software, chip and biotech stocks were among the worst performing.

**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) reversed sharply lower, losing more than 7% and falling back below the 50-day moving average, in more than double its average volume. Reuters reported that Nvidia is [suspending tests of self-driving cars](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-falls-self-driving-car-reports-overshadow-gtc-conference/) following a fatal accident involving an autonomous Uber vehicle last week.


It was a bad day in general for leading stocks. The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) plummeted 3.9% and many components in the screen saw bearish reversals or wild outside days.


Defensive industry groups fared better, with utilities, soaps, prepared foods, tobacco and real estate investment trusts registering some gains.


Last week, the market got two bottoming signals in the put-call volume ratio and the [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX. Both flashed excessive fear levels, which have coincided with market lows in the past. Monday's surge seemed to confirm those signals, but uncertainty remains.

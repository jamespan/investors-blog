A day after the S&P 500 made its latest test of the bulls' mettle at a [key technical level](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), you want to see the big boys and big girls of Wall Street jump back into the stock market. Well, at least for a day, they did just that.




The large-cap benchmark, slumping more than 2.6% over a three-day sell-off, regained more than half of those losses Tuesday. The S&P 500's 1.5% gain pretty much matched a 1.6% rebound by both the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


The pullback recently by smaller issues has been sharper. So, naturally one should not be surprised by even bigger gains Tuesday by the related indexes.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund really needed a big up day, especially after losing ground in nine of the past 11 sessions. So, Tuesday's 3.1% advance, by itself, surely feels good for investors going long in stocks. However, that gain only mops up a portion of the 8.5% spill witnessed since the July 1 close.


Midcaps muscled higher too. The SPDR S&P 50 Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ETF rose almost 2.9%, its biggest single-session gain since Jan. 6.



Watch This Technical Detail
---------------------------


Yet notice on a daily chart how the ETF remains beneath its 50-day moving average. In a healthy market uptrend, you want to see key indexes trade above their 50-day lines, not below them.


As institutional investors took some profits off the table amid a weekslong rush back into long-dated U.S. Treasuries, money appeared to flow back into other sectors too. The Dow Jones transportation average jumped 2%. Oil and gas stocks gained ground, but mostly in limited fashion. One look at Energy Select Sector ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)), up 1.3%, shows why. It's still 16% off prior highs.


Utilities lagged. SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) edged up 0.4%.

U.S. crude oil futures rose 1.5% to $67.42 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond rebounded 3 basis points to 1.21%, according to Cboe data.


What Will Move The Stock Market Now?
------------------------------------


There's plenty of chatter about "peak earnings." That is, you simply are not going to get any stronger increases in profits amid S&P 500 firms than what we'll likely see in the second quarter. Yet, does this really surprise anyone?


Astute IBD readers know that a year ago, earnings plummeted. Sales in some industries shrank almost as fast as a pin-pricked birthday party balloon. So, the second quarter of 2021 appeared set for a huge year-over-year rebound — even as the economy was slowly reopening in the first several months of the year.


Some veteran investors note that volatility jumps right before corporate earnings results for reasons beyond simply the consequences of Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure), which cracked down on information given to analysts.


"Don't get flushed out of the market just before earnings come out. It's normal just before earnings season for shorts to try to flush everybody out," Louis Navellier, a seasoned money manager and president of Navellier & Associates, wrote in a daily note to clients. "This is a game Wall Street plays four times a year and the shorts can get buried by the good sales, earnings and guidance, and markets will stabilize as earnings come out."


Meanwhile, breakouts can and do happen on earnings surprises.


Take **HCA Healthcare** ([HCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA)). The hospital operator launched a breakaway gap on Tuesday following splendid Q2 results issued before the open (earnings up 35% to $4.37 a share, revenue accelerating 30% to $14.4 billion). HCA meekly surpassed a 217.46 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a shallow five-week flat base two weeks ago. But volume was scarce back then.


The large cap got early attention in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).


The earnings news completely changed the price-volume picture. (Please read more about breakaway gaps in this [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/).)


This week, as many as 66 stocks within the S&P 500 are reporting quarterly results, according to S&P Capital IQ.

---


HCA's strong gains since an earlier breakout past 140.10 in November have helped power the hospitals industry group to a 12th ranking among 197 industries tracked by IBD for six-month price performance.


Market breadth improved on Tuesday as airline, oil and gas royalty trust, automobile retail, RV, transportation equipment, leisure products, superregional bank and department store chain stocks joined the hospitals in rising 3% or more on a price-weighted basis.


Big Sell-Off
------------



Meanwhile, **Piedmont Lithium** ([PLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLL)) illustrated why companies with no solid record of sales or earnings harbor much more risk in the stock market.


The thinly traded metal ores play crashed almost 20% and [undercut its 200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) in the heaviest turnover since March.


A strong 98 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) surely does not offer investors a timely sell indicator. For that, charts matter. A late-June breakout attempt past 77.18 within its base, carrying elements of a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), quickly reversed into losses of 7%-8% by early July.


How Do Equity Valuations Look Today?
------------------------------------


Some veteran observers of stocks remain wary of historically high values, when using such standard measures as price-to-earnings (P-to-E) ratios or even price to sales (P-to-S) for the S&P 500. But they also note that valuations can stay stretched for a long time as companies eventually meet or beat demanding growth expectations. In other words, the earnings often rise fast enough to justify high expectations.


Drew Horter, president and chief investment officer of $250 million Tactical Fund Advisors in Cincinnati, Ohio, notes that even before the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the S&P 500 showed a fresh all-time peak in the P-to-S ratio on a trailing 12-month basis. According to data from S&P Capital IQ and Compustat, as of April 30 the S&P 500's median P-to-S ratio stood at 3.42 — well above the 2.08 value for a linear regression line drawn all the way back to 1966. At the end of 2019, the ratio jumped near 2.8.


"I was in the stock market back in 1996 when (former Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan Greenspan spoke about 'irrational exuberance.' But nothing happened for 2-1/2 years," Horter told IBD. Horter launched his registered investment advisory (RIA) firm in 1991. Today, he oversees five funds that each employ one or more subadvisors. All five have the flexibility to go completely to cash. The multimanager funds can have a net-short exposure.


Valuing Blue-Chip Stocks Today
------------------------------


Horter is also keeping a close eye on inflation, given that we've now had two straight months of bigger-than-expected increases in U.S. consumer prices. Lately, though, long-dated U.S. Treasuries have enjoyed a nice upswing in prices, suggesting that recent large price gains may tend to be transitory in the near term.


"I have a business friend who has made five price increases in flooring products," Horter said. "Right now, you don't know if prices are going to stop rising, or whether product is available. And you've got wage wars, not just wage increases."


According to the latest [Psychological & Other Market Indicators table](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/psychological-indicators-volume-jul-20-2021/), updated each day at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), the Dow Jones Industrial Average is showing a 28.3 P-E ratio. That sits in the upper half of the five-year range of 15.5 (set on March 23, 2020, amid the coronavirus bear market) and 37.9 (set on Oct. 22, 2018).


Put another way, a lot is riding on [second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/).

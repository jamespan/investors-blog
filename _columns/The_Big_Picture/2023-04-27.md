Big Tech stocks propelled the Nasdaq higher Thursday, as the stock market rebounded from Tuesday's heavy losses. **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) surged on strong earnings after the close Thursday. And, up next, Friday's March PCE inflation report is due out ahead of the market open.




The still-struggling stock market uptrend sees a number of leading stocks near buy points, including **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)), **Paccar** ([PCAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCAR)) and [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)).


On Thursday, the [Federal Reserve's key inflation rate showed price pressures](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/the-feds-key-inflation-rate-stays-hot-as-gdp-slows-sp-500-futures-rise/) heated up in the first quarter as the U.S. economy slowed. Fresh data also showed an unexpected drop in new claims for jobless benefits last week. Yet the stock market rallied after the reports, even as the inflation data helped boost odds for a Fed rate hike next week.


Due out Friday morning, Wall Street expects the PCE price index to rise 0.1% for the month of March, with an annual increase of 4.2%. Personal income is expected to climb 0.2% in March. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.


Megacap tech stocks **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) were big outperformers in Thursday's stock market.


**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) stock soared 13.9% Thursday after [easily beating Wall Street's first-quarter projections](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-meta-earnings-q1-2023/) and issuing bullish sales guidance.


Amazon shares leapt more than 8% in extended trade after the e-commerce giant beat Q1 earnings and sales targets.


Earnings Movers
---------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MP042723--238x300.jpg)Other key earnings movers included **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), **Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)). And reactions were predominantly negative.


Caterpillar shares slashed losses to less than 1% after the [company delivered a huge positive surprise](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-earnings-sp-500-bellwether-could-show-how-bank-crisis-is-hitting-construction/) early Thursday, signaling the global economic backdrop remains solid as recession fears grow.


Crocs shares dived 15.9% after a [weaker-than-expected second-quarter outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/crox-stock-leapt-37-percent-this-year-it-faces-a-low-hurdle-for-q1/). CROX stock triggered the 7%-8% loss rule from a 143.60 cup-base buy point.


Hot chip stock Impinj [missed Wall Street's target for earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/impinj-stock-plummets-as-tracking-chip-maker-cuts-outlook/) but beat estimates for sales in the first quarter. The company also offered an outlook that was well below views for the current period. Impinj stock crumbled 39%.


Mobileye [beat analyst estimates for the first quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mbly-stock-mobileye-lowers-2023-outlook/), but the company lowered its full-year outlook on weakening electric vehicle sales in China. MBLY stock plunged 16.1%.


Dow Jones drug giant Merck reversed from early losses to close 1.5% higher after a [Q1 earnings beat](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/merck-stock-merck-earnings-q1-2023/). Finally, ServiceNow shares turned a sharp loss into a slight gain after the [company reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/now-stock-servicenow-earnings-q1-2023/) that handily topped views, while revenue edged past consensus estimates.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.6% and the S&P 500 advanced 2%. Both ended two-day skids and found support around their 50-day line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 2.4%, closing at its highest level since April 19. Again, the small-cap Russell 2000 was the laggard, climbing 1.2%, just off its late-March lows.


Volume inched lower on the Nasdaq and also fell on the NYSE vs. the prior session. That took some of the power out of the day's bullish gains.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 0.9%, falling a for a fourth straight session. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), biotech leader **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) shot back into buy range above a 325.29 buy point from a cup base as it rallied Thursday. Earnings are set for Monday after the close.


Despite Thursday's big gain, the stock market outlook remains in an "uptrend under pressure." IBD recommends an exposure level 20% to 40% due to the volatile daily market action. Weak breadth is another concern lately.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: BJs, Paccar, Las Vegas Sands
-----------------------------------------------------------



[Recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/bj-stock-near-buy-point-bjs-wholesale-club-hasnt-done-this-since-2018/) BJ's Wholesale finished Thursday just 2% away from a 78.98 buy point in a flat base, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)


A few key stats get to the heart of BJ's strengths: The renewal rate for club members reached a record 90% last year. The wholesale club model offers a relatively limited selection of goods, giving BJ's more bargaining power with suppliers and depends on less labor. That adds up to a 25% discount relative to grocery competitors, BJ's says.


[Paccar is trying to find support](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/paccar-leaves-tesla-semi-in-the-dust-as-breakout-nears/) around its 50-day line, as it continues to build a flat base with a 76.82 buy point. An early entry at 75.83 is also in play.


The producer of heavy-duty semi-trucks topped Q1 estimates on Tuesday, reporting a 96% earnings spike. At [CES 2022](https://www.paccar.com/news/current-news/2022/paccar-exhibits-innovative-electric-connected-and-autonomous-trucks-at-ces-2022/), Paccar exhibited connected and autonomous trucks. The company behind the [Kenworth](https://www.kenworth.com/), [Peterbilt](https://www.peterbilt.com/) and [DAF](http://www.daftrucks.com/) nameplates showcased three vehicles.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Las Vegas Sands found support at 60.40 buy point in a cup with handle, snapping a two-day losing streak Thursday. Shares hit a new high Monday.


Last week, [Las Vegas Sands smashed earnings expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/lvs-stock-earnings-breakout-as-macau-booms-again/) for the first quarter and signaled a "robust recovery" in China's Macao gaming hub. The casino stock posted earnings of 28 cents per share, up from a loss of 40 cents a year ago. Revenue vaulted nearly 125% to $2.12 billion.

Small Cap Stocks Lead Quiet Action In Today's Stock Market
===========================================================

After a suspect start to the trading day, the major stock indexes ended modestly higher Thursday — a calming session that helps an uncertain stock market gather itself.




Before the stock market's open, the government reported that U.S. economic growth slowed to a revised 2.2% in the fourth quarter, in line with estimates. Meanwhile, China and U.S. trade talks restarted. The trade talks have been an ongoing catalyst in the stock market.


Indexes were negative for a while but recovered in afternoon trading. The Nasdaq gained 0.3%. The S&P 500 index moved up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also advanced 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed, with a nearly 0.9% gain. Volume fell across both exchanges, compared to the previous session.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished Thursday with an inside day. That's when the daily price action is fully contained within the previous day's price range. It is considered uncertain action following a wide down day like Wednesday. However, the Nasdaq had fallen three of the last four sessions, so a quiet trading day was a welcomed change.


Compared to October — where one sell-off was often followed by one or even two more sharp declines — the selling of the past week has been much more mild.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP_032819-229x300.jpg)Despite the constructive daily action of the major stock indexes, IBD readers should continue to harvest profits at the [20%-25% profit-taking level](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/), while being vigilant for sell signals.


The IBD 50 gained 1.1%, indicating that leading stocks moved up far better than the major stock indexes. On the upside, **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) shone, but **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) suddenly lost its luster and triggered a sell signal.


These Three Retailers Reported Earnings
---------------------------------------


Lululemon notched an all-time high — and a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) — after the company reported [strong quarterly earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-q4-2018-lululemon-stock-buy-point/) late Wednesday. The opening price at 169.15 serves as the proper buy point, because the stock opened far above the flat base's 158.77 entry. Lululemon stock closed at 167.54, up 14.1% and just below the opening price entry.


Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) surged to a new high along with the stock price, confirming the breakout.


Teen-centric retailer Five Below jumped back above its 50-day line in huge volume, rising 8%, after the [company reported results](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/five-below-stock-five-below-earnings-q4-2018/). Shares are rapidly approaching a 133.75 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The lagging RS line is worth monitoring for improvement. The RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day or shortly thereafter.


Pleasant retail profit surprises ran out after the close Thursday. **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, [reported mixed quarterly earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/rh-earnings-growth-rh-stock/), sending shares sharply lower. RH shares were down about 16% to 110 in after-hours trading. The retailer ended the regular trading session about 20% off its 52-week high and below its long-term 200-day line.


In the chip sector, **ON Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) said it's acquiring [IPO Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) **Quantenna Communications** ([QTNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QTNA)) for [over $1 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/on-semiconductor-quantenna-purchase/), just a few weeks after Quantenna's March 12 breakout above a [19.34 entry in a cup with handle.](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-quantenna-communications-earnings-growth/) Quantenna stock is about 25% above the buy point, ripe for taking profits.



Kirkland Lake Gold Triggers Sell Signal
---------------------------------------


Kirkland Lake Gold [gapped down through its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/kirkland-lake-stock-triggers-sell-rule-gold-prices/) Thursday, falling 6% to close at its lowest level since late January. The gold mining stock closed at 30.78. Volume ballooned to nearly double the average daily turnover, indicating strong institutional selling. A [sharp break of the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) can mark the end of a huge run. After a breakout above a 23.96 buy point on Dec. 10, Kirkland advanced as much as 53% to its Feb. 28 peak.


An IBD Stock Of The Day column on Jan. 30 mentioned Kirkland was at a [good spot to take some profits](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-top-growth-stock-sell-signal/). On that day, the stock closed at 31.32. Even though the stock would go on to rise past that level, eventually topping at 36.74, downside pressure comes abruptly and painfully. The stock is back below that original profit-taking level.


Last Friday, the stock market outlook was lowered to uptrend under pressure, given the sharp sell-off among top growth stocks and higher number of distribution days. Investors should be vigilant about potential sell signals, like that given by Kirkland Lake Gold Thursday. Likewise, it is always OK to take profits once your gain reaches 20% to 25%, unless you're chasing bigger gains in a market leader.


Given the myriad high-quality breakouts — Lululemon comes to mind — it can be wise to take some profits and use that money to acquire a new stock idea with more potential upside. This type of compounding can lead to market-beating annual returns.

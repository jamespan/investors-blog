Stock Market Reverses Higher, Encouraging The Bulls
====================================================

The stock market struggled throughout most of Thursday's session but reversed higher in an afternoon rally.




The Nasdaq posted a 0.3% gain for the day, after being down 0.6%. The [large-cap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/big-cap-stocks-can-be-winners/) S&P 500 advanced 0.4%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat. Small caps gauged by the Russell 2000 added 0.3%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


A rebound in indexes picked up steam around 2 p.m. ET, when headlines flashed comments from New York Fed President John Williams.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP071819-227x300.jpg)His comments were interpreted as [favoring more-aggressive interest-rate cuts](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-indexes-fight-back-on-dovish-fed-comment/). "It's better to take preventive measures than to wait for disaster to unfold," Williams said in a speech.


Odds Of Half-Point Rate Cut Jump
--------------------------------


The odds of a half-point rate cut at this month's Fed meeting shot up on the news. CBOE's FedWatch Tool now sees a 69% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates a half point. The odds for a quarter-point cut is pegged at 31%.


Indexes pared some late gains after President Donald Trump said a U.S. Navy ship had destroyed an Iranian drone in a "defensive action" in the Strait of Hormuz.


The late rally helped the indexes avoid [distribution, which is a sign of institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/too-much-distribution-in-a-base-can-hurt-a-breakouts-chances/). The yield on the 10-year Treasury note sank further, dipping to 2.04% late Thursday.


Yet the lack of distribution can't paper over every current market negative.


So far this month there has been only one day of accumulation, July 10. Accumulation is a sign of institutional buying. It involves a significant price gain in a major index in rising volume.


Also, the Nasdaq is finding resistance near 8260, and the S&P 500 has run into headwinds near 3015.


After the S&P 500 and Nasdaq marked lows in early June, the indexes gained 10% and 13% in almost seven weeks. A minor pullback in the stock market might be expected and nothing to worry about in the context of the seven-week rally.


Other negatives involve the bulls-vs.-bears ratio and new lows vs. new highs. Bullish advisors are at 58%. The danger zone begins at 55%, according to Investors Intelligence. In the meantime, early data showed new lows outnumbering new highs for the first time in about three weeks.


IBM Surprises The Stock Market
------------------------------


Yet, bulls Thursday weren't without a song to sing from the optimist's hymnal.


**IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) shares knifed about 5% higher after the company reported a small beat on earnings. The stock broke out of a long cup-with-handle pattern. The buy point was 145.49.


Growth investors aren't much interested in IBM. The last time Big Blue grew annual revenue as much as 10% was more than 15 years ago. Annual earnings haven't increased 20% or more in almost 12 years.


Yet the stock is up 32% so far this year. Apparently, some deep value investors expect IBM's turnaround strategy to pay off fairly soon.


Additional Breakouts
--------------------


Other breakouts Thursday included online dating company **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)), up 4.5% in torrid trade, and Brazilian bank **Banco Santander Brasil** ([BSBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSBR)), up 3%.


Progress on the pension overhaul issue has helped Brazilian stocks.


International News Mostly Quiet
-------------------------------


On trade, the South China Morning Post reported that China is negotiating with Russia to increase trade in soybeans and other farm products.


In other news, Iran said its military seized a foreign oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz. The ship is reportedly a Panama-flagged tanker. Iran said the tanker was seized Sunday. The price of light sweet crude dropped 1.9% to $55.70 a barrel.

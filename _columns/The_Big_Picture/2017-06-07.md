  Stocks Rise Before UK Vote; This Sector Is Firming

 Stocks moved nonchalantly ahead of pivotal elections in the U.K. in relatively rangebound trade before a boost of buying in the final 45 minutes of Wednesday's session took the major indexes practically to session highs.


The Nasdaq composite led the way, just as it's done all year. The tech-rich index gained nearly 0.4%. The S&P 500 was not far behind, up 0.2%, but a big sell-off in crude oil sent most energy stocks sinking and hampered the large-cap benchmark's advance. Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq.


The struggles for the S&P 500 are evidenced by the difference in breadth on the two main exchanges. On the Nasdaq, a bastion of newer technology and consumer-oriented names, winners led losers by a slim margin of around 100 issues. But on the NYSE, where the bulk of S&P 500 firms reside, more stocks fell than rose by nearly 200.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MP060717-169x300.png)Since Jan. 1, the Nasdaq has boosted its gain to nearly 17%, well above the S&P 500's 8.7% advance.


Although the day's gains were small, a growth investor certainly has to be encouraged by the way the market ended. In addition, heavy institutional selling continues to be mild.


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq's May 2 stalling day fell on time. That shaved the distribution-day count to three for the Nasdaq; the S&P 500 is also at three. A bull market can fend off the bears when the frequency of intense professional selling is sporadic.


A great example of how the market can recover from an institutional-quality sell-off? The big plunge on May 17, spurred in part by the surprise firing of FBI Director James Comey a week earlier. The news helped trigger a 2.6% slide by the Nasdaq. Were some institutions itching for an "excuse" to take gains off the table? Sure. Yet the index also erased that loss in the space of six sessions.


Buying stocks when the indexes are at or near new highs is a scary proposition for most traders. Indeed, one doesn't want to get caught "holding the bag." Yet with the economy still in steady growth-mode, earnings on the rise, interest rates still at historically low levels, and strength in other equities markets overseas, no one really knows yet when and where the bull run will tire.


Let's consider the American economy. Research by Sadoff Investment Management in Milwaukee has found that a recession usually arrives 11 months after the Leading Economic Indicators index peaks.  The stock market usually gets a whiff of a contracting economy months in advance as well, as it did in 1990 and 2008.


On last check, the LEI index for April showed a 0.3% rise, in line with consensus views. (Keep an eye on the [economic calendar](http://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), available in the News section at Investors.com.)


New issues, including those that have debuted in the past 36 months, are doing well. True, **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) has fast become a laggard after its fireworks-like debut, but IBD readers have plenty of new companies with substantial profit growth to choose from. Just look at **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) (a July 2012 IPO) and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) (April 2014).


Momo and Weibo underscore the strength of consumer spending and digital advertising in China, where the Middle Kingdom's leaders fully recognize the need to steer the country from one wholly dependent on exports into one that is robust in household-wealth creation, economic freedom, and domestically inclined innovation.


The U.S. seems to be gaining traction on the consumer end as well. Mike Flaskey, CEO of the vacation time-share operator Diamond Resorts International, told IBD that the "future is incredibly bright" for the industry. One reason: An industry association study has found that just 6% of eligible American households are currently using time-shares as one avenue for travel. For Diamond Resorts, properties in Maui and Kauai in Hawaii, and Las Vegas, Orlando and Virginia Beach are doing "extremely well."


**Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)) bought Diamond Resorts in September last year. Before the transaction was done, Diamond was part of IBD's lodging industry group, which has risen through IBD's 197 rankings and is now No. 26 in terms of six-month price strength. As many as six of the group's 14 companies boasts a 90 RS Rating or higher, including **China Lodging Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) and **Hilton Worldwide** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)).


The consumer and health care sectors, both in the stock market and in the economy, are certainly faring well in the market, despite the constant headlines about the "death of retail." The gaming group is ranked No. 15, medical systems is No. 11, internet retail is No. 10 and internet content is No. 9.

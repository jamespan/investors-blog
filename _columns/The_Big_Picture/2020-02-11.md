The stock market barely extended its February rally, holding on to a win after ceding most of the day's gains. It was a dispirited ending to a session that saw record highs by key indexes in the early hours of trading.




The Nasdaq added 0.1% but had been up as much as 0.9%. A weak close near session lows is a symptom of a tired market, and it's contrary to the way indexes have acted so far this year. Is it [the mark of a stock market top](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/)? Too soon to tell, but a normal pullback like the one in January wouldn't be a shock.


The Nasdaq composite has climbed every day so far this month except for Friday. It is about to extend itself above a trend line touching the index highs since the October low. A similar move came before the market's January descent. So a dose of caution would serve investors well.


The S&P 500 also gave back decent-size gains and ended with a 0.2% increase. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, while small caps outperformed. The Russell 2000 climbed 0.6%, after underperforming for three days.


Volume rose 12% on the Nasdaq vs. the prior day and was higher on the NYSE as well. That means the limp ending etched [a stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) for the S&P 500. That's a form of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or heavy institutional selling.


Major Tech Stocks Hit Stock Market
----------------------------------


Indexes pared gains after the Federal Trade Commission said it will investigate prior acquisitions by major technology companies. The [FTC will review deals](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies?utm_source=slider) made by **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP_3x4_021120-215x300.jpg)In a statement, the commission said the review will "help the FTC deepen its understanding of large technology firms' acquisition activity, including how these firms report their transactions to the federal antitrust agencies, and whether large tech companies are making potentially anticompetitive acquisitions. ..."


Microsoft reversed lower to close with a 2.3% loss. Facebook tumbled 2.8%. Amazon.com and Alphabet rose but closed near session lows. Apple, a current [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock, reversed mildly lower.


While those stocks represent the command heights of the stock market, the selling did not spread much. Advancing stocks led decliners by an 11-to-5 ratio on the NYSE and by 12-to-7 on the Nasdaq.


Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave testimony in Congress while indexes faded, but there was nothing major in his remarks.


Even stocks sensitive to the coronavirus — chips and Chinese stocks — were among the best. There is still no sign that the deadly coronavirus is contained or that it has peaked. On Tuesday, the [World Health Organization tallied](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200211-sitrep-22-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=fb6d49b1_2) more than 42,000 infected worldwide, and more than 1,000 dead.


But the U.S. stock market is acting like there's no cause for alarm. When such dichotomies happen, investors need to follow the indexes rather than the headlines.


Just look back to January when some thought war would break out with Iran. Stock indexes hardly flinched and the crisis soon was over. Investors who took themselves out of the market came to regret their decision.


More Breakouts In Tuesday Trading
---------------------------------


Many stocks [broke out of bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) Tuesday, although just a few impressed.



Semiconductor company **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) topped the 65.33 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) in heavy volume. **Ingredion** ([INGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGR)), which makes ingredients for food and other industries, gapped above the 94.51 buy point of a flat base after beating profit views.


Given its industry and so-so IBD ratings, including a 64 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) as seen in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-ingredion-inc-ingr.aspx), consider Ingredion an income or defensive play. It scores an annualized dividend yield of 2.8%.


**OneMain** ([OMF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OMF)) followed through on a breakout past a 44.97 entry. Late Monday, the financial services company beat profit expectations. **Steris** ([STE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STE)) jumped above the 155.17 buy point of a flat base after the infection prevention company raised its guidance.


OneMain was discussed in [today's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).

The IBD 50 rose not even 0.1%. **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) was the biggest loser on the IBD 50, down more than 8% in quadruple usual trade. The stock broke out of a base Monday, but just one day later [flashed a loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Shares fell nearly 8% from the 43.97 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The textbook company had a mostly positive earnings report Monday.


The wireless services industry group led 197 IBD industry groups, and that was thanks to news. A [federal judge approved the T-Mobile and Sprint merger](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/t-mobile-stock-sprint-stock-federal-judge-clears-merger/) without conditions. The Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission had already approved the deal.

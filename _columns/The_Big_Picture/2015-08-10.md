Stocks Surge, But Outlook Doesn't Change
=========================================

Stocks staged a big-time bounce Monday after sizable losses the prior week, but the market outlook remained unchanged. The S&P 500 jumped 1.3%, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.2%. Both rose back above their 50-day moving averages. The benchmark S&P 500 tested its 200-day line Friday, while the Nasdaq found support close to the 5,000 level.

  

Friday also saw the put-call ratio rising near the 1.1 area, which was close to the peaks that have marked short-term lows in the market.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average outperformed with a 1.4% gain to halt a seven-day slide. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1.3%. But the IBD 50 underwhelmed with a 0.7% gain.

  

A round of positive developments helped stocks.

  

Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told Bloomberg TV that he doesn't expect the central bank to start raising interest rates until inflation picks up.

  

Later, when Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart told the Atlanta Press Club that rate hikes are near, the market held on to its gains.

  

The market also digested deal news. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is buying a stake in Suning (see story on Page A1); Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)) is buying **Precision Castparts** ([PCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCP)); and **Mallinckrodt** ([MNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNK)) is scooping up Therakos.

  

In addition, oil prices rebounded Monday after falling for six straight weeks. Crude oil for September delivery rallied 2.5% to $44.96 a barrel.

  

Volume in the NYSE and Nasdaq ended lower Monday from Friday's heavy pace, which was disappointing. A big move is more convincing when there's heavy turnover behind it.

  

Another positive was that the July 6 distribution day on Nasdaq and the S&P 500 expired due to time. The expiration gives the Nasdaq just two marks of institutional selling, which isn't much. Yet the S&P 500 still lugs around seven distribution days.

  

While Monday's rally was nice to see, the market remains under pressure. Investors should remain cautious about putting money into a market that continues to trend sideways. On one hand, the major indexes have rebounded soon each time they've suffered losses in excess of 1%. On the other hand, whenever an index hits a new high, buying momentum quickly exhausts itself.

  

Until the character of the market changes, investors might want to keep stock trading on the light side.

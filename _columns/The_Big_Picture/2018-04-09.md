Bullish Session For Stock Market Early Ends Up Being Not So Bullish
====================================================================

Several biotech stocks ended with strong gains Monday, but the session was marred by a lack of conviction behind the buying and a late-day sell-off.




The Nasdaq composite jumped 2.3% early but ended with a gain of just 0.5%. Volume was heavy early but trailed off. Some attributed the selling to a New York Times report that the FBI raided the office of Michael Cohen, President Trump's personal lawyer.


The S&P 500 edged higher by 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index inched up 0.1%, but the IBD 50 outperformed with a 0.7% gain. Nasdaq volume fell and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE also lower than Friday's levels.


The Nasdaq's performance in the morning most definitely had the look of a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/). But it obviously didn't pan out. The market remains in a correction until proven otherwise.

The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain below their respective 50-day moving averages. The 50-day line for each index is a potential resistance level to watch. The Dow met with resistance at the 50-day line on March 12-13.


Biotech Stocks Soar
-------------------


Several biotech stocks outperformed, helped by a flurry of headlines. **Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)) announced plans to buy **AveXis** ([AVXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVXS)) for around $8.7 billion, gaining access to a gene therapy treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. Shares of AveXis surged nearly 82%.


Inside the Dow, **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) surged 5% after data showed its drug Keytruda improved overall survival as a first treatment option for some lung cancer patients.


Meanwhile, biotech **Agios Pharmaceuticals** ([AGIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGIO)) gapped up and rose 9% on reports that **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) is a potential suitor.


IBD 50 Stocks Jump
------------------


Several top-rated growth stocks in the [IBD 5o](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) held gains even as the Nasdaq ended well off session highs. Ten names in the index of leading growth stocks rose 2% or more. China-based **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) was the top gainer, up nearly 6%. The stock extended gains after a nice bounce off the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/) last week. Another component, **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)), has been stingy about giving back recent gains, but a first test of the 10-week line is still possible.


Elsewhere, some semiconductor stocks outperformed early. A positive note from Evercore ISI fueled positive sentiment. Evercore reiterated outperform ratings and raised price targets for **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)). Both outperformed early but ceded early gains.


Aluminum producer **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) was a top performer in IBD's mining and metal ores group. Aluminum stocks were strong after Russian producer United Company Rusal warned Monday that Trump sanctions could put the company in technical default of debt obligations.

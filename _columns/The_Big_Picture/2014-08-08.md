Major averages capped the week with solid gains in lighter volume Friday, undeterred by news of multiple U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.


The rally gained steam in the second half of the session on news that Russian troops ended military exercises near the Ukraine border.


The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, its best one-day percentage gain since early March, but the index is still below its 50-day moving average. The Dow Jones industrial average bounced off its 200-day moving average, a long-term support level, rising 1.1%. The Nasdaq picked up 0.8%, ending a hair below its 50-day line.


The IBD 50 lagged a bit, rising 0.8% â€” a disappointing performance on a seemingly strong day for the market. That said, the index of leading growth stocks is showing relative strength to some extent, trading above its 50-day moving average.


Friday's strength notwithstanding, it's still a headline-driven market that remains under distribution with no signs yet that institutional investors are ready to come back from the sidelines. Friday's lower-volume gains were proof of that.


Headlines are good one day and bad the next about the economy, the Fed, the Middle East and Ukraine, in no particular order.


Things could change quickly, though, so it's important not to slant too far toward the bearish side.


Breadth improved markedly on the NYSE Friday even though the NYSE advance/decline line remains in a downtrend. On the NYSE, advancing stocks trounced decliners by 3-to-1. Winners beat losers by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Some breakouts have run into trouble including the likes of **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), **Harman Industries** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)) and **GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)), for example. But other leaders are holding up just fine, including **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), among others.


Rather than force the issue and try to make money on the long side in a downtrending market, take time to refresh your watch list with potentially actionable growth names.


**Polaris Industries** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) completed three-weeks-tight patterns Friday.


**Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) and **Old Dominion Freight Lines** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) are consolidating gains constructively.


The market served up one powerful breakout Friday. **Air Methods** ([AIRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIRM)), a provider of air ambulance services, surged out of a lengthy consolidation, rising 12%. Keep in mind, though, that new buys should be avoided when the market's in a correction.


Late Thursday, Air Methods reported better-than-expected earnings and sales. Sales at its Air Medical Services segment rose 7% to $219.6 million, making up 85% of total revenue. Sales at its tourism segment nearly doubled to $31.4 million. The unit provides helicopter tours and charter flights in the Las Vegas-Grand Canyon region and Hawaii.

  Stocks Trim Losses As Trade-War Salvos Rattle Global Markets, Dow Sputters

For the second day in a row, the stock market pared trade-war-related selling in an especially strong effort given the heavy losses in China's markets.




The Nasdaq on Tuesday opened with a 1.4% loss and closed just 0.3% lower. While that was an impressive recovery, it fell short of Monday's rebound, when the composite erased a loss of 0.9% to close flat. The S&P 500 cut Tuesday's loss by roughly half, ending down 0.4%.


But the Dow Jones industrial average had a whimper of a bounce, closing 1.1% lower. Two Dow components with big exposure to China — **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) — gapped down in active trading. Boeing fell below its 50-day moving average and Caterpillar below its 200-day.

After Tuesday's loss, the Dow was at a deficit for 2018. But the index found support at the 50-day moving average. That's where the Dow was able to get a second wind in late May.


Small caps shined as the Russell 2000 reversed higher for a gain of 0.1%. The Dow utilities average climbed 1.1%. Utilities act as a counterweight when the market falls into hard times.


While Wall Street could find some relief in reducing its losses this week, the same could not be said for many foreign markets. Stocks in Europe and Asia slid after President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.


It was the latest step in an exchange between the U.S., China and other trade partners that have already rattled global markets. On Tuesday, the Paris CAC 40 slid 1.1%, the German DAX lost 1.2%, and the Nikkei slid 1.8%. Sell-offs were even more intense in China, the target of most U.S. trade attacks.


The Shanghai composite plunged 3.8% to the lowest level in nearly two years. The Shenzhen index plummeted 5.8%, touching the lowest level since September 2015. Hong Kong's Hang Seng skidded 2.8% — less than the mainland China indexes but still enough to send it below the 200-day moving average.


Such shelling indicates investors see clear risks in the trade spat, [even if negotiations continue](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-bluff-zte-dow-jones/). Tuesday's industry-group performance reflected those worries as well. Among the worst-performing groups were machinery, automakers, fertilizers, airfreight and chemicals.

While it's good that indexes trimmed losses, they're still losses. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, giving the composite a new [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). NYSE volume also rose. This gives the S&P 500 a new distribution day. At the same time, the May 14 distribution on the S&P 500, a stalling day, dropped off due to age.


Six distribution days (the S&P's tally right now) are more than normal, suggesting that institutional investors are liquidating. But similar levels of distribution haven't necessarily hurt the market. A spate of distribution from April 20 to May 15 on the S&P 500 did not stop the index from ascending.


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) fell 0.8% Tuesday, with the six worst stocks all based in China. **Sogou** ([SOGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOGO)), a search engine company, plunged nearly 10% and closed back below its 14.80 buy point. **Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)), an investment advisory firm, fell 4%. **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), one of the hottest internet stocks lately, dropped 4%.


With every bout of weakness, there's at least one pocket of strength — and investors Tuesday could find them in biotechs and energy.


IBD's biotech industry group rose 1.7% and the SPDR S&P Biotech ([XBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XBI)) ETF climbed to a new high. The group's ascent in [IBD's 197 industry groups table](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) indicates that biotechs are rotating back into a leadership role.


In oil, **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) jumped 4% and surged back above its 50-day line. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration ([XOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOP)) is still finding support in a pullback to the 50-day average.

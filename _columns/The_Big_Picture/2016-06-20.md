Waning Brexit Fears Stoke Market Rally, But Early Gains Fade

Stocks jumped out of the gate Monday but closed with a whimper as major averages failed to keep pace with bullish gains for key European indexes overnight.


Sentiment was positive at the open after new opinion polls showed rising support for the U.K. remaining in the European Union. Key European indexes ended with gains of 3% or more.


But it was a different story in the U.S. The Nasdaq more than halved a 1.7% intraday gain, rising 0.8%. The Dow added 0.7% and the S&P 500 picked up 0.6%. Small caps hung in there, with the Russell 2000 up 1.1%.


![MP062016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP062016.jpg)Volume fell sharply from Friday's levels. That's not surprising because options and futures expired Friday, which resulted in unusually heavy volume.


Crude oil for July delivery jumped nearly 3% to $49.37 a barrel. Money flowed out of bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield up 8 basis points to 1.69%.


Breadth on the NYSE was decent as advancers topped decliners by more than 3-to-1. Nasdaq breadth was a bit weaker at slightly less than 3-to-1. The IBD 50 added 1%, helped by **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)), which rose 4%. The networking firm followed through after Friday's breakout and is now extended from a 34.24 buy point.


What Monday's action showed is that institutional investors remain hesitant to put money to work. If they had been active buyers Monday, indexes would not have ceded early gains. Once the U.K's status in the European Union is resolved with Thursday's referendum, fund managers still must grapple with the question: How healthy is the U.S. economy?Â  And that's a difficult question, particularly for the Fed, which seems content to be more dovish than hawkish at this point.


Some of the more compelling charts right now can be found in the market's more speculative names.


**Guidewire Software** ([GWRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWRE)) had a good day, gaining nearly 3% in fast trade. It's working on a cup-with-handle base with a 62.72 buy point.


Small caps **Duluth Holdings** ([DLTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTH)) is rising from support at its 50-day moving average. **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)) slipped below its 16.10 buy point but found support near the 50-day line.


In the large-cap space, **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) added 2.5% in solid volume ahead of its earnings report Tuesday after the close. It's above its 50-day moving average and near a 98.10 buy point.


**Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) gapped up and rose 2%. It reports earnings Wednesday after the close and is still in buy range from a 76.30 buy point.


Heightened market uncertainty is never an easy time to make money in stocks, either long or short. Long ideas can sour in no time. So can shorts. Until signs of institutional buying pick back up in the market, conservative exposure to growth stocks makes sense. The distribution-day count has been falling in recent weeks, a good sign for the bulls, but it hasn't made it much easier to make money on the long side.

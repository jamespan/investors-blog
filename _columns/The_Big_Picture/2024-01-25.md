  Stock Market Rises On Strong GDP Report; Key Inflation Report Next

The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the stock market higher Thursday, as Wall Street reacted to a stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP report. Meanwhile, market leaders **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)), **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) and **XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)) are in or near buy zones.




The stock market got off to a bullish start Thursday after the preliminary [fourth-quarter GDP](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/key-federal-reserve-inflation-rate-stays-tame-as-gdp-surprises-sp-500/) came in stronger than expected. The U.S. economy grew 3.3% in Q4, above forecasts of 2% growth, though slowing from Q3's 4.9% pace.


Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge, the core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price index, rose at a 2% annual rate in Q4, matching expectations. It was the second straight quarter of 2% annualized inflation, in line with the Fed's target. That follows increases of 3.7% in Q2 and 5% in Q1.


Initial unemployment claims jumped to 214,000 vs. 187,000 in the previous week. They were expected to rise to 200,000, per Econoday estimates.


In response to that economic data, the 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to 4.13%.


Up next, the Commerce Department will issue its personal income and outlays report for December, out at 8:30 a.m. ET Friday. The PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2% in December, with a 2.7% annual increase.


Key Earnings Movers: Tesla
--------------------------


Tesla was one of the big earnings movers Thursday, as shares plunged more than 12% to close at their lowest level since May 2023.


Late Wednesday, the [electric-vehicle giant said](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-earnings-slide-40-next-gen-vehicle-elon-musk/) earnings fell 40% to 71 cents per share while revenue totaled $25.17 billion, up 3.5% vs. the year-ago period. Wall Street expected earnings of 73 cents a share on revenue of $25.62 billion. For 2023, Tesla earnings fell 23% to $3.12 a share while revenue increased 19% to $96.77 billion vs. estimates of $3.05 on sales of $97.5 billion.


Other key earnings movers Thursday included **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), along with **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)).


American Airlines advanced more than 10%, while [Lam Research](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lrcx-stock-lam-research-tops-december-quarter-views-guides-up/) rose more than 2% after paring gains. Mobileye stock gained 1.2%. [ServiceNow](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/now-stock-servicenow-earnings-q42023/) moved up 0.4%. And Southwest stock reversed lower 2.3% in Thursday trading.

Stock Market Today
------------------


![Market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP012524-206x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 0.2%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 moved up 0.7%. The Dow and S&P 500 made new closing highs.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


In the Dow, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) soared 9.5% on strong fourth-quarter earnings. Shares are at the [20%-25% profit-taking range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) from a 151.93 cup-with-handle entry.


On the Dow's downside, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) were the biggest losers Thursday. Boeing shares dived 5.7%, erasing recent gains and closing just off the Jan. 16 lows. And UnitedHealth tumbled 3.9% to fall below its long-term 200-day line.


Among the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rose 0.4% Thursday, still trading in the 20%-25% profit area past a 505.48 flat-base entry. Meanwhile, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) climbed 2.1% to a new high. It is extended above a 139.42 cup-with-handle buy point.

What To Do Now
--------------


Despite the major stock indexes trading around record highs, IBD is reducing its recommended exposure level to 60%-80%. The overall outlook remains "confirmed uptrend," however.


The Nasdaq is getting extended from its 50-day moving average, more than 5% above that key benchmark. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq continues to rise in declining volume, a sign that institutions are reluctant to commit heavy resources at this level. The S&P 500 is carrying a high number of distribution days, with seven.


So, while there is currently nothing overtly wrong with the market action, the odds are higher for a market pullback. With an eye toward trimming exposure, be sure to cut losses short and take at least some profits at the 20%-25% level.


Still, there's nothing that should keep investors from looking for new breakouts or strong rebounds from key support levels.


A great resource for finding daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks topping buy points. In Thursday's list, there were zero breakouts, another sign of a tiring uptrend.


Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows a handful of stocks nearing buy points in bases. For example, **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)) is within striking distance of a flat base's 85.66 buy point.

Stock Market Leaders: DraftKings, MongoDB, XP
---------------------------------------------



Several stock market leaders were near crucial chart areas in Thursday's market action.


[IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) DraftKings extended a win streak to seven sessions Thursday, with a 0.6% rise. [Shares are trying to break out](https://www.investors.com/news/draftkings-breaks-out-into-buy-zone-on-barstool-sports-deal-talks/) past a double-bottom base's buy point at 38.97.


MongoDB declined 2.4%, about 5% away from a double bottom's 425.02 entry. The stock may try to find support around its 50-day line in coming sessions. The relative strength line hasn't made a new high yet, so that's a technical indicator to watch.


Financial leader XP lost 0.4% Thursday, testing its 50-day line. XP is forming a cup with handle with a 27.03 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).

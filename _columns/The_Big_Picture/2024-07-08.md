  Dow Jones Reverses Lower As Nasdaq Hits All-Time High; Time To Worry About This Stock Market Sentiment Indicator?

If investors had expected some dramatic change in stock market behavior on Monday, following last week's July 4 holiday, they certainly didn't get it. The Nasdaq composite muscled to all-time highs and small caps rose. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged a bit lower amid mixed action among its components.




The Dow Jones industrials closed down only 31 points, or less than 0.1%. Yet it failed to join other indexes higher as struggling also-rans such as **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), as well as software-as-a-service stalwart **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) logged losses of 2 to 5 points each.


However, at least eight of the 30 blue chip components rallied 1 point or more. Among these names, **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) both hold an Earnings Per Share Rating of 90 or higher.


Monday's session reaffirmed what could serve as an [investing refrain during the second half the year](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-next-6-months-magnificent-seven-tech-sp500-nasdaq/): Bullish themes such as artificial intelligence and select areas of retail and consumer spending remain intact. But be wary of future volatility, even among large caps in the Dow Jones and the S&P 500, as the November elections approach.


For now, the [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) remains muted. On Monday, the VIX reversed lower, down 0.9% to 12.37. It has been testing the 12 level for at least seven weeks.


Once again, small moves by the major indexes concealed bigger swings on a sector and industry group level.

Stock Market Today
------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP070824-215x300.jpg)While semiconductor stocks bagged gains and enterprise software shares faded, the Nasdaq composite still logged a 0.3% rise to 18,403, its fourth close in a row about 18,000. As small as Monday's rise was, the Nasdaq reaffirmed its leadership in the stock market, up 22.6% from its Jan. 1 start at 15,011.


Breadth on the Nasdaq side of the stock market? It was decently bullish. Early data showed winners beat losers by a nearly 4-3 margin. The balance of advancing issues vs. declining ones on the NYSE? More balanced at 1,538 up vs. 1,359 down, according to data on ThinkOrSwim.


Remember **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)), one of the tech darlings of 2023? Its strong move helped generate a 7% rise for the computer hardware and peripherals industry group, the best performer among 197 IBD industries on Monday. Yet, computer hardware was hardly alone in sharply outdistancing the stock market indexes. At least 20 additional industry groups advanced 1.5% or more. They included fabless semiconductors, chip manufacturing, biotech, apparel making, contract electronics, and home furnishings retail.


On the other side of the spectrum, a big wad of transportation stocks joined telecom and other cyclical industries in sinking 1% or more on Monday. Yet, sticking out in terms of groups on the downside of the stock market was enterprise software, off 1.4%.


This group has fallen 7.6% over the past three months on a price-weighted basis. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), which got considerable airtime on the Monday episode of [IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/), gapped down at the open and fell 5% to 766.20. The leader in helping large organizations digitize their operations had made a nifty run from the bottom of its current base, and so a pullback seemed likely. Volume picked up 44% above usual levels. But ServiceNow trades only 6% below the consolidation's left-side peak.


ServiceNow is without question a stock market leader. A 99 [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) and 89 [Relative Strength score](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) underline its bullish traits. However, after doubling since March 2023, it may need more time to set up a robust breakout to new highs. Earnings are due on July 24.

Small caps joined the stock market rally. The Russell 2000, up 0.6%, continues to tread near its own 50-day line. Year to date, the Russell's gain remains staid, up just 0.6%.


Volume was mixed. Nasdaq turnover grew 8% vs. Friday's dull session. NYSE activity cooled mildly.


Beyond Stock Market: Is This A Ticking Time Bomb?
-------------------------------------------------


Normally, the financial media and numerous stock market observers would point to the [U.S. mountain of debt as a potential ticking time bomb](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-broke-the-budget-what-budget-deficits-mean-for-the-economy-and-sp-500/) for not only the economy but also the debt and equity markets. And when such fears strengthen, even stocks in the Dow Jones industrials do not necessarily become a safe haven from the storm.


From late September through mid-October, the fast run in U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yields sparked discussion on the return of "bond vigilantes," or those market participants who are selling long-dated Treasurys or perhaps going short on U.S. government bonds. Why? With the federal debt now approaching $35 trillion, investors rightfully worry about how servicing that debt alone could pose as a real drag on U.S. economic output.


On Monday, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond finished flat at 4.26%, one trading day after nonfarm payrolls data for June signaled the labor market continues to moderate.


In the more immediate term, however, stock market investors may want to monitor the daily action very closely, now that some sentiment indicators have gotten near levels that historically have marked an ensuing pullback.

Stock Market Psychology
-----------------------


One to watch? The [bulls vs. bears indicator from Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/). Last week, the bulls ratio climbed for the fourth straight week to 63.1%. That's the highest level since the week ended April 23, 2021, when this ratio reached 63.7%. This high level highlights that a far majority of newsletter writers and editors think the bull run will keep going. Yet strong market runs eventually need to take a break.


A high bullish ratio, by itself, can work as a contrarian signal, but often is not a timely sell signal.


Back in 2021, the S&P 500 continued to rally for the next eight months despite the frothy ratio. It wasn't until the first three weeks of 2022 when the threat of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve had proverbially broke the bull's back. The S&P 500 dropped like a rock in January that year, falling 5.3%. The Dow Jones industrials slid 3.3%.


Interestingly, look more closely at a monthly chart of the Dow Jones average, and you'll find that even this index of blue chips had gotten more volatile in the fourth quarter of 2021.


From the month of September, the Dow fell 4.3%, then rallied 5.8% the next month. The index slumped 3.7% in November, then rebounded 5.8% in December. Talk about zigzagging moves.


This Leader Gets Grilled
------------------------


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) continues to go into serious correction mode just days after posting a historic 50-for-1 stock split.



A monthly chart highlights the stock's amazing run since it smashed a long downtrend line in April 2018. Nevertheless, Chipotle, down 5.2% in heavy volume Monday, now trades 6% below its still-rising 50-day line. For recent buyers of the burrito and taco chain, without question Monday's action delivered an [acute sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Go back to July 27, 2023, and you see the stock also declining further after gapping right through its 50-day moving average following quarterly results.


Going back to the S&P 500, on Monday it finished less than 5% above its 50-day moving average. History has shown that when the index rises 5% or more above this key technical level, it has often reached overbought territory and gets ripe for a pullback.


Some examples to consider: March 29, 2022, when the S&P 500 finished 5% above the 50-day line; Aug. 16, 2022 (8.7% above, but also trading below its 200-day moving average); Feb. 2, 2023 (5.7% above the 50-day); and July 31, 2023 (4.8% above).

The Nasdaq continues to puncture arguments that the U.S. economy has a long way to before things turn normal. And that's certainly true for select sectors. But growth stocks on Tuesday also confirmed this timeless advice for stock pickers: [Don't chase](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).




The tech-centered Nasdaq composite came well off its session and all-time high of 10,221 during a Wall Street-wide pullback in the final two hours of trading. Yet it still logged an eighth straight win. The leading equity index has recouped all of its 5.3% drubbing on June 11 and more. The Nasdaq knocked off a June 4 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to its substantial advance since then.


On Tuesday, at least 12 industry groups hit 52-week or all-time highs. Seven hail from the software sector: gaming, desktop, enterprise, specialty enterprise, design, database and medical. (See the daily performance and six-month rankings of all 197 industries at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


At 10,131, the Nasdaq finished in the lower fifth of the day's price range, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). However, since the index made a bullish gap, it's more appropriate to judge the close in terms of how it finished between Monday's closing price of 10,056 and Tuesday's session high. From that vantage point, the composite finished almost at the midpoint, or 10,138.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP062320-209x300.jpg)FAANG stocks continued to show leadership and helped boost the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF to a gain of nearly 0.9% and new all-time highs.


At 10,209, with five trading days left in the second quarter, the Nasdaq 100 has a whopping gain of more than 30% for the second quarter.


That crushes a 21% gain for both the S&P 500 (up 0.4% on Tuesday) and S&P SmallCap 600 (also up 0.4%) over the same time frame.


Utility, food, tobacco, select retail and a few medical and other defensive groups have been duds.


Beyond Nasdaq: Leaders Quarter To Date
--------------------------------------


Since April 1, the best-performing industry groups include home furnishings retail (up 114%, according to preliminary data), automakers, RV, enterprise software, both U.S. and international oil and gas exploration, gaming, oil drilling, solar, internet retail, wood products, gold and silver mining, discount and variety retail, and desktop software. All of these industry groups have risen 40% or more on a price-weighted basis.


Does anyone think such an advance by the Nasdaq can be sustained on an annualized basis?


Of course not, so growth investors should be prepared for future days in which the leaders cool off, move sideways, reverse off their highs and eventually create [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).

Consider **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)). Four of these five names hold [a spot in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders). All five sat out Tuesday's rally.


The former two saw declines in heavy turnover. Yet neither are posting sell signals. Fortinet, a stalwart within the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), may form a new base after its bullish gap-up on May 7 following solid Q1 results.


New IPO Leader
--------------



Cloudflare, down 4% in double normal volume, has now fallen 8% below its new all-time peak of 38.48 set just two days earlier. The fellow member of the security software and firewall protection market would have forced traders who chased the stock at Friday's high to [cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Now, more than ever, is an important time to buy with discipline.


Look for [shelf patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-shelf-pattern-and-why-it-is-perfect-pyramiding-tool-in-growth-stocks/). When you spot a [rebound off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) following a robust breakout, try to buy as close as possible to the moment that it springs off that line.


[A clear break of the 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) then serves as a line in the sand to control downside risk.


Will Chips Dethrone Software?
-----------------------------


Headed into Tuesday's trade, Chips ranked No. 3 among 33 sectors that shape [IBD's stock tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jun-22-2020/). As the digital economy continues to evolve and grow, it will depend ever more on advanced semiconductors.


On the chip equipment side, **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) has seen virtually zero price progress in the past five sessions. And that's not necessarily bad. The chip-equipment firm finally busted through upside resistance at 180 three weeks ago; a positive reversal on June 15 reflected a floor of support at that key price level.


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) has shown some snoozing action. Yet the stock continues to inhabit the north side of its 50-day moving average, a promising sign.


[As Tuesday's IBD Live show noted](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live), AMD continues to rank highly within [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), and one reason stems from its huge 12-month price gain. But year-to-date performance has been a quieter affair.

New Economic Data Comes In, Money In U.S. Treasuries Goes Out
-------------------------------------------------------------


A better-than-expected bounce in manufacturing activity for June, as seen in the U.S. PMI Composite flash report, helped boost institutional appetite for equities. The flash index of 46.8 beat the [consensus view](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 45 and jumped sharply from an unusually deflated level of 36.4 in May. A 50 reading is neutral; over 50 marks expanding output.


The same June PMI flash readings for Germany and France also beat the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


Meanwhile, the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank's manufacturing index jumped sharply in June to a neutral zero from a severely depressed figure of -27 in May. It too beat the Econoday consensus view of -5. The headline index covers new orders, shipments and employment.


The benchmark 10-year U.S. government bond fell in price, sending the yield up 1 basis point to 0.72%. Two-year notes have bumped up 4 basis points this month to 0.18%.

  Stocks Fall Mildly As Medical Sector Stumbles

The major indexes are keeping their confirmed uptrend intact, but will the Nasdaq's bullish trajectory prevail over the other indexes' more subdued path?


The Nasdaq fell less than 0.2% Monday, hardly a bother compared with the 1.1% gain on Friday. The composite held near all-time highs. The S&P 500 eased 0.1%. Both indexes made late bounces, though neither got deep into the red anyway.


Volume fell across the board, another sign that the selling was normal. Losers led winners by 11-to-10 on the Nasdaq, but winners led by about 9-to-7 on the NYSE. The 2.6% rise in oil prices Monday could explain at least part of that divergence. Energy stocks outperformed, which gave the oil-heavier NYSE a leg up.


While energy stocks were in demand, health care stocks were in retreat. Biotech, home care, research and pharmaceutical companies were in the bottom of the day's industry group performance table. There was no overarching reason, but rather a mix of earnings and other news.


**![MP080816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP080816-174x300.jpg)Bristol-Myers Squibb** ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)) slid 5%, adding to Friday's 16% plunge on news that its new lung cancer drug fared poorly in a critical late-stage clinical trial. **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) fell 5.5%. It had already plunged 10% Friday following mixed quarterly results.


**AMN Healthcare Services** ([AHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AHS)) fell 8% as it continued to sell off following the medical staffing firm's earnings report.


The IBD 50 fell 0.3% Monday, and it has been lagging for several days. Last week, when the Nasdaq added 1.1%, the IBD 50 inched up just 0.1%. But such flash numbers can be misleading.


A scan of the IBD 50 shows several well-behaved stocks that are finding support at their 50-day or 10-week moving averages, providing the next buy opportunities after their initial breakouts. More than five weeks after the June 30 follow-through, such pullbacks are to be expected among the leading stocks.


**Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)), **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) and **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)) all present charts that investors should be studying. Some have already made strong moves from their 50-day lines, including **Jack in the Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)), **B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS)) and **Masimo** ([MASI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MASI)).


For the broad market, the key question is how the Nasdaq and S&P 500 will reconcile their divergent paths. The Nasdaq has gone up 7.7% since the June 30 follow-through, the S&P 500 just 3.9%. The Dow industrials fell in 10 of the past 13 sessions. Bulls have to hope the other indexes will catch up to the Nasdaq.


To be sure, the Nasdaq is making up for its lagging performance earlier in the year. The composite is up 4.1% year to date, while the S&P 500 still leads with a 6.7% advance.


Breadth remains favorable. The advance-decline line of the NYSE has been making new highs since April. The Nasdaq is now at the highest level in a year. The put-call volume ratio is near a one-year low. That's an unusually complacent reading that may indicate the market is getting frothy. But distribution in the main indexes remains at acceptable levels, and that weighs on the market calculus more than any other factor.

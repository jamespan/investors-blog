September housing starts, weak. American-style pizza sales, piping hot around the globe. Big banks basking again in big profits. And a **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) CEO anxious to trump the final debate between presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton by holding by his own media event this evening, one hour before the debate goes live.


The overall market reaction on Wednesday? Not great, but not terrible either.


The major indexes posted small gains as stocks chiseled out a little more of last week's significant losses. Yet the small moves seemed to disguise a heavier-than-normal flow of money going into sectors such as oil and gas, banking, air transport, leisure products and services, and the internet.


Small caps outperformed as the S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.4%, upending the S&P 500 large-cap index's 0.2% gain. The Russell 2000 also advanced 0.4%; at 1222, the popular small-cap gauge is now up 7.6% year-to-date.


**![MP101916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP101916-160x300.png)Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) helped light up the beleaguered restaurant sector with a second straight solid gain. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/) member posted excellent growth (EPS up 43%, sales up 17%) on Tuesday and saw solid same-store sales growth both in the U.S. and overseas. Domino's gets a terrific 95 Composite Rating from the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-dominos-pizza-inc-dpz.aspx).


The Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1% and stopped short of closing above its key 50-day moving average. (See the dotted 50-day line on the big charts via the link at the end of this column.)


The indexes' gains peaked at around 2 p.m. ET, when the Federal Reserve's Beige Book reported faster economic growth in the St. Louis, Kansas City and Dallas districts, but the rally faded in the final two hours of trading.


Volume increased modestly on both exchanges. That's generally a good sign. You want to see institutional activity pick up when the market is going higher, not slow down. So, at least technically, Wednesday represented accumulation.


Keep in mind, however, that Nasdaq volume rose in part due to a surge in trading in **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), which dived almost 6% and gapped below its rising 50-day moving average. Nearly 70 million Intel shares changed hands, roughly 27 million shares more than on Tuesday.


The chipmaking giant saw a 21% jump in third-quarter earnings per share. It has now posted double-digit profit growth in two of the past three quarters, yet Wall Street apparently was disappointed with Intel's initial sales guidance for the fourth quarter.


In other sectors of the market, strong accumulation of shares appeared to take root in big Wall Street banks as well as oil and gas companies of all shapes, sizes and territories covered.
**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) joined the breakout train, moving past their 172.52 and 32.47 pivot points in heavy volume, respectively. They joined **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), which have also broken out.


The average earnings per share gain in the latest quarter for these four Wall Street banks was 58%, according to data from William O'Neil + Co. Morgan Stanley led with a 135% EPS boost, helped by an easy comp as Q3 profits sank 52% in the same quarter a year ago.


**Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), meanwhile, thundered more than 4% higher to 49.07. That sent the oil and gas field services expert nearly 5% past a 47 buy point in a seven-week flat base. That base sits next to another much longer, deeper price structure that stretches all the way back to May 2015.
Did investors care about a 97% plunge in third-quarter earnings and a 31% drop in revenue at the Houston-based drilling and completion services giant? Obviously not. They seemed to favor more the possibility that Halliburton will move past a difficult 2016 for the industry and return to profitability in 2017. The Street currently sees a loss of 17 cents a share this year giving way to a net profit of 91 cents in 2017.


A 2.2% jump in West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures to $51.71 a barrel certainly helped as well. Small- and midcap Permian Basin plays **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) (an IBD 50 member, currently No. 23) and **Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)) continue to ride solid uptrends.


It's been hardly weeks since the negative headlines on **Deutsche Bank** ([DB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DB)) appeared to rattle some folks' nerves. After all, the U.S. Department of Justice handed the Wall Street major player with a fine related to the selling of mortgage-backed securities that at one point was larger than DB's market cap, which for a time was $15.3 billion. Bullishness, as measured among newsletter editors by Investors Intelligence, has dipped to 42.9%. In other words, quite a majority of Wall Street pundits think the market is headed for either an intermediate-level correction or an outright bear market.


Have you been seeing the headlines regarding the 29th anniversary of the Black Monday stock market crash?


Ultimately, pessimism is good for bull markets. [Investor skepticism](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) and fear help prevent stock rallies from getting overly bubbly.


An equally important factor for the bulls? Solid earnings growth across a range of sectors. So far, the third-quarter narrative of results appears on script.

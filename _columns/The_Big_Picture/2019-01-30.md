  Stock Market Cheers Fed, Bullish Earnings Reports From Apple, Boeing

It was another solid day for the bulls in the stock market Wednesday as strong earnings from FAANG stock **Apple** ([APPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPL)) fueled a big rally in technology shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also held its own, thanks to a strong showing for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). Dovish comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also helped.




At the close, the Nasdaq composite jumped 2.2% and the Dow added 1.8%. The S&P 500 rose nearly 1.6%, a pretty good performance despite earnings sell-offs for **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)), **Franklin Resources** ([BEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEN)), **T. Rowe Price** ([TROW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TROW)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)). Weakness in these names was offset by strong showings from **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), up 20%, and **Stryker** ([SYK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYK)), up 11% as it surged to new highs.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF, a proxy for leading growth stocks, rose 1.4%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added just over 1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Tuesday as institutional investors put more money to work.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MP013019-229x300.jpg)The next test for the Nasdaq will be the 7,500 level. The Nasdaq's 200-day moving average sits around 7,450. It's a potential resistance level to watch, but if new institutional money continues to come in from the sidelines, it might not be a tough nut to crack. The S&P 500 is also nearing its 200-day line around 2,740.


Apple Earnings
--------------


On the surface, Apple's [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-apple-earnings-q1-2019/) left a lot to be desired, with adjusted earnings per share up just 7% from the year-ago quarter. Sales fell 5% to $84.3 billion, but Wall Street seemed to focus more on a 9% rise in Mac sales, a 17% increase in iPad sales and a 50% jump in wearables sales. Meanwhile, Apple Pay did 1.8 billion transactions in the quarter. Apple Music now boasts 50 million subscribers.



Apple showed bullish price action Wednesday, rising nearly 7% in big volume and reclaiming its 50-day moving average. But it's still 29% off its high after a sharp sell-off. That means it has a lot of overhead supply to conquer on the way back up.


Stock Market News: What The Fed Said
------------------------------------


The stock market strengthened in the afternoon after the [two-day Federal Reserve meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/dow-jones-fed-meeting-rates-balance-sheet-jerome-powell/) ended and the policy statement was released at 2 p.m. ET.


Powell pledged patience with future rate hikes. He also said quantitative tightening — where the Fed sells bonds to reduce its balance sheet — will stay at the current pace of up to $50 billion worth of Treasury and mortgage securities each month. When it comes to the Fed's bloated balance sheet, Powell said the Fed would consider adjusting the reduction of the central bank's bond portfolio if conditions warrant, but he also said the Fed plans to operate with an "ample supply" of bank reserves.


The 10-year Treasury yield eased three basis points to 2.68%. The market, according to the [CBOE Group FedWatch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/), isn't expecting any rate hikes this year.


Boeing Leads Stock Market
-------------------------


Wednesday's session served up [a solid breakout for Boeing](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-earnings-q4-2018-boeing-stock-buy-point/). The stock might look extended after gapping over a handle entry of 367.42 and a double-bottom entry of 373.80. But another interpretation is that the stock is still trying to clear a longer consolidation with a conventional entry at 394.38.


Two other aerospace firms continued to show relative strength. **TransDigm Group** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) broke out powerfully Tuesday after the company released bullish preliminary results. Meanwhile, group peer **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) gapped up Wednesday and broke out of a base, also on strong earnings.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


There was a healthy dose of skepticism when the S&P 500 surged 3.4% on Jan. 4. The big percentage gain in higher volume qualified as a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) and confirmed a new uptrend. Why the skepticism? Because two prior follow-through days for the Nasdaq composite — one on Nov. 7 and one on Nov. 28 — failed quickly. But there's a lot to like about the current stock market uptrend. There's been a relatively small but nice crop of breakouts, and distribution days have been few.


With the market tide flowing positive, it makes sense to continue to look for opportunities to put money to work. And don't be afraid to buy when a stock gaps up bullishly out of a base. Price action like this can often lead to more gains in the early stages of a confirmed uptrend.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) continues to add gains after a bullish earnings report. Same with **Waters** ([WAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAT)), which gapped out of a consolidation last week.

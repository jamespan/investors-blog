The stock market ended Friday trading mixed but turned in another weekly gain. An upcoming Warren Buffett letter to **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) investors and more inflation data now looms.




The Nasdaq composite ended Friday down 0.3% but managed to turn in a weekly gain of 1.4% following **Nvidia's** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) blockbuster earnings. The index has now gained in 15 of the past 17 weeks. The tech-heavy index also ended the week clear of all its [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) after getting support at the 21-day line. It is now up almost 7% so far this year.


The S&P 500 was nominally positive but essentially flat, though it rose 1.7% for the week. It sits clear of its short-term moving averages and is about 5% above its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The benchmark index also holds a gain of nearly 7% thus far in 2024.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared better than the other major indexes as it notched a 0.2% daily gain and now sits at a record high. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) was strongest here while **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was the worst performer.


Small caps also inched higher, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.1%. Growth stocks outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund notched a 0.3% daily gain.


Warren Buffett Letter, Inflation Data Looms
-------------------------------------------


Next week will be a busy one in terms of economic data. The latest reading on consumer confidence comes Tuesday, while retail inventories data is due Wednesday and the purchasing managers' manufacturing index for February drops on Friday.


Perhaps most importantly, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index data is due Thursday. Core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is seen rising 2.8% year over year.


Earnings season may be winding down, but there are a number of notable stock market [companies posting results next week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-zscaler-salesforce-snowflake-software-earnings/), including [Leaderboard stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)).


But earnings kick off early when Berkshire Hathaway reports on Saturday. The fourth-quarter report is also notable as it will include the latest annual letter to shareholders from Berkshire Chief Executive Warren Buffett.


His letters are widely read by those seeking his thoughts on the economy and investing in general. It also will be Buffett's first yearly missive since the death of his long-term lieutenant Charlie Munger in November.

These Stock Market Sectors Impress
----------------------------------


A majority of the [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday's session higher](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Utilities and materials were the best-performing areas. Consumer discretionary and energy were the worst laggards.


The performance of Investor's Business Daily's industry groups gave a more granular view of what happened on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).



Foreign telecom services firms, building maintenance stocks, security software companies and auto retailers were among the strongest performers.


In contrast, computer hardware firms, fiber-optics plays and cable and satellite companies were among the biggest laggards.


Travel stocks had the toughest session following a negative reaction to the latest quarterly report from **Booking** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)). The stock was given the chop from the [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) amid a decline of more than 10%.

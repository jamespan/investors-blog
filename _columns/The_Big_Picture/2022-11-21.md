Marquee names made headlines in Monday's stock market while American investors looked forward to a welcome Thanksgiving break. Dow Jones Industrial Average component **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) ousted CEO Bob Chapek after 160 million-plus new streaming subscriptions failed to book a profit while **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) brand destruction continued, dropping the EV maker to a two-year low.




Major benchmarks posted modest losses in narrow rangebound price action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell just 0.1% while the S&P 500 lost 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite led the downside, dropping 1.1%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index split the difference, down almost 0.6%.


Volume exceeded Friday's options-expiration session through most of the day but ended with the Nasdaq and NYSE down between 5% and 10%, according to preliminary closing data. This meant the distribution day count remained the same.


U.S. Treasury bonds had quiet sessions, with yields lifting a few basis points after another round of Fed governor sound bites.


Crude oil went on a wild ride, falling as much as 6% in early trading, before recouping the entire loss. The turnaround erupted after Saudi Arabia denied a report it would seek a 500,000-barrel production increase at the next OPEC meeting. The fossil fuel traded at $80.28 in late action.


**Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) fell 8.9% to an all-time low, dragging Bitcoin to a two-year low at $15,588, as the FTX bankruptcy drama continues to obliterate sentiment for digital assets.


Stock Market Holding Q4 Gains Despite Fedspeak
----------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP112122_2-229x300.jpg)Even amid all of the above-mentioned volatility, stock market indexes are holding relatively close to November highs, and are up for the quarter, despite the barrage of Fed governors spinning their take on interest rate policy. The majority now expect a 50-basis-point hike at the December meeting, according to CME data on fed funds futures action. However, confusion reigns when it comes three specific points.


First, what will be the terminal rate in this hiking sequence? Governors have thrown out numbers between 4.5% and 7%, which just adds to investor confusion.


Second, how long will it take until we hit the magic level? Looking back a few decades, former Fed Chair Paul Volcker spent more than two years lifting the Fed funds rate from 11.2% in 1979 to an astounding 20% in June 1981.


Third, and most important to stock market investors, when will the next round of rate cuts start?


We're learning the hard way that growth sectors need low interest rates to thrive. Unfortunately, those are the stocks held by most investors, whether directly or through funds.


This broad-based exposure has triggered a number of hope-fueled bounces or rallies, dubbed "hopium" by the financial media. Some market observers think it's unwise to expect the turnaround until 2024, at the earliest.


However, a Fed reversal in 2023 isn't out of the question.


The pandemic upset the economic apple cart, triggering widespread supply chain disruptions and wide data swings. Now that supply and demand are coming back into balance,  it's possible that prices and wages will do the same, albeit at a higher level than 2021.


If so, the Fed could find itself too far ahead the curve, be forced to apologize and reverse its rate tightening policy.


Given the crosscurrents, IBD has lifted its stock market rating to "Confirmed Uptrend" but is advising skilled investors to limit exposure to just 20% to 40%, and to take losses aggressively.


Disney And Tesla Shake Up Quiet Session
---------------------------------------



[Disney rallied 6.3%](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-replaces-ceo-bob-chapek-with-return-of-bob-iger/) after the board fired CEO Bob Chapek and reinstated former CEO Robert Igor for a two-year stretch. The Disney+ streaming service is losing lots of money despite garnering more than 150 million subscribers and plenty of new subs recently. The activist Trian Fund Management has taken a large stake and is seeking a board seat.


This will put a fire under Iger in coming months, forcing layoffs and other cost containment initiatives. Meanwhile, social media is abuzz, wondering what the change in the guard means for the Mouse's controversial creative content in recent years.



Tesla fell 6.8% to its lowest price since November 2020. The decline follows a barrage of media reports suggesting that Twitter was about to shut down or go bankrupt. CEO Elon Musk has become a controversial and polarizing figure, which could translate into costly brand destruction.


TSLA has lost nearly 60% of its value since the November 2021 top near 414. Tesla split its shares 3 for 1 in late August.

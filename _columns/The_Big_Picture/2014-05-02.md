Stock Indexes Sag, But IBD 50 Outperforms Again
================================================

Stocks retreated in quiet volume Friday, but the IBD 50 outperformed the major indexes for the fourth straight day.


The Nasdaq slipped 0.1% after being up 0.4%. The S&P 500 also fell 0.1% after an early advance took it just 0.3% shy of a new high.


Volume fell across the board.


In the past four sessions, the IBD 50 tacked on 1.3%, 0.6%, 1.2% and on Friday 0.1%, beating the major indexes each day. While Friday's gain was slight, the gain would've been 0.6% if the drug and medical stocks had been stripped out.


Money has been rotating out of the medical sector. The strength in the remaining portions of the IBD 50 is encouraging.


Yet bulls shouldn't get too excited. The leading stocks remain leaders in search of followers. The rest of the market has yet to perk up clearly.


The indexes began the day up, after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported April data on payrolls and unemployment. Gains in the indexes dwindled after the first hour or so of trade.


Payrolls for April increased 288,000, topping the consensus estimate of 215,000 and beating the highest estimate in the entire range, according to Econoday. Meanwhile, the jobless rate fell four ticks to 6.3%.


But the market apparently decided that this was no time to don the party hats. While the payroll number was welcome, the improvement in the jobless rate was not truly an improvement. The labor force participation rate fell from 63.2% in March to 62.8% in April, the worst level since 1978.


While the market has not yet confirmed that an uptrend is underway, investors should keep a careful eye on the leaders.


**Trinity Industries** ([TRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRN)) popped 1.99 to 76.28 Friday, clearing a 76.05 buy point in volume 82% above average. The base, however, is late stage. The stock climbed above the buy point Wednesday but reversed to close under the entry.


Other stocks breaking out Friday included **Canadian Pacific Railroad** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)), which topped a 158.57 entry in heavy volume but closed under the entry; and Netherlands-based aircraft leasing company **AerCap** ([AER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AER)), which thrust 1.08 to 43.83, topping a 43.79 buy point.


Additional breakouts earlier in the week haven't led to much acceleration.


Aerospace play **Alliant Techsystems** ([ATK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATK)) crossed its buy point Tuesday, lost it, and recrossed Friday. The stock is 4% past a 145.26 entry.


Other leaders, such as **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)), are showing jagged action after their breakouts.


The worst follow-up belongs to crane maker **Manitowoc** ([MTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTW)), which triggered the 8% sell rule a day after clearing a buy point intraday.


For the week, the IBD 50 rose 2%, the Nasdaq 1.2% and the S&P 500 1%.

The stock market extended its pullback Friday on rising U.S.-China tensions after China ordered the U.S. to close the consulate in the city of Chengdu. The Nasdaq composite sold off as much as 2.3% before trimming losses.




The Nasdaq closed 0.9% lower, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7%, or 182 points, dragged down by a 16% dive in **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) shares [on a key product delay](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-stock-tanks-production-delay-next-generation-chips/). Intel's troubles resulted in big gains for **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Taiwan** **Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)). AMD stock surged 16.5%, while TSM stock soared 9.7%.


Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% loss. Leading growth stocks were also sharply lower, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) fell 1.15%. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq, and early data showed lighter NYSE volume, taking some of the sting off the day's losses.


Stock Market Pullback Continues
-------------------------------


At the stock market open, the Nasdaq fell as much as 2.3%, adding to Thursday's sell-off. The Nasdaq cut losses in morning trade, but was unable to build on its early recovery efforts and ended with a sharp loss.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP072420-248x300.jpg)The Nasdaq not only pared losses but also closed at its 21-day exponential moving average, a support level for the index the past many weeks.


Sparking the early losses was news that China ordered the U.S. to close its Chengdu consulate in retaliation for a similar U.S. move. Earlier in the week, the U.S. State Department ordered China to close its Houston consulate. State Department Spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the order was issued "to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information."


Volume ended lower than on Thursday, so the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes narrowly avoided a [new distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). The week saw an increase in institutional selling. On Monday, the S&P 500 counted only two distribution days, while the Nasdaq logged one. By the end of the week, the S&P 500 had four, while the Nasdaq had three distribution days.


On the downside, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) skidded 6.4% on an analyst downgrade. The [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock is over 20% off its all-time high.


[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) closed below its 50-day line for the first time since a June 23 breakout above a 295.65 buy point in a flat base. Shares fell 2.1% Friday in above-average volume. The biotech was removed from the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) service.


According to Leaderboard commentary, "Vertex did a complete exit of the Leaders list on two reasons. One, a recent breakout past a 295.65 flat-base entry made very little progress. And two, a gap-down below the 50-day line indicates weakening demand for shares in the near term."

Breakout Stocks To Watch: Mastercard
------------------------------------


[IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) is trading just below a 316.16 buy point in a cup with handle after a breakout attempt on July 23, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows [Mastercard has a 90](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-mastercard-inc-cl-a-ma.aspx) out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


The stock's relative strength line is a bit far from its old highs, as it underperforms the broad market. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the broad market.


Mastercard will report earnings on Thursday. Analysts expect the payment processor to earn $1.17 a share on revenue of $3.2 billion.

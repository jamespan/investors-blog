These Growth Stocks See Plenty Of Action
=========================================

Major stock indexes started off the week with a quiet performance Monday, ending mixed and mostly unchanged, despite a busy day of headlines and individual stock movement.




The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 ended with tiny losses, while the Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1%, extending its winning streak to seven sessions. The Russell 2000 added 0.2% and the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) eased 0.4%. Nasdaq volume edged lower, while NYSE volume rose also.


Wall Street didn't focus much on a weaker-than-expected reading from the Empire State manufacturing index. It came in at 9.8, below the consensus estimate of 15. Bonds rose a bit, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 2 basis points to 2.31%.


The Nasdaq's distribution-day count dropped by one at Monday's close after the June 9 higher-volume decline fell off the count due to time.


The market is back in a confirmed uptrend after Friday's new closing high for the S&P 500. That gives the green light for new buys or to add to current positions that are working.

After a series of higher-volume declines, lower-volume gains can make for a shaky foundation. A daily chart for **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) offers a good example. It's one of several growth names setting up for a possible breakout, but the stock is not showing meaningful signs of accumulation at this point, judging from its price and volume during the pattern.


Several retail-related groups outperformed Monday. Among discount retailers, **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) narrowly cleared a flat base with a 44.18 buy point, although volume was light. Shares rose 2% to 44.10.


IBD 50 name **Nutrisystem** ([NTRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRI)) finds itself in the same boat as Alphabet and Ollie's — forming a decent base but tepid upside volume.


News that China's economy grew at a rate of 6.9% in the second quarter didn't stir much excitement on Wall Street, but it did propel some China growth names to more heavy-volume gains.


**YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) followed through nicely after Friday's breakout over a 61.62 buy point. Shares rose 3% more to 65.90. **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), featured Friday in the [Stock Spotlight](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/acquisition-could-fuel-strong-growth-ahead-for-this-china-hotel-name/) column, soared nearly 4% to 88.24 in strong volume. It closed near the 88.18 buy point of a flat base.


Nasdaq 100 component **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) lagged, falling nearly 3% to 301.91, as it tests support at the 50-day moving average again. It recently flashed a sell signal when it erased a double-digit gain from a 301.92 buy point. Note that the latest breakout was from late-stage base after a huge price run already.


Also in the Nasdaq 100, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) veered 2.5% lower after a Minnesota driver claimed a crashed occurred while using Tesla's autopilot system. Tesla shares haven't mounted much of a comeback since gapping below its 50-day moving average on July 5. That means the stock is likely ready to take a breather and consolidate gains for a while.


After the close, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) reported another solid quarter, sending shares 8% higher in after-hours trading. The company added 5.2 million net new subscribers in the quarter, vs. Wall Street's consensus estimate of 3.22 million and Netflix's own guidance of 3.2 million. The stock could be buyable early Tuesday if it successfully gaps out of its current base.


**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) reports Tuesday before the open. **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) reports after the close.


Bank of America is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 25.21 buy point, while United Continental has a base-on-base pattern in the works with an 83.14 entry.


August-delivery West Texas Intermediate crude oil lost 52 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $46.02 a barrel after notching a weekly gain of 5.2%.

Stocks ended narrowly mixed and took a breather Monday after rising for the past four weeks. The Nasdaq squeezed out an 0.1% gain, despite a 3% drop in index heavyweight **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).

  

Chips stocks were also weak. The Philadelphia semiconductor index slumped 2%. But Internet content stocks were strong Monday.

  

The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.2% after being down as much as 0.4% earlier in the day.

  

Meanwhile, the Dow Industrials slipped 0.1%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.6%. The IBD 50 outperformed with an 0.3% gain.

  

Volume dropped off sharply across the board from Friday's busy pace. Monday marked the slowest day for the Nasdaq in about a week. Losers beat winners by nearly 5-to-3 on both major exchanges.

  

Monday marked ideal action after the market's robust gains in recent weeks. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have jumped as much as 12.5% and 11%, respectively, from their September lows. Both of the major indexes have cleared multiple layers of resistance in impressive fashion. But now both indexes are in areas where they just chopped around from March to July.

  

Even though there wasn't much action in the main indexes Monday, more top-rated stocks cleared buy points.

  

**Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) blew past a 1,394.10 buy point in hefty volume. It's another old-school Internet name that is acting well. Others are **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)).

  

**LendingTree** ([TREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREE)) broke out from a double-bottom pattern in big volume.

  

Since the S&P 500 put in a follow-through signal Oct. 2, there's been no shortage of breakouts. Stocks such as **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)), **Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)) and **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) are working well. But others such as **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)) haven't done much. Investors need to make the most efficient use of their capital. So if a breakout isn't working, consider selling and using the funds on a stock that is in buy range.

  

This week brings another heavy round of corporate earnings. Apple, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) and **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) are a few of the big guns set to report.

  

The Federal Reserve will also start a two-day meeting Tuesday.

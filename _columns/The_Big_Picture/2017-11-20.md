Small caps outperformed Monday, and blue chips also fared well, ahead of what's expected to be a slow week of trading due to the Thanksgiving holiday.




The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3% as  seven components rallied 0.9% or more. The Russell 2000 fared the best, rising 0.7%, after reclaiming the 50-day moving average last week.


Gains were more muted in the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 at around 0.1%, but the real outperformance was in the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) again, with nearly half the components up 1% or more. The index as a whole rallied 1.3% Monday.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Breadth was positive, with advancers over decliners by 3-to-2 on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


Chip stocks and Chinese names did well again, while health care, restaurant and oil stocks lagged. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures for January delivery eased 0.5% to settle at $56.42 a barrel.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MP112017-176x300.png)Semiconductor stocks outperformed after **Marvell Technology Group** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) sealed a deal to acquire **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) for $6 billion. Cavium is known for its multicore processing, networking communications, storage connectivity and security products. Shares of Cavium jumped nearly 11% to 84.02. Marvell jumped 6% to 21.59.


In related news, **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) received more [positive analyst chatter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/broadcom-gets-price-target-hikes-after-closing-brocade-deal/) after the chipmaker closed its acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems on Friday. Shares of Broadcom rose 1% to 274.87. Earnings are due Dec. 6 after the close.


Broadcom is also trying to buy **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), but Qualcomm says the $105 billion offer, which valued Qualcomm at $70 a share, is too low. Shares of Qualcomm closed Monday at 66.47.


With the market still in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/market-direction/) and leading growth stocks holding their own, it still makes sense to have exposure, but not overly aggressive exposure. The Nasdaq's distribution day count of seven looks high, but remember, none of those days shows a percentage decline worse than 0.6%.


Still, the market landscape is home to plenty of extended stocks at this point. And when it comes to stocks forming bases, the question begs: Will volume be heavy enough at a breakout attempt to fuel a sustained advance? That's a question mark at this point.


As always, let the market be your guide. If the market is serving up heavy-volume breakouts, that's a bullish message that says "buy." But if a stock you're watching is trying to break out in light volume, that's a less convincing message. Keep in mind that volume can be heavy in the morning when a stock breaks out, but fade by the close. That's always the risk with buying morning breakouts.


Dow component **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) held up pretty well despite a downgrade to neutral from buy at Goldman Sachs, which cited valuation concerns. Shares lost 1% early, but the retail leader reversed higher for a fractional gain. Shares of Wal-Mart gapped up to an all-time high Thursday after the company reported earnings and gave a solid holiday outlook.


China stocks outperformed again Monday, a common theme in recent weeks amid an avalanche of strong profit reports from the country.


IBD 50 member **YY Inc**. ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) snapped back after Thursday's downside reversal appeared to cap its latest rally. Shares of the China-based name rose nearly 10% to 117.60 in strong turnover Monday. It's well-extended from an 83.10 buy point.


Shares of **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), meanwhile, rose 1.5% on news it's investing $2.9 billion in [China hypermart operator Sun Art Retail](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-19/alibaba-led-group-agrees-to-buy-sun-art-stake-for-2-9-billion). Hypermarts sell everything from electronics to fresh produce. Alibaba's investment means it's ready to do battle with Wal-Mart in the world's second-largest economy.


**NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), on the other hand, was volatile after two sessions of sharp gains. Shares dropped 6% to 344.07 — poor action after Thursday's breakout over a 320.77 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point. Strong earnings sparked the two-day surge.


Earnings reports to watch this week include **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) Tuesday before the open; **HP** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) Tuesday after the close and **John Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) Wednesday before the open.

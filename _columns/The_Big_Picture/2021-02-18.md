  Stock Market Pares Losses For 2nd Straight Session; Applied Materials Jumps Late On Earnings

Sellers were in the stock market again Thursday, but the session ended up being a carbon copy of Wednesday, with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 paring losses for the second straight session. It's a stock market that's showing signs it wants to go down yet doesn't want to go down — at least not yet.




The Cboe volatility index (VIX) rose again, but it significantly pared gains for the third straight day. The VIX is a popular fear gauge because it tends to spike during periods of extreme market negativity, bearishness and panic.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Small caps took the biggest hit, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) down around 1.5%. But the small-cap index continues to hold above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), a key support level. The Nasdaq composite gave back 0.7%, but that was much better than an intraday loss of 1.8%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials eased around 0.4% each. Nasdaq volume fell. But NYSE volume rose, which gave the S&P 500 a new distribution day.


![MP021821_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP021821_2-231x300.jpg)The stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend with a moderate [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count. The price action in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday and Thursday shows that buyers are still around and indexes could keep grinding higher. But it's important to invest with an edge, and an edge is hard to come by these days. Growth investors have an edge in the early stages of a new uptrend — when the market is serving up new buys on a silver platter — but the market's been running higher for some time now.

Declining stocks on the Nasdaq outnumbered advancers more than 2-to-1. Breadth was worse on the NYSE, with losing stocks topping winners by nearly 5-to-1. Oil and gas stocks lagged badly in the S&P 500.


Stock Market Strength
---------------------


While the case for a stock market pullback has plenty of merit, the Nasdaq is still holding support at the 21-day exponential moving average. It's been a support level ever since the Nasdaq's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) on Nov. 5. The Nasdaq breached the line on Jan. 4 but rallied off lows and closed just above it. It undercut the 21-day line on Jan. 29 but reclaimed the line the very next day.


A convincing break of the 21-day line for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq would open the door for a trip to the 50-day moving average. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing because it would serve to shake out excesses that have built up in the market in recent months.

[Topping action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/) has been discussed recently in high flyers like **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)), **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)), **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) and **EXP World** ([EXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPI)), but the stock market continues to hold up well.


And don't forget about Bitcoin, which has seen its share of euphoria in recent weeks. Cathy Wood, CEO of Ark Invest and manager of the high-flying Ark Innovation ETF ([ARKK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARKK)), said Bitcoin could hit $250,000 if other corporations follow **Tesla**'s ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) lead and add Bitcoin to their balance sheets.


Sound familiar? It should because it brings back memories of the 1,000 price target for **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) just before the Nasdaq topped in 2000.


IBD 50 Gainers
--------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost ground for the third straight day, but it shaved a 2.4% intraday loss to 0.5%. Its weekly loss now stands at 2.6%.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) halted a six-session slide in impressive fashion. Headed into Thursday, it was an orderly, low-volume pullback after the stock gapped up over a 48.30 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


**SciPlay** ([SCPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCPL)) reversed nicely higher off its 10-day moving average, rising nearly 6% to 20.52. After a bullish breakout last week and weekly price gain of 19%, SciPlay hasn't given up any ground this week.


QQQ Movers
----------


The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) touched its 21-day line, but the Nasdaq 100 also rallied off lows and ended near its session high.


**Kraft Heinz** ([KHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KHC)) led the the Nasdaq 100, up 5% to 38.96. Shares topped a 35.30 buy point on Feb. 11 after the company reported strong earnings along with news it's selling its Planters nuts business to **Hormel Foods** ([HRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRL)) for $3.35 billion.


**Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) held up well in the Nasdaq 100, up 1% and 2.5%, respectively. EA stock pulled back to its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) after a breakout over a 143.96 buy point. It's back near highs and in buy range. Meanwhile, it hasn't been a powerful breakout for Atlassian, but selling pressure has been muted and the stock continues to hold near highs after a breakout over a 250.13 buy point.


But **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) lagged in the Nasdaq 100, falling 2%. Leading chip-equipment stocks were weak across the board, with the chip-equipment group down around 3%. After the close, Applied Materials reported fiscal Q1 results and guided Q2 above expectations. Shares were up around 4% in extended trading.


Bullish Sentiment
-----------------


Meanwhile, bullish sentiment among stock market newsletter writers is still elevated. Investors Intelligence on Wednesday showed an increase in bullish sentiment to 59.1% from 58.6% the prior week. It was the third straight reading below 60% after nine straight readings above 60%.


The weekly survey is used as a contrarian indicator because excessively bullish sentiment has been seen at several market tops in the past. The bulls were at 61.5% on Sept. 1 just ahead of a 13% correction in the Nasdaq.

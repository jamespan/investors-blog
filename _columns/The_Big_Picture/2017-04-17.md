  Bulls Take Control To Start Week, But Volume Disappoints; Small Caps Lead

More daunting geopolitical headlines out of North Korea over the long weekend didn't have much effect on the stock market Monday.


Neither did another round of soft economic data as March retail sales, released on Good Friday, missed expectations, while manufacturing data from the New York region, released Monday, also disappointed.


The end result was solid gains in lower volume for the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average. Buyers came into the market with less than one hour left to go in the session, resulting in a close at or near session highs for the indexes.


The Nasdaq composite reclaimed its 50-day moving average, rising 0.9%. The S&P 500 and Dow rose by the same amount, but both indexes are still below their 50-day lines. The Russell 2000 small-cap index outperformed, rising 1.2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP041717.png)It was the Nasdaq's best percentage gain since its 1.4% gain on March 1. The Nasdaq has been trading sideways since then, making it tough for individual growth names to make meaningful headway.


Volume fell from Thursday's levels but picked up the pace late in the session. Breadth was pretty good Monday as advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, winners beat losers by just over 2-to-1. Financials outperformed after recent weakness.


Soft retail sales and a slack reading from the Empire State manufacturing index probably won't sway the Fed much in terms of their overall outlook for the economy, which is why the market shrugged off the data. The Fed expects annual GDP growth in the area of 2% for the next couple of years, slow enough growth to keep inflation in check.


Semiconductor stocks performed mostly in line with the market Monday despite a bearish note from BMO Capital Markets talking about peak valuations in chip stocks. The analyst cited **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) as having the most downside risk.


Ironically, Nvidia was one of the top percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 Monday, rising 4%. It's not near a buy point, though, as it consolidates gains below the 50-day moving average.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) also did well in the Nasdaq 100, helping lift the index to an 0.9% gain.


Netflix rose 3% in strong volume during the regular session and was up more than 1% in after-hours trading as Wall Street weighed its first-quarter earnings report.


Shares of Amazon rose 2% in average volume after Credit Suisse raised its price target to 1,050 from 900. Facebook rallied 1.5% in soft trade after Aegis lifted its target to 160 from 155. Facebook's developer conference kicks off Tuesday in San Jose, Calif.


IBD's market outlook went from confirmed uptrend to uptrend under pressure last month after a bearish session for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on March 21. The change in outlook was a signal for growth investors to take the foot off the accelerator â€” a time to be more defensive.


The market continues to tempt investors with intriguing setups in the growth space, but the question investors must ask now is this: Is there enough buying power left from institutional investors that can provide the fuel for productive breakouts? It's a legitimate question that doesn't offer a clear answer, unfortunately.


A legitimate argument from the bear camp says that eight years into a bull market, there's not much buying power left. The bulls, however, like a fairly dovish Fed and the prospects for a solid first-quarter earnings season.


Bulls also like the fact that indexes continue to show resilience and hold near highs, plus the fact that growth stocks in general continue to act reasonably well.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)) is working on a new base, while **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)) is getting support at the 50-day moving average as it tries to reclaim a 200.63 buy point. Meanwhile, **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) is trading tightly and holding near highs.


**Restaurant Brands** ([QSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QSR)) is working on a flat base with a 58.08 buy point. **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) is also working on a flat base with a 73.18 buy point.

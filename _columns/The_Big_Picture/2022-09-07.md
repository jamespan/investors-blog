Wednesday's action reminded investors of this stark fact: [Stocks today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) aren't the only place where the bears reside.




Amid a broad rebound among major equity indexes, selling in energy assets intensified.


West Texas Intermediate-grade crude oil futures tanked 5.9% to below $82 a barrel. This mauling came despite a decision by OPEC+ members to nominally cut production. Natural gas futures, down 3.8% for the day, closed below $8 for the first time since Aug. 9. Natural gas finished below the 50-day moving average for the first time since July 19.


Put another way, both oil and natural gas are in full-blown bear markets. They trade 37% and 22% off their 52-week highs, respectively.


Are more financial markets spreading the word that a global recession looks more likely?


Bond Sellers Take A Break
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP090722-203x300.jpg)If that's the case, then it helps explain why institutions sought a safe haven in U.S. government bonds. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note dove 7 basis points to 3.26%, Cboe data showed.


If the bond buying persists, watch ProShares UltraShort 20+ Treasury ([TBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBT)) closely. The inverse-designed exchange traded fund slid 3.3% to 28.19. It falls when long-duration bond prices rise, dampening yields.


Another sell-off like Wednesday could send the ETF back near its recent 27.64 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an 11-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/).


Regardless of this activity, count the day's action in stocks today as a win for those betting that inflation will not stay sticky.


The Nasdaq composite and smaller issues led the upside. The former rebounded 2.1%, finally breaking a nasty seven-session selling streak. Over that period, the composite index lopped off 9.2%. The Russell 2000 gained 2.2% Wednesday. Those gains exceeded rallies of 1.8% by the S&P 500 and 1.4% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


At least five components in the 30-stock Dow industrials flexed gains of 4 points or more, including Leaderboard member **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)). **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), subject of a new IBD story on [how to construct a call calendar spread in options](https://www.investors.com/research/options/mcdonalds-stock-dow-jones-leader-why-a-calendar-call-spread-may-net-200/), rose 1.6% and regained its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) in 51% higher than usual turnover.


IBD's restaurant industry group outperformed stocks today, gaining 2.5%.


Meanwhile, volume fell mildly on both main exchanges.


What The Stock Market Needs Now
-------------------------------


If the current rebound truly has legs, expect the major averages to hop back above their own 50-day moving averages. The summer rebound back above this intermediate technical level was successful. But the benefit of hindsight shows that resistance at the longer-term 200-day averages has proved too strong so far this year.


Plus, more stocks need to break out of well-formed bases and refuse to reverse back below their buy points. Such misfortunes have come to new investors in names such as **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), Norway's oil and gas giant **Equinor** ([EQNR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQNR)) and **Vermilion Energy** ([VET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VET)).


Finally, market bulls will want to see big gains such as Wednesday's session repeat, and for declines to diminish in size.


Stocks today need to show more evidence that institutional demand is rising. And further advances may help in reducing the very heavy [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) as noted in the accompanying Market Pulse table.


Stocks Today: The Bigger Picture
--------------------------------


At this point, stocks today seem to paint a tug of war between two parties. On the one hand, you have those who believe the Federal Reserve has little option but to crank up the cost of money in fast and furious fashion in order to regain credibility that it can control inflation.


On the other hand, you have those who point out that the economy still has a chance to avoid a deep recession while getting the cost of goods and services back on track to 2% annual increases in the long run.


Perhaps everyone would agree that the job of the Fed is hardly enviable right now.


Over the weekend, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told Bloomberg TV that he sees the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) around 5%. That is, in his view, you cannot have a jobless rate of under 5% without stoking inflation. Plus, Summers noted it could take a jobless rate of around 6% before the U.S. sees a true slowdown in the ferocious rate of rising wages.


On Friday, the government reported the jobless rate creeping up to 3.7% in August vs. 3.5% in the prior two months. But the Labor Department also revised nonfarm payroll gains downward by 107,000 in the months of June and July.


LPL Economist's Take
--------------------


Meanwhile, the release of the Fed's Beige Book survey of regional activity didn't hurt the afternoon buying spree witnessed in stocks today. Rather, the anecdotal information appeared to convince economists that hikes in short-term interest rates are already helping the cause.


Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at Charlotte, N.C.-based LPL Financial, noted that many Federal Reserve Bank districts saw input costs easing in lumber, copper and steel as supply chains continued to improve. The regional survey also highlighted a rising number of cancellations for new home purchase contracts and easing import prices, courtesy of the strong U.S. dollar.


But Wall Street will likely give a stronger judgment on the inflation conundrum next week. Fresh data on monthly consumer prices arrives on Tuesday, followed by producer-level prices the following day.


"The Fed still has an inflation problem and is committed to front-loading rate hikes as aggressively as possible," Roach said in a note sent to IBD. "The likelihood of a 75 basis point hike later this month could increase if next week's inflation report surprises to the upside."


As of Wednesday, CME data showed the [probability of a three-quarter-point jump in the fed funds rate](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) on Sept. 21 — to a target range of 3%-3.25% — rose to 74%, the highest in least a month.


Bond futures traders also see a high likelihood that the Fed will ratchet rates up another 50 basis points to 3.5%-3.75% during its following meeting on Nov. 2, just six days before the midterm elections.

Bulls Vs. Bears In Stocks Today
-------------------------------


Amid the challenging conditions in stocks today, it's not surprising to see pessimism growing on the Street.


Data accumulated on the major U.S. options exchanges showed a jump in the total put vs. call volume ratio to 1.07 during Tuesday's decline. This means that for every 100 calls traded, 107 bearish puts exchanged hands.


Bullishness among newsletter editors tracked by Investors Intelligence plunged to 29.7% vs. 38.4% the prior week. The 29.7% figure matched the bearish ratio. Many bullish pundits jumped into the 40.6% camp that the market will suffer a correction, mainly in the 10% to 19% range.

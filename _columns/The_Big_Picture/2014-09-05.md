Stock Indexes Reverse Higher, But In Tame Volume
=================================================

Stocks overcame a weak open Friday to finish with decent gains for the day.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 added 0.5% while the Dow Jones industrial average tacked on 0.4%. The IBD 50 rose 0.3%.


Volume fell across the board.


In the morning, an ugly session appeared to be taking shape. The major indexes were down about 0.4% a little more than an hour into the session after a disappointing jobs report. However, the bulls took over from there, pushing the indexes up steadily.


The positive reversal and the high closes in the day's range were bullish signs. Yet the lower volume suggested that institutions weren't fully participating.


While the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, individual investors need to stay somewhat cautious. In the best uptrends, even dart-throwing amateurs can make money. But this is not a climate that makes investing easy.


One area to watch is stocks that gapped up, then did a sideways shuffle.


Consider these five stocks:


Online social platform **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has been consolidating in a shallow base on base since gapping up in July. The stock inched above the pattern Friday, but in tame volume. It cleared a 76.09 entry last week.


Apparel marketer **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) also shows sideways action (with a slight upward bias) since gapping up in July. The stock notched a new high Friday, but in quiet volume.


Software provider **OpenText** ([OTEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTEX)) is showing upward to sideways action since a July gap up. The stock hasn't found much volume since.


**AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)), a drug distributor, has turned its sideways action after a July breakout into a new flat base.


**Polaris Industries** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) gapped up in July and has turned sideways action into a shallow pattern in the 5% buy zone.


These stocks, and a few others like it, are worth watching even if you don't own shares. They could give an early indication of whether this uptrend can go to the next level.


This is an uptrend that changes its tone day to day. In Friday's case, the tone change came in the same session.


**Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) demonstrates the kind of difficulties some leaders are encountering. In early August, the firm had a spot in the Sector Leaders screen, IBD's most rigorous and best-performing screen. Priceline's base was first stage.


The stock cleared a 1292.76 buy point Aug. 4 in heavy volume.


Those who bought Priceline, however, saw the stock rise about 3%, then sag steadily lower. On Friday, Priceline fell 8% below the buy point, triggering a sell rule.


Priceline rebounded a bit Friday after tripping the sell rule, which sometimes happens. The stock, though, should not be bought back unless it retakes the buy point or breaks out from a new base. Right now, Priceline is stuck under its 200-day moving average line.


Steady strength in stocks such as **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) and **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) has offset the weakness in issues such as Priceline and **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) (which gave back everything from a June 12 gap-up open.)


Individual investors who bought the former two are feeling much different about this market than those who bought the latter two.


For the week, the IBD 50 advanced 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.2% and the Nasdaq less than 0.1%.

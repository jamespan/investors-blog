Stocks scored gains Thursday for the fifth time in six sessions as the bulls showed confidence. The Nasdaq popped 1.3%, while the S&P 500 added 0.8%. The IBD 50 advanced 0.9%. Volume in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) rose on the Nasdaq but slipped on the NYSE.

  

The Nasdaq's recent gains include two gap-up days — a 1.5% gush Monday and a 1.3% surge Thursday. Sizable price gains in rising volume point to institutional buying, also known as accumulation.

  

The follow-through-like action was good enough to shift the Market Pulse's outlook to resumed uptrend.

  

If the investment climate has truly changed, then the market can prove it by avoiding its recent frustrations around new highs. The past three new highs in the Nasdaq led to splinter-sized gains followed by pullbacks of 4% to 5%.

  

The Nasdaq made a new closing high Thursday and needs a gain of less than 0.1% to peg a new intraday high.

  

On Thursday, stocks striking new highs in fast trade included home-furnishings provider **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), petroleum refiner and marketer **Tesoro** ([TSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSO)), Midwest banker **PrivateBancorp** ([PVTB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVTB)) and drugstore chain **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)).

  

Each of these companies has something new going for it:

  

•Restoration Hardware will unveil a new modern line this fall.

  

•Tesoro benefits from new industry conditions. Because refiners are buyers of oil, crude oil's price decline since June lowers refiners' costs. The price of oil is about 50% lower than it was at its peak in June 2014. Tesoro's stock soared 77% in the same period.

  

•PrivateBancorp also could benefit from new conditions. When the Federal Reserve begins raising interest rates, banks should get better margins.

  

•Walgreens Boots has set a new cost-cutting goal that could boost profits. The company is also benefiting from the Boots merger completed in December.

  

IBD research indicates that the best stocks have a new factor going for them.

  

Recently, breakouts have had trouble making progress, but that picture could be improving.

  

As of the June 10 close, 10 stocks in the IBD 50 were stuck in the 5% buy zone after breakouts, and six retreated under the buy point after the breakout.

  

As of Thursday's close, four of the 10 stocks stuck in the buy zone had moved above the zone. Two of the six below a recent entry regained the buy point.

The stock market ended moderately lower Thursday, as St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard suggested that the Fed will keep raising rates beyond most expectations to curb inflation.




In other notable action, struggling or failed breakouts include **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), **Phillips 66** ([PSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSX)) and **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)). Meanwhile, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) is holding up well following a breakout.


Economic Data, Fed Comments, Treasury Yields
--------------------------------------------


The Labor Department's initial unemployment claims fell to 222,000 vs. 225,000 in the previous week, meeting estimates and hinting at continued strength in the labor market. Housing starts and preliminary building permits for October came in above estimates, but still slowed compared with September. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index sharply missed estimates, with a reading of -19.4, below expectations for a -7 reading for November.


The Fed's Bullard said rate hikes have had "limited effects" on inflation so far and that more work has to be done. He also said that rates are not yet at a level "that may be considered sufficiently restrictive."


Bullard didn't voice a specific target number, but a [chart accompanying his remarks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-markets-dow-update-11-17-2022-11668687278) suggested the Fed's policy rate could reach a range of 5% to 7%. This month, the Fed raised its target rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%.


Investors now place an 80% probability of a 50-basis-point rate hike at December's Fed meeting, down from an 85% chance a week ago, according to the [CME FedWatch Tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html)


The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 3.77% Thursday, recovering a part of this week's slide.

Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP111722-265x300.jpg)On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite cut losses to 0.4%, finding support at its 50-day line. Lastly, the small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.8%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, and also appeared to be slightly lower on the NYSE. That means the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both avoid new [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The distribution-day count remains light, with one day of institutional selling on each index.


So far, the market pullback should be considered normal, as the major stock indexes take a necessary breather to consolidate recent gains. The last two days of losses haven't done anything to disrupt the current stock market uptrend.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) moved up 0.2% Thursday, but is still finding resistance around its 50-day line this week. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), energy leaders struggled as U.S. oil prices fell sharply. **APA** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)) dropped 1%, **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) lost 0.5%, and **Cenovus Energy** ([CVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVE)) declined nearly 2%.

Breakout Stocks To Watch: GlobalFoundries, Mobileye, Phillips 66
----------------------------------------------------------------


GlobalFoundries, MercadoLibre, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Mobileye, Phillips 66 and Shift4 Payments all staged breakouts in recent sessions. But the breakouts are under pressure, and three of those growth stocks have triggered sell rules.


Chip foundry GlobalFoundries is trading just above a 66.06 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a cup base following Wednesday's slide and Thursday's 3.7% upside reversal. Along with strong volume on the breakout day, the stock's [RS line is at an eight-month high](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). Both are signs of strong institutional demand.


MercadoLibre slid 4.7% Thursday, hitting the [7%-8% loss trigger](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) below a 1,018.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


[IPO Leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stock-of-the-week-new-issue-mobileye-approaches-first-buy-point/) Mobileye briefly fell more than 8% below an IPO base's 29.96 buy point Thursday, which would trigger the 7%-8% loss-cutting rule. But shares shrugged off those early losses to move up 0.7%. Remember, it is best to utilize smaller position sizes with IPOs to help offset their increased volatility.


Energy leader Phillips 66 reversed from solid losses to move up 1.9% Thursday. Despite the session's gains, the stock is below its cup with handle's 110.08 buy point.


Shift4 Payments hit the [7%-8% loss rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) Thursday from a 51.52 buy point, causing IBD Leaderboard to cut its position in half. For now, shares are holding above their 50- and 200-day lines.



ULTA Breakout Holds Up In Stock Market Pullback
-----------------------------------------------


Ulta Beauty found support around its [426.99 buy point in a cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/ulta-beauty-in-demand-among-the-best-mutual-funds-as-ulta-stock-enters-buy-zone/) Thursday, cutting losses to just 0.2%, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Ulta shares broke out last week, but volume has been mostly lackluster, so that's a factor to watch over the coming sessions. The 5% buy area goes up to 448.34.


Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Ulta stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-ulta-beauty-ulta.aspx) shows a 94 out of a 99 IBD Composite Rating.Â Headquartered in Illinois, Ulta Beauty is the largest beauty retailer in the U.S.

Stock Market Resilient Despite Weakness In Health Care, Software Stocks
========================================================================

Major stock indexes kept to a tight trading range Wednesday and ended with small losses, but the session delivered plenty of big movers in the stock market today.




Health care stocks lagged badly for the second straight session. Inside the Dow, **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) took hits. Merck and Pfizer shareholders are worried about legislation to rein in drug prices. UnitedHealth CEO David Wichmann said on Tuesday that proposals like a single-payer system like Medicare for All would destabilize the nation's health system.


Health Care Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) slumped nearly 3% after falling 2% Tuesday.


Stock Market Today: Software Stocks Nailed Again
------------------------------------------------


Leading software stocks faced another round of selling, with [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) names like **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) down at least 4%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP__041719-220x300.jpg)Don't give up on leading software stocks yet, though. In the security software group, for example, **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) are still holding above buy points. **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) continues to hold near highs, and Zscaler could be poised for a first test of the 10-week moving average.


Despite the selling in heath care and software stocks, the stock market overall held up relatively well.


Major Stock Indexes Ease
------------------------


The S&P 500 eased 0.2%, with the Dow Jones industrials and Nasdaq composite down less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq 100 outperformed with a gain of nearly 0.4%, but the index closed in the bottom half of the day's range after touching an all-time high. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE, chalking up another mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500.


The real damage was in the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which fell nearly 1%. Growth stocks also lagged, with Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) down 0.9%.


Two more distribution days fell off the Nasdaq's count. The Nasdaq has rallied nicely from the March 22 distribution day and March 27 distribution day, making them no longer relevant.


What To Do Now
--------------


Take a look at current holdings and decide which stocks have the best potential to be big stock market leaders. For these stocks, be as patient as possible and wait to see what a first test of the 50-day or 10-week moving average looks like. Strong stocks will often pull back and find support before resuming their advance.


And avoid giving too much room to holdings that just aren't performing well. If a recent breakout is struggling to make headway, don't be afraid to cut the stock loose to free up some cash.


Transports Lead Stock Market
----------------------------


In other [stock market news](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), the Dow Jones Transportation index picked up 1%, helped by strength in railroad and airline stocks. **CSX Corp**. ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) jumped 4% to 78.94 after reporting earnings late Tuesday. Headed into Wednesday, it was still inside the 5% buy zone from the 74.49 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It's slightly extended now.


Group peer **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)) reported earnings before the open. Shares rose 4% to 122.81. It's extended past an earlier entry of 111.19.


**United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) gapped up [on strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/united-airlines-stock-earnings-q1-2019-boeing-737-max-airline-stocks/). It broke out over a trend line, rising nearly 5% to 89.24, but it still has a double-bottom buy point at 91.03 to conquer. It got resistance there in late February.


Qualcomm A Bright Spot
----------------------


Another big day for **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) helped lift the Philadelphia Semiconductor index to a gain of 1.6%.


Late Tuesday, Qualcomm and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) settled their lengthy [patent dispute](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-qualcomm-stock-rise-legal-settlement/). After Qualcomm soared 23% Tuesday, shares were up another 12% Wednesday. Apple, meanwhile, is still in buy range after a low-volume breakout from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The buy point was 197.79.


Shares of **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) jumped 3%. As a result of the Qualcomm/Apple accord, Intel is shuttering its wireless chip business. Intel has made nice progress after a breakout over a 54.20 buy point.


China News
----------


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) was a nice gainer, up 3.5%. It cleared a 111.70 handle entry with conviction early in the session, but backed off. Autohome is a [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock.


Sentiment was generally positive around Chinese stocks after China's GDP growth for Q1 came in at 6.4%, slightly better than expected. Industrial production jumped 8.5% in March, also better than expected.


But Germany on Wednesday cut its 2019 GDP forecast again. It now sees growth of 0.5%, down from a 1% forecast in January.

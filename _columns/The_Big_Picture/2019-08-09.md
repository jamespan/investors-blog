title: Stock Indexes Play A Now Familiar Game: Beware The Trump

Stock indexes repeated an old pattern last week, a pattern that began about 18 months ago. Markets try to rise but then sag on trade-war news.




On Friday, the Nasdaq chalked up a 1% loss. The S&P 500 carved off 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed 0.3%. Volume fell on both major exchanges.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq got turned away near their 50-day moving averages Friday, stopping the market's three-day rebound. In a positive sign, both indexes pared sharp losses from earlier in the week. The S&P 500 was down as much as 3.8% for the week, but ended just 0.5% lower. The Nasdaq erased nearly all of a 4.3% plunge with a 0.6% weekly loss.


A bit of history might be useful for understanding the current stock market.


The trade war began quietly Jan. 23, 2018, when President Trump slapped tariffs on solar parts and washing machines.

But as time went on the stakes increased. Trump expanded his tariff targets to include at various times, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and his main nemesis, China.


The first three are pretty much done deals. China, though, has proved to be a harder fire to put out.


Stock Indexes And The News
--------------------------


Reversals on trade news have become routine. Thursday and Friday fell into that category.


On Thursday, the stock market scored big gains, though in quiet volume. The South China Post reported that the U.S.-China talks in September were still on track.


On Friday, Trump announced he was in no hurry to reach a trade deal. He added that the U.S. is not going to do business with China's tech giant Huawei. Trump also said the September negotiations could be canceled.


The losses Friday dashed hopes for more bullish action, as there was on Tuesday through Thursday.


Tariffs have put a lid on the stock market. The S&P 500 is only 2.9% above the tariff war's start from a year and a half ago.


Rules For The Current Stock Market
----------------------------------


There's no signal so far that the market's correction has ended. What should an investor do under these circumstances?


If an investor is sitting on a nice profit cushion, then holding a stock is prudent.


If the stock is under the break-even line, lightening up makes sense. The market after all is in correction.


Other IBD sell rules are always in effect: Cut all losses at 7% to 8%. Sell for a small profit if a stock threatens to erase all of its gains. Take profits when a profit reaches 20% to 25%.


When an investor takes a profit, he or she should sell a weak stock at the same time. Otherwise, the portfolio could become a collection of losers.


Reject The Temptation
---------------------


In the meantime, reject the temptation to invest according to the latest turn in the news — especially if the news isn't really new.


The U.S. and China are playing a high-stakes game. It's impossible to know how that will end.

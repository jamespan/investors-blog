Nasdaq Leads Stock Market Rally; Stocks To Watch Are ServiceNow, Veeva Systems
===============================================================================

The major stock indexes ended with strong gains Friday, as the stock market rally attempt continues. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, led by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), advanced 2.3%.




The S&P 500 rose 1.6%, while the Dow Jones industrials followed with a 1.3% rise. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 1.6%.


Leading growth stocks also rallied, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) moved up 2.1%. In the IBD 50, **Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) advanced 3.9% and 4.3%, respectively. Both stocks are holding above their 50-day moving averages in the face of a weak stock market environment.


Volume was squarely lower on the Nasdaq, and was indicated sharply lower on the NYSE vs. Thursday's session.


Stock Market Rally Attempt Continues
------------------------------------


![MP092520](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP092520.jpg)Despite this week's shift into [market correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-another-hit-apple-amazon-netflix-slump/), the Nasdaq continues its rally attempt after the "pink rally day" on Sept. 21. Make sure to brush up on your [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) rules, since one could occur any day.


Essentially, look for a big percentage gain in higher volume than the previous session. Friday's session had the requisite gain, but the higher-volume element was missing. That indicates that institutional investors were reluctant buyers.


A follow-through day should convey power, highlighted by a number of breakouts among stock market leaders. For now, buying opportunities are scarce, indicating that the stock market may still need a few weeks for chart breakouts to emerge.

What To Do Now
--------------


With the stock market in a correction, investors should be holding off on new purchases, but don't tune out from the daily stock market action. A follow-through day, signaling the beginning of a new potential uptrend, can occur anytime.


For now, build a watchlist of stocks that are holding up the best during the current stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with [strong relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). These stock ideas could become stock market leaders.


Use [MarketSmith features](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) like the RS Line Blue Dot to easily spot such stock candidates. The [RS Line Blue Dot](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) is assigned to stocks whose RS lines are making new highs while the stock is basing or breaking out.


If there is a follow-through day in the near future, be disciplined and methodical about buying stocks. Don't just buy any stock; make sure it has the requisite fundamental and technical strengths. The IBD Stock Checkup can help you easily gauge a company's strengths and weaknesses.



Stocks To Watch: ServiceNow, Veeva Systems

Amid the current stock market weakness, software leaders **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) are displaying tremendous strength. Both show best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).

Both software stocks have [RS lines at new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/), indicating that they are sharply outperforming the S&P 500 during this period of weakness.

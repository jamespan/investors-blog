U.S. stock indexes added slim gains Thursday on the eve of the market's last session of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%, while the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 each rose 0.2%.




 Volume was lower on the Nasdaq, and a pinch higher on the NYSE.


With the Nasdaq up 29% for the year, the Dow Jones industrial average up 26% and the S&P 500 up 20%, funds apparently were content to sit tight.


Neither sellers nor buyers were evident in Thursday's session.


Halfhearted Breakouts
---------------------


Breakouts Thursday had a halfhearted quality, either due to the price-and-volume action or due to iffy fundamentals.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MP122817-266x300.png)Business software developer **OpenText** ([OTEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTEX)) zoomed 8% higher in the first 10 minutes of trade and then sketched some L-shaped action â€” a down move followed by sideways action. The stock closed with a 7% gain. Fundamentals comprise the drawback for OpenText. The stock has a [Composite Rating](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 76, which means 24% of the stocks in IBD's database are rated higher.


The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.


**Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) rose about 1% in volume 56% above average. The stock marked its high for the day in the first few minutes of trade and then zigzagged the rest of the session. Constellation cleared a 227.30 [buy point](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) in a shallow pattern.


Constellation has a Composite Rating of 93.


The Marijuana Play
------------------


Constellation Brands may have received additional thrust from California's approaching legalization of recreational marijuana, which takes effect Jan. 1.


In October, Constellation agreed to buy an almost 10% stake in Canopy Growth, a medical marijuana company in Canada. Canopy rose 5% Friday, 20% Wednesday and 9% Thursday. (Canada's stock market was closed Monday and Tuesday for the Christmas and Boxing Day holidays.) Canopy broke out of a short consolidation Friday, clearing a 21.82 buy point in strong volume.


Constellation isn't alone in looking to the marijuana market. Analysts expect tobacco companies and biotechs to either develop or expand existing ties to the marijuana industry now that it nears legalization in California.


Because of the low barrier to entry, analysts do not expect much profit from marijuana as a commodity. Companies that can create designer brands could be a different story.


One way for investors to participate is through the AdvisorShares Vice ETF ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), a Dec. 12 initial public offering. The exchange-traded fund has exposure to tobacco, alcohol and to a lesser extent marijuana.


Nine Blue Chips Ready To Break Out
----------------------------------


For the broader market, charts are showing good action, especially in light of how long the current uptrend has been running. In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average alone, [nine stocks are consolidating and aren't far from buy points](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/indexes-calm-but-9-dow-stocks-could-be-ready-to-break-out/).


Three of the nine are expected to deliver solid earnings growth in 2018. The Street expects **DowDuPont** ([DWDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DWDP)) to grow earnings 25% in 2018; **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) to post 24% growth in fiscal '18 ending in September; and **ExxonMobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), 16%.


Economic news
-------------


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 245,000, about 2% higher than the consensus view.


The Chicago purchasing managers gauge for December chalked up a 67.6 reading, 8% better than expected. Readings above 50 point to economic growth.


Friday is expected to be a slow day for financial news. At 1 p.m. ET, Baker-Hughes oil rig count.

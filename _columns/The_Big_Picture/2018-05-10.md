title: Stock Market Cruises To Good Gains, As Worries Recede

U.S. stock indexes sailed ahead smoothly Thursday as they extended a rebound and two worries moved to the background.




The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 advanced 0.9% each. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, but the small-cap Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.5% pop.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


The Nasdaq closed above its 50-day line for a fifth consecutive session, while the S&P 500 did so in the past two sessions.


Both indexes are now above their April highs.


Overall, the bullish action was enough to lift IBD's market outlook back to a confirmed uptrend. Because the market never went into correction status, the distribution days are not wiped out.

The stock market got some help Thursday from the calm surrounding trade.


News related to China tariffs and trimming Dodd-Frank faded recently from being front-page concerns.


On Thursday, Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration extended public hearings on proposed tariffs on Chinese goods. The hearings, followed by a public comment period, could push the implementation of tariffs to early June.


Meanwhile, the Senate bill to amend the Dodd-Frank law now appears likely to pass in the House.


How many of the [27,000 regulations](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/dodd-frank-one-biggest-regulatory-events-ever) in Dodd-Frank will be axed isn't clear. But the stock market would probably be happy with just knowing. Uncertainty makes it difficult to price that factor into the stock market.


Gains Accelerate
----------------


With no compelling reason for the market to go south Thursday, the stock market apparently decided that was a good enough reason to head north.

CLOSE




The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 opened with gains of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, and then grew the gains through most of the session. The Nasdaq's March 24 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) was deleted because of the index's gains since then.


If the market received help earlier this week from oil stocks rising with the price of light sweet crude, it needed no help Thursday. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, gainers led losers by an 11-2 ratio.


Quality Breakouts
-----------------


Breakouts picked up the pace Thursday.


Stocks clearing buy points in strong volume included debit-card provider **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)), up 14%; **Carrizo Oil & Gas** ([CRZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRZO)), up 4%; and tech outsourcer **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), up 3%.


Two stocks broke out but then retreated to close under the buy point. They were telecom infrastructure play **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)), up 11%; and work management software developer **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)), up 8%.


Each of the above five stocks has a Composite Rating of 92 or higher. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 92 means the stock is in the top 8% of all the stocks in IBD's database.


With the market back in an uptrend, stocks can be bought with more confidence.


Individual investors, though, should closely watch the 50-day lines that the indexes recently retook. Bulls would like to see the 50-day areas serve as support rather than resistance.


If the indexes stay above the 50-day lines, the next natural test would come at the 7500 level for the Nasdaq and the 2800 level for the S&P 500. Indexes have bounced sharply over the past five days, so a minor pullback would be normal.

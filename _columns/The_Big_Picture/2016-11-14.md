Stocks kicked off the week right where they left off last week: Small caps soared again, financial stocks outperformed and the quartet of so-called FANG stocks faced more selling pressure.


The Dow Jones industrial average held up the best, rising 0.1%, thanks to strength in **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)). The S&P 500 fell fractionally and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.4%. Volume on the Nasdaq rose slightly from Friday's levels, giving the Nasdaq a mild distribution day.


![mp_9_111416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP_9_111416.png)After soaring 10% last week, the Russell 2000 extended gains, rising 1.3%. The Nasdaq 100 lagged, falling 1%, as FANG stocks **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) showed losses ranging from 1% to 3%. Netflix eased 1% as it continued to work on a cup-with-handle base with a 129.39 buy point.


The 10-year Treasury yield jumped 11 basis points to 2.26% as of 5 p.m. ET. About a month ago, the 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 1.75%. The torrid rise in interest rates has raised the odds of a rate hike at the Dec. 14 Fed meeting. Futures traders now think there's an 85% chance of a quarter-point hike.


Keep in mind, though, that rising interest rates aren't necessarily a bad thing. In the past, they've gone hand-in-hand with an improving economy. The front-page story in the latest IBD Weekly raised the question: "[Will Trump Unleash A New Bull Market?](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-win-stocks-rise-new-bull-market/)" As the piece pointed out, there's market precedent that says it's a distinct possibility.


Financials picked up where they left off last week, making more gains. It's been an explosive move higher for [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) financials like **Sterling Bancorp** ([STL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STL)), **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) and **East West Bancorp** ([EWBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWBC)) in the past few days as the market adjusts to Donald Trump's presidential win. But these names, as well as other beneficiaries of a Trump win, like infrastructure and construction plays, have quickly become extended.


The current situation probably has many investors in a quandary. A rotation is clearly going on, but the names that money has rotated into have quickly become extended. A name like **Aecom Technology** ([ACM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACM)) might look interesting because it's still in buy range from a 36.30 buy point, but buying a straight-up-off-the-bottom move like this is risky. For now, investors should be patient and be careful not to chase. If the recently resumed uptrend is for real, new opportunities will present themselves.

Retail-related industry groups were among the day's top performers as Wall Street bets on improved economic growth ahead.
In the retail sector, **e.l.f. Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) extended gains on the heels of its earnings report last week. Shares jumped 9% to 29.37. It's still in buy range from a 29.02 buy point.


Headed into Monday's session, small-cap **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) was in buy range from a 30.12 cup-with-handle point, but shares jumped 5% to 32.37 Monday ahead of its earnings report after the close. The company smashed estimates after the close and shares jumped 5% in after-hours trading.


Other retail stocks on the move Monday included **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)), featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/dicks-sporting-goods-gap-ross-lead-busy-week-of-retail-earnings/) column. Dick's popped briefly above a 62.04 buy point early in the session but gains faded. The stock still rose 2% but ended the below the buy point. Earnings are due Tuesday before the open.

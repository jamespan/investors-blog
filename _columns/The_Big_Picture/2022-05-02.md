  Stock Market Reverses Higher But Fed Looms Large As Investors Seek Clues

After a brutal April, the month of May started with a bullish reversal as bargain hunters came into the stock market late Monday afternoon. What happens next could depend on the Federal Reserve. The benchmark Treasury yield hit 3%.




The Nasdaq composite sank as much as 1.1% to a December 2020 low, but began rebounding at 2:45 p.m. ET. The index closed 1.6% higher and at session highs.


The S&P 500 slid 1.7% Monday but closed 0.5% higher after the late rally. The index undercut this year's low of 4114, and that's now a significant level to watch for a possible low.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.3% higher after nearly falling to its 2022 low of 32,272. Buyers also embraced small caps, as the Russell 2000 rose 1%.


While the bullish market reversal gives the month a good start, remember that indexes have made similar moves multiple times in past months, only to dissolve into more declines. Bulls applauded Nasdaq reversals on April 19, April 25 and Thursday's 3.1% surge. Yet, none of those days proved to be a bottom.


Stock Market Losses Worst Since 2020 Bear Market
------------------------------------------------


It's not necessarily surprising to find some bottom fishing happen after weeks of intense selling. The S&P 500 tumbled 8.8% in April, the largest one-month decline since March 2020, in the middle of the pandemic bear market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP050222-273x300.jpg)The Nasdaq sold off 13.3% in April in the largest monthly decline since October 2008, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It was the worst April since 2000, in the early months of the dot-com bust. The Nasdaq's four-week losing streak is now the worst since April, 2020.


Against that backdrop, the stock market this week faces a Federal Reserve meeting in which a half-point interest-rate hike is all but assured. The larger question after the Tuesday-Wednesday meeting will be [how aggressively the Fed plans to unwind](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-will-peak-hawkishness-spark-dow-jones-relief-rally/) its massive balance sheet.


In an emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fed bought Treasury and mortgage securities to keep borrowing costs low, a program that now totals some $9 trillion. Fed officials have indicated they may allow [up to $95 billion in securities to mature every month](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-signals-half-percentage-point-increases-could-be-warranted-at-coming-meetings-11649268002?mod=article_inline) without replacement.


It would be an aggressive policy that has already rattled the bond market. On Monday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed 11 basis points to close at 2.99% and topped 3% earlier in the day. Year to date, the yield has climbed almost 1.5 percentage points.


Earnings Also In Focus This Week
--------------------------------


The Fed's message and Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks after the decision could influence the market for days to come.


Meanwhile, the stock market has many more [earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) to watch.


Bellwether companies such as **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)), **Hilton** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Shell** ([SHEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHEL)) and **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) report this week.


Late Monday, **Expedia Group** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) shares rose after the company reported a narrower quarterly loss and an 81% rise in revenue; total bookings jumped 58% from a year ago. The stock is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 204.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).



Another big question for the stock market is its leadership. The old leadership that rested so heavily on [FAANG stocks and other big techs is largely demolished](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-the-fang-stock-crash-is-costing-you-trillion-and-counting/). **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is off more than 20% from prior highs. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) has lost more than 40% its value. **Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) have suffered outright crashes.


Where Will Stock Market Leadership Come From?
---------------------------------------------


Where is the new leadership going to come from? It's unclear for now.


Leading fertilizer stocks are testing support levels with key earnings this week. Steelmakers have cooled after racing to new highs in April. Shipping stocks started to roll over a month ago. The mining, defense and utility industry groups also sold off in April.


Real estate investment trusts — defensive investments that in some cases provide an inflation hedge — are the latest market leaders to come apart. **Prologis** ([PLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLD)), **Rexford Industrial Realty** ([REXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REXR)), **Life Storage** ([LSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSI)), **Public Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)) and **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)) came under heavy selling the past couple of days.

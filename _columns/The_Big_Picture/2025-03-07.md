Indexes ended a wild session in positive territory Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell turned stock market whisperer. New consumer inflation data and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) earnings are due for the week ahead.


The Nasdaq composite swashbuckled its way out of deeply negative territory to post a daily lift of 0.7%. Nevertheless, it remains stuck below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and its 200-day line after diving 3.5% for the week. The tech-heavy index now has a painful loss of 5.8% so far in 2025.




The S&P 500 also enjoyed a Lazarus-like resurrection as it gained 0.6% Friday. It managed to end the session back above its 200-day average, but sits 3.5% beneath its 50-day line. The benchmark index is benefiting from its relatively smaller exposure to technology, but is still down 1.9% year-to-date.


Advancers managed to edge out decliners by a slim margin on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on both exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped roughly 223 points to end Friday up 0.5%. It too remains stuck between its 50-day and 200-day lines after skidding 2.4% for the week, but its yearly gain of 0.6% gives it bragging rights. **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) fared best here while **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) lagged.


Bears Maul Growth Stocks
------------------------


Small caps also squeezed out gains, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.4% Friday. It ends the week further below its 200-day line due to its weekly decline of just over 4%. The bears continued to spank growth stocks, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund falling 0.9% Friday and suffering an eye-watering weekly decline of 7.4%.


While Friday's bounce was encouraging, the stock market remains a long way off recent highs. The clock also has been reset for a rally attempt, which means Wednesday is now the earliest opportunity for a follow-through day.


With IBD still recommending exposure at the 0%-to-20% level, now is the time to concentrate on building up a robust watchlist for the start of the next market uptrend.


Stock Market Rebounds After Powell
----------------------------------


Stocks initially opened higher following the latest U.S. jobs report. The U.S. economy added 151,000 nonfarm payrolls in February, lower than the 160,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, slightly higher than views for it to hold at 4%. Then negative sentiment then took hold and it looked like more losses were in the cards.

But Fed Chair Powell played the role of stock market whisperer after he struck a reassuringly calm tone at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum. He gave a virtuoso performance, insisting the economy remains "in good shape" despite recent volatility.


"We are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves," he said.


Powell also insisted the central bank remains "well positioned to wait for greater clarity" amid worries over President Donald Trump's trade tariff agenda.


Inflation will be front and center on the economic agenda in the week ahead, with consumer price index data for February set to drop Wednesday. A new producer price index report is due the following day. Other data points include job openings on Tuesday and the preliminary consumer sentiment reading for March on Friday.


While earnings season is drawing to a close, a few [noteworthy reports loom in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/oracle-stock-cruise-line-viking-earnings/). **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) are all due. A number of retailers also are set to post results, including **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)).


Costco Earnings Hit This Stock Market Group
-------------------------------------------


A majority of [the S&P 500 sectors ended Friday higher](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Utilities and energy stocks fared best while financials and consumer staples lagged.



But a more nuanced view of the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) could be purloined by studying the relative performance of the 197 IBD industry groups.Â Drug stores, office supply retailers, oil-and-gas royalty trusts, solar stocks and educational software companies were among the best performers.


By contrast, mail order stocks, diversified medical plays, home furnishings retailers, cement companies and airlines were among the worst laggards.


It was the discount retail group, however, that was the biggest underperformer Friday. It was hit hard after **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) plunged more than 6% after missing earnings views.


Costco flashed a sell signal by undercutting its 50-day moving average. But shares managed to avoid falling more than 7% below a 1008.25 entry.

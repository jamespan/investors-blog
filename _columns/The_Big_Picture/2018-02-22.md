Stocks Sag To Weak Closes Again; These 2 Big Caps Did OK
=========================================================

U.S. stock indexes Thursday continued a recent trend of strong starts and weak finishes, a classic characteristic of a weakening market.




 The Nasdaq closed with a 0.1% loss after being up almost 1% earlier in the session, while the S&P 500 trimmed its gain to 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average  looked stronger, rising 0.7%. But the Dow was up 1.4% earlier in the day.


The small-cap Russell 2000 slipped 0.1%.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and, according to preliminary data, also on the NYSE.


The action did not constitute either stalling or [distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) despite the ugly finishes.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP022218-230x300.png)Thursday was the fourth session in a row that the indexes reversed off intraday highs to close low in the day's range. While that's no reason to panic, it might make the bulls justifiably nervous.


The confirmed market uptrend remains intact, but the weak closes can't continue without eventually graduating to greater harm.


Another area of concern is the [50-day moving average](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). While the Nasdaq has a thin cushion above the line, the S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and small-cap Russell 2000 are meeting some resistance at their 50-day lines.


Breakouts and attempted breakouts occurred Thursday but many were among stocks on the thinly traded side.


Breakouts Thursday
------------------


They included: medical software firm **Mindbody** ([MB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MB)), up almost 7%; debit card provider **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)), up 10%; customer contact software maker **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)), up more than 12%; restaurant chain **Bloomin' Brands** ([BLMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLMN)), up 8%; educator **Grand Canyon Education** ([LOPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOPE)), up 8%; **FTI Consulting** ([FCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCN)), up 9%; Colombian bank **Bancolombia** ([CIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIB)), up 2% (though it closed below its entry); biotech **ChemoCentryx** ([CCXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCXI)), up 6%; and marketing services provider **Quad/Graphics** ([QUAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QUAD)), up 6%.


Two Big Stocks That Did OK
--------------------------


Among larger stocks, **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) showed constructive action on a hardscrabble day. The stock advanced 0.4% in volume 50% above average. The megacap closed high in the day's range and is only 2% off its high.


Mastercard is No. 1 in its group in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-mastercard-inc-cl-a-ma.aspx) at Investors.com.


Another stock showing some grit was electric vehicle maker **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). The big-cap stock rose 4% in volume 18% above average, retaking its 200-day line. Tesla reclaimed its 50-day line in mid-February.

Economic Data
-------------


Economic reports were bullish, but the market didn't seem to care.


First-time jobless claims were nearly the lowest in 45 years. The reading of 222,000 was lower than the lowest estimate in the range, which was 227,000. The data underlined the strength of the U.S. economy.


The Kansas City Fed's manufacturing reading came in at 17 vs. the consensus estimate for 16. Readings above zero point to growth.


Leading indicators rolled in at 1%, topping the consensus view for 0.6%


Coming Up
---------


Friday will be a quiet day for economic reports. The chief item will be the Baker-Hughes oil rig count, which will be released at 1 p.m. ET.

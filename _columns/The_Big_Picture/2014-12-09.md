Stocks Trim Losses As Nasdaq Paces Upside
==========================================

The stock market showed that it's not ready to roll over just yet, as it bounced back from sharp losses Tuesday.


What started out as a panic in early trading became a bullish reversal for the major indexes.


Recent reports showing weakness in the economies of China and Japan shook Wall Street at the open. It was a chilly start to trading, coming on the heels of Monday's rout.


The Nasdaq was down as much as 1.4%, but it started rebounding and closed with a gain of 0.5%, reclaiming much of Monday's loss.


The S&P 500 couldn't quite muster a win. It closed fractionally lower after erasing an early loss of 1.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average lagged with a 0.3% loss, although it too pared most of its decline.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.


Advancing stocks led decliners by a 3-2 ratio on the NYSE. Breadth was even more bullish on the Nasdaq, where winners more than doubled the losers.


With buyers holding the upper hand, Tuesday wound up being nothing more than a shakeout. Such tremors can help wash out weak holders and keep stocks in firmer hands.


Despite the favorable result Tuesday, the market is still looking fatigued. It also didn't cure the biggest frustration for growth investors â€” that many leading stocks haven't risen much from buy points and are lagging the major indexes.


The Nasdaq undercut its Dec. 1 low, and it would be important for the index to top the Nov. 28 peak to keep its uptrend going.


Many leading stocks also reversed higher, although a couple came out with significant damage.


**Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) plunged 13% in heavy trading and fell as much as 5% below a 74.10 buy point. The company warned about its margins and noted that some airlines seem to be taking advantage of lower fuel costs to cut fares.


Airline stocks were one of the biggest losers Tuesday.


Pharmaceutical company **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) slid 10% in heavy volume. The stock fell below the 50-day moving average and closed nearly 8% below a 46.84 buy point.


The IBD 50 gained 0.2%, dragged in part by Spirit's sell-off. It drew strength from semiconductor, financial and retail components.


Auto stores rallied after **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) beat quarterly expectations thanks to falling gasoline prices and good weather. The stock leapt 4% to a new high. **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) (a member of the IBD 50) and car dealer **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN))made strides as well.


Several restaurant stocks also were favored. Even the maligned energy sector got a respite as crude prices bounced a bit.


New issue **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is testing the patience of shareholders. The stock had soared from the 99.80 buy point of an IPO base but has been melting its gains. It came close to erasing the entire 22% profit Tuesday morning.


Alibaba was on the brink of a sell signal that would have triggered a "round tripped" back to the entry.


But just as the stock touched the 50-day line, institutions stepped in to support the stock. The Chinese e-commerce giant closed with a gain of 2% and a chance to resume its advance.

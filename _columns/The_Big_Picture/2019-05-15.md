  Stock Market Rallies Again, But Bulls Have Plenty Of Questions

Stocks rallied again Wednesday, but not enough to put the stock market back in a confirmed uptrend.




The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 1.1% for the second straight session, as software stocks and semiconductor stocks outperformed. The S&P 500 picked up 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrials added nearly 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday's levels.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) picked up close to 0.9%, helped by strength in software stocks like **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)). Will software stocks continue to lead the stock market? With many still holding near highs and showing relative strength, it's certainly not out of the question. The sector is still home to plenty of bullish charts.


Soft April Retail Sales
-----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP051519-274x300.jpg)Sentiment was negative early after the Commerce Department reported a 0.2% decline in April retail sales, below expectations for 0.2% growth, and down sharply from March's 1.6% gain. Excluding autos, sales edged up 0.1%, well below forecasts for a 0.7% gain.


The weak data hit the retail sector and fueled more bond inflows. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 4 basis points to 2.37%, hurting the cause of financial stocks. SPDR Financial ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) eased 0.4% to 26.79 as it probes support near 26.50.


The 10-year yield isn't far from its low of 2.356% set on March 27. The last time it was that low was all the way back in December 2017. The bond market is clearly worried about a slowdown for the U.S. economy. The stock market is ambiguous.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


Are new highs right around the corner for the major stock indexes?


No doubt the bulls like the look of two straight strong percentage gains for the Nasdaq composite. Sentiment turned positive after CNBC reported that President Donald Trump plans to delay auto tariffs by six months as trade negotiations with China continue. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday he expects to travel to China "in the near future" to continue trade talks.


The Dow Jones is making an early stand at its 200-day moving average, but the technical pictures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still questionable, with both indexes still below their 50-day lines. In addition, the Russell 2000 small-cap index is still entrenched below its converged 50- and 200-day lines.


Since hitting a high of 8176 in late April, [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/)Â haven't been hard to see in the Nasdaq's daily chart, with three of them between May 2 and May 9. The fourth was on Monday, the day the market outlook was changed in the Market Pulse to "market in correction."


New buys should generally be avoided when the market's in a correction, but growth investors need to be ready to act quickly if conditions turn bullish again. There are too many good setups out there to ignore.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Is a breakout nigh for **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) stock?


Facebook led a FANG rally Wednesday, up 3% to 186.27 in average turnover. It came close to a test of its 50-day moving average Tuesday as it works on a cup-with-handle base with a 198.58 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) jumped above its 200-day moving average, helped by a price target hike by Deutsche Bank, but it's still damaged goods after shares gapped down April 30 on earnings.


The stock market is in a correction, but growth investors also realize that there's no shortage of growth stocks holding up well.


Outside of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), software leader **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) is getting support at its 50-day moving average. It's working on a base with a 154.90 entry. Meanwhile, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) is still inside the 5% buy zone after a breakout from a cup base with a 73.04 buy point.



Semiconductor stocks also outperformed Wednesday. After giving up its 50-day moving average Monday, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 0.8% Wednesday, but it's still below its 50-day line. One leader to watch in the chip space is **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)). It's getting support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/add-trading-playbook-rebound-10-week-line/) for the first time after a breakout in mid-March.


**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), another [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), is also getting support at its 10-week line. Same with **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)).


IPO Breakout
------------


Shares of **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) jumped 9% to 86.92, good for a breakout from an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). It closed well within the 5% buy zone from the 85.55 buy point. But with the stock market in a correction, new buys are risky.

Meanwhile, a breakout for **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) faded for the second straight session. It topped a 44.35 entry on Tuesday and Wednesday, but shares reversed lower Wednesday, falling 2% to 42.47.

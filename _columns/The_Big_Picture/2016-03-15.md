Stock Market Falls, But Upward Trend Remains Undisturbed

The broad indexes fell Tuesday, though it seemed like a minor complication in the market's upward price trend.


The S&P 500 dropped less than 0.2% after trimming an early loss of 0.7%. The index is just below its 200-day moving average, which has become the market's most immediate technical test.


The Nasdaq, unable to pare losses like the S&P, closed 0.5% lower. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1%, thanks in large part to **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). The stock gapped up 2% on positive chatter about the iPhone.

Small caps -- a proxy for the more speculative corners of the market -- lagged considerably: The Russell 2000 slid 1.6%. But the IBD 50 dipped less than 0.1%. It's always a good sign when leading stocks can do better than the indexes.


For the Nasdaq and S&P 500, Tuesday seemed like a minor bump as they guard most of their double-digit rallies since their Feb. 11 lows.


Volume increased across the board, resulting in a new distribution day for the Nasdaq composite. The number of such higher-volume declines has increased to the point where the stalling day March 4 now must be added into the count. So, suddenly the Nasdaq has five distribution days.


That's a significant number in the past few weeks. While that's a bothersome symptom, the market's condition is less bearish when put in context.


For one, Monday's Nasdaq volume was the lowest of the year, making Tuesday's increase in trade just an ankle-high hurdle. The S&P 500 still has just one distribution day.


Market volume has been trending lower for more than a week, but the Accumulation/Distribution Rating for the S&P 500 improved to C- in Tuesday's edition. The Nasdaq's was at D+.


The NYSE advance-decline line is at its highest level since late November. The Nasdaq's is still only at early-January levels. Stronger gains by energy, metal and construction stocks appear to have helped the NYSE's A/D line.


The market has been cautious this week ahead of the Federal Reserve policy announcement due Wednesday afternoon. No interest rate hike is expected, but investors will be seeking signs on the future path of rates. With key primaries in Ohio and Florida on Tuesday, the market may also get more clarity on a hotly contested Republican nomination.


If there is a significant divergence in the stock market, it's between the indexes and leading stocks. Most of the latter have not progressed much from breakouts.


IBD's industry group rankings still shows utilities, food and other defensive stocks leading the market. Utility and the food and beverage sectors are in the top four of 33 sectors. Interest in growth companies remains lukewarm.


That's hurting stock pickers. Some funds in the IBD Mutual Fund index are down more than 10%.


The medical sector was the weakest Tuesday. Ethical drugs slid after **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) gave a [dire outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/valeant-stock-plummets-as-guidance-slashed-after-q4-earnings-miss/). The stock plummeted more than 51%. Retail sales for January were [revised sharply lower](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-slip-0-1-in-february-but-january-is-the-real-story/), but retail stocks weren't perturbed much.

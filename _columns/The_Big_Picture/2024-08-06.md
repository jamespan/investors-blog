  Stock Market Snaps 3-Session Losing Streak But Gains Fade, Risks Remain; Palantir Pops On Earnings

The stock market bounced back Tuesday after three straight days of sharp declines. But 1% gains for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 — and some late-session selling — weren't enough to lift the market out of its corrective phase.




After plunging 7.9% in the prior three sessions, the Nasdaq composite bounced back 1% in lower volume after three heavy-volume declines. Breadth was nearly 2-to-1 positive on the Nasdaq. At its high, the Nasdaq was up 2.6%, but sellers came into the market during the final hour of trading.


NYSE-listed **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) closed off highs, but shares still surged more than 10% after the enterprise software firm reported its fourth straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth. The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance for the second time this year, thanks to continued strong demand for its generative AI offerings.


Palantir looks better than a lot of other technology stocks at the moment, but there's no new entry as the stock looks ready to form a new base.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq closed in the upper half its trading range Monday, giving the session the look of a "pink rally day," or the first day of a rally attempt. But it fell short because the midpoint of the Nasdaq's true range Monday, based on Friday's closing price (16,776) and Monday's low (15,708), was 16,242. The Nasdaq closed Monday at 16,200, just below the midpoint. That means Tuesday marked the first day of a rally attempt.


It's common to see short covering during the first few days of a rally. That means a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-how-to-invest-using-follow-through-days/) could come as early as Friday. Not all follow-through days work though, especially when buy candidates are in short supply.


Several stock market leaders, including **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), have come under heavy selling pressure. That means they're most likely ready to form new bases, and that will take some time.

It will also take some time for new leadership to develop. For now, several stocks in the health care sector as well as consumer staples like **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **Philip Morris** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)) and **Colgate-Palmolive** ([CL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CL)) continue to outperform.


After three straight higher-volume declines, the S&P 500 also rallied 1%. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by just over 3 to 1.


**Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) was a top gainer in the S&P 500, up nearly 11%. Wall Street cheered [Uber's Q2 earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/uber-stock-uber-earnings-q2-2024/), which showed adjusted profit up 161% to 47 cents a share. Total revenue increased 16% to $10.7 billion. Despite the stock's big gain Tuesday, Uber is still below its 50- and 200-day lines.


CAT Leads Dow Jones
-------------------


The Russell 2000 small-cap index outperformed in the stock market today with a 1.2% gain, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, rising nearly 0.8%.

**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) was among a group of six blue-chip stocks that rallied at least 2%. Shares rose 3% after the company reported [better-than-expected earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-earnings-q2-cat-stock-dow-jones-buybacks/). But after finding support at the 200-day line, Caterpillar could run into some resistance near its 50-day line, currently around 334.50.


The 10-year Treasury yield finally firmed up after eight straight declines. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 3.89%, up 10 basis points.


Last week, the Federal Reserve confirmed expectations that the first interest-rate cut will likely come at the September meeting. Chances for a 50-basis-point cut are now around 65% in light of Friday's [weak jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-july-unemployment-rate-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/).


The stock market is now in a correction. On Monday, IBD lowered the invested percentage to 0% to 20%. If you're holding a lot of cash, it's OK to stay engaged and wade into the market with a pilot buy or two. But keep in mind that weak markets eventually bring everything down with them — even stocks showing strength in a down market.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


For perspective, the [Leaderboard model portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com) came into Tuesday just under 40% invested on the long side as defensive holdings like **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) and **Ensign Group** ([ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)) continue to perform well.


In the oil and gas sector, **Viper Energy** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) reclaimed a 41.22 entry in the morning and was still in buy range. But Viper strengthened even more after that and closed just past the 5% buy zone. The oil and gas producer reported a 30% rise in quarterly profit, with revenue up 35% to $216.7 million.


India-based online travel firm **MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)) jumped back above its 50-day line after the stock on Monday pared a 9.4% intraday loss to 1.1%.


**Mueller Water Products** ([MWA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MWA)) reclaimed a 19.43 buy point after finding support at its 50-day line Monday. Shares jumped nearly 6% in strong turnover.

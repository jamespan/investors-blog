Stocks End Win Streak; This Sign Points To A Nasdaq Pullback
=============================================================

The Nasdaq composite reversed lower, snapping a five-day win streak Tuesday. It seemed like little to fuss about after a splendid stock market performance midway through the year.




Through Tuesday's peak, the Nasdaq surged 58.6% from its March low. That's the equivalent of several years' worth of good annual returns. Yet, the composite still shows no sign of distress.


With a clean sheet of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), little seems to stand in the Nasdaq's way. Its major components such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are performing well.


But that doesn't mean it's immune from a normal pullback. The stock market could use a pause, especially the hot Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP070720-254x300.jpg)At Tuesday's high, the Nasdaq stood 20% above its 200-day moving average. That's the largest gap in at least eight years. At the February peak, the Nasdaq got as much as 18% above its 200-day average. This is not a topping signal, but rather an indication that the Nasdaq is getting overbought.


By comparison, the S&P 500's advance looks more moderated. It has settled into a trading range between 2965 and 3233. Right now, the S&P 500 is 4% above its 200-day average. On Tuesday, it fell 1.1%. The Nasdaq lost 0.9% after erasing a 0.8% gain.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5% and closed right back below the 200-day moving average. The Dow is 12% off its prior high, playing its usual role of slower performer.


Small caps took a larger tumble, with the Russell 2000 off 1.9%. Indexes closed at session lows. Lower volume kept indexes from notching a new distribution day.


Leading Stocks Outperform Stock Market
--------------------------------------


The IBD 50 performed relatively better. It fell only 0.2%, thanks to 10 stocks that rose more than 1%. **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) climbed back above its 295.65 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [new flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).

The stock market has faced the coronavirus quite well, even as the pandemic clouds the economic outlook. The [IBD/TIPP Poll found deepening pessimism](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/covid-19-relapse-sinks-economic-optimism-crisis-low-ibd-tipp-poll-july-2020/) among Americans about their financial well-being. This month, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index and the six-month economic outlook both hit the lowest levels since September 2015.


Many states and municipalities are restarting preventive measures that hurt businesses. Yet the stock market has hardly flinched. Why?


UBS Global Wealth Management offered some thoughts on that.


"While we expect continued volatility, we think there are grounds for optimism that economies and markets can weather the recent acceleration in infections," said Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele. Health care systems appear to be coping better with Covid-19, and fatalities have been rising more slowly than infections.


"Investors have also been encouraged by medical advances both in treatment and in vaccines," Haefele added.


Also important, central banks and governments remain committed to massive stimulus. Congress, he noted, unanimously agreed to extend an aid program for small businesses through August. And economic data has been surprising to the upside, with the Citi Economic Surprise Index rising to 188, a record high.

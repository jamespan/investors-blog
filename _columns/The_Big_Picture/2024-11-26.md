After a day of outperformance Monday, the Russell 2000 lagged the stock market Tuesday. But the Nasdaq composite outperformed, helped by strength in large-cap technology stocks like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)).




The Nasdaq composite extended its winning streak to four sessions, rising 0.6% in lower volume. The S&P 500 rose for the seventh straight session and marked an all-time closing high, also up 0.6% in lower volume. The S&P 500 suffered a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) Monday, raising the index's distribution-day count to three.


The major stock indexes strengthened a bit during the final hour of trading after President Joe Biden announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah. But small caps sat out the rally, with the Russell 2000 down 0.7% at the close.


After a pullback, Amazon is back in a buy zone from a 201.20 alternative entry. (It had topped a 195.37 handle entry Nov. 1.) Microsoft popped above a couple of short-term moving averages as it tries to break out of a downtrend. Meta Platforms is only 5% off its high as it forms a flat base. Meta tried to reclaims its 50-day moving average but closed just below the line.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) was by far the day's best performer, up 1.6%. The ETF hit an all-time high and is still near an 82.50 entry.

Despite the gains, declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by nearly 2-to-1. The ratio was less than 2-to-1 negative on the Nasdaq.


The Dow Jones industrials made it five up days in a row, paring a 0.7% morning loss to a gain of 0.3% by the close. It also made a record closing high. A sell-off in **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) was offset by strength in Amazon and Microsoft. Amgen shares closed off lows but still fell nearly 5% after the company reported good, but not good enough, trial results for its highly anticipated [weight-loss drug, MariTide](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-weight-loss-drug-maritide-eli-lilly-zepbound/).


The stock market shrugged off comments from President-elect Donald Trump late Monday, who said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico. He also announced an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs could dramatically raises prices for American consumers who have already been dealing with inflation. ETFs tracking Mexico, Canada and China stocks fell.


PCE In Stock Market's Focus
---------------------------


It should be a quiet, low-volume session Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but a key piece of economic data looms large with the release of the Personal Income and Spending report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Inside the report, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge — the core personal consumption expenditures index — is expected to show prices up 2.8% in October from a year ago. That would be a slight increase from 2.7% in September.


The stock market didn't react much to the 2 p.m. ET release of the minutes from the early-November Fed meeting. Committee members acknowledged the possibility of gradual rate cuts so long as the U.S. economy continues to perform as expected.


The stock market isn't focused on inflation like it once was because inflation is heading in the right direction. It's still above the Fed's preferred target of 2%, but the economy continues to perform well — so much so that the odds for another quarter-point rate cut at the December meeting have been fading. Futures traders see a 60% chance of another rate cut in December, down from 75% about a month ago.


Watch The Stock Market Leaders
------------------------------


With so many stocks out of position and well-extended past proper entry points, it's important to be discerning with new buys. The common pitfall now is to buy a lagging stock in an industry group just because it's setting up in a base and near a buy point.

In the insurance sector, **Chubb** ([CB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB)) is forming a flat base and could try to break out of a downtrend soon. But it has a weak [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-relative-strength/) of 63. The big leaders in the group are **Lemonade** ([LMND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMND)) and **Goosehead Insurance** ([GSHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSHD)). Buying the true leaders in a group on pullbacks is a generally better strategy than buying a laggard breakout.


**Western Digital** ([WDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC)) rallied sharply for the second straight session and closed just below a 73.50 entry. New buyers are watching to see if Western Digital can break out of a cup-with-handle base. But the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is lagging badly on the weekly chart.


Homebuilders lagged after strong gains Monday. After plunging more than 14 basis points Monday to around 4.26%, the 10-year Treasury yield added four basis points to 4.30%.


**Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) joined the [Leaderboard Leaders list](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Monday when it was near the top of a buy zone from a 71.95 buy point. Tuesday's modest decline in lower volume looked orderly in light of Monday's 5.2% gain higher volume.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is an example of a recent breakout that still looks actionable. The security software bellwether is getting support at its 21-day exponential moving average as it holds in a buy zone from an alternate entry of 384.

title: Nasdaq Rejoins Leading Indexes, Up A Third Straight Week; Three Major Risks To Watch

Midcap stocks led the upside on Friday. A 0.7% lift by SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) to all-time highs outmuscled gains of 0.5% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 0.4% by the S&P 500. The Nasdaq edged up less than 0.1%. Yet the composite index, finishing at 14,052, accomplished a third straight up week.




The Nasdaq gained almost 7% over that time frame and is now just an 0.8% gain away from eclipsing its Feb. 16 all-time high of 14,175.


Indexes, industry groups and individual leaders reaffirmed a market in a confirmed uptrend since March 26. On Friday, the construction sector commanded the upside, thanks to a buoyant rise in U.S. housing starts in March — a 1.739 million annualized rate vs. the Econoday view for 1.62 million.


**Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)), new on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), outperformed key indexes Friday. Its 3.2% gain in the highest turnover in eight sessions pushed shares further above a 65.10 [three-weeks-tight buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/).


Beyond Nasdaq: Three Risks In The Stock Market Today
----------------------------------------------------


![MP041621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP041621-265x300.jpg)As panelists have noted on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), the Nasdaq is making a normal-looking rebound after a pair of declines sent the composite index a full standard deviation below its regression channel going back to the April 6, 2020, [follow-through signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) by the Nasdaq. Yet the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has failed to make upward progress since early February — a curious divergence. When more stocks rally, an uptrend reflects true strength.


Two, [bullishness among newsletter pundits](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) polled each week by Investors Intelligence has been hitting stratospheric levels again. The bulls ratio rose this past week to 63.4%. When this ratio hit 64.6% in late November, however, the market continued to chug higher. The Big Picture did not declare the confirmed uptrend going under pressure until Jan. 29 of this year. Bears are at 16%.


The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) (VIX) hit 16.11, the lowest level since February 2020. But this gauge of S&P 500 options volatility has fallen even more than that level before the stock market headed into major corrections. So it doesn't act that well as a timing indicator at market tops. In December 2006, the VIX reached 9.39, long before equities peaked in late 2007. In November 2017, the VIX fell to 8.56.


Avoid Stocks That Whipsaw Investors
-----------------------------------



Three, numerous stocks have built bases that show jagged, rough action. Whipsawing action within the pattern is generally undesirable. **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), **Azek** ([AZEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZEK)), **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) offer some current examples. **Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)), which is joining the S&P MidCap 400, tried to clear a 53.58 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a seven-week cup entry. However, a 50.35 handle entry is proving to work out well. The [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) passes the midpoint test.


Of course, an outstanding earnings report can send a stock flying out of its consolidation, no matter how messy, and resolve any dispute about the quality of the base itself. Yet, your odds of a solid gain generally go higher when the base shows [smooth contours and symmetry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-stock-charts-roku-bullish-element-symmetry/), tight weekly closes, and a steady, high-volume rally back near the base's left-side peak before the breakout takes place.


Lately, **Charles River Labs** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)), **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)), **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)), **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) and **Fair Isaac** ([FICO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FICO)) have shown constructive price-and-volume action. All five hold a slot in IBD's [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/).

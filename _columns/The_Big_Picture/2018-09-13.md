Stocks appear ready to repeat recent history, as the Nasdaq's gains Thursday added to a rise from support near the 50-day line — the fourth time since late June the composite has rebounded from the line.




The Nasdaq climbed 0.7% Thursday, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the large-cap S&P 500 added 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Small caps hesitated as the S&P 600 remained flat.


Volume declined on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq retook the 8,000 price level, an area of recent resistance. The S&P 500 did the same with the 2,900 area.

Pullbacks were modest — roughly 5%, 4%, 2% and, if the latest low holds, 3%. Rebounds off the 50-day area were only a sliver better — about 7%, 4% and 5%. The current rebound could add to this trend, but the recent stock action is still a work in progress.


Small Ball? Forget It
---------------------


Small ball might appear to be the game here, but that's not really the case. A tentative market can create false sell signals, particularly if the individual investor is impatient.


So, if this market isn't small ball, then what is it?


Look at the gains that [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) has made for the year, up about 28% and roughly twice the Nasdaq's gain. Then look at the gains from some highly rated stocks.


Certainly if an individual investor spotted stocks such as **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) in late March and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) in early June, they didn't have to play the minor swings in the stock market.


IBD's [new high column on March 29](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/retail-stocks-lululemon-citi-trends-movado-hit-new-highs/) pegged Lululemon's buy point at 84.25, when the stock gapped up from support at the 50-day line. The stock is now up more than 80%.


Individual investors who bought Five Below's June 5 breakout at the 78.38 buy point are now up more than 65%. IBD's Stock Market Today column identified [Five Below as a buy candidate](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stocks-mixed-twitter-new-high-retail-stock-five-below/) on June 5.


The game here isn't small ball, but Hall of Fame field manager Earl Weaver's patient approach: pitching, defense and the three-run home run.


Portfolio Dictates Strategy
---------------------------


For IBD style investors, individual strategies depend on the contours of the investor's portfolio.


If the stocks in the portfolio have big profit cushions, then standing pat and waiting for the Weaver moment can make sense.


Profits can be reaped at the 20% to 25% level, but not if conviction suggests the stock can become a much bigger winner.


But if an investor's portfolio is lagging the market, then the situation becomes more challenging. Adjustments are necessary, even if sell signals aren't flashing. The investor might want to sell some laggards to raise cash, then study candidates that might offer a better performance. (The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is a key item to watch. If the stock isn't outperforming the market, move on.)


Where will the investor find the buy candidates?


Try IBD's screens: the IBD 50, NYSE and Nasdaq Stocks On The Move, Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders, Stock Spotlight, Global Leaders, Big Cap 20 and the New High List.


Those lists could give the investor as many as 150 stocks or more to study. If that sounds like too much work, think of how big the payoff could be if the investor gets it right on one or two stocks.


Thursday's Action
-----------------


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, laggards such as chips, office supplies and funeral services posted solid gains for the day. On the downside, wood products, grocers, tobacco and superregional banks absorbed hits.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) led the Dow with a 2.4% gain. **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) fell the most, 1.4%.


Light sweet crude dropped 2.5% to $68.59 a barrel.

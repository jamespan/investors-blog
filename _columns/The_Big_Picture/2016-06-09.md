Stocks Hang Tough, But Is Sharp Divergence Ahead?
==================================================

Stock indexes kept their losses small and quiet Thursday, as volume faded on both major exchanges.


The Nasdaq sawed off 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and IBD 50 each sanded off less than 0.2%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq for the sixth time in seven sessions this month, while NYSE trade stepped down for only the third time in June.

The two major indexes have shown somewhat different action recently. For example, the S&P 500 has climbed over old resistance at the 2100 area, while the Nasdaq is trading sideways under its old resistance around 5000.


However, the Nasdaq has done a better job trimming its distribution-day count. Three weeks ago, the Nasdaq had nine distribution days. Now the count is down to two. (At Thursday's close, the Nasdaq jettisoned the May 4 distribution day because of its age.)


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has had trouble lowering its count. Three weeks ago, the S&P carried seven distribution days. Now the tally is five. A distribution day is a sign of institutional selling.


Should the bulls be concerned about these divergences?


Yes, but they also should be aware that the divergences are drawn with a fine point, not a bold point.Â Timing may account for part or all of the divergence. One index has to lead, and that doesn't necessarily constitute divergence, unless it persists and widens.


Still, individual investors should watch the indexes closely. Questions to ask while waiting might include:


What are the indexes' closes like? Mostly high in the range.


Are there price reversals? Several, and mostly positive.


What's the NYSE advance-decline line doing? Rising.


How is the IBD Mutual Fund Index performing? Nicely.


What industry groups are leading? Mostly the commodity-related stocks.


Which are lagging? Retail, which is not good.


Which groups have the highest percentage of stocks at new highs? Paints, utilities, medical supplies and gold miners.


Which Fidelity sector funds are doing best year-to-date? Utilities, telecom, medical equipment and chemicals.


What is the bulls vs. bears survey at? Bulls are at 47.3%, bears 23.8%. This is not good for this contrarian indicator. The last time the bullish percentage was that high was April 19, just before the most recent 4%-6% pullback began.


How about the new-highs count? The new highs tally has dominated the new-lows tally this month, which is a bullish development.


What percentage of NYSE stocks are above their 200-day moving average line? The figure has been running above a level this month that could be a cautionary sign.


Individual investors might wonder how they should play this partly sunny, partly cloudy picture.


As always, much depends on the individual investor's portfolio performance. Generally, though, it would be prudent to take a three-point stance.


First, if a stock is up 20% to 25% from the buy point, selling makes sense. Most stocks begin to consolidate after such a gain, and this imperfect uptrend could make that especially true.


Second, cutting losses early is prudent. An investor needn't wait for the stock to fall 7% to 8% below the buy point. As IBD founder William O'Neil pointed out in "How to Make Money in Stocks," a 7% to 8% loss is the limit, not the target. "The average of all your losses should be less, perhaps 5% or 6%, if you're strictly disciplined and fast on your feet."


Third, don't let a winner round trip to the negative side after being up. Quit hoping and take the small, humiliating profit rather than risk selling for a loss.


**Coming up Friday**: The economic calendar will be relatively thin. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for June will be released a half-hour after the market's open. The consensus estimate is 94.5, according to Econoday.

The stock market ended higher in the final week before Thanksgiving. Now more inflation data and the latest Federal Reserve minutes are due.


The Nasdaq composite flirted with negative territory before rallying to end Friday up 0.2%. This allowed the tech-heavy index to post a weekly gain of 1.7% and put it back above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The Nasdaq has climbed in two of the past three weeks and has increased 26.6% so far for 2024.




The S&P 500 fared a bit better, rising 0.4% for the session. It also managed a weekly lift of 1.7% and sits clear of its short-term moving averages and is nearly 3% above the 50-day line. The benchmark index is now up 25.1% for the year.


Advancers led decliners by 3-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by just over 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges.


Speaking to the breadth, the equal-weighted Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund and the Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) both rose 0.8%. Each outperformed their market cap-weighted counterparts by a fair margin.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best out of the major indexes, closing at record heights after rising 1% Friday. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) fared best while artificial intelligence stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) lagged as investors continued to digest its earnings report.


Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 popping 1.8% Friday. It's just off recent highs and is now up nearly 10% for the month. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) turned in a gain of 0.7% for the session.


PCE Inflation Data, Fed Minutes Due
-----------------------------------


While many people will be most concerned with obtaining a suitably large Thanksgiving turkey, investors will have to mull over a small feast of economic data.


Consumer confidence and new home sales both drop on Tuesday. The Fed minutes from October come that same day, and could offer further clues on the future path of interest rate policy.


Wednesday will see the release of the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures price index data for October. This is important as it is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Headline PCE is seen rising 2.3% year over year. Core PCE, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, is expected to post an annualized rise of 2.8%, up slightly from 2.7% in September.


There will also be some noteworthy [earnings reports to look out for](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/) despite the shortened week, with the markets closing on Thursday and having a shortened day Friday. **Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) in particular is one to watch out for due to its growing status as an artificial intelligence play, with server rival **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) embroiled in controversy. **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) and **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) are among a slew of retailers reporting.


Techs Lag But These Stock Market Groups Shine
---------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday mostly higher,](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) with consumer discretionary and staples faring the best. Technology, communication services and utilities all finished lower.



The relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups offered a more granular insight into what happened [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Oil-and-gas realty trusts, database software firms, funeral services stocks and automakers were the best performers.


In contrast, hospital plays, coal firms, travel bookers and managed care firms were among the laggards. The internet content group also fell, weighed down by Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). Google stock ended the week down 4.5% amid a Justice Department push to have [the search giant sell its Chrome browser](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-justice-department-chrome-sale-apple-search-payments/).

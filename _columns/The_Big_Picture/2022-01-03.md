Nasdaq, Small Caps Race Ahead, But Leaders Give This Mixed Picture; Is The S&P 500 Overvalued?
===============================================================================================

The stock market, led by the Nasdaq and small caps, hinted Monday that the future of the economy may be bright, even as investors head into the new year with worries old and new.




Amid concerns surrounding Covid-19 and inflation, the Nasdaq got a much needed boost. Its 1.2% gain snapped a mild four-day losing streak. The composite's advance almost matched a 1.3% rise by iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)).


Notice how the ETF, while reclaiming its 200-day moving average on Monday, still needs more effort to cross above its intermediate-term [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


The S&P 500 rallied 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%. Both indexes made fresh all-time closing highs. Volume grew sharply on both exchanges. No surprise there, given how turnover has shrunk well below average on the NYSE each day since Dec. 21. The Nasdaq hasn't seen a day of heavy turnover vs. its 50-day moving average since Dec. 17, the day of [quadruple witching](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/options-expiration-witching-days-do-they-place-the-market-under-a-spell-or-not/).



To start the new year on a bullish note? Painful only for short sellers. Yet as this column repeatedly advises, it's always good to look closely under the hood.


Breadth served as one of the market's positive factors on Monday. Early data on TD Ameritrade's ThinkOrSwim platform showed winning issues outpacing losers by more than a 2-1 margin on the Nasdaq, and roughly 4-to-3 on the NYSE.


Helping the cause were financial firms, especially banks. Institutions went on a selling rampage in long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the 10-year bond soared 12 basis points to 1.62%. That hit the highest level since the benchmark bond hit 1.64% on Nov. 24. Overall, though, the increasingly positive slope of the Treasury yield curve gives banks a favorable environment to make profits on loans.


Beyond Nasdaq: Yields Deserve Watching
--------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP010322-202x300.jpg)Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and author of the new book "In Praise of Profits," wrote in a Monday note to clients that it pays to watch the spreads between the two-year notes and both the five- and 10-year bonds. Why? The current spreads "suggest that bond investors believe that a federal funds rate of 0.75% might be enough to slow down both inflation and economic growth."


Right now, the Federal Reserve continues to guide the cost of overnight loans to Wall Street banks at a rate of 0% to 0.25%.


Yardeni's team offers 2% as a year-end target for the all-important 10-year bond yield, which "was remarkably subdued around 1.5% last year despite the jump in inflation," he added.


According to U.S. Treasury data, the two-year note yielded 0.78% on Monday and the five-year note 1.37%.


These Bank Stocks Do Better
---------------------------


**Jefferies** ([JEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JEF)), a 1.8% gainer on Monday, has been swimming beneath its 50-day moving average since Nov. 24. If a base builds, you'd like to see the stock spend more time above this key technical level, not below it.


**Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), up 5.7% on a bullish upgrade by Barclays, hopped above its own 50-day line for the first time since Dec. 16. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), rising 2.1%, finished right between its 50- and 200-day moving averages. West Reading, Pa.-based **Customers Bancorp** ([CUBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBI)), which has broken out twice since September, stepped up 2.5% to new highs.

Yet Monday's action seemed an opportunity for some fund managers to dump shares in big winners of 2021. Did they wait until the new year to lock in gains so that taxes do not have to be paid until April of 2023? Or was it a move to funnel money from stocks that have seen rocket-like moves to other areas of the market? Hard to know for sure. But for recent buyers in the top stocks, it's key to be flexible and not allow even small gains to turn into big losses.


**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) illustrated the tough time software firms had on Monday. The Nasdaq-listed cybersecurity leader and member of [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) slid 7.3%. It is now below its latest entry in a new flat base at 355.45.



**Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)), also trading on the Nasdaq, slid 6.6% in the heaviest turnover in two weeks and pierced its 50-day moving average for the second time in three weeks. Its trucking industry group had a banner year in 2021, up 70% as businesses have scrambled to deal with a bogged-down supply chain, caused in part by overcrowded sea ports.


In the IBD 50, at least 24 companies fell 2% or more on Monday, while only six stocks rallied 2% or more.


Is The S&P 500 Overvalued?
--------------------------


Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, says that based on current estimates for earnings in 2022, the S&P 500 on Friday showed a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.7 on an operating earnings basis. While that comes in much higher than the 10-year average of 18.7 times earnings, it's actually in line with the five-year average of 21.2.


Go all the way back to 1988, and the average P-E ratio, again on an operating results basis, stands at 19.1 times earnings.


Silverblatt adds, "the passive S&P 500 three-year run is 90.13% and 100.37% with dividends."


"Covid-19 continued to dominate the news, as the vaccines (and now the boosters) permitted Americans to spend more outside. But it was spending inside, especially via e-commerce, that permitted record earnings, sales and margins for the S&P 500, as consumer wealth shot up (via equities and home ownership, and lower spending) and frustration at being confined fueled their spending," he wrote.


The SPDR Utilities ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) took a back seat on Monday, falling 1%. SPDR Consumer Discretionary ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) powered 2.9% higher and worked further on a [potential new flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) and a 215.16 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

U.S. stock indexes chalked up small losses Friday in a quiet run-up to the Christmas holiday. The stock market will take Monday off and reopen Tuesday.




 The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq each shaved 0.1% Friday, while the S&P 500 fell just below the break-even mark. The small-cap Russell 2000 trimmed 0.3%.


Volume was down on both major exchanges.


For the week, the best performer was the Russell 2000, up 0.8%. The worst was the Dow utility average, down 4.3%. The utility index's 4.3% loss was the biggest weekly loss in more than two years.


Rising bond yields have made utility dividends less attractive, and bullish conviction on stocks is luring money into more aggressive instruments.

President Trump signed the tax-overhaul bill Friday. The new law will slash corporate taxes from 35% to 21%.


Bulls expect the corporate tax cut to lead to more capital spending rather than the corporate buybacks that were common in the Obama era.


If the economy does shift into a higher gear, earnings are likely to grow, presumably driving many stocks higher.


Where will the money go?


Many analysts expect money to flow into cyclicals, which could benefit from a stronger economy.


For IBD-style investors, this is good news because it could lead to breakouts in fresh areas.


Banks are expected to benefit, especially if Republicans can strip at least some regulations from the Dodd-Frank law.



Banks that are setting up for possible breakouts include **Royal Bank of Canada** ([RY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RY)) and **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)). **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Bank of Montreal** ([BMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMO)) have topped buy points but haven't made much progress. Most other money-centers stocks have already broken out.


Infrastructure-related stocks also could benefit if Congress can put a package together.



The stock action of aggregates maker **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) illustrates the difficulties that infrastructure-tied stocks faced in 2017. The stock stayed in a channel and is flat year to date. Hopes surrounding infrastructure projects proved futile. Investors with exposure to the aggregates and cement stocks are hoping that gets done in 2018.


Strong action among leaders was scarce Friday. The biggest gainer in the Nasdaq 100 was **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)), up 4%. The stock is trading about 70% off its high of four years ago.

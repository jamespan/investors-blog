The [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), after mainly rising steadily and sharply for four weeks in a row, certainly deserves a break. From this vantage point, Wednesday's action did not disturb its confirmed uptrend — a good sign for the bulls.




After hours, the stock market continued its feast-or-famine ways.


AI and accelerated computing innovator **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) gained as much as 7.7% on a [strong fiscal first-quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-fiscal-q1-2025-earnings/) and robust revenue forecast for Q2. At one point shares hit an extended-hours session high of 1,023.


Nvidia has a [full-size position in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). To guard against a sharp drop after Q1 results, a hedge was added on Wednesday before the close to offset half of the position within the model portfolio.


**ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) suffered a sharp drop early in extended-hours moves on a [lighter-than-expected full-year sales forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/elf-stock-elf-beauty-stock-earnings-q4-2024/). But the stock quickly bounced and was up slightly in extended trading.


ELF, like, Nvidia, has enjoyed robust gains for nearly two years since the cosmetics brand broke out of an early stage base in July 2022 near 34.

Stock Market Today Closes Lower
-------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP052224-199x300.jpg)The Nasdaq finished just underneath a 0.2% decline. Volume rose more than 16% vs. the prior session to 7.28 billion shares. So, the composite avoided a distribution day, or session of unusually heavy professional selling, due to the minor drop — but only barely.


Nontech-dominated indexes in the stock market fared a bit worse.


While the S&P 500 slumped 0.3%, it still recorded a mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Over a revolving 25-session cycle, the large-cap benchmark hosts just two such sessions of negative price-and-volume action. Hence, the situation of its uptrend is pretty much the same as the Nasdaq.


Afternoon selling hit the stock market following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's April 30-May 1 meeting on interest rates. Policymakers were concerned that inflation remains persistent, and [some would consider raising interest rates](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/various-fed-officials-said-they-were-willing-to-hike-interest-rates-if-needed-minutes-show-dde8983d) if prices don't come down further.


Bond investors have adjusted their forecast on the extent that the central bank will loosen monetary policy this year in the form of cuts in the fed funds rate.


On Wednesday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield edged up 2 basis points to 4.43%. That's still well below the current fed funds target range of 5.25%-5.5%. Big banks generally borrow money from the Fed at the fed funds rate.


Weakness Centered Here
----------------------


Small caps took a bigger hit on the chin. The Russell 2000 slid 0.8%, matching a decline by the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund.


Keep in mind, however, that Wednesday's losses follow a four-week, 7.6% cumulative gain by the former and a 6.4% rally by the latter over the same time frame.


While long-dated bonds fell in price, so too did the utilities, which have really stood out as highfliers in the past two months. (Please watch [Wednesday's IBD Live session](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) for more detail.) The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) ETF fell 1.2%.


Nonetheless, the utilities index has gained a marvelous 14.5% since making a test of support near its 10-week moving average at 63.64 during the week ended April 19.



Go to a weekly chart, and draw a long trendline that starts with the top of a failed cup pattern that began with a peak of 78.22 in mid-September 2022. The breakout from this trendline near 64? Gorgeous.


While Nvidia will certainly dominate stock market investors' attention on Thursday and likely Friday as well, savvy IBD readers won't ignore perhaps an even larger trend going on: de-concentration of gains.


As illustrated by utilities, other sectors are taking more of a role in buttressing the performance of the stock market.

A Broader Stock Market Rally Continues
--------------------------------------


A simple piece of evidence? The S&P 500, at 5307, has expanded its gain to 11.3%. Annualized, and excluding dividends, this is quite good. The S&P 500 rose 24% in 2023.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped 0.5% to 39,671, is also chugging along. A gain of 5.3% since Jan. 1 surely lags the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. However, it too is showcasing strength in certain sectors outside technology.


Within the Dow industrials, at least three components hold a Relative Strength Rating or 90 or higher. And none of them are in technology.


**American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) trades less than 2% off its all-time peak. It boasts a 95 Composite Rating. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) are also leading the Dow Jones industrials.


The median RS Rating within the 30 Dow Jones stocks stands at 59.


Lululemon Now A Lemon
---------------------


Outside the Dow Jones, former stock market winner **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) has proved to be a small shadow of its former self lately. Shares tanked 7% in heavy turnover on news that a senior executive is leaving the yoga and sports apparel giant. The RS Rating of 10 is horrible. Only three months ago, that rating was swell at 82.


Is Lululemon a [short selling opportunity](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-short-side/) now? Absolutely not. The weakness is too obvious. Watch for a potential follow-on shorting setup similar to **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), currently in Leaderboard as a short-sale play.

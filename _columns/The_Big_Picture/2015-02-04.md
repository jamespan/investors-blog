Indexes Down, Yet Some Growth Stocks Buck Decline
==================================================

The market's latest rebound lost steam on Wednesday. A slight pickup in Nasdaq volume meant that the premier index added yet another distribution day.


However, decent action among a relatively wide swathe of high-growth leaders presented a curious divergence.


The IBD 50 edged up 0.1%.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 wavered in a relatively tight trading range. But a late-hour sell-off, spurred by new headlines on the Greek debt crisis, resulted in a 0.2% loss for the Nasdaq and a 0.4% drop for the S&P 500.


NYSE volume was a shade lower, which kept the distribution count for the S&P 500 at five.


At five distribution days in recent weeks, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 still bear a heavy weight of institutional selling pressure. Yet the technical action has not been so horrific.


In the final analysis, it's smart to trade cautiously. Yet, what are reasons to stay prepared to buy?


One, weeks of whipsawing action makes an impact on investor optimism. Check out the bulls-bear survey updated each week by Investors Intelligence. The chart on Page B11 shows bulls at 49%, still sharply below the mid-June peak of 62.60%.


Two, a fair amount of highly rated stocks rose in heavy volume Wednesday. The action among some giant caps, including **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), was an unmistakable sign of institutional investors putting cash to work.


Boeing, which sports an 87 Composite Rating, reported a small decline in fourth-quarter earnings. However, its 787 Dreamliner is a hot seller, and Q1 EPS growth is expected to be 47%. Disney continues to churn out new products (think "Frozen") and services to cater to the world's growing consumer class. It gets a 92 Composite Rating.


Three, other market technicals are encouraging. In Wednesday's IBD, the New High List showed 195 making new highs vs. only 38 at new lows. The NYSE advance-decline line recently stretched into new-high ground. And the quality of growth among those in the top 40 IBD industry groups is high.


An 8% slide in crude oil also impacted Wednesday's market, with many oil-related subgroups pacing the decline. Commodity-related plays are teaching new investors the lesson of never catching a falling knife.


As seen in today's IBD, the energy sector has fallen to No. 33, dead last among all sectors in terms of mid- to long-term relative price performance.

S&P 500 Sells Off On New Rate Hike; Will A More Hawkish Fed Cut Stock Market Rally Short?
==========================================================================================

The S&P 500 showed it's still willing to underperform. The Nasdaq gave clues that true market leaders are fine. But what exactly is the Federal Reserve thinking now?




Everyone expected the most powerful central bank in the world to ratchet up the cost of money for the seventh time in 2-1/2 years. But will the Fed in fact raise interest rates two more times later this year, or be finished with three increases by September? It doesn't seem clear right now.


That's fine. Watching the price-and-volume action of the major indexes and the current leaders should remain a top-drawer priority for growth stock investors.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MP061318-192x300.jpg)The Nasdaq squandered an early advance of nearly 0.6% to finish a touch in the red. Volume increased. Yet the Nasdaq's 0.1% decline did not meet the 0.2% minimum required to call it a day of distribution.


The Nasdaq 100 lost less than 0.1% as **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), one of [12 companies earning a spot in IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), muscled higher and countered declines in interest rate-sensitive and defensive sectors.


The S&P 500 slipped 0.4%. Again, not a steep decline. But with turnover rising on the Big Board, according to early readings, the sell-off marked a sixth distribution day, or bout of intense professional selling, over the past 25 trading sessions.


Market breadth was terrible on the NYSE, with losing issues exceeding winners by a 2-1 ratio. But on the Nasdaq, losers beat winners by an almost 5-4 margin.


View the Market Pulse Table. You'll see a big discrepancy in distribution days for the Nasdaq (3) vs. the 500 (now at 6). Why?


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq actually rallied strongly enough to render a pair of distribution days on May 15 and May 18 as no longer relevant.


Such price action offers a timely hint that institutions are more eager to buy shares than to sell them.


The S&P 500 has been drastically underperforming the Nasdaq in part because it carries a higher weighting of utility, REIT, telecom services and large manufacturers that take on tons of debt. Higher interest rates simply boost the refinancing costs of these companies.


In contrast, many of the largest tech companies on the Nasdaq now hold some long-term debt on their balance sheets. But their long-term debt-to-equity ratios are healthy.


The market action Wednesday hummed this all-too-familiar tune of 2018.


The Laggards
------------


Homebuilding, wood products, mortgage services, construction products, mining gear and property REITs sold off with losses of 1.7% or more. Several oil-related groups slid 1% or more, even though WTI crude oil futures rebounded roughly 0.4% to $66.64 a barrel.


The Fed funds rate, or what the U.S. central bank charges Wall Street firms on overnight loans, has now hit the 1.75%-2% range. That's the highest level since September 2008. But that rate also stands well below a 12-year high of 5.25%, first marked in June 2006. That rate stood unchanged until September 2007.


The language of the Federal Reserve's statement after its two-day meeting pointed to solidifying confidence in the U.S. economy. In May, the Fed said economic activity was rising "at a moderate rate." On Wednesday, the interest rate policy committee noted that it's now rising at a "solid rate."


The Fed also said that it "expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2% objective over the medium term." In other words, expect more rate hikes to come.


One More Or Two?
----------------


In a separate article, IBD noted how the forecasts of FOMC committee members pointed to a [strong likelihood of two more rate hikes](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-hikes-rates-signals-just-one-more-2018-dow-jones-rises/), one in September and another in December. However, the CME Group's Fed Watch monitor of fed funds futures now only show a 51% chance of two such hikes.


Is the market doubting some indications that central bankers are getting markedly more hawkish?


This question should get a clearer answer in the coming days and weeks.


Meanwhile, there's zero doubt that the Nasdaq remains the leading index.

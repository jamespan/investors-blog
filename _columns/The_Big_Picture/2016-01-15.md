  'Relief Rally' Gives Bears A Laugh; Fast-Paced Selling Resumes

Stock indexes resumed their torrid selling Friday, raising the odds that the Nasdaq will reach bear-market territory. The Nasdaq dived 2.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average splashed 2.2% and 2.4% lower.


The IBD 50 dropped 2.4%.


Volume rose across the board. Options expirations probably played a part in the higher volume.


After Thursday's big gains raised hopes of a relief rally of some length, the bears quickly made a joke of that idea. The indexes gapped down at Friday's open and showed few second thoughts.


![](http://ibdcmsprod10/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MPv_500_011516-e1453250503687.gif)Economic news was negative, with disappointments in retail sales, New York manufacturing and industrial production.


Yet the bears don't need much of an excuse to act like bears in this market. The climate is right for fear.


A bear market is a possibility now. The traditional definition of a bear market is 20% off a high.


The Nasdaq has lost as much as 15.5% since July and would need to fall about 303 points to reach a 20% loss.


Considering that the Nasdaq has dumped 550 points over the past two weeks, an additional 303 points sounds possible.


Yet bulls might consider a 20% drop the best medicine for a sick stock market and even sicker oil prices.


In a free market, the best cure for low prices is low prices, and that's true whether analysts are tracking stocks or oil.


Reaching the minus-20% level might be the surest way to clear out the remaining weak holders and make a confident rally possible.


When the screams of pain reach the right pitch, value funds and the GARP (growth at a reasonable price) camp will often step in and buy.


The last time the Nasdaq dropped 20% was May 2011 to October 2011. It proved to be end of the selling. From the October 2011 low to the March 2012 high, the Nasdaq gained 36%.


Bulls would be happy to see a repeat of that piece of history. Bears, however, are hoping that a move down to 20% would usher in something longer and uglier.


Of course, there's always the chance that the lows in this downtrend are either near or have been put in.


The Nasdaq's test at the 4500 area still appears in play.


Another figure for the optimistic case is the put-call volume ratio. The ratio closed at 1.33, the highest since Sept. 28's 1.37 reading. The Nasdaq bottomed the next day and then advanced almost 15% over the next two months.


IBD-style investors should be patient. Wait until the Market Pulse indicates that a new uptrend is underway.


Until then, cash is a good place to be.


For the week, the IBD 50 slid 4.2%; the Nasdaq, 3.3%; the small cap S&P 600, 2.4%; and the S&P 500 and the Dow, 2.2% each. The defensive Dow Jones utility average added 1.5%, rising in four of the past five weeks.

Stock Market Fades Late On Intel Sales Warning, China Trade Jitters
====================================================================

The stock market held modest gains for a good portion of Wednesday's session, but sellers came in late ahead of the start of China trade talks in Washington, D.C. The weak close was due in part to soft revenue guidance from **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) late in the session.




Wednesday's late fade followed an unequivocal day of institutional selling in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Tuesday.


At the close, the Dow Jones industrials eked out a gain of less than 0.1% after rising 0.6% early. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.3% and the S&P 500 eased 0.2%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index slipped 0.5%, but Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 0.5%, helped by big gains for **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) and **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)).


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP050819-254x300.jpg)The market outlook was lowered a notch to uptrend under pressure Tuesday after a harsh distribution day for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Distribution days can be mild, or they can be severe. Tuesday's price action was an example of the latter, but it's not a market that's under heavy distribution by any means. And plenty of market-leading growth stocks are still holding up well.


Meanwhile, a stalling session was added to the S&P 500 distribution day count. Of the two stalling sessions for the S&P 500 (April 3 and April 16), only one was being counted. Now that the S&P 500 shows three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), the other stalling session is back on the count.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The Dow Jones closed below its 50-day moving average Tuesday and remained below that level Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 are still holding above their 50-day lines.


A market uptrend under pressure is not the time to be aggressively putting capital to work. It's OK to nibble here and there at intriguing setups, but it's also the time to take stock of current holdings. Give conviction stocks that aren't showing sell signals time to work, and avoid the pitfall of being patient with names that aren't working.


One example of a conviction stock would be [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) name **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)). It's been getting support at the 50-day moving average for the first time after a breakout from a base earlier this year.


**Tandem Diabetes Care** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) is just above its 50-day moving average as it works the right side of a cup-shaped base.


Other setups are out there, but the devil is in the details. **Intercontinental Exchange** ([ICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICE)) is working on a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), but a lagging relative strength line mars the chart. **Hexcel** ([HXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HXL)) is also near the top of base, also with a lagging relative strength line.


Top IPO Stocks
--------------


It's been a vibrant IPO market in recent weeks, and all eyes will be on Uber when it prices Thursday night and starts trading Friday. Competitor **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) slumped nearly 11% Wednesday after reporting earnings. Lyft reported another quarter of impressive sales growth, up 95% to $776 million, but an adjusted loss of $3.94 a share was wider than expected.


Among recent new issues, **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) finally took a breather Wednesday after four straight gains. Shares slumped nearly 9%. Rather than chase hot IPOs like Beyond Meat, it's best to wait for an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) to form.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) jumped nearly 6% to 77.68. It reclaimed a 74.27 buy point after falling 6% Tuesday.


**PagerDuty** ([PD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PD)) has also been a stout performer since its debut last month at 24. It's well-extended from the 5% buy zone after a breakout from an IPO base with a 42.05 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


**Levi Strauss** ([LEVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEVI)) and **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)), meanwhile, continue to work on IPO bases. Earnings from Tradeweb are due Thursday before the open.


Two other new issues, **Jumia Technologies** ([JMIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JMIA)) and **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), report earnings next week. Pinterest was featured on Wednesday in [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/pinterest-stock-ipos-base-etf/).


Small cap **Silk Road Medical** ([SILK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SILK)) is thinly traded and unprofitable but shows big sales growth in recent quarters. It's been a solid performer since its debut last month at 20. Shares closed Wednesday at 41, still above a 39.61 buy point after a breakout attempt from an IPO base.

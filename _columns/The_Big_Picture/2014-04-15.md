Tuesday was shaping up to be another ugly day for the stock market, but major averages recovered impressively and closed near highs on a busy day of headline flow.

  

The S&P 500 led the way, rising 0.7%. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.6%, helped by strong earnings from **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)).

  

The Nasdaq, meanwhile, came close to its 200-day moving average before reversing higher. It fell 1.9% early but ended with a gain of 0.3%. NYSE and Nasdaq volume rose sharply from Monday's levels.

  

The IBD 50 basically performed in line with the market, rising 0.6%. Its top performers included **Synaptics** ([SYNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNA)), **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)), **Myriad Genetics** ([MYGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYGN)) and **Trimble Navigation** ([TRMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRMB)).

  

Stocks jumped out of the gate during the first half hour of trading but turned lower after the NAHB Housing Market Index came in at 47, below the consensus estimate of 49, and the third straight reading below 50. A number above 50 means more builders view conditions as good rather than poor.

  

Homebuilders, on the verge of upside breakouts not that long ago, continue to struggle. IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has lost 9% since its March high. March housing start and building permit data are due Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET.

  

Meanwhile, the market was mostly unfazed by weak reading from the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. It came in at 1.29, well below the estimate of 7.5 and also below March's reading of 5.61.

  

Tuesday's resilient showing by the stock indexes was encouraging, but it's only the first day of a rally attempt. That means the market needs to prove itself more.

  

Leading growth stocks have been taken apart in recent weeks, and chart damage caused by institutional selling will take time to repair.

  

Many high-quality names in the IBD 50 are building the left side of bases but it remains to be seen which ones will successfully build the right sides.

  

Chipmakers fared well ahead of **Intel**'s ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) earnings report after the close. IBD's chipmaker group rose 1.1%. Intel rose 0.8% during the regular session and gained 2% in after-hours trading after the chip bellwether's earnings came in slightly better than expected. (See [story](http://news.investors.com/technology/041514-697269-intc-stock-rises-on-q1-earnings-q1-shows-pc-sales-stabilizing-data-center-up.htm).)

  

Intel is trying to break out from a 13-week base.

  

Utility stocks and oil and gas producers continued their outperformance. In IBD's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration and Production group, IBD Big Cap 20 components **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) and **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) continue to hold above recent buy points.

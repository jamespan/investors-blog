Stock Market Rises As Nvidia Surges On Earnings; Inflation Data Up Next
========================================================================

The major stock indexes reversed lower but rebounded in afternoon trading Thursday to end moderately higher. Tech stocks in particular received an early boost after chip giant **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) surged 14% on [strong Q4 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvda-stock-nvidia-delivers-upbeat-q4-report/) and a positive outlook.




On Friday, investors will shift their attention to inflation data, with the release of the personal consumption expenditures price index.


Wall Street expects the PCE price index to rise 0.4% in January, with a 4.9% annual rate vs. December's 0.1% increase and 5.0% annual rate. Personal income is expected to rise 1% in January with consumption expenditures up 1.2%.


As the struggling stock market uptrend tries to rebound, there are still stocks that are near a fresh point, including [IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), Dow Jones leader **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)).


GDP, Jobless Claims, Earnings Results
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MP022323-259x300.jpg)The Labor Department's initial unemployment claims posted a surprise drop to 192,000 from 194,000 the previous week. They were expected to rise to 200,000. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP fell to 2.7% growth from 2.9%; it was expected to remain unchanged from the first estimate of 2.9%.


Among key earnings reports, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Lucid Group** ([LCID](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCID)) and **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) were on the move.


BABA stock reversed from early gains to fall nearly 0.7%, while Domino's shares traded down 11.6% and BROS stock tumbled more than 10%. Etsy shares [rose 2.4% in a positive reversal despite missing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/etsy-stock-jumps-on-fourth-quarter-earnings/) earnings targets. Lucid shares plunged almost 12% on a sales miss. Finally, Planet Fitness stock climbed more than 5% to decisively retake its 50-day line.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3% and the S&P 500 gained 0.5%. The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 also rose 0.7%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE from the prior session.


Perhaps most significantly, the S&P 500 found support at its 50-day moving average, and the Nasdaq held above its 200-day line.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 1.2% Thursday as the ETF of top growth stocks continued to rebound from the 50-day line.


In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) bounced back Thursday, jumping 8.7%. On Wednesday, the stock triggered the [7%-8% loss rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 92.90 double-bottom buy point. This type of volatile action underscores the danger in the struggling stock market uptrend.


Following Tuesday's market rout, IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) was downgraded to an "uptrend under pressure," which means investors should now be focusing on defense rather than aggressively buying breakout stocks. Given the market's recent weakness, it makes sense to have a more conservative exposure level ranging from 40% to 60%.


If more and more breakouts start to fade and your portfolio's progress wanes, then you should be proactive and reduce your exposure even further to match the market action. Keep a close eye out for sell signals, like breaks of the 50-day line and 7%-8% sell signals, to avoid bigger losses.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: American Express, Deere, Palo Alto
-----------------------------------------------------------------


[Dow Jones payments leader American Express](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/american-express-dow-stock-charges-toward-buy-zone-as-investors-scoop-up-shares-in-axp-stock/) is adding a handle to a big cup base, resulting in a 182.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares are just 4% away from the new buy point.


On Jan. 27, American Express reported its Q4 and full-year 2022 numbers. It delivered on its [2022 growth plan](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2023/American-Express-Delivers-on-2022-Growth-Plan-With-Full-Year-Revenue-Growth-of-25-and-Earnings-Per-Share-of-9.85/default.aspx), posting revenue growth of 25% and earnings per share of $9.85.


Deere shares inched lower Thursday, holding just above support at their 50-day line. Shares are just 5% away from a 448.50 buy point in a flat base.


An industrial bellwether, Deere has shrugged off recession and inflation fears to deliver solid profits. In the last year, higher commodity prices boosted farming purchases. In the fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 29, the tractor maker posted a 124% EPS jump on a 32.2% total revenue surge, both topping estimates. Earnings growth accelerated for a second straight quarter.

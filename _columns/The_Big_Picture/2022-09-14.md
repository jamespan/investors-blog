title: Some Growth Stocks And This Sector Outperform Indexes; How This Investing Pro Hedges Rampant Inflation

Wednesday's rebound among major equity indexes may seem laughable in comparison with the intensity of Tuesday's fire sale of stocks on torrid U.S. inflation data. However, a small band of high-quality growth stocks and another clear dose of institutional-class buying in at least one sector affirmed this thesis: The market is going to favor stock pickers.




The Nasdaq composite led the way, rising 0.7%. Despite the relatively tight range during the day, it took a somewhat sinuous path to attain that gain.


At one point, the tech-driven index had lost all of that advance and even fell a few points.


The tech-oriented Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF climbed 0.8%.


Compared to Tuesday 5.2% loss and almost 5.5% for these two indexes, respectively, Wednesday's advance didn't exactly frighten the bears.

Equally unimpressive? The Russell 2000, sinking 3.9% on Tuesday, recouped a sliver of that deep loss, up almost 0.4%.


The S&P 500 also lagged, mustering only a 0.3% gain after backpedaling 4.3% in the wake of Tuesday's bigger than expected rises in consumer prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up only 0.1%, saw at least three of its components lose 2 points or more. **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) are now all trading beneath their respective [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE Wednesday after Tuesday's heavy-volume sell-off.


In both a healthy stock market and in robust growth stocks, you expect to see positive action, such as stout gains in heavy turnover, occurring frequently and above the 50-day line, not below.


Indeed, the sickening downtrends for long investors in stocks such as Honeywell and 3M appear to affirm the likelihood that the Federal Reserve cannot take strong measures to tighten the money supply without triggering a meaningful recession. On Wednesday, fellow industrial giant **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) [warned about third-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/nucor-warns-on-earnings-as-steel-prices-soften-nue-stock-falls/), and investors have punished the well-run large-cap firm with a 16% loss for the week so far.



Nucor blamed shrinking margins in metal products and "reduced shipping volumes particularly at our sheet and plate mills."


**Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) fell in sympathy; shares took out the 50-day line and are now down 13.8% for the week. The stock is also on the verge of taking out its 200-day moving average.


Copper futures, meanwhile, have sunk 23% from their June 3 peak of $4.57 per pound.

The Leading Sector In Growth Stocks Today
-----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP091422-185x300.jpg)Growth stocks, however, did show some measure of outperformance on Tuesday.


One piece of evidence? Among small caps, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) bounced 0.6% and more sharply than a 0.2% rise by its counterpart exchange traded fund, iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)).


Second, the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF rallied almost 2.4%. It hopped slightly back above the 50-day moving average, which actually has been edging higher for nearly three weeks.


Now, at 28.33, this ETF has simply had an abominable year, falling 38% since Jan. 1. The S&P 500 has fallen less than half that over the same time frame.


The best actively managed mutual funds are also lying low in 2022. Headed into Wednesday, the IBD Mutual Fund Index was posting a horrific [year-to-date loss of 25.7%](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI091322.pdf). All of the member funds have not done as poorly as the Innovator IBD 50. Yet keep in mind that the IBD 50 ETF does not represent the IBD 50 in equal-weighted form. Rather, it shows an overweighting of the highest ranked companies within this dynamic list.


And as can be seen in the [top 10 of the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), oil and gas and solar stocks really did the heavy lifting.


Energy continues to rank [No. 1 within IBD's stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-sep-14-2022/) in terms of mid- and long-term performance. The sector rose 4% on Tuesday on a price-weighted basis. Affirming the bullish action: Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) marched 2.8% higher amid crude oil futures' fourth gain in five sessions to $88.98 a barrel. VanEck Oil Services ([OIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OIH)) ran ahead 3.6%.


Ranked No. 6 within the IBD 50 on Tuesday's close, **Comstock Resources** ([CRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRK)) rallied 8.1% to 21.23, after earlier topping the 21.28 buy point in its [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/).


At one point, the Frisco, Texas, oil and gas explorer reached a high of 21.85. So at least for now, CRK stayed within the 5% buy zone from its breakout point.

A weekly chart truly highlights the sharp decline within its latest pattern. At one point, Comstock fell nearly 52% off the cup's left-side peak of 22.11. It's highly unusual for growth stocks, after falling that much, to stage spectacular breakouts to new highs.


Managing Money: How One Investing Pro Battles Volatility
--------------------------------------------------------


Jim Cahn, chief of investments and business development officer at $55 billion Wealth Enhancement Group in Minneapolis, points out that 2022 stands out among recent bear markets. Why? It shows how financial advisors and investors, by generally relying on a 60%-40% allocation model of equities and bonds, have still suffered sharp losses. Both types of assets have staggered due to a one-two punch of high inflation and a stagnating economy.


"When you have unexpectedly high inflation and stagflation, there is a breakdown in the correlation between equity and corporate risk and interest-rate risk," Cahn told IBD. "This is why you also have to have inflation-protected assets, such as commodities."


He notes that equity and bond portfolios generally have four types of risk: corporate performance; the Treasury yield curve and the level of interest rates; changes in inflation; and asset managers' skill in managed portfolios, or what Cahn calls "unattainable alpha." So, when the investing environment becomes what we see now in 2022 — high inflation and economic contraction — disparate asset classes such as junk bonds and small-cap stocks may in fact fall in tandem.


In such a situation, this sort of attempt to diversify investments falls flat on its face.


Therefore, Cahn says his team has recommended the use of a relatively new product called "CPI swaps." They essentially give holders a positive return in situations when the [consumer price index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) shows increases that exceed economists' consensus forecasts. According to Cahn, Pioneer Investments and Lord Abbett are among the mutual fund families that offer such a product to retail investors.


"Many have talked about real estate as a hedge, yet it's had a tough year," Cahn added.

No doubt. Even some of the best-run REITs in the country have found 2022 to be tough sledding. Among real estate plays that act like growth stocks in the long run, check out **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)). The stock notched its fifth straight decline. Shares slid 1.5% on Wednesday in volume that shot 87% above its 50-day moving average.


The REIT, which sank below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Monday, took out its 50- and 200-day lines as well in the past two days of heavy selling.


IBD's residential building industry group dropped 0.8%. It's slumped almost 35% from a Dec. 9 peak. (You can see the industry's chart by typing in "G1520" at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).)

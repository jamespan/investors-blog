The stock market Tuesday continued to rebound, closing just a step away from new highs.

  

The Nasdaq jumped 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.7%. Combined with Monday's gains, the broad indexes have put together their best two-day rally since Feb. 6-7. That's when the market was starting its current uptrend.

  

Indexes closed near session highs. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are now less than 1% away from clearing their early March peaks.

  

A shift to higher-risk stocks could be seen in other indexes: The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1.4%, while the Dow utility average dropped 0.2%.

  

Volume increased across the board, which was an improvement of sorts. Until Tuesday's advance, the Nasdaq's previous three gains had come in lighter trading. The combination of recent losses and rising volume indicated that institutional investors were taking profits rather than adding stocks.

  

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of the Nasdaq got knocked down to D- and the S&P 500's to C- after Monday's trading.

  

This week's rebound is a sign those institutions are slowly moving back into stocks, perhaps sensing the Ukraine crisis is, if not improving, at least not escalating.

  

Industry groups that have led the market — including biotech, security software, chipmaking and health care — were among the best performing stocks Tuesday. That can be taken as a sign the market is shaking off sellers and returning to normalcy.

  

The IBD 50 rose 1.5% for the day, and there's been little sign of a more serious correction brewing among its components. Several of the top-performing stocks are finding support at the 50-day or 10-week moving averages.

  

Those include **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)), **Grifols** ([GRFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRFS)), **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)), **KapStone Paper & Packaging** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)) and **Rexnord** ([RXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RXN)).

  

Even with the indexes aiming for new highs, it's best to maintain a cautious investing approach.

  

The Fed concludes a two-day meeting Wednesday, and its policy decisions carry broader implications than geopolitics.

  

It also will be a significant day because for the first time new Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen gives a post-meeting press conference. The market will surely be parsing her remarks as it tries to learn more about her policy inclinations.

  

A couple of earnings reports gave some pause.

  

After the close, **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) shares fell as the database giant missed profit estimates.

  

**SolarCity**'s ([SCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCTY)) delayed earnings report also came out after the bell, and the stock was moderately lower. It beat views, but management's outlook was weak.

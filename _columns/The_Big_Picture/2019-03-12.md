  Growth Stocks Rally Amid Boeing Slump, Sleepy Inflation Data; What One Strategist Is Watching Closely

So, how did Wall Street react after the U.K. Parliament rejected the latest proposal by Prime Minister Theresa May for a Brexit deal? Mostly yawns. President Donald Trump's new budget proposal that includes more funding to fortify the U.S.-Mexico border? Hardly an eyebrow raised.




Instead, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) exemplified for a second straight session the risk in going all in with just one stock. Meantime, the Nasdaq composite and top growth stocks continued their advance.


Boeing fell sharply for a second straight day as [more airlines and nations grounded the company's 737 Max 8](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-lion-air-order-boeing-737-max-crash/) airplane. The stock slid 6% in more than seven times normal volume. Plus, Boeing closed below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. Before the big plunge, shares tripped a [key offense-type sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) with a 20% gain past an aggressive buy point in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) at 369.10. An early entry at 373.80 was also acceptable.


[In IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), **Ionis Pharmaceuticals** ([IONS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IONS)), **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and five others pummeled the performance of the major indexes. They each rose 0.6% to 2% or more for the day.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP031219-263x300.jpg)The stocks making Leaderboard in 2018 garnered an 11.8% return on a portfolio-weighted basis. The S&P 500 fell 6.2% last year. A full position on Leaderboard is equal to one-eighth of an entire portfolio committed to growth stocks. A half-size position would take up one-sixteenth of the entire account.


The tech-fortified Nasdaq composite gained 0.4% on Tuesday. It continued to gnaw away at the constructive pullback of 4.1% seen over a five-session selling streak that ended Friday. At 7591, the leading index for growth stocks is still enjoying one of its strongest advances in any quarter in recent history, up 14.4% since Jan. 1.


The Nasdaq 100 Beats The Dow Jones Too
--------------------------------------


The Nasdaq 100 — boosted by decent gains from the likes of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and Google owner **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — edged both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 (up 0.3% on Tuesday) with a 0.5% lift.


Volume fell on both the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Care to guess which sector outdid even the mighty techs on Tuesday? The answer: dividend-heavy utilities.


The Dow Jones utility average ramped nearly 0.7% higher. It's now eclipsed the highs seen in the fourth quarter of 2018, just as the U.S. market embarked on its third bear-market-quality correction over the prior 10 years. (See the current [Utility Leaders stock list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/utility-leaders-mar-12-2019/) by going to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), housed within the "Stock Lists" section of Investors.com.)


Yet at 776, the Dow utilities' year-to-date gain of 8.9% still pales in comparison with the Nasdaq composite's solid performance thus far.


As noted in the [economic calendar section](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of Investors.com, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2% in February vs. the prior month, matching the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Year over year, a 1.5% lift in the CPI index falls well below the 2% pace that is being openly targeted by the Federal Reserve. Core consumer prices (stripping out the volatility of energy and food) inched up 0.1% in February, below the 0.2% consensus view.


The central U.S. bank meets on interest rate policy on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Traders of fed funds rate futures are not expecting a single rate hike through at least December, according to data from the CME Group. In fact, futures data shows a 19% probability that the Fed *will cut rates* by at least a quarter point in the final month of 2019.


The Importance Of Inflation And How It Affects Growth Stocks
------------------------------------------------------------


Keeping an eye on inflation data is important. After all, we're still in a phase of monetary tightening, albeit in a very mild fashion.


Last year, the Fed raised short-term rates by a quarter point four times. That sent the fed funds target interest rate to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.


However, that's still significantly below the 5.25% level seen in June 2006, when the central bank ended a multiyear campaign of raising the cost of money.


Can U.S. equities continue to rally after a truly superb run-up since the major bottom of March 2009?


Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management, is among the more bullish voices across the buy side on Wall Street. His team is targeting an average annual rate of return of 7.25% for U.S. equities over the next 10 years. That's higher than the average outlook, Ma says.


So, why the sunny perspective?


"Share buybacks are not being adequately captured in valuation models. If you dial back the market 15 years or so, dividends were a primary component of shareholder return," Ma told IBD in a phone interview. "But only recently, share buybacks have become a bigger component of that return."


The Market Rally Is Not Only About Low Inflation
------------------------------------------------


Ma adds that the technology sector remains a vibrant part of the U.S. economy. Scads of tech stocks with very strong profit margins now make up a larger portion of the overall wealth in the U.S. stock market.


While some market analysts express a concern that profit margins, now high among U.S. companies, are likely to revert to historical means, Ma believes it's highly unlikely that in the future a company can dethrone, say, a [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) with a low-margin business strategy.


The reason? Technology does not come cheap. In Silicon Valley, a winner-takes-all phenomenon is common. When you have a superior market share, your pricing power tends to stay strong.


Ma, who taught economics at Lehigh University before transitioning into money management, likes the decent level of productivity growth in the U.S. Nonfarm output per hour grew nearly 1.8% in the fourth quarter vs. a year ago, according to the FRED database managed by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. That smacked the consensus view of 1.5% growth.


If productivity can stay at 1.5% or higher in the future, Ma thinks companies will be able to absorb the current level of higher wages without having to raise product prices or cut investment spending.


Keep Watching The U.S. Treasury Bonds
-------------------------------------


Strong productivity increases may also lessen the pressure on the Fed to sharply hike rates to contain a future spike in inflation. "Our model is based on the expectation that interest rates stay well behaved in the short term and the long term," Ma said.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note eased a further 3 basis points Tuesday to 2.61%. It began the month at 2.76%. The current yield is not far above the annualized dividend yield of 1.95% for the S&P 500. You can track the yield at the top of the large daily chart of the large-cap benchmark in the PDF link below.

The stock market managed to dig in before ending near highs for the day as investors shook off Moody's negative sentiment on U.S. debt. Stocks now have to handle another inflation reading, which comes Tuesday.




The Nasdaq composite briefly threatened to turn positive but ultimately finished the session down 0.2%. Nevertheless, it held its ground and its uptrend above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) remains intact for now. The tech-heavy index has gained almost 32% so far this year.


The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the session with a nominal loss of 0.1%. Although it was forced lower late, the index still closed near session highs. The S&P did not cede ground to its 50-day line as the technical benchmark itself also slipped. The index has a gain of more than 15% so far in 2023.


Advancers and decliners were evenly matched on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was underwhelming on both exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed the other major stock market indexes as it lifted 0.2%. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) fared best in the Dow amid reports [China may end its commercial freeze](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-soars-on-dubai-orders-52-billion-deal-china-commitment-rumors/) on the purchase of Boeing 737 Max jets. Boeing also won a major plane order with Emirates airline.

Small caps managed to squeeze out a nominal gain, though the Russell 2000 was essentially flat. Growth stocks fared best of all, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) jumping 0.7%. Strong sessions from **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)), **Clearwater Analytics** ([CWAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CWAN)) and **Goosehead Insurance** ([GSHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSHD)) helped the IBD 50.


Inflation Data Looms Large
--------------------------


Stocks opened lower after Moody's Investors Service late Friday [cut its outlook on U.S. debt](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-moodys-cuts-us-outlook-boeing-jumps-on-jet-order/) to negative from stable, citing high budget deficits and a polarized government. But indexes bounced.


Even if the current interest-rate hiking cycle looks to be coming to a close, the potential for more inflation and the knock-on effects to Federal Reserve policy continue to weigh on the stock market.


Tuesday morning, the latest Consumer Price Index data is due to be released. Economists expect it to rise 3.3% year over year. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, is seen lifting 4.1% year over year.


There is also more Fedspeak slated, with New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson set to make appearances.


Meanwhile, consumer stock **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) reports Tuesday before the open. The Roger Federer-backed Swiss shoemaker is up nearly 60% so far this year. Dow Jones giant **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) is also set to report quarterly results.


Tesla Helps This Stock Market Group
-----------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Monday mixed](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Energy and health care turned in the best gains, while real estate and utilities were the worst-performing areas.



As ever, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a more in-depth insight into what happened on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Office suppliers, medical product stocks and department stores were among the best performers. Automakers also shined, boosted by a strong session from Elon Musk-led **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which managed to move back above its 200-day moving average.


In contrast, generic drug manufacturers, radio and TV firms, computer hardware makers and electric utility stocks all struggled. The tiny dairy products group, which is the home of only three stocks, turned in the worst decline as **Lifeway Foods** ([LWAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LWAY)) plunged 15.6% after the company's Q3 results.

Stock Indexes Skid; Uptrend Comes Under Pressure
=================================================

U.S. stock indexes fell for a third session in a row, this time delivering ugly losses.


The Nasdaq skidded 2.1%, closing under its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively. Of the three, only the Dow closed above its 50-day line.




Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The S&P 500's [distribution-day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) count stayed at three. The combination of losses and higher volume gave the index a new distribution day Thursday, but at the same time the S&P junked its July 6 distribution day because of time. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP081017.png)The Nasdaq count rose to seven. Worse yet was the cluster of distribution: The Nasdaq suffered four distribution days in the past six sessions.


Distribution involves a significant decline in a major index in higher volume, which is a sign of institutional selling. Individual investors should never get in a shoving match with the indexes. Funds' buying or selling power is far greater than what individual investors can wield.


IBD's market outlook shifted from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure." That means investors must seek to take some profits and buy stocks with much more care than normal. Cutting losses short becomes even more important in a weaker market environment.


Could the market be marking a short-term bottom? That question might sound premature, even silly. But ifÂ a short-term low is being sketched, it would be in line with this year's action on the Nasdaq. The index has consistently bounced off the 50-day line, though sometimes after a brief and shallow stay under the line.


Rather than play that game again, bulls would probably prefer a heftier pullback. A pullback of 10% to 20% could help chase out the weak holders and perhaps initiate sector rotation.


One gauge for determining whether the market has pegged a short-term bottom is the put/call volume ratio. This secondary indicator closed at 1.08, not quite the elevated level that has marked market lows in the past. A reading of 1.15 or higher is considered bullish for the stock market. The last such day was Jan. 18, when the ratio hit 1.18. From there, the Nasdaq rose 16% in about six months.


Another signal came from the [CBOE Market Volatility Index](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), known also as a measure of investor fear. The VIX, as it's known, soared to the highest level since May 18. The index climbed 45.5% above its 10-day moving average. Any time it leaps more than 20% above its 10-day average, it can confirm a positive reversal in the market.


On Thursday, the best performers among IBD's 197 industry groups were either laggards or defensive stocks. The lowly rated generic drugs, gold miners and dairy products scored the best percentage gains. The day's losers were a mix: department stores, fiber optics and biotechs.


A lineup like that doesn't give the bulls anything fresh to consider.


On a day of pain, investors should pay special attention to stocks that either do well or simply less badly.


Fitness-center chain **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) broke out of a flat pattern in strong volume on a strong earnings report. The stock rose 2.09 to 25.13, clearing a 24.68 buy point.


Credit-card processor **Vantiv** ([VNTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNTV)) followed up on Wednesday's earnings-related breakout with a 2.20 gain to 69.30 in strong volume Thursday.


China-based online auto website **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) rose 1.86 to 56.46 in brisk volume, pegging a new high.


In the less-bad category, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) lost 3.6% in volume 42% above average. The stock pulled under a recent entry but stopped at its 10-day line. The stock remains comfortably above its 50-day and 200-day averages. Apple could eventually set up a second chance at buying the stock.


**Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) lost 3%, which was less than Apple. But Priceline's volume was twice its usual pace. Also, Priceline's chart action is much weaker. On Thursday, Priceline added to Wednesday's 7% gap down, and volume was heavy both days. The stock is below its 50-day line.


One area of recent strength is gold. The iShares Gold Trust ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)) exchange-traded fund rose for a third session in a row.


Economic reports were few Thursday. Jobless claims came in roughly in line with expectations. Friday is also expected to be a quiet day for financial news. The next news to watch comes Wednesday when the Federal Reserve releases the minutes from its July meeting.

The Nasdaq composite once again asserted relative strength. It rose a bit more than its S&P 500 counterpart on Wednesday. Boosted by gains in some retail, computer software and transportation-related stocks, the Nasdaq rallied more than 0.4% in higher volume. Its year-to-date gain expanded to 7.6%. The tech-heavy index nipped at the heels of last Wednesday's all-time closing high of 5106.

  

The S&P 500 mustered only a 0.2% gain. Volume on the NYSE edged slightly lower, but the large-cap index finished well in the lower half of the session's range. It met other technical rules to satisfy the definition of a stalling day, a rare form of distribution.

  

The stalling day is the S&P 500's first since the Nasdaq pushed IBD's market's current outlook to "confirmed uptrend" on May 14.

  

Even at three distribution days each for the Nasdaq and the S&P, a breakout-minded growth investor likely still felt good about the day's action.

  

A fair supply of stocks with solid EPS and RS Ratings made nice gains. The new high list looks a bit more robust these days (see Page B1), thanks in part to strong action among banks. And the Nasdaq's advance-decline line rose again as winners beat losers by more than 2-to-1.

  

What hurt the S&P 500? Blame it on Wednesday's intense selling among mining, oil and the interest-rate-sensitive utility stocks.

  

A relatively harmonious chorus of positive economic reports and the Beige Book, suggesting that overall activity expanded across all 12 reporting districts, seemed to indicate that the Federal Reserve's plan later this year to raise rates from practically zero is well intact.

  

The Dow utilities slid 1.5%. Higher rates raise costs for utilities and make the yield of other financial assets, such as government bonds, more attractive.

  

The IBD 50 gained 0.6%. The S&P SmallCap 600 index and the Russell 2000 both rose 1%.

  

Semiconductor stocks mostly fell, and the Philadelphia SOX soured 0.6%. Yet **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), a longtime resident of the IBD 50, padded its recent rebound off the 10-week moving average. The camera and video chip firm blasted ahead nearly 4% in huge trade. It has a market cap of $3 billion.

  

**Gray TV** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)) (97 Composite, $1.2 billion market cap) was a rare stock leader to sink in heavy trade Wednesday, off 1.8% at 16.09. It sits 8% above a buy point at 14.90.

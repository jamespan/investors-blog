title: Stocks Up, But Breadth Flat; Does This Gauge Point To Excessive Optimism?

Stocks trotted mildly higher on Wednesday, reaffirming the confirmed uptrend. Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE.


As it's done throughout the year, the Nasdaq composite took charge once again. The tech-heavy index gained 0.3% and marked a new all-time closing high. The Nasdaq 100, which consists of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the Nasdaq, rose 0.4%.


Small-cap issues slightly outperformed. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.4%. Perhaps more important is the way this index got that gain.


The S&P 600 started the session weak and touched its rising 50-day moving average. But just before lunchtime on Wall Street, the index's fortunes turned around. By day's end, it closed nearly at session highs.

Without question, the strength of the market advance is moderating. You wouldn't really get a sense of that by just looking at the large daily charts of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 via the link to "General Market Indicators" at the end of this column. Unlike the small-cap gauges, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both show a healthy air pocket above their rising 50-day moving averages, which in turn are well ahead of the 200-day lines.


The distribution-day count on the Nasdaq is high, but in quantity only. The most severe sell-off among the Nasdaq's five [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) (or bouts of intense institutional selling): a 0.6% dip on Oct. 23.


The S&P 500 still has just one distribution day.


However, market internals hint at a little bit of sluggishness among the bulls.


The new high list is still solid, with close to 300 Nasdaq and NYSE-listed stocks making IBD's screen on the new high side vs. around 100 for new lows. Yet in late September and early October, the new highs exceeded 500 or sometimes even 600 stocks.


Market breadth has flattened on the NYSE. (See the S&P 500 daily chart in the link below.) And for the Nasdaq, the advance-decline line has now curled lower for nearly five weeks.


Bullishness among newsletter writers polled each week by Investors Intelligence hit a 5-year high of 64.4%, or nearly two-thirds of the pundits surveyed.


IBD and the Big Picture have long said that the bulls-bears ratio has worked well as a secondary market indicator near major market bottoms. When bearishness exceeds bullishness, it's usually a great time to watch for a follow-through, the earliest signal that stocks may turn higher after a serious pullback.


The 60% level is significant.


In the week ended Oct. 19, 2007, the bulls ratio spiked to 62.0%, a nearly three-year high. At the time, the S&P 500 finished that week at 1500.63. Seventeen months later in March 2009, the large-cap benchmark slumped to 666.


Yet inÂ recent years, a bullish ratio of 60% or higher has led to some mild pullbacks, but they did not open the floodgates of selling that lead to intermediate (10% to 19% declines) or bear-level corrections (20%-plus) that some traders have long been expecting.


At the same time, options investors are still generally bearish. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) appears to be closer to the 1.0 level than 0.5.


There certainly are plenty of things to worry about. And some observers remind investors to continue to watch the trend of earnings, the economy, diplomatic events across the world, and the prospects for meaningful tax reform in U.S., which is now one of the most expensive places for corporations to do business.


Bob Doll, chief strategist at Nuveen, notes that 70% of S&P 500 firms that have reported Q3 results exceeded the Street's consensus view, and the average beat is 7%. Thus, EPS growth is on pace to top 10% for the quarter.



One of the latest examples: **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)), which gapped up 12% to 297.23, shattering a price ceiling near 280 and breaking out of a cup with handle base at 272.97. The laser maker performed a fundamentals trifecta of sorts. Earnings rose 125%, stretching a streak of triple-digit growth to four quarters. Earnings beat the consensus view by nearly 8%. And revenue jumped 97% to $490.3 million, the highest amount of sales in any quarter ever.


Caution is warranted, however, with the member of IBD's scientific and measuring instruments group now having catapulted more than 320% past an initial-stage base breakout at 69.77, all the way back in late January 2016.


"The macroeconomic backdrop that produced this environment includes accelerating global growth, expanding trade levels, low inflation and accommodative monetary policy, even as the Fed increased interest rates 3 times over the last 12 months," Doll wrote in a note to clients.


"Looking ahead to 2018, we expect this backdrop to remain similar, which suggests ongoing support for the pro-growth trade. However, we expect investment conditions may grow more challenging. Volatility has been surprisingly low in 2017, and we think volatility should rise modestly across asset classes as monetary policy tightens and interest rates move higher."

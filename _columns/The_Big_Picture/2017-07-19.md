**Applied Optoelectronics** ([AAOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAOI)). **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)). **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)). **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)). **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)).


Are these seven highfliers and possibly others going to be among the ones that you, your children and friends will talk about five or 10 years from now as superstocks? Of course, no one knows. But judging by Wednesday's market action, it appears that the N in IBD's [CAN SLIM investment system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) just never seems to grow old.


Just as a new U.S. president every four or eight years brings about new challenges, progress, problems and solutions, new bull markets thrive on new stock leadership as well.


Sure, some of the big winners from past bull runs (think **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), up 28% from a breakout at 118.12; Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), up 25% year to date and carving a new base; and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), now on the NYSE, up 33% this year and up 8% past a 47.09 flat-base entry) are fortifying the advance in big-cap and megacap tech-land.


But certainly for the aggressive growth investor, the biggest profits are coming from the smaller, younger names.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP071917-155x300.png)The Nasdaq composite again roasted the bearish thesis that a serious correction is overdue, rising 0.6% on Wednesday and staging a ninth up day in a row. The tech-centered index gained 4.9% in that span. More important than hitting new highs or setting records, its action is accompanied by a chorus of strength seen in all ranges of market capitalization, from mega to big to small.


The S&P 500 was not far behind, rising 0.5% and also eclipsing recent all-time highs. Small caps outperformed sharply, with the S&P SmallCap 600 up nearly 1.2%. The Russell 2000 drove 1% higher.


At 6385, the Nasdaq is still king of the benchmarks in 2017, up 18.6% since Jan. 1 vs. up 10.5% for the 500 and up 6.2% for the Russell 2000.


Volume edged higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. The combination of stout gains in higher volume constitutes accumulation, which is welcome amid the still relatively high levels of distribution days for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 in recent weeks. Keep in mind, though, that among the five instances of heavy professional selling in the Nasdaq, the June 16 distribution day was caused in part by a surge in options expiration-related volume.


Other technical aspects of the market looked sound Wednesday.


* One, breadth was positive, with nearly three times as many stocks rising than falling on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, winners beat losers by a 2-to-1 ratio. IBD's screened new high list has been expanding. On Tuesday, it showed a combined 209 companies logging 52-week or all-time highs vs. just 46 making new lows. The Finance, Medical, Electronics and other sectors have dominated this list as well.
* Two, one cannot ignore the rising demand for equities in other key foreign economic centers. In France, the CAC-40 is up a modest 6.4% year-to-date, but that's progress considering all of the debate over the future of the euro. In China, the Hang Seng index is up 21%.
* Three, measures of investor psychology aren't all at extreme levels. While the CBOE Volatility Index has hung near multiyear lows for weeks, the bullish ratio in the weekly Investors Intelligence survey, part of IBD's [Psychological Market Indicators feature](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), is still significantly below the 63.1% peak seen in early March. Meanwhile, the put-call volume ratio has amazingly remained well north of 0.50 for months.
* In May, margin debt grew 19.7% vs. year-ago levels, still well below the extreme levels seen at the end of the 2003-2007 bull run. ([See the chart here](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=margindebt).)
* Finally, leading stocks are showing strength, even if they may already be well past proper buy points.


Applied Optoelectronics, which rocketed off its 50-day moving average around 63 on July 7 in muscular turnover, gained 2.6% to 92.51 in heavy turnover, expanding the rally. The stock is a member of IBD's superstrict growth screen, [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders). In the same screen, **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)), **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) are basing.


In IBD Stock Spotlight, **Sierra Wireless** ([SWIR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWIR)) and Veeva are basing and showing outstanding fundamentals.


Don't forget to check IBD's weekly feature, [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/).


A look at the top third of IBD's 33 sectors seems to send this message: Invest in growth.


The top five sectors are Electronics, Chips, Computer, Leisure and Building (see the [entire rankings of 33 sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jul-18-2017/) by going to the [NYSE + Nasdaq stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the Data Tables section of Stock Lists at Investors.com). They reflect the insatiable demand for data and entertainment, as well as the slow yet steady rebound in consumer spending and home prices.


It may be enticing to find the bottom in oil stocks, given the nifty 1.5% gain in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices on the back of a surprise dip in U.S. weekly inventories. However, not everyone can pick the bottom. And share prices in a given sector can remain low for months, if not years. It's always best to wait for strength to return.


The Energy sector ranks dead last at No. 33, down 8.6% year-to-date through Tuesday's close.

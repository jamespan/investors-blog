A new rally attempt by the stock market is on the ropes after the major indexes fell sharply Monday in a tech-driven decline.




Indexes started rebounding last week. But the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 soon retreated, turning back below their 50-day moving averages after briefly regaining those levels.


The Nasdaq composite slid 1.5% Monday, its third loss of more than 1% in the past six sessions. The composite closed 77 points above last Monday's low, the nadir of the current market correction so far.


A sell-off in technology and especially semiconductors hurt the tech-heavy Nasdaq more than other indexes. The S&P 500 — which is 21.3% invested in technology compared with 46% for the Nasdaq — lost 0.7%.

Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE. Declining stocks led advancers by a 2-1 ratio on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


Chip Stocks Routed
------------------


Semiconductor and telecom equipment stocks sold off after U.S. businesses [started halting the supply of critical software and components to China's Huawei Technologies](https://www.investors.com/news/huawei-techgiants-google-intel-qualcomm/). The Trump administration suspects Huawei poses national security risks. The rift underscores a hostile time in U.S.-China trade relations, a dispute that has rattled Wall Street.


IBD's chipmaking, chip equipment and chip design industry groups were down 3% to 4% and in the bottom five of [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-may-17-2019/). The Philadelphia semiconductor index gapped down to a loss of 4% and seems headed for its 200-day moving average, at about 1,322.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) fell 1.4%, with software stocks among the worst performing. **Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) was the largest decliner in the IBD 50 after plummeting nearly 13% in heavy trading. Robert W. Baird downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform. Reports said the electronic measurement technology company has exposure to Huawei.

Technically, not all is lost for the market's rally attempt. As long as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq hold above last week's lows, the chance for a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) is intact. With the market moving on headlines more than fundamentals, a big spike could happen — up or down.


That's the market's double-edged sword: Setbacks in trade talks or other flash points such as Iran could easily undo any new market gains.


Fear Gauges Spike
-----------------


A possible bottoming signal appeared last week when the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) topped 1.15. Such readings indicate elevated fear in the market and often coincide with market bottoms. The [CBOE Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) gave similar signals in early May, but the rebound in stocks was brief.


At the moment, it requires pinpoint precision to make profitable trades. For example, [India stocks and ETFs rallied](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/india-stocks-soar-as-key-indexes-hit-record-highs/) Monday after polls indicated a victory for pro-business Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party.


Don't expect many India-like opportunities to come up. Until the market correction ends, avoid any stock purchases and take some profits. Be sensitive to sell signals, such as sharp breaks of support at the 10-week moving average. [Sell any stock that falls more than 7% or 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from the purchase price.


Defensive stocks are providing some shelter, as they usually do in bad markets. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) edged higher and briefly topped the 59.17 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).

  Stock Market Jumps Despite Election Uncertainty; Astera Labs, Palantir Lead Tech Rally

The stock market rally gained traction Tuesday as Americans went to the polls and cast their ballots for the 47th president of the United States.  


Bullish earnings from **Astera Labs** ([ALAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALAB)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) had technology investors in a good mood right from the start. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4% in higher volume and reclaimed its short-term moving averages. The Nasdaq's Oct. 1 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) fell off the count because enough time has passed (25 sessions) to make it irrelevant. That brings the Nasdaq's count down to three.  




Stocks held strong gains early even when the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.366%. But the yield reversed lower and was trading around 4.28% near 4:30 p.m. ET. That helped the Russell 2000 small-cap index outperform with a gain of 1.9%. The small-cap index is back above all of its key moving averages and less than 2% from an all-time high.


The surge in the 10-year yield since mid-September comes even as the Federal Reserve gets set to cut its key lending rate by another 25 basis points Thursday. That would bring the federal funds rate down to a range of 4.50%-4.75%. Futures traders tracked by [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) think there's a 76% chance that the Fed will cut by another 25 basis points at the December meeting.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with gains of 1.2% and 1%, respectively. Volume on the NYSE rose slightly from Monday. It was a bullish session despite uncertainty about the presidential and congressional races. Polls show a tight race for control of the White House and Congress.

The Dow Jones jumped above its 50-day line and reclaimed the 42,000 level. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 are back above their short-term moving averages.


Breadth was strong and improved as the session wore on, with advancing stocks beating decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1. Over on the NYSE, winners beat losers by nearly 5-to-1. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), one of the better gauges of breadth on the NYSE, jumped 1.2% and reclaimed its 50-day moving average after three straight closes below the line.

**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which is set to join the Dow Jones industrials Friday before the open, jumped 2.8% in light turnover. After sellers knocked the stock off highs Monday, Nvidia rallied back above its 10-day moving average. Now the AI chip leader has its sights set on its recent high of 144.42. Nvidia is now the world's most valuable company — just in front of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) — with a market capitalization just above $3.4 trillion.


AI-related stocks generally performed well after Astera Labs reported [Q3 revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/astera-labs-alab-stock-rockets-q3-report/) of $113.1 million, up 206% year over year and nicely above the $98 million consensus. Q4 revenue guidance was also above expectations. The stock blasted out of a very deep, first-stage cup-with-handle base. But keep in mind that ALAB has more than doubled after hitting a low of 36.02 in August. Rather than chase the stock, it's best to watch for a low-volume pullback at this point


Palantir, another big player in the AI space as a provider of data analytics software, soared more than 23%. The stock market leader reported its fourth straight quarter of [accelerating revenue growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-palantir-earnings-news-q32024/). But it's way past a proper entry after shares surged 21% in August, also on strong earnings.


**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), yet another AI stock, is trading tightly just above its 10-week moving average with earnings due Thursday after the close.


Stocks To Watch
---------------


There's no doubt that a large number of growth stocks continue to act well. But there's also an ample supply of top-rated growth stocks that are extended far past proper entries. At this point, it's a good idea to put the big leaders on a watchlist and wait for alternate entries.


The stock market has served up plenty of chart breakouts, including recent new issue **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)), which gapped up sharply last week after reporting strong earnings. If Reddit can hold below last week's high, a short consolidation phase, or [shelf](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-shelf-pattern-and-why-it-is-perfect-pyramiding-tool-in-growth-stocks/), could yield a new entry.


Enterprise software stock **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and GPS device leader **Garmin** ([GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)) are also good candidates for the watchlist after earnings breakouts last week.


**Affirm** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)), known for its buy-now-pay-later model, has been holding support at its 10-week line with earnings due Thursday after the close. It's still a compelling growth story amid booming revenue growth in recent quarters. It's also right on the cusp of profitability.



Stocks building bases are tougher to find. But if you do find them, make sure the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is at or near highs.


While several homebuilders have come under selling pressure, **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) has a bullish relative strength line as it forms a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 71.95 entry. In the medical products group, **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) is near the top of a flat base with a 243.98 buy point.

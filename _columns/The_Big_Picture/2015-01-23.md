Stocks sauntered to a mixed finish Friday, wrapping up the week in a quiet way.

  

The Nasdaq tacked on 0.2%, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.5%. The IBD 50 added 0.4%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

With the market back in a confirmed uptrend, individual investors can scout the market for quality breakouts.

  

So far this year, the market hasn't been especially friendly to bulls or bears. The major indexes have been in a U-turn mode. The Nasdaq formed a W-like pattern — down, up, down, up — over just three weeks.

  

This kind of action can make things hard on IBD-style investors, especially if they overreact on both the buy and sell side.

  

Keep in mind that the IBD ideal isn't to play each minor move in the market. It is to latch onto a high-conviction stock that the individual investor can comfortably hold through the blips.

  

Last year, **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) was the poster child for this kind of investing. The stock broke out a little more than a year ago, crossing a buy point near 28.60. Skyworks was up about 37% from the buy point by the time it began its first pullback in March — trimming the profit to 19% before resuming its rise.

  

A more severe test came in October, when Skyworks trimmed a 107% gain to 54%.

  

On Friday, Skyworks thrust 2% to a new high. Volume was strong as the stock closed at 80.86, up 182% from the year-ago entry.

  

Now imagine what the recent market volatility is like for the individual investor who latched onto Skyworks early and held through subsequent turbulence, and still has those shares.

  

An individual investor positioned to sit on a big gain is far more relaxed than the investor scrambling to micromanage minor gains in stocks that are proving themselves frustratingly flawed and erratic.

  

Identifying a big winner early isn't easy. But IBD's ratings can reduce the candidates to a manageable level.

  

This should be the IBD investor's goal for 2015: Find a quality stock that might rise enough to let you to sit through turbulence.

  

On Friday, two more leaders broke out.

  

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) gapped up 7% in huge volume. Same-store sales were stronger than the Street expected.**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) popped 2% in heavy volume, emerging from a second-stage pattern.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 rose about 3%, the Nasdaq 2.7% and the S&P 500 1.6%.

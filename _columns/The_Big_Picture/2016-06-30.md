Stock indexes jumped Thursday for a third day in a row, as the market shook off the gloom from Britain's decision to leave the European Union.


The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average each sprinted 1.3%, while the S&P 500 ran up 1.4%. The IBD 50 popped 1.7%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


The three days of strong price gains in above-average volume constituted a rare, Day 3 follow-through. A follow-through signals that the market is in an uptrend. That's a signal to investors to increase exposure to stocks.

What sort of stance should be taken after this quick U-turn?


Although quality stocks breaking out of solid chart patterns can be bought, individual investors should exercise some caution for several reasons.


First, a Day 3 follow-through is rare. The most recent previous case was Dec. 16 on the S&P 500. However, two sessions later the uptrend was back under pressure. All uptrends include a confirmation, but not all confirmations prove accurate.


Second, the charts of the major indexes are just plain ugly. Action over the past three weeks has been wide and sloppy. It would be best if the indexes would now begin advancing in a disciplined fashion.


Third, follow-through days in June and July have a history mostly of failure. (August, however, has historically been a better month for successful bullish signals.)


Fourth, the long-term picture cries out for caution. After setting a peak of 5231.94 last July, the Nasdaq has been in a rolling, choppy descent for 11 months. Lower lows were pegged in August and February on the Nasdaq. And lower highs on the Nasdaq have ratcheted resistance down from the 5200 area to around 5000.


Does that sound like a bull market?


There's more: The S&P 500 has had lower lows in roughly the same period as the Nasdaq, but resistance has remained steady at just over 2100. That 2100 level is being tested now. The Nasdaq faces a longer hike to test the 5000 level.


Weigh all these factors and it's easy to be cautious, maybe even too cautious.


Quality stocks are providing some breakouts, and the prudent investor will test one or two with half positions that are completed only if the stock continues to work.


Recent breakouts include China-based online gamer **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), China educator **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)), chip designer **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) and employee benefits oursourcer **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)).


Stocks close to a buy point include **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) and **Vantiv** ([VNTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNTV)).


Economic news was mostly constructive Thursday.


After Wednesday's close, the Federal Reserve revealed the results of its stress tests. Of 33 banks, only two failed. The U.S. units of **Deutsche Bank** ([DB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DB)) failed for the second year in a row. Spain-based **Banco Santander**'s ([SAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAN)) U.S. units failed for the third consecutive year.


In the U.K., the Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, said additional stimulus is likely. The U.S. indexes started picking up steam after the news came out.


The Chicago PMI number for June trounced the Street's consensus estimate, pointing to improved economic conditions. On Friday, the Institute for Supply Management will report its June number. The Street's consensus is 51.5. The range of estimates runs from 50 to 53.

  Stock Market Plunges As Treasury Yields Surge; Jobs Report On Deck

The stock market posted a dispiriting performance Thursday, as the major stock indexes plunged, immediately surrendering the entirety of [Wednesday's Fed-fueled gains](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-begins-two-fisted-tightening-dow-jones-volatile/). Next up, the April jobs report is due out before Friday's market open, which could lead to more volatile market action.




The 10-year Treasury yield surged above 3%, closing at 3.07% Thursday — its highest level since November 2018.


On the news front, **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) climbed 2.8% after [Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-gets-7-billion-in-fresh-financing-for-twitter-deal-11651748316) he received $7 billion in new financing for his deal to buy the social media company. On the downside, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) plunged more than 8% to close back below its 50- and 200-day lines.


On the earnings front, energy leaders **APA** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)), **Chesapeake Energy** ([CHK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHK)), **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) and **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) — along with **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) — were key earnings movers Thursday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP050522-234x300.jpg)APA shares tumbled 8.6%. Chesapeake reversed from heavy losses to gain 0.6%. [Conoco](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-majors-bp-shell-and-conocophillips-earnings-on-tap-amid-high-oil-prices/) shares dropped 1%. And Continental Resources rallied 1.1%. [Fertilizer leader CF](https://www.investors.com/news/mosaic-nutrien-earnings-due-as-booming-fertilizer-stocks-test-key-support/) slid 1.7%. Cybersecurity leader [Fortinet](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ftnt-stock-fortinet-earnings-news-q12022/) reversed 1% lower. [Shopify stock dived](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-stock-shopify-earnings-news-acquisition-deliverr-q1/) nearly 15%.


The April jobs report — due out Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET — is expected to show that nonfarm payrolls grew 400,000, per Econoday estimates. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.6%.


Stock Market Correction Worsens
-------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dived 3.1% Thursday, while the S&P 500 tumbled 3.6%. Both are still below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


The Nasdaq composite plunged 5%, its worst session since June 11, 2020. And the small-cap Russell 2000 slid 4%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


The S&P sectors all closed lower, with consumer discretionary and technology the biggest losers, sliding 6.5% and 5.8%, respectively. Utilities was the best performer, but even this defensive sector dropped 1.7%.


Growth stocks snapped a two-day win streak, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) declined 3.2%, holding just above Monday's 52-week low. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD))slid more than 9%, closing right below the 50-day line.


With Thursday's big losses, the stock market rally attempt is in peril. The Nasdaq's rally attempt is dead because the tech-heavy composite hit new correction lows. The market still has a chance with the S&P 500, which is clinging just above Monday's lows. Friday will be Day 5 of a rally attempt.


But it's hard to imagine the market mounting a sustained rally after the way that hopeful gains on April 25, April 28, Monday and Wednesday were so swiftly met with selling.


Continue to keep a watchlist of stocks that are holding up well. They could be market leaders during the next uptrend, whenever that happens.

Exxon Mobil Is A Stock Market Leader
------------------------------------



Energy giant **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), for example, is one of the top stocks to watch after Wednesday's breakout past a cup-with-handle's 89.90 buy point. The stock closed just above the entry despite Thursday's 1.5% loss. The 5% buy area goes up to 94.40, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [XOM stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-exxon-mobil-corp-xom.aspx) boasts a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Meanwhile, the stock's RS line made a new high this week, as the energy leader attempts to shrug off the market weakness and oil stocks benefit from surging crude prices.


Remember that the current market conditions are not conducive to new purchases. Still, the stock is holding up well in a volatile market, so it should be placed on a watchlist.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) is another one of the top stocks to watch. Shares are about 4% away from a flat base's 149.52 entry.

  Growth Stocks Keep Bullish Character; Is This Index Going To Make It 8 Straight Weeks Up?

Crises that hit the world and Wall Street will come and go. The subject of the mainstream media headlines surely will change. And over time, so will the uppermost echelon of [top growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/).




What will not change? Meaningful sector rotations.


For proof in the fourth quarter, let's highlight the small caps.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund tracks the popular index of companies with market caps generally less than $6 billion. It rallied 1% on Tuesday and etched a new all-time closing high. The Russell still has a shot to mark an eighth straight up week; over the prior seven weeks, it's surged a total 28%.


According to internet sources, the current median market value of stocks within the Russell 2000 is around $2.3 billion.


S&P 500 Pulls Back Mildly
-------------------------


The ETF's fine session beat a 0.5% gain by the Nasdaq composite, which wiped away skinny losses in the prior two sessions. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gave up 0.2% for its third straight session of yawn-inspiring declines.


As to be expected, winners led losers by a modest margin on the Nasdaq (a little more than 300 stocks). On the NYSE, decliners outpaced risers by a nearly 4-3 margin. Meanwhile, volume rose on the Nasdaq. That's exactly what you want to see on an up day. Plus, hundreds of Nasdaq-listed issues raced to 52-week or all-time highs. (See the exact figures at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). [In Monday's list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-dec-21-2020/), 198 Nasdaq issues hit new highs; only 11 sank to new lows.)


![MP122220](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP122220-201x300.jpg)Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied more than 1% Tuesday.


Following a long-awaited Republican-Democrat compromise in Congress on a $900 billion rescue package for individuals and small businesses hit hard by Covid-19, the extra fiscal spending surely gives small-cap stocks an extra boost. Smaller firms tend to lack the financial wherewithal to survive economic plunges. Companies in the S&P 500 or S&P 100 generally have seen that movie before.


Huge Recovery In The Third Quarter
----------------------------------


The final figure of U.S. GDP arrived Tuesday, with the economy rebounding 33.4% on an annualized rate in Q3. That beat the 33.1% estimate at Econoday. GDP plummeted at a 31.4% rate in the second quarter this year.


Year to date, the 19% gain in iShares Russell 2000 hardly holds a candle to a 45.6% advance by the Nasdaq 100, which monitors the 100 largest nonfinancial firms on that all-electronic exchange. Indeed, big- and megacap techs are going to exit 2020 with a bang. Yet quarter to date, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) holds an 11% gain since the Sept. 30 close vs. a 32% pop by the small-cap ETF over the same time frame.


And it's not just the mighty mites that are wearing the big pants in this Santa Claus bull run.


A small yet definitively noticeable number of dynamic companies in so-called emerging market economies have roared to new highs.


Emerging?
---------


**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) will finish the year in championship form. After dawdling around a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 1,270.10 in an awkward-looking cup base in October, the e-commerce juggernaut in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru and other parts of Latin America really turned it on a few weeks after the Nov. 3 U.S. elections.



That breakout came on top of a highly [bullish breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) on May 6 — just a month after the S&P 500 followed through on April 6. So, from that breakout from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 633.30, gains have now compounded to 173%.


MercadoLibre is not trading in an emerging markets vacuum.


**StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)), **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)), **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) have sparkled after they each made strong breakouts. The latter two hold a spot in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


On a portfolio-weighted basis, Leaderboard stocks have carved out a 57% gain year to date through Monday, vs. a 14% rise by the S&P 500, excluding dividends.

**Rackspace Technology** ([RXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RXT)) is forming a [handle on its somewhat deep but reasonable cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/).


The 42 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is both fair and unfair. It's fair, because Rackspace actually hasn't really risen much since it went public — again — at 21 a share on Aug. 5. It's unfair, because the RS Rating is truly engineered to cover 12 months' worth of price action.


Rackspace actually is not a brand-new IPO. In 2016, the San Antonio-based cloud computing pioneer departed the public market in a $4.3 billion private equity deal mastered by Apollo Global Management.


In addition to Rackspace, 41 more growth stocks held a spot on the [Ready List for IBD Live show attendees](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-live-qa-summary-leebriceleebricehappyendingsdontbelieveeverythingyouthink-key-stock-lists-for-tuesday-dec-22-2020/).


Small cap **Bandwidth** ([BAND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAND)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) and **Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)) also generated plenty of chart analysis on the [Zoom platform-driven show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A). Bandwidth, which has posted three terrific quarters in a row of hearty earnings per share and robust sales growth, shows a market value of $4.6 billion. At $8.2 billion, Axon, formerly known as Taser International, sits squarely in midcap land.


Also Tuesday, the Dow Jones utility average dropped 0.4%. The Dow transports eased 0.2%.

  Stocks Fall As Tax Bill Nears Final Passage; Apple Singes Techs

A fright in the technology sector caused the Nasdaq composite and small caps to sink Tuesday, while the rest of the market saw only moderate selling.




 The Nasdaq fell 0.4% and the S&P 500 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average eased less than 0.2%. But the Russell 2000 slid 0.8%, as small caps' attempt to rally keeps getting frustrated.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. While that showed institutional investors weren't selling shares massively, they did spread around their selling: Declining stocks led advancers by about 9-to-5.


Technology shares took some blows after an analyst downgraded one of the most important stocks in the sector.  Nomura cut **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) to neutral from buy and lowered its target price to 175 from 185. "We argue that the stock's gains for the iPhone X supercycle are in the late innings," analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said.


Apple slid 1% and closed below the 176.34 buy point of Monday's breakout. That's not a mortal wound for Apple, but the stock does have long coattails in its supplier universe. Those cousin stocks were mixed Tuesday.



**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), another big component of the Nasdaq and Dow as well, fell less than 1% and is now below the 86.30 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) it had just cleared Friday.


Market indicators are not causing much worry. The number of distribution days remains tolerable. The advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE are making new highs again.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain in four-month price channels that are tilting higher. But both indexes are at the tops of those channels, so a pullback is possible.


On Tuesday, the House of Representatives gave final approval to a sweeping tax bill, and the Senate could vote on it as early as Tuesday night. A report late Tuesday said the House would vote again on the measure to correct a procedural error. Most taxpayers will get a tax cut, and the big prize is for U.S. corporations, whose tax rate shrinks to 21% from 35%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MP_4x1_121917-239x300.png)At this time of year, a Santa Claus rally is possible too. This refers to a tendency in stocks to climb in December and more specifically the last week of December, around Christmas and New Year's Day. But a rally in the closing days of the year hasn't happened since 2013.


Some interest-rate-sensitive industry groups were broadly weaker. IBD's property REIT industry group fell 2%, the third worst performance among [197 IBD industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). The four utility industry groups that IBD tracks were down 1.1% to 2%.


These dividend-rich assets appeared to be falling out of favor as Treasury yields jump. The benchmark yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 6 basis points Tuesday to 2.46%, near the Oct. 25 high. Yields started rising after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last Wednesday, and the tax bill seems to have pushed yields higher also. Surprisingly, financials were modestly lower.


Consumer and energy industry groups were higher. U.S. oil prices edged up 30 cents to $57.46 a barrel.


Restaurants climbed 1.4%, where **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) and **Darden Restaurants** ([DRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRI)) broke out. Darden on Tuesday [beat profit and sales expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/olive-garden-parent-darden-beats-navistar-crushes-profit-views/). Specialty retail and apparel were two other groups up around 1%.


Health care and transportation stocks were other positive areas. **Navistar** ([NAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NAV)) climbed past the 45.57 buy point of a cup-without-handle base in tremendous volume. The truck manufacturer sped past expectations for its October-ended quarter.

There was a lot of green in the stock market Monday as a shortened week of trading got underway, but growth investors saw a lot of red, particularly in the software sector.




Several leading industry groups in the software sector ended lower Monday. IBD's enterprise software group gave back around 1%, but big leaders in the group like [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) and **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) are still holding above their 10-day moving averages.


Sellers were in **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) for the second straight session, but it recovered off lows after finding support at its 21-day exponential moving average.


After 11 straight gains, sellers finally came into **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)). The stock tumbled nearly 10% and flashed an outside day, but it's still early in the week so it'll be important to see what the weekly close looks like. Because of an explosive gain from a 25.33 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), Fastly is still a candidate to form a [high, tight flag](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-tesla-stock-rally-high-tight-flag-base/). Either way, it needs to consolidate gains for a new entry to present itself.


Several other leading groups in the stock market lagged Monday including internet retailers, biotech and networking stocks.


Stock Market Indexes
--------------------


But the major stock indexes showed once again why they remain in confirmed uptrends.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP062920-244x300.jpg)


The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.3%, helped by a 14% rally in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)).


Shares were strong after certification flights began Monday for the 737 Max. Meanwhile, strength in airline stocks and cruise line operators helped lift the S&P 500 to a gain of 1.5%.


The S&P 500 closed slightly below its 200-day moving average Friday but held above the psychologically important 3000 level. It hit an intraday low Monday of 2999.90.


The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.2%, and small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 3.1%.


Retailer **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) is one of the higher-weighted stocks in iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)). Shares of BJ's jumped 6% in light turnover to 37.87 as the top-performing retailer works on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 38.45 buy point.



BJ's was one of the top gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), along with **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), which rallied more than 6.5% to 35.07. After a sharp pullback, Crocs has rallied sharply off lows and is just below a 36.76 buy point.


Of the S&P 500's 11 sectors, consumer discretionary and consumer staple stocks were among the best performers.


It was a rough open for the stock market. The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 1% intraday, but it turned higher around 10 a.m. ET along with the Dow Jones and S&P 500. The catalyst was news that pending home sales soared 44.3% in May, well above the consensus estimate of 11.3%.


IShares U.S. Home Construction ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) surged just over 3%. Top-rated [homebuilders](http://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/) near highs include **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)), **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)).


Distribution Days
-----------------


The Nasdaq composite reclaimed its 21-day exponential moving average Monday after closing slightly below the line Friday. It's a key support level to watch because the Nasdaq found support there in May and earlier this month. (Please see the latest [Weekend Stock Market Update](https://www.investors.com/tag/weekend-stock-market-update/) for more analysis on the Nasdaq's 21-day line.)


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffered [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) Friday. Volume was heavy due to the rebalancing of the Russell stock indexes. Monday's gains came in lower volume.

The S&P 500 now shows five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), a yellow flag to be sure. But distribution days remain well contained on the Nasdaq as leading growth stocks aren't showing  much in the way of sell signals. Many continue to trade quite well.


As always, take stock of your current holdings. In some cases, taking partial profits might make sense. But overall, leading growths are still holding their own.


Growth stocks faced another round of selling pressure early Monday but damage was minimal by the close. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) plunged 1.8% intraday but recovered nicely for a fractional gain. Last week, FFTY fell 1.3%, but that was much better than a 2.9% decline for the S&P 500 and 1.9% decline for the Nasdaq.



**Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) was a top gainer [in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) Monday, up 4.8% to 25.91. It broke out over a trend line and closed just below a 26.15 entry. Group peer **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) also cleared a trend line and closed just below a 34.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Kroger is Monday's [IBD 50 Growth Stocks To Watch showcase](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-ibd-50-stock-kroger-stock-nears-new-buy-point/).


Software stocks took heat in the MarketSmith Growth 250, including **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)). But RingCentral is still holding support at its 50-day moving average, while Twilio and HubSpot still trade above their 21-day lines. Zoom Video is still testing its 10-day line.

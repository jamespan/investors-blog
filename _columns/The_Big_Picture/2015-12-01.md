Stocks Rise, Indexes Aim To Pass Recent Highs
==============================================

The stock market finished a seesaw session higher Tuesday as it set its sights on new highs. The S&P 500 rallied 1.1% and the Nasdaq 0.9%, closing at the day's highs despite shifting direction much of the day.


In fact, since the Nov. 16 lows, indexes have been getting back into a trend of closing near session highs — a positive indication at least in the short term.


The way the market acted Tuesday, you wouldn't have thought a gloomy economic report was among the highlights.

The Institute for Supply Management said U.S. [manufacturing activity fell](http://news.investors.com/economy/120115-783110-manufacturing-falls-to-surprise-contraction-levels.htm?ref=HPLNews&t=1449004980970&cachecheck=1) to 48.6 in November. That not only missed forecasts but also marked a contraction in factory activity, to the lowest level since June 2009. (The Purchasing Managers' Manufacturing Index was better.)


Stocks gave up early gains as soon as the ISM headline came out at 10 a.m. ET. But soon enough, they started recovering, unevenly until buyers got serious in the afternoon.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The IBD 50 climbed 1.1%. Its Internet and technology components shined, while homebuilder **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) rallied 7% to a new high in heavy trading.


Construction spending rose 1% in October, above expectations. That helped homebuilders and other building-related industry groups to gains of more than 1%.


Tuesday's advance left the market within striking distance of near-term highs. The S&P 500 closed above the 2100 level and is about 14 points from a one-month high. Similarly, the Nasdaq is just a few points away from the Nov. 3 high at 5163.


The indexes now will try to make it three straight months of gains — a streak that hasn't happened on the S&P 500 since the first half of 2014.


But Wall Street has some history in its favor. December tends to be a good month for the stock market. Historically, it is the best month for the S&P 500 and the second best for the Nasdaq, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.


Small caps often outperform in the second half of December. And while the existence of Santa Claus is debatable, there is strong evidence that a Santa Claus rally takes shape in the closing days of December. Since 1969, the market has been up an average of 1.4% in that final stretch, the Almanac notes.


Despite a higher-than-normal level of distribution days, there is no obvious stress on the market. In the past week and a half, any index losses have been modest.


But if there is a fault line, it's in market breadth.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line basically has been flat since the Aug. 24 index low, even as the index has advanced smartly.


Obviously, many stocks have been left behind in the latest uptrend. Which ones? Small caps, to name one group.


The Russell 2000 is still 7% below its prior high, while the big-cap S&P 500 is just 1% below its high.


The NYSE advance-decline line, however, is acting better.


On Tuesday, winning stocks led losers by 12-to-5 on the NYSE and by a much more moderate 9-to-7 on the Nasdaq.

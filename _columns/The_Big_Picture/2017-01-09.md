Strength in semiconductor stocks and some biotech names helped boost the Nasdaq to a 0.2% gain Monday, but small caps diverged again with the Russell 2000 down 0.7%.


Last week, the Nasdaq composite index jumped 2.6% but the Russell 2000 closed near its low for the week, mustering a gain of just 0.7%. For the bull camp, it would be good to see the Nasdaq and Russell moving in unison, but that hasn't been the case lately. It's a yellow flag at this point; nothing more, nothing less.


Oil prices fell hard, weighing on the performance of the S&P 500 and Dow industrials. Both indexes eased nearly 0.4%. Volume on the Nasdaq rose slightly from Friday's levels. NYSE volume fell a bit.


![mp010917](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP010917.png)The IBD 50 eked out a 0.1% gain.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude oil futures slumped nearly 4% to $51.96 a barrel after **Baker Hughes** ([BHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHI)) said the number of active U.S. oil rigs rose for a tenth straight week, hinting at further gains in U.S. crude production.


There was some encouraging action beneath the surface, particularly in the medical sector, as the JPMorgan Health Care conference got underway in San Francisco.


**Incyte Pharmaceuticals** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) soared 9% to 118.53 on news ofÂ  a partnership with **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)). The biotech blasted out of flat base with a 110.05 buy point. Because Incyte gapped up in price, the open price of 113.55 is also a valid entry. Incyte ended the session near the high end of a buy range from the 113.55 entry.


Investors always have the choice of focusing on highly speculative, nonprofitable biotechs or more liquid, profitable names like Incyte. When given a choice, prefer the latter because these are the names that tend to gain favor quickly among institutional investors.


**Glaukos** ([GKOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GKOS)), meanwhile, jumped nearly 6% to 38.35. The glaucoma treatment firm followed through nicely after Friday's breakout over a 36.10 handle buy point.


IBD 50 name **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) soared 6% to 42.96 as it works on a flat base with a 45.10 entry.


 HealthEquity has the look of a potential market leader. Not only is it a new issue, but it's also adapting quite well to new conditions in the health care industry. The company is well positioned for continued growth as Americans turn to health savings accounts to fund out-of-pocket medical expenses.
With major averages perched near all-time highs, one would think it would be a favorable environment to make money in stocks. While that's true to some extent, it remains a challenging environment. For every breakout that's working, there seem to be a few others that are not.


One of the easiest ways to gauge market health is simply by looking at your current holdings. Are recent new buys holding comfortably above recent buy points? If so, that's a good sign. Most financials and some infrastructure stocks are doing that right now.


But what about recent breakouts? Are they working or not? This is where it gets trickier, because it's been a mixed bag at best in recent weeks. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), for example, tried to clear a long cup-with-handle base last week but shares reversed in heavy volume Friday. It's still holding above a 129.39 buy point but the breakout hasn't gotten going yet.


The bottom line is that if new buys are having trouble making headway, take that as a cue to slow down the pace of new buys. With distribution days falling off the count recently, the market uptrend must still be respected, but watching the action of new buys is also paramount.


Another yellow flag worth monitoring is the CBOE VIX volatility index. The index's recent slide points toward a complacent market, which is not what you want to see as stock indexes are trying to break out to the upside.

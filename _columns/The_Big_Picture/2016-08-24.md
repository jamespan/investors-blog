What looked like another quiet and orderly session for the stock market Wednesday ended up loud and disorderly by the close, prompting a shift in market outlook.


Losses were mild and volume was light in the morning, but a wave of selling in the afternoon resulted in a bearish session for stocks. The Nasdaq composite slumped 0.8%, the S&P 500 0.5% and the Dow 0.4%. Small caps fell mostly in line with the Nasdaq, with the Russell 2000 down 0.9%. The IBD 50 underperformed, falling 1.4%.

Volume rose on both exchanges, adding a distribution day to the count. Several prior distribution days in the indexes didn't have the feel of heavy institutional selling, but Wednesday's session did because of the noticeable weakness in highflying stocks and the intense selling late in the day.


Because of those factors, IBD's market outlook was changed from confirmed uptrend to uptrend under pressure. Investors should consider taking profits and be especially mindful to cut losses short. It's a good idea to avoid adding stocks for now.


Some highflying new issues like **Acacia** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Line** ([LN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LN)) and **Yirendai** ([YRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YRD)) fell hard, with losses ranging from 4% to 22%.


A rally in the U.S. dollar against most other currencies fueled a sell-off in mining stocks. IBD's gold and silver mining industry group was the session's worst performer, falling around 8%. Oil slumped nearly 3% to $46.77 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported an unexpected rise in stockpiles.


The biotech industry group reversed in spectacular fashion. The group was up when the market was down in the morning but ended with a loss of nearly 4%. It was also among the worst-performing groups.


The market had been jittery for a while about the path of interest rates. Wall Street will be listening closely to what Fed chief Janet Yellen has to say Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo. In recent weeks, several Fed officials have hinted that a rate hike is coming before the end of the year. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 21.


There's no shortage of technical and psychological indicators saying the market could be ready to pull back. For starters, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed below their 10-day moving average lines for the first time since the June 30 follow-through day. The Nasdaq has made an unusually long eight-week winning streak.


Meanwhile, according to the latest data from Investors Intelligence, the percentage of newsletter writers who are bullish is now 56.7%, up from 56.2% a week ago. Both are above 55%, which is considered a danger level. Bears were barely unchanged at 20.2%.


The bull-bear spread increased to +36.5% from last week's 36.2%. That continues to signal caution with the widest positive difference since early 2015. The spread has been above +30% for five straight weeks. (A spread above 40% may signal danger.)


These indicators are important to monitor, but the other thing to keep in mind is that the more talk there is about an imminent market pullback, the less likely it is to happen. A confirmed uptrend that's now under pressure could have more left, but an elevated distribution-day count, plus weak action in leading growth stocks, is worth heeding. Now is the time to play defense, not offense.


Speaking of defense, the **iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond** ([TLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLT)) ETF is moving sideways and holding above its 50-day moving average as it works on a new base.

The stock market moved higher Friday and booked weekly gains, bolstered by strong **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) earnings. Results from Magnificent Seven name **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) are among the noteworthy events in the coming week.


The Nasdaq composite was the strongest performer out of the major indexes Friday, rising 0.6%. This helped the tech-heavy index, which sits above its short-term moving averages as well as its [50-day moving line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), to a weekly gain of 0.8%. While it remains off July highs, it is now up 23.2% for 2024.




The S&P 500 notched an all-time closing high as it rose 0.4% Friday. The benchmark index notched a 0.9% lift for the week and holds a 1.8% gain for the month. The index is sitting pretty above all its moving averages and is now up 23% for the year.


Advancers led decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both indexes.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also made a new closing high after squeezing out a paltry 0.1% gain. Its weekly lift came in at 1%. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fared best while **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) lagged, falling 3.1% after Q3 revenue came in weaker than expected.


Small caps gave up slight ground on the stock market Friday, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.2%. Nevertheless, the index ended the week up nearly 2%. Growth stocks had a lukewarm session, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rising 0.1%. Its recent uptrend continues, and it now sits nearly 6% above its 50-day line.

Gold miners, medical systems and equipment stocks, airlines and alternative energy plays were among the best performers.

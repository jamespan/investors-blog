Semiconductor stocks have garnered their share of headlines in recent days, and it was more of the same Wednesday as chip stocks lifted the Nasdaq to another day of outperformance. In stock news today, Nomura initiated coverage of **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) with buy ratings.




That fueled a new round of buying in the chip sector, coupled with reports of meaningful progress in U.S.-China trade talks. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gapped up for the second time in three sessions, rising another 2.3% to an all-time high. It's up 6.6% over the past four sessions.


Weakness in oil and gas stocks weighed on the S&P 500. The index closed in the bottom half of its range, up 0.2%, after rising 0.6% early. The session qualified as [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) due to the index's fade in higher volume, although stock market bulls were more interested in another strong session for chip stocks. Two distribution days fell off the Nasdaq's count because the Nasdaq's gain from both days exceeded 5%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP_040319.jpg)The Nasdaq pared a 1.1% intraday gain but still rose 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Tuesday.


Stock News Today: Chip Stocks Extend Gains
------------------------------------------


Semiconductor stocks started their initial move March 15 after **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) gapped up on earnings. That's when VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) initially broke out. After that, **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) surged nearly 10% March 21 on strong earnings and a bullish outlook for the second half of this year. That fueled more buying in the chip sector.


In other stock news today, Intel was the top gainer in the Dow, up 2%. It's [still within the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) after a breakout over a 54.20 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). While several chip stocks are well extended past proper buy points, others are still in buy range, including **Cabot Microelectronics** ([CCMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCMP)), **ASML Holding** ([CCMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCMP)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)).


Is A Market Pullback In The Cards?
----------------------------------


After five straight gains for the Nasdaq, a pullback wouldn't be surprising, especially as the index closes in on the 8000 level. The composite met resistance around 8100 when it topped last August and October.


Same goes for the S&P 500, which is quickly approaching 2900. Look for low volume on pullbacks. The fewer distribution days there are in the Market Pulse, the easier it will be for the stock market to make headway. Keep in mind that the stock market has shown it can move higher even with an elevated distribution-day count. If the count is elevated and leading growth stocks are under duress, that's the time when selling can intensify.


Headed into Wednesday, six distribution days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 definitely raised an eyebrow. It's an elevated count, no doubt, but market technicals continue to look pretty good, and leading growth stocks are holding up well. It's still a favorable environment to make money in stocks.


Globant Breaks Out
------------------


In other stock news today, small cap tech services firm **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)) cleared a flat base with a 74.10 buy point. Shares rose 2.6% to 74.51. It's a member of the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com).


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Insperity** ([NSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSP)), meanwhile, broke out over a trend line Wednesday as it works on a flat base with a 132.60 buy point.


The 10-year Treasury yield added 5 basis points to 2.52%. It's been in rally mode after hitting a low near 2.35% last week. The strength comes as several financials get ready to kick off first-quarter earnings reports next week. Some pundits are making a case that the worst is over for financials, although Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) has been getting repeated resistance at the 200-day moving average.

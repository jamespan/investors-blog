The stock market continued its autumn rally, as all major indexes reached record highs and a raft of top-rated stocks rose in heavy volume.




The Nasdaq composite climbed for a seventh straight day and added 0.3%. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%. Moderate as they may have been, index gains showed no letup among buyers. Indexes closed near session highs for a fourth straight day.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4% also and closed above 36,000 for the first time. It was the sixth 1,000-point milestone of 2021 so far, the most in a single year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Small caps also made new highs as the Russell 2000 edged up 0.2%. The index made its first new high since March, and appears to be finally clearing resistance around the 2350 level.

But the IBD 50 lagged, up barely 0.1% yet  enough for a new closing high. There wasn't much distress on the IBD 50, except for a few stocks. **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) fell more than 4% in heavy trading after a volatile session that followed its earnings report. The stock stayed on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


**Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)) tried to break out of a cup with handle but closed below the 80.62 buy point, according to [MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Multiple Breakouts In Stock Market
----------------------------------


Still, there was a satisfying side for leading stocks because so many saw gains in high volume and several broke out of bases.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) rose past the 420.86 buy point of a flat base in volume 21% above average.


In other [breakouts Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/growth-stocks-breaking-out-to-new-highs-univar-ibd-50-stock-freedom-holding-and-dow-jones-stock-goldman-sachs/), **Freedom Holding** ([FRHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRHC)), an IBD 50 stock, rose past its 68.90 buy point in heavy volume. **McKesson** ([MCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCK)) and **Rockwell Automation** ([ROK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROK)) gapped up after announcing earnings. **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) broke out of a cup without handle in active trading.



That offers investors new opportunities, just as long as those breakouts hold up. There's been a number of breakouts that have faded, so investors have to watch for any quick deterioration. Remember to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% below the buy point.


Risks Ahead For Stock Market
----------------------------


While the stock market is humming, investors cannot afford to become complacent. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are roughly 4% above their 50-day moving averages, a sign they may be getting stretched.


The Federal Reserve concludes its meeting Wednesday, and it is widely expected to announce a taper of asset purchases. That's the emergency program started during the Covid-19 pandemic to shore up financial markets.


Fed policymakers believe the U.S. economy has recovered enough that it no longer needs the extra stimulus, and inflation is a greater worry.


Transportation was the best performing S&P sector Tuesday, racing 4.2% to a new high, While trucking and other transportation stocks performed well, the dramatic gain was mainly due to a single stock in the index.


Car rental company**Avis Budget Group**'s ([CAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAR)) stock [soared more than 300%  after the company's third-quarter earnings easily beat views](https://www.investors.com/news/avis-stock/) and shares closed with a 108% increase. The stock appeared to be surging as short-sellers covered their positions just as chatter about Avis spiked on stock-trading Reddit groups.

The Nasdaq's newfound strength was on display Monday, as the index jumped 1% while the rest of the stock market was slow to get the new week going.




Buyers picked their spots, targeting mainly technology shares. Many software, internet and semiconductor industry groups climbed more than 1%, while industry leaders such as **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rose solidly.


Both stocks hold a spot in [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


With a moderate amount of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), the stock market is not in clear danger. But for much of 2021, the stock market leadership has shifted from sector to sector. Investors must track those moves, or risk losing gains.


Today, another rotation is occurring. This time, growth and tech stocks have the upper hand over cyclicals and value.

The tech buying simply grew in the final hour of trading. Around 3 p.m. ET, shares of **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) started heating up after a federal judged dismissed antitrust lawsuits against the company. The judge did allow the Federal Trade Commission to revise its lawsuit, but state cases were thrown out in their entirety.


Facebook — which accounts for 3.4% of the Nasdaq and 2.3% of the S&P 500 — closed 4.2% higher and at new highs. With Monday's surge, Facebook was crowned into the $1 trillion club after its market cap reached just over $1 trillion, according to Dow Jones data.


Up for five of the past six sessions, the Nasdaq has been catching up to the S&P 500 in year-to-date performance. It's now up 12.5% compared to the S&P 500's 14.2%. Earlier this year, the S&P 500 about doubled the Nasdaq. Much of that is coming from software. The ETF iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) is up 9.6% in June, accounting for practically the entire gain for the year.


Stock Market Makes Record Highs
-------------------------------


But apart from technology, it was hard to notice that the stock market made record highs Monday. The S&P 500 took an afternoon bounce to a 0.2% gain at the close. Even so, it appeared that big-cap tech stocks did most of the lifting because the average S&P 500 stock was down 0.4%.


The Nasdaq made a record high but decliners outnumbered advancers by a small margin. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE from Friday's totals, when trading spiked as Russell index reconstitutions went into effect.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) descended more than 3% after a report said [certification of the new 777X jetliner is likely delayed until 2023](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-falls-faa-wont-certify-777x-jet-until-2023/). The FAA cited safety concerns arising from the plane's test flights. Boeing stock, for now, held above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and is still forming a [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).


In a good day for semiconductors, Nvidia rose 5% on positive news. The Sunday Times first reported that **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), MediaTek and **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) [now support Nvidia's deal to buy ARM](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidia-gets-just-a-little-help-from-its-friends-11624905738) from SoftBank Group. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rallied 2.5%.

Treasury Yields Drop, Hitting Financials
----------------------------------------


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid nearly 6 basis points to 1.48%. That basically wiped out Friday's spike. The drop in yields probably helped technology and growth stocks outperform. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 0.8%.


Utilities also tend to benefit from lower yields, and that sector was up 0.6%, based on the Utility Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)). But higher yields hurt financials. The iShares U.S. Financials ETF ([IYF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYF)) fell 0.9%.



Energy and other cyclical stocks came down, too. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) stumbled 3.4%, the weakest showing among the S&P sector ETFs. The energy market appears jittery ahead of technical meetings and meetings of OPEC and OPEC+ set for later this week.

Stocks started the second quarter Friday with solid action as the indexes moved up in increased volume.


The Nasdaq rolled 0.9% higher, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each added 0.6%. The IBD 50 matched the Nasdaq's 0.9% gain.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


Advancers and decliners sent a mixed message Friday. Despite the index gains, losers led winners on the NYSE by a 13-12 ratio. Winners led on the Nasdaq by a 4-3 ratio.

* New highs, which not too long ago trailed daily new lows, have taken charge. Triple digits at or above 200 are now the rule for new highs, while new lows are in the 15 to 40 range. For IBD-style growth investors, new highs are important: This is where many new buys are identified.
* The percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day moving averages has been at or above 50% since Tuesday. These are the strongest readings in about 10 months.
* The IBD Mutual Fund Index is looking good. Meanwhile the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have retaken their 50-day and 200-day lines.
* While not at a high, the Dow Jones industrial average's current yield is about 85 basis points above the 10-year Treasury yield, suggesting conservative investors have a reason to buy or hold dividend stocks. At the start of the year, the advantage was only 37 basis points.
* The put-call ratio, which closed at 1.21 March 8, once again proved adept at flagging a short-term low.


However, Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears gauge doesn't look as encouraging as it did five weeks ago. The bearish advisers held the upper hand Feb. 24. Now bullish advisers are more prevalent. Elevated bearish levels can be a good sign for the market.


Some breakouts are now coming from newly emerging industry groups, which is an encouraging sign.


On Friday, **Whirlpool** ([WHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHR)) showed good follow-up action. The stock cleared a 179.75 handle in a deep base Thursday, but volume was only average. On Friday, volume stepped up to 32% above average as shares padded the gain.


While that was still below the desired 40% minimum for a breakout, weekly volume was 74% above the previous week’s level.


Whirlpool’s Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A points to fund buying. The up-down volume ratio, which provides a gauge about 10 days shorter than the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, is 2.6, far above the neutral 1.0 level.


Whirlpool holds a 96 Composite Rating, putting it in the top four percentile. The appliances industry group has improved from No. 171 among 197 groups to No. 56, according to Stock Checkup at Investors.com.


Economic news was mixed Friday.


Nonfarm payrolls came in about 2% better than expected. The PMI manufacturing index delivered a slight miss, but the ISM manufacturing index posted a modest beat. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey was stronger than expected, but construction spending was below the Street’s consensus estimate.


For the week, the small cap S&P 600 advanced 3.3%, the Nasdaq, 3%, the IBD 50, 2.7% and the S&P 500, 1.8%.

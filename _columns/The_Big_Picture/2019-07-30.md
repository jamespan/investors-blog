  Small Caps Trounce Dow Jones; Will These Industry Groups Power More Upside In 2019?

Large-cap stocks and techs fell Tuesday yet looked poised to end the month of July with a solid gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost all of 0.1%. But some institutional investors clearly took the session as an opportunity to lock in some profits.




Sure, every day in a bull market poses as a day of profit taking by someone, somewhere.


But judging by the action of leading growth stocks, it certainly did not feel like profit-taking by hordes of fund managers en masse.


The key indexes staged mild losses, which are perfectly normal after a hot run-up lately. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite lost less than 0.3%, the Nasdaq 100 nearly 0.5%. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) cooled off 0.6%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP_5x3_073019-219x300.jpg)Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, turnover rose more than 10% vs. the prior session.


So, add a [fresh day of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) — a session of unusually intense professional selling — on the S&P 500 to the books. As the Market Pulse in the [Monday Big Picture notes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-leads-drop-but-this-yet-to-happen-in-july-5-warning-signs-to-watch-right-now/), a June 21 distribution day fell on the Nasdaq count due to time.


IBD analysis has found that major indexes can resist a serious downturn in prices even with a relatively elevated distribution count. One reason: Most, if not all, of the distribution days are mild.


Consider the S&P 500. Prior to Tuesday's action, the four institutional-quality sell-offs making the current Market Pulse count are June 25 (-0.9%), July 8 (-0.5%), July 16 (-0.3%) and July 25 (-0.5%).


Big Buying In Small Issues
--------------------------


In terms of market sector action, what made Tuesday's session interesting?


The big boys and girls on Wall Street also scooped up bargains in the small-cap space. The Russell 2000 provided a bullish surprise, rising more than 1% for its third advance of 1% or more in five sessions.


The small-cap S&P 600 mirrored the Russell's emerging strength. The S&P 600 ratcheted up 1.1% to make its highest close since May 7. It would have to drop at least 1.5% on Wednesday to wipe out all of the current month's modest advance.


Cyclicals and energy names appeared to fortify the small-cap advance. An expected cut in interest rates on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve and a 2.6% rally in crude oil futures to $58.34 a barrel seemed to help spark the unusual day of outperformance by small caps vs. their larger brethren.


Overall, small caps still lag big caps in 2019.


Beyond Dow Jones: Positive Stock Market Internals
-------------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq advance-decline line has moved sideways for a week. But in a curious divergence on Tuesday, [MarketSmith's homepage](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) noted that more stocks actually rose in heavy volume than those that fell in above average trade.


Meanwhile, companies that make up key IBD stock lists such as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) highlight the fact that outstanding fundamentals growth and market leadership can come from small-, mid- and large-cap territories on Wall Street.



The largest company by market value in [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/)? **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) wins this competition with a market cap of $11.8 billion.


Beyond The Federal Reserve Meeting
----------------------------------


With a strong likelihood that the fed funds rate will get chopped by 25 basis points on Wednesday to a target range of 2%-2.25%, it's plain to see that the U.S. central bank has less of an opportunity to reduce the cost of money by a large scale as in past easing campaigns. For instance, from September 2007 to December 2008, the Fed slashed the rate on overnight cash infusions to large banks from 5.25% to nearly nil.


(See [Monday's Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-leads-drop-but-this-yet-to-happen-in-july-5-warning-signs-to-watch-right-now/) for details on how the market reacted to long periods of serious increases in the fed funds rate, a key risk to watch in equities in the future.)


Meantime, prospects for an acceleration in global economic growth look grim.


Europe is desperate to jump-start its economy. EU regulators are targeting the largest U.S. tech firms with antitrust penalties, provoking sharp Twitter rebukes from President Donald Trump. The U.S. and China look set to lock horns on many fronts in the ongoing fight for economic supremacy. Japan and South Korea squabble on trade issues of their own. America continues to see dull housing growth as younger adults struggle to get out from under the crushing weight of big college loans.


Last week, data showed 2.1% annualized U.S. GDP growth for the second quarter. That beat the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 1.9% growth. Yet it still represents a dramatic drop from a 3.1% rise in Q1.


So, what's an individual investor in growth stocks to do?

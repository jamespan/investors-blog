Major averages extended their winning streak to four sessions Monday, but the S&P 500 showed stalling action, giving the benchmark index its first distribution day since the market uptrend was confirmed on May 27.

  

Sellers came into the market just after 2 p.m. ET on some Fedspeak, but it didn't amount to much as indexes traded in a relatively tight range.

  

At the close, the Nasdaq added 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 marked new closing highs, each rising 0.1%. The S&P's close in the lower half of its range as it made a new high resulted in a stalling-type distribution day.

  

The Russell 2000 was a winner, rising 0.9%. Volume on the NYSE fell 3% from Friday's level. Nasdaq volume rose 10%. Breadth was solid as advancers topped decliners on the Nasdaq by a better than 2-to-1 margin. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by 3 to 2.

  

One distribution day for the S&P 500 doesn't mean that it's time to reassess new buys and consider raising cash. There's still much to like about the newly confirmed uptrend. Breakouts have emerged, and plenty more growth stocks are setting up for possible breakouts.

  

**Grifols** ([GRFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRFS)), a maker of plasma derivative products, extended gains after Friday's heavy-volume breakout over 43.60. Shares rose another 2% in strong trade. It's slightly extended now at nearly 7% above the buy point.

  

Elsewhere, **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)) looked good early Monday when it cleared a buy point of 49.47, but its breakout faded. Note that Anika's breakout attempt emerged from a riskier fourth-stage base.

  

Scads of base-building stocks are out there, particularly in the IBD 50, but many are late-stage after big runs already. Stocks in late-stage bases include **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), **HollySys Automation Technologies** ([HOLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOLI)), **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) and **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)).

  

Early-stage bases in the IBD 50 include **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), **KapStone Paper & Packaging** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)) and **Web.com Group** ([WWWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWWW)). Web.com Group has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 36.30.

  

Also on the downside, **Gilead Sciences**' ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) base-building effort ran into some trouble Monday as shares tumbled 4% in heavy volume. Competition concerns plagued the drugmaker after **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) agreed to buy **Idenix Pharmaceuticals** ([IDIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDIX)) for $3.85 billion. The deal gives Merck control of three hepatitis C drugs in development, two of which are in the same class as Gilead Sciences' blockbuster Sovaldi.

  

Despite Monday's drop, Gilead's cup-with-handle base remains intact, although the pattern is marred somewhat by Monday's bout of institutional selling.

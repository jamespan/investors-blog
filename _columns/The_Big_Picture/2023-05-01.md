The stock market edged lower Monday to start off a busy week of economic data and earnings reports. **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) outperformed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while buyers pushed **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) higher again.




Oil and gold fell as the U.S. dollar strengthened. West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $75.66 a barrel, down 1.5%. Gold eased 0.4% to $1,922.20 an ounce.


The Nasdaq composite ended a three-session win streak, falling 0.1%. It's in a good technical setup as the index eyes its Feb. 2 intraday high of 12,269.56.


After three straight above-average volume gains, Nasdaq volume was slightly lower than Friday's levels. Declining stocks had a small edge over advancers.


Buyers flocked to Nvidia, sending shares higher by 4%. Nvidia joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) on Feb. 23 when it gapped up on earnings. The chip leader has been finding support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) ever since. It gapped up to a 52-week high Monday ahead of its May 24 earnings report.


**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)), meanwhile, added 3% after reclaiming a 21.72 entry last week. DKNG reports earnings Thursday after the close. The company isn't profitable yet, but it continues to deliver booming revenue growth. After 81% top-line growth in Q4, first-quarter revenue is expected to jump 68% to $699.6 million.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 dipped less than 0.1%. Volume fell on the NYSE, with losing stocks beating winners by about 18-11.

Out of the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Health Care Select Sector SDPR Fund ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) outperformed, up 0.5%. Meanwhile, up sessions for **Raytheon** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)), **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) and **UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) helped lift the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLI)) to a gain of 0.5%.


The Dow Jones industrials slipped 0.1%, and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) edged higher by less than 0.1%.


JPMorgan was the top gainer in the Dow Jones after the banking giant acquired all of **First Republic**'s ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) deposits, plus about $173 billion in loans and $30 billion in securities after the bank was seized by regulators. JPM stock tried to gap out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/), but it closed off highs and below a 141.88 entry.


The JPMorgan-First Republic news didn't fuel a rally in regional banks. Instead, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) slumped 2.8%. The exchange traded fund was weighed down by more selling in top holdings like **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)), **Citizens Financial Group** ([CFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFG)) and **Truist Financial** ([TFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TFC)).


IBD's regional bank group was the day's worst performer, down 3.4%.


Interest Rates & The Fed
------------------------


Investors sold bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 12 basis points to 3.57%. The price chart of the 10-year yield (0TNX on MarketSmith) shows the yield getting close to a rendezvous with its 50-day moving average. It's a potential resistance level to watch.


The two-day Federal Reserve meeting starts Tuesday and a decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.


[Fed funds futures traders](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) have already priced in another quarter-point hike Wednesday to a range of 5% to 5.25%. But the odds for a half-point increase have risen to 31.5%, up from 23.9% Friday. That's because the latest reading from the ISM Manufacturing index came in slightly better than expected. Also, the prices paid component of the index hit 53.2, a nine-month high, according to Reuters.


Traders are still leaning toward a pause in June and July, with at least one rate cut widely expected before the end of the year. But a lot can change between now and then.


For now, having some exposure to stocks make sense. But it's not a market where new buys are being served up on a silver platter. That generally happens when new institutional money is coming from the sidelines.


An invested percentage of 20% to 40% is conservative, but it doesn't make sense to have aggressive exposure to stocks in front of another busy week of earnings reports, the Fed meeting and the jobs report on Friday.


Market Movers
-------------


In the energy space, **Weatherford International** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)) tried to clear a cup-with-handle base after gapping down on earnings last week. But WFRD once again reminded investors that it's still a challenging environment for chart breakouts in the current stock market environment. After jumping 2.9% intraday and topping a 63.63 entry, the stock gave back early gains and closed flat.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), **One SpaWorld Holdings** ([OSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSW)) soared past a 12.38 buy point ahead of Wednesday's earnings report before the open. But it's a thin stock with an average daily dollar volume of around $7.5 million.

Stocks Keep Bullish Tone; How Traders Can Avoid Post-Earnings Sell-Offs

Stocks posted a constructive session Wednesday, two days before the Trump White House era starts in earnest.


The major indexes looked headed for a dull finish after trading in a tight range throughout the entire session. But buying intensified in the final hour, and investors concentrated on both the Nasdaq and small-cap equities.


The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%, recouping half of Tuesday's 0.6% decline in higher volume. Turnover cooled Wednesday. You'd much prefer to see the Nasdaq and other major indexes rise in higher volume and fall in slower trading.


However, Tuesday's distribution day likely served a good purpose to keep the bulls in check. A market uptrend never goes up in a straight line.


![mp011817](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP011817-170x300.png)As the Market Pulse table shows, the Nasdaq's distribution-day count remains elevated at six. Mathematically, that's a large enough quantity to halt a bull run. But so far, institutional selling has largely been limited.


The average decline among those six distribution days is a mild -0.5%, including the Dec. 15 stalling session in which the Nasdaq rose 0.4%.


The S&P 500 edged nearly 0.2% higher, just a step behind the Nasdaq. A sell-off in gold mining, international oil and gas exploration, clothing, discount retail and foreign banking shares offset gains by industrial metals, steel, dairy product, tobacco, chip equipment and biotech shares.


Small caps outperformed. The Russell 2000 and the S&P SmallCap 600 both rose 0.5%. NYSE volume also fell.


Heading into the session's final hour, it seemed as if Wall Street was on standby, just two days before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.


So quiet, in fact, was trading that even after the Nasdaq ramped higher in the final hour, the index still posted a so-called inside day, in which the day's intraday high and low both were inside the prior day's high and low. The S&P 500 also barely met the requirements of an inside day on Wednesday.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *The Trump rally may be "low energy" right now, but here are [leading stocks forming bullish bases](https://www.investors.com/research/investing-action-plan/trump-rally-is-low-energy-sad-but-new-bases-form-investing-action-plan/).*

Volatility should increase as more companies report fourth-quarter results and as Trump begins his presidency after taking the oath on Friday. Indeed, as the recent pullbacks by **Goldman Sachs Group** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) show, even leading stocks will follow that old market saw, "buy on the rumor, sell on the news." So, it's always critical to buy right and not chase.


Goldman flashed a buy signal way back in mid-October, when it crept past a 172.52 saucer-with-handle buy point. UnitedHealth needed two tries during October and November to clear a 144.58 flat-base entry.
Small caps had a huge 2016, and so it's fair to assume that they have more gains to give up. However, if Trump delivers on promises to slash corporate income taxes, it may prove more beneficial to smaller companies since they generally pay more of their pretax profits to Uncle Sam.


Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial, notes that the median corporate tax rate for companies in the Russell 2000 is 33%, vs. 29% for members of the large-cap S&P 500.


"Smaller cap companies also have more to gain from the Trump administration's efforts to bring more offshore manufacturing back to the U.S. Although some low value manufacturing won't ever be brought back, proposals from Trump and congressional Republicans have suggested more favorable tax treatment for companies with U.S. production," White wrote in a note to clients.


LPL's advisors manage $502 billion in total client assets.


Other observers noted that comments by secretary of Commerce nominee Wilbur Ross Jr. on tariffs indicated a strong trade policy in favor of U.S. steel makers.


**Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)), part of the [IBD Leaderboard Leaders List](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/) since Nov. 9, one day after Trump's election win, helped lead the market's upside with a 3.7% gain in heavy trading, sending shares back above the fast-rising 50-day moving average.


Healthy market leaders spend most of their time above their 50-day line, not below it, during their long price rallies. Nucor industry peers **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) and **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) showed similar bullish action on Wednesday.


Every bull market features sectors that are stronger than others. Stockpickers who wish to beat index investors need to be aware of which industries are rising faster than most. The Top 40 Groups section on the General Market Indicators page (see the link below at the end of this article) is another fast way to see which industries are performing well.


Very rarely does a big stock market winner hail from a poorly performing industry group or sector.


Even though dairy stocks, a traditionally defensive industry, helped pace the market's upside on Wednesday, a look at the worst 40 groups today shows plenty of defensive groups, including meat products (No. 185 out of 197 groups and subgroups), alcoholic beverages (No. 193) and gold and silver miners (No. 196).


It would not be a surprise to see the market take a significant breather amid concerns about how Trump will handle trade relations between the U.S. and Mexico, China and Europe. The next step by the U.K. regarding its departure from the EU carries equally high concern. And you'll likely never see the end of worries from market prognosticators on the U.S. dollar, China's debt mountain, North Korea's nuclear threat, future ISIS attacks, and the future of interest rates.


In other words, investors will always have something to worry about. But in the near term, perhaps one should worry most about the lack of worry itself among most market pundits.


Bearishness among newsletter writers surveyed by Investors Intelligence fell back to 17.3%, the lowest since August 2015. As noted in a recent [Investor's Corner column](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/be-ready-to-act-when-market-sentiment-reaches-extreme-levels/), when investor sentiment reaches one extreme, the market tends to turn and go in the opposite direction.


The low bearishness certainly has not yet spurred a bear-market-type decline. However, the major indexes have seen generally sluggish gains over the past 18 months. The S&P 500 has risen just 8% since the [Investors Intelligence survey](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) on market bears hit such low levels in August 2015.

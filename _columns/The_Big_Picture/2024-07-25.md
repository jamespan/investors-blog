  S&P 500, Nasdaq Extend Losses After GDP, Inflation Data; Nvidia Stock Enters Bear Market

A promising rebound faded badly Thursday, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite reversed lower and extended Wednesday's sell-offs. Up next, Wall Street will shift its attention to Friday's early release of the Federal Reserve's favored inflation indicator â€” the core PCE price index.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2%, recouping a small part of Wednesday's dive. The S&P 500 lost 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 0.9% after being up as much as 1.2%. For the Nasdaq, it was the largest three-day decline since Feb. 21, 2023, per Dow Jones Market Data.


The small-cap Russell 2000 index rebounded 1.3% even after it trimmed gains in afternoon trading. Within the 11 S&P 500 sectors, the energy sector was the best performer, while communication services fell sharply.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, but rose on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That gave the S&P 500 a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for a total of seven in the past several weeks.


The [Federal Reserve's key inflation rate](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-inflation-rate-gdp-growth-q2-rate-cuts-sp-500/) came in a touch hotter than expected in the second quarter, as U.S. GDP growth perked up after a slow start to the year, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.


"The stronger than expected data on GDP and inflation suggest the Fed must be wary, but is unlikely to alter market expectations for a September rate cut," said John Lynch, Chief Investment Officer for Comerica Wealth Management, in an email to IBD.


Lynch continued, "Yet today's data should remind investors that while 1-2 cuts in coming months is warranted, an aggressive easing cycle next year is unlikely."


On Friday, the Fed's primary inflation gauge, the core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price index, is expected to rise 0.1% for the month of June, with an annual increase of 2.5%, per Econoday estimates.

Stock Market Today
------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) staged a breakout following the [company's earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-stock-q2-2024-earnings-ai/). Shares rallied 4.3% to move above a 189.47 cup-with-handle entry. Meanwhile, **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) (which gave mixed guidance) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were among the biggest losers in the Dow Thursday, with respective declines of 5.2% and 2.5%.


[Six of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended lower Thursday. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was the sole advancer, rebounding 2% after Wednesday's 12% plunge. And **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) entered bear market territory, falling 20% off its 52-week high.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) declined 1.3% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)) closed just below an 89.83 cup-base entry.


Weight-loss drug leaders **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) and **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) sold off 4.5% and 2.8%, respectively, after **Viking Therapeutics** ([VKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VKTX)) said [it's exploring a monthly dose](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/viking-therapeutics-unveils-monthly-weight-loss-shot-and-rocks-eli-lilly-novo-nordisk/) of its weight-loss drug. Viking shares soared 28%, while Lilly triggered a sell signal with a break of its 10-week moving average.


What To Do Now
--------------


Wednesday marked another change in character for the stock market, as the Nasdaq closed below its 50-day line for the first time since May 2. And because the tech sector saw more extensive damage, IBD reduced its recommended exposure level to 40%-60%.


Amid the sharp market declines, investors should be playing more defense, cutting losing stocks and taking some profits. Continue to monitor your stock holdings for any sell signals.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list had only two stocks Thursday, which makes sense given the stock market weakness. There are only a handful of names on the Near Pivot list, suggesting that many previous tech leaders have some work ahead of them before new buy points emerge.

S&P 500 Stock ServiceNow Breaks Out
-----------------------------------


The market continues to see dozens of stocks making new highs, providing some opportunities for those willing to take on the market's higher risk. Stocks to watch include **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Tenet Healthcare** ([THC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THC)), **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)).


[ServiceNow surged](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/servicenow-stock-servicenow-earnings-news-q22024/) more than 13%, breaking out past a 806.52 handle entry. Late Wednesday, the enterprise software maker delivered a strong second-quarter earnings report, beating on adjusted profit, revenue and a key growth metric. Analysts said ServiceNow seems to be one of a few software companies gaining traction with generative artificial intelligence. ServiceNow is a new [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) addition.


[Tenet Healthcare](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tenet-stck-tenet-healthcare-q2-earnings-breakout/) added to Wednesday's breakout, moving further above a 142.35 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). This week, the operator of hospitals and surgery centers blew past second-quarter earnings estimates and sharply raised its full-year outlook amid boom times for health care providers.


And homebuilder Toll Brothers rallied 1.8% to close just shy of a 135.37 entry in a cup base. The homebuilding industry continues to advance along with rate-cut hopes.

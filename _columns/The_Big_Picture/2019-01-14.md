Stocks today fell broadly but not all that sharply, as the market continued to cool off but in acceptably moderate fashion.




The Nasdaq composite tripped up 0.9% while the S&P 500 lost 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 closed with a loss of 1% in a broad retreat for stocks. Decliners led advancers by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by nearly 12-to-7 on the NYSE.


No doubt, the stock market is slowing after a fast post-Christmas rebound. The Nasdaq hit up against the 50-day moving average the past few days, a significant level that is acting as a lid on the composite's rebound.


The S&P 500 still is 2% away from its 50-day line, but is testing another key level at 2600.

On Friday, the S&P 500 closed near session highs. And on Monday, the large-cap benchmark ended in the upper 40% of its intraday price range. Such action suggests improving institutional demand for equities.


The Nasdaq hasn't been quite as buoyant, but also has held on to most of its late December-January rally. Overall, there's a sense that institutional investors are not cleaning out their holdings.


Nasdaq volume fell Monday, sparing the composite from a distribution day. But volume rose on the NYSE, which gave the S&P 500 and the market its first session of heavy institutional selling, or [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), since the [Jan. 4 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/).


Much of the higher volume rested on a single stock. California utility **PG&E** ([PCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCG)) collapsed 52% to the lowest since October 2002 after the company said [it will file for bankruptcy](https://www.investors.com/news/pge-files-for-bankruptcy-california-wildfires-pge-stock-dives/) after incurring huge potential liabilities in wildfires. PG&E traded nearly 127 million shares, which at least influenced the rise in NYSE volume. CEO Geisha Williams stepped down.


While the broad market's behavior is mainly encouraging, the leading stocks remain a trouble spot. A small number of leaders have broken out past [proper bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), and the few that have are not necessarily tearing it up.


 **Dorman Products** ([DORM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DORM)) topped a 91.42 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) Jan. 7 and came back near that entry in Monday's trading. Volume was heavy in the auto parts manufacturer.


Restaurant chain **Denny's** ([DENN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DENN)) reversed lower Monday, just after it edged past an 18.26 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on Friday. Denny's reported Monday [a 1.4% increase in comparable sales](https://www.investors.com/news/wingstop-stock-dennys-del-taco-q4-early-results/). **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)), a member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), gave back two days of gains, including a modest increase from its 54.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) lagged the market, falling 1.5% on Monday.


**Banco Santander Brazil** ([BSBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSBR)) (which is not in the IBD 50) is a modest success, up about 6% from its 12.35 buy point. **NanoString Technologies** ([NSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSTG)) is up about 15% from its [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), a rare winner.


Earnings season starting to get active, and with that come some possibilities for [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


In the first test for the financial sector, **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) surged 4% Monday after the firm [beat profit and missed revenue estimates.](https://www.investors.com/news/citigroup-earnings-citigroup-stock-q4-2018-bank-stocks/) Citi sounded guarded in its outlook. Still, other major banks rose in applause for the profit beat.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) both climbed 1% to lead the Dow. Financials led the market. The SPDR Financial ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) rose 0.6%, rising past a level of short-term resistance.


Utilities, health care, technology were weaker sectors.


Many pharmaceuticals slid after [Democrats launched an investigation into drug prices](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pharmaceutical-companies-drug-prices/). IBD's ethical drugs, generic drugs and biotech industry groups fell about 2%.

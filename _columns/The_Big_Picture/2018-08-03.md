U.S. stock indexes rewarded caution Friday, as food, beverage and diversified groups grabbed five of the top 12 spots for daily price performance. Yet fresh stock breakouts emerged.




The Nasdaq crept 0.1% higher, while the large-cap S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average each pegged 0.5% gains. The small-cap S&P 600 skidded 0.4%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume.


The Dow Jones utility average popped 1%, confirming the market's guarded tone.

Yet, as long as the market avoids distribution — a sign of institutional selling — quiet action buys time for the bulls.


On Friday, a handful of stocks broke out.


Restaurant chain **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) gapped up 23% at the open and then eased to a 17% gain. The small-cap company reported a 15% earnings beat for Q2. Wingstop crossed above a 55.95 buy point.


**Callaway Golf** ([ELY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELY)) gapped up 20% at the open but then deflated to an 11% gain. The small-cap company topped views by 34%. Callaway cleared a 20.92 buy point.


**Orion Engineered Carbons** ([OEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OEC)) is a supplier of carbon black, which is used in rubber products. The stock surged 10% in the first 15 minutes of trade and then settled for a 7.5% gain. Orion topped a 34.05 buy point.


**Continental Building Products** ([CBPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBPX)) stabbed 10% higher and then backed off to an 8% gain. The thinly traded small cap cleared a 32.85 buy point.


Former market leader **Nu Skin** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) rumbled out of an awkward consolidation. The stock advanced almost 17% and then slipped to an 11% gain.

Here's what is good about the above breakouts: None is late stage. All are relatively fresh names.

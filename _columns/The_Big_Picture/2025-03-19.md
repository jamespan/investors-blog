The stock market ended the session with bullish gains Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spoke positively again about the overall health of the U.S. economy. But Powell also acknowledged some recent softness in consumer spending along with an uncertain economic outlook as a result of President Donald Trump's tariffs.


The Nasdaq composite rose 1.4% on the sixth day of its rally attempt but closed well off highs.


Volume fell slightly from Tuesday, eliminating the possibility of a follow-through day.




Keep in mind that a follow-through day should convey power. Even if volume did rise from Tuesday, the Nasdaq closed off highs as sellers came into the market during the final 45 minutes of trading.


IBD's recommended exposure stays at 0% to 20%.


Small Caps Outperform; S&P Continues Rally Attempt
--------------------------------------------------


Small caps outperformed as the Russell 2000 jumped 1.6%.


The S&P 500 gained 1.1% in lower volume on the fourth day of its rally attempt. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.9%.

Despite an overall positive tone, the Fed boosted its core inflation outlook this year to 2.8% from an earlier estimate of 2.5%. It also lowered its gross domestic product forecast for this year to 1.7%, down from 2.1%.


The overall rate cut picture didn't change much after the Fed policy statement, according to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html). For now, the market and the Fed expect two rate cuts this year. But there's now an 80% chance that the first rate cut will come at the July meeting as opposed to June.

The recent three-week plunge for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 had the characteristics of a [vertical violation](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-vertical-violation/). That means both indexes still have plenty of overhead supply to work through. If more money starts to come in from the sidelines, look for higher volume behind the gains and lower volume behind the declines. Even more importantly, look for an increasing number of stocks to buy.


In the oil-and-gas space, **LandBridge** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)) jumped 11% in strong volume and cleared a double-bottom base with a 76.22 entry. Tracked in the exploration and production group, LandBridge owns more than 200,000 acres in the Delaware Basin. That area is part of the lucrative Permian Basin that spans West Texas and Southeast New Mexico.


Group peer **Range Resources** ([RRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RRC)) rallied 2% and topped a 40.49 entry.


Stock Market Movers: ADMA, Entergy, GFL Environmental
-----------------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, a look at today's Leaders Up In Volume section of the accompanying Market Pulse didn't stir a whole lot of excitement. But in the biotech group, **ADMA Biologics** ([ADMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADMA)) jumped 10% in higher volume as it sculpts the right side of a cup base. The base is a bit lopsided as ADMA quickly builds the right side. Yet the biotech has been rallying in strong volume after getting bullish support during the week ended March 7.


In the electric utility group, **Entergy** ([ETR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETR)) remains in a buy zone as it holds support at its 10-week moving average. Support comes after Entergy broke out powerfully in mid-January.


**GFL Environmental** ([GFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFL)), a provider of waste management services, topped an alternate entry of 48.09 but faded off highs by the close. The renewed strength comes after GFL fell more than 7% from a prior 46.61 entry.


Among leading insurance stocks, **Progressive** ([PGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGR)) gapped below its 21-day exponential moving average and slumped 3.5% after the company said net premiums in February increased 17% to $6.68 billion. Progressive was showing a lot of relative strength after it cleared a cup base on Feb. 24.

  Stock Market Rallies Late For Second Straight Session; Trump Tariff News Next

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 closed strongly for the second straight session in the stock market Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's tariff announcement.




The Nasdaq composite snapped a four-session losing streak, rising 0.9% in slightly lower volume. Breadth wasn't all that great as winners beat losers on the Nasdaq exchange by a minuscule margin. It'll be a challenging road back for the Nasdaq after several higher-volume declines in the index since the second half of February. But not insurmountable. Watch for higher-volume gains from here with lower-volume declines. That would be the best sign yet that new money is moving in from the sidelines.


After finding support near the 5500 level, the S&P 500 added 0.4%, also in lower volume. Breadth was a little better on the NYSE, with advancing stocks outnumbering decliners by 17-to-10.


Stock Market Today: New Rally Attempt
-------------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell less than 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 small-cap index rallied less than 0.1%.

It was bullish close for the stock indexes Monday as the Nasdaq composite pared a 2.7% intraday loss to 0.1%. Even though it was a down session, Monday qualified as the first day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq, because buyers lifted the index off lows by the close. There was some conviction behind the buying, too, as volume rose from Friday. The S&P 500 closed with a gain of 0.55%, also in higher volume, after falling 1.6% intraday. As long as Monday's lows hold, the rally will be intact.


Now is the time to be on the lookout for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-how-to-invest-using-follow-through-days/). Some of the more powerful follow-through days — when at least one index scores a big percentage gain in higher volume — have occurred between the fourth day and seventh day of a rally attempt. Growth investors are still watching for one, but the challenge now is finding good merchandise to buy.


The auto manufacturers group was one of the day's top performers, up more than 3%. But the group's gain was skewed by a 3.6% rise for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which jumped ahead of Q1 delivery data due early Wednesday. After a nice rally off lows, Tesla got turned away at its 200-day moving average last week.


Waiting For New Leadership
--------------------------


After heavy-volume sell-offs for former stock market leaders like **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)), the environment for growth stocks is still challenging. As growth stocks have sold off, money has flowed into gold, China, biotech and insurance stocks, along with real estate investment trusts with nice dividend yields. But these are not industries typically associated with new bull runs.


That said, if you missed the move in Chinese stocks, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is testing its 10-week moving average for the first time. The test comes after Alibaba soared out of a cup base during the week ending Feb. 14. A first test of the 10-week line is a reasonable time to buy a stock for the first time, but it's usually best to start with a smaller-than-normal position.



China EV maker **Xpeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) is also testing its 10-week line, along with the iShares China Large Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)).


Ten-Year Yield Weakens
----------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield came under pressure for the third straight session as bond investors — and the stock market for that matter — worry about the prospects for stagflation. That's when economic growth slows, but inflation stays stubbornly high. The concern is that the cost of tariffs will be passed along and prices will stay high, at least in the short term. The so-called "reciprocal tariffs" are intended to counteract foreign tariffs on U.S. exports. But some economists have warned that tariffs could provoke retaliation and impede global trade.

Over the past three sessions, the 10-year yield has plunged 21 basis points, from 4.37% to around 4.16%. And the stock market got more soft economic data before the open. Not only did the ISM Manufacturing index come in slightly weaker than expected, but the JOLTS Job Openings also came in below expectations.


Besides Wednesday's tariff announcement, the only other major stock market headline comes Friday with the release of the March jobs report. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to increase by 131,000, with the unemployment rate ticking higher to 4.2%.


It's hard being patient and avoiding new buys when the market is in a correction. But that's not a bad game plan for now, especially since there's not much in the way of actionable setups.


At some point, new leadership will emerge beyond the gold and insurance groups. Until then, wait for the market tide to start flowing positive again. Follow-through days have done a great job of flagging stock market bottoms in the past. If we get one, and leadership is still light, it doesn't bode well for a sustained rally. But if a follow-through day comes with plenty of new leadership, it means the rally could have legs.

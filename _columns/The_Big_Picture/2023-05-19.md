====================================================================================================

The stock market reversed lower as a breakdown in debt-ceiling talks raised jitters among investors. Even dovish interest rate talk from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was not enough to lift indexes.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day 0.2% lower, avoiding distribution due to lower volume. Still, it ended with a meaty 3% gain for the week and remains near its highs for the year. The tech-heavy index has risen in each of the past four weeks and is up nearly 22% so far in 2023.


The S&P 500 also dipped, falling 0.1%. It ended with a solid weekly gain of nearly 2% but the divergence in distribution between the benchmark index and the Nasdaq is a concern. Nevertheless, it added to its cushion above the 50-day moving average.


Decliners outnumbered gainers by about 1.5-to-1 on the NYSE. The margin was even narrower on the Nasdaq, reflecting the uncertain nature of the day's action.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also suffered a narrow loss, dipping 0.3%. **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO))Â  fared best while **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) dipped after a poor earnings report from key partner **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)).


Small caps were roughed up by the bears, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.6%. Growth stocks managed to battle off lows, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) limiting losses to 0.2%.


Stock Market Today: Debt Ceiling Vs. Dovish Powell

Fingers were getting pointed furiously on Capitol Hill after the debt-ceiling talks fell apart, though urgency remains.


GOP delegates walked out on negotiations, with Republican Garret Graves blaming Biden administration counterparts for not being "reasonable."


Given the gravity of the situation, it is very unlikely to be the last word, with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer telling members to be ready to return to D.C. within 24 hours.


The ongoing worries over the debt ceiling overshadowed dovish comments from Fed Chair Powell on interest rates.


He said banking sector strength could mean the "policy rate may not need to rise as much as it would have otherwise to achieve our goals."


The coming week could give further insight into the thoughts of the Federal Open Market Committee, as the minutes from the May meeting are due Wednesday.


In addition, the latest PCE index data, the Fed's favored gauge of inflation, is due to be released on Friday. In the earnings world, **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) report on Wednesday after the close is a key one to watch.

Foot Locker Earnings Hit This Group
-----------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors ended the day mixed, though a majority were in the red. Health and energy were the strongest areas while technology and consumer discretionary areas lagged.


In addition, the performance of the IBD Industry Groups offered further insight.


Food wholesalers, medical research service providers, computer networking plays and Canadian oil and gas explorers were all strong on a relative basis.


Department store stocks, mobile home makers, specialty retailers all were among the worst performers on Friday's stock market.


Shoe stocks were also hit after the poor earnings report from **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)). **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) was [booted off Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) after it fell 3% in high volume, adding to its losses for the week.

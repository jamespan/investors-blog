The stock market extended this week's losses Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield reached its highest level since 2007.




As the stock market continues to pull back sharply, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) are holding up well, as evidenced by rising relative strength lines.


U.S. Treasury yields jumped again Thursday, with the 10-year yield settling at 4.3%. The yield, based on 3 p.m. ET readings, rose to its highest level since Nov. 7, 2007, per Dow Jones market data. Meanwhile, the average mortgage rate rose to 7.09%, [its highest level in more than 20 years](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms), according to mortgage giant Freddie Mac.


On Thursday, key earnings movers included **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) and Dow Jones stocks **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)).


[Cisco shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/csco-stock-cisco-stock-cisco-earnings-q22023/) rallied more than 3% to a 15-month high, while StoneCo dived through its 50-day line, down 7.6%. [Walmart](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-dow-jones-giant-target-face-widely-divergent-earnings-expectations/) sold off more than 2% even after the company reported strong earnings and sales results and [raised its fiscal-year guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-dow-jones-giant-target-face-widely-divergent-earnings-expectations/).


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP081723-300x280.jpg)On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8%, closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time since June 1.


In the Dow 30, **Walgreen Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) tumbled 3.65% to hit a new 52-week low. Rival **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) slumped 8.1% after [nonprofit insurer Blue Shield of California](https://www.investors.com/news/blue-shield-of-cali-drops-cvs-health-taps-amazon-in-challenge-to-pbm-model/) said on Thursday that it will end its use of a prescription benefit management middleman to negotiate contracts with drugmakers.


The S&P 500 lost 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite moved down 1.2% Thursday, its third straight decline of more than 1%. The last time the index fell at least 1% for three straight days was Oct. 11, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Lastly, the small-cap Russell 2000 lost nearly 1.2%. All four major stock indexes are now below their 50-day lines.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but appeared to be slightly higher on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


Top growth stocks were hit hard, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) stumbled 2.3% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) lost 1.4%. Shares of the retailer are just 2% off their 52-week high despite a worsening stock market environment. DECK's RS line hit a new high this week.


Following Thursday's weak action, IBD's market outlook was downgraded to a stock market correction, with a 20%-40% recommended exposure range. That means that investors should be mostly moving to the sidelines, out of equities and into cash.


During market corrections, investors should be focusing on the next round of potential market leaders.


One way to do this is by using theÂ [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Look for stock charts in which the line is trending upward, which means the stock is outperforming the S&P.

Leaders To Watch: Nvidia, Lululemon, Monster, Oracle
----------------------------------------------------



With the market in a correction, investors should hold off on new purchases until a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) signals the start of a potential new uptrend.


But these four stocks are worth monitoring due to their outperformance vs. the S&P 500 in recent weeks:


On [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), Nvidia staged a big bounce Monday after getting trimmed to a quarter position Friday on a decisive close below the 50-day line. A continued rebound from there would place the chip giant in a new buy area. But keep in mind that earnings are due Wednesday and market risk is high.


Lululemon has seen continued support around its 50-day line in recent weeks, even after a breakout past a 389.06 buy point sputtered. LULU's RS line is at its highest level since June, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).

Monster Beverage's flat base continues to take shape as shares look to mount another test of support at their 50-day line. Shares are about 5% away from their 60.47 buy point.


Oracle is also building a flat base as it consolidates after a big run-up in late June. The conventional buy point is at 127.54, while an early entry is in play at 121.36.

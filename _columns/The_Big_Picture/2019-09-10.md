Stocks Rally But Mask Some Heavy Selling In These Key Growth Sectors
=====================================================================

If you had to describe what happened in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), you might mention all three of the following actions: moving very little, going up, and falling quite a lot.




The major indexes themselves moved very little by the market's close. In fact, their tight closes in recent days would likely be favored by most IBD readers following a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on Aug. 13. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on Tuesday, making a decent late-hour rally to close less than 0.1% lower.


That's actually a positive result, considering that the Nasdaq composite fell more than 1% in the early going. It fell briefly below the 50-day moving average, and almost tested buyers at the 8000 price level.


Such rebounds off the session low are bullish moves. The Nasdaq's reversal hinted that institutions came into the market to support stocks.

CLOSE




The S&P 500 turned a 0.7% loss suffered after 45 minutes of trading to a tiny gain of less than 1 point. Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq.


So, what about the "going up a lot" part about Tuesday? Small caps and transportation issues stole this show.


Small Caps Turning The Tide?
----------------------------


The small-cap S&P 600 turned in its fourth gain in five sessions, ramping up 1.2% and marking its highest daily close since July 31.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP091019-199x300.jpg)The S&P 600 now has a modest gain of 0.2% for the third quarter. The Russell 2000 matched the 1.2% advance on Tuesday. The Dow Jones transports rallied 1.5% — less than a week after the ISM manufacturing survey showed its worst monthly figure since the fall of 2016, indicating that factories across the U.S. slowed down.


Third, the "falling quite a lot" portion of the market for a second straight day belonged to high-growth companies with much higher valuations.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped like a rock, sliding nearly 2.9%. It caved below the long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since June 4.


At 32.27, The ETF has lost its once-sizable cushion of year-to-date outperformance vs. the S&P 500 (up 18.9%). The exchange traded fund now holds a 16.8% gain since Jan. 1. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average now has the ETF's gains in its sights: The blue chip index is up 15.4% year to date.


Anecdotally, the large number of stocks down in heavy volume seen in today's Market Pulse added more texture to a story of disconnect seen between the major equity benchmarks and leading growth stocks.


Over the past five sessions, enterprise software, gold and silver mining, solar, and desktop software groups have fallen 3% to 9%. But so too have nonalcoholic beverage, meat, soap and water utility stocks.


A New $64,000 Question
----------------------


Is this a new chapter in sector rotation? Or the start of a much bigger decline?


For sure, some sectors have simply had marvelous advances since the major indexes ended their bear market in December. A cooling off was perhaps justified. Gains by small caps in recent days indicate optimism over the economy has not diminished.


Regardless, at this point, it's foolish to try to guess the bottom in individual stocks.



**Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) made quite a stunning reversal of its own. It turned a drop of more than 4% into a 0.5% gain. The medical software leader also refused to touch its long-term 200-day moving average. But no one knows yet if the large cap has hit bottom yet. Wait for new bases to form and finish.


Ditto for other leaders in the enterprise software space, including **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)).


Beyond Stocks Today
-------------------


Meanwhile, all equity investors need to keep watching what the U.S. bond market is doing. And Tuesday's action was mostly bullish, even if the cost of money went up.


The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell sharply, sending the yield on the long-term debt security up nine basis points to 1.72%. The yield on shorter-term two-year notes also spiked nine basis points. But at 1.67%, it's a lower yield than what the 10-year bond offers. And that's good for banks. It means that the yield curve is getting less inverted.


Three-month T-bills remain higher than the 10-year note with a yield of 1.95%. But next week, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to slash short-term interest rates by a quarter point during a two-day meeting ending on Wednesday. One could expect yields on the short end of the curve to fall.


Banks Show More Pep
-------------------



**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) jumped 2.5% in heavy volume. It's forming the right side of a new base. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) added a financial services stock late Tuesday; **Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)) also earned a spot in [IBD Stock Spotlight](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/growth-stocks-breaking-out-why-ally-financial-is-rare-in-the-stock-market-today/).


"Over past cycles, when the 2-10-year U.S. Treasury yield curve inverts, many policymakers, investors, economists, and strategists believe there may be an artificial reason and, therefore, may not be signaling recession," Tony Dwyer, equity strategist at Canaccord Genuity, wrote in a note to clients. "We refuse to make the 'it's different this time' mistake, but we want to spotlight that once the curve does invert, it takes a very long time to shut down the levered economic engine and create 'the' market peak and recession."

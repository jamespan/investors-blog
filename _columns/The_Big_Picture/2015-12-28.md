Stocks kicked off another shortened week of trading Monday with modest losses. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 gapped down at the open but recovered early losses.


The S&P 500 lost 0.2%, while the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1% each. Small caps lagged again with the Russell 2000 down 0.6%.

Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by slightly less than 2-to-1.


Volume rose from Thursday's half-session levels, resulting in a technical distribution day for the S&P 500. The Nasdaq avoided one with its decline of 0.1%.


Top percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included institutional-quality names like **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). Alphabet and Amazon got price target hikes from Axiom Capital. But all three could have benefited from "window dressing" â€” fund managers' selling their losers and buying big winners at the end of the year to make their portfolios look good.


Utility stocks were some of the best performers Monday. Their recent outperformance is the topic of today's Income Investor column on B9.


Oil-and-gas-related groups lagged again as West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for February delivery slumped 3.4% to $36.81 a barrel.


The market uptrend remains under pressure, but distribution in the major average is not cause for concern.


Take a look at a weekly chart of the Nasdaq, and the last meaningful higher-volume weekly decline was in September.


Still, seasoned investors know that it's a challenging environment for making money in growth stocks. The S&P 500's follow-through day on Oct. 2 yielded a tradeable rally, but the one on Dec. 16 met immediate selling pressure.


The market's defensive nature is on full display, particularly in today's Big Cap 20 screen on A14. Names like **Hormel Foods** ([HRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRL)) and **Tyson Foods** ([TSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSN)) recently broke out and rallied 20%, triggering a profit-taking rule. New entrant **Baxalta** ([BXLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BXLT)), meanwhile, is working a first-stage base that shows nice accumulation on the right side.


Safe-haven buying like this doesn't necessarily mean that the market's about to roll over. Significant distribution and weakness in market leaders are the telltale signs. Neither is happening now.


While it's true that institutional investors aren't exactly embracing growth stocks at the moment, there's no reason yet to sell high-quality names that are working.

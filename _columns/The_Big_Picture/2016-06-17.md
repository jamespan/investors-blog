Stock indexes gave up critical support levels Friday but did so narrowly enough to leave the battle of bulls and bears to another day.


The Nasdaq skidded 0.9%, while the S&P 500 tapped the brakes to a 0.3% loss. The IBD 50 had a 0.7% loss.

Volume rose across the board. The Nasdaq ended a streak of 11 sessions in a row in below-average turnover. However, it took a quadruple witching day to do it. Quadruple witching involves the expiration of index futures, index options, stock options and single stock futures. Expirations often boost stock volume.


The Nasdaq closed under its 200-day line for the first time in about four weeks. The S&P 500 remains above its 200-day line but closed under the 50-day line for the third time in the past four days.


Look for these battles to pick up again in the coming week, if only because both indexes are not far from the moving average.


The May 12 distribution day on the Nasdaq fell off the count because of time, but the Nasdaq picked up a fresh distribution day Friday. The S&P 500 also added distribution Friday. Distribution involves a loss in rising volume, which reflects institutional selling.


So far this month, many old distribution days have expired. However, new distribution has kept the count moderate. Seven distribution days -- on one or both indexes -- have fallen off in June, but six days in the same period involved fresh distribution.


This shift to younger distribution days is not a good thing. And the coming week will provide a slew of tests for the stock market.


On Tuesday and Wednesday, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen will speak to Congress on monetary policy.


On Thursday, the Fed will announce the results of annual stress tests for the banks.


Also Thursday is the big headline event: Britain will vote on whether to leave or remain in the European Union.


On Friday, the annual rebalancing of the Russell 2000 and Russell 1000 indexes will go into effect. This forces managers of index-tracking funds to sell or buy shares to keep in proper step with the indexes.


Durable goods orders for May will be released before Friday's open.


Any of these events by themselves could test the stock market.


Earnings reports will continue throughout the week.


Companies expected to draw close attention include **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), which is shifting more of its offerings to the cloud; **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), which could give insights into the homebuilders' situation; and **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), which often is used as a gauge for the general economy.


For the week, the Nasdaq chopped off 1.9%, its biggest weekly loss since late April. The S&P 500 sliced off 1.2%, also the biggest loss since the last week of April. The IBD 50 severed 1.5%, again the biggest loss since the last week of April.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, oil groups did best Friday and medical stocks dragged. Over the past four weeks, leaders include fiber optics, retail discounters and steel producers. Laggards include consumer electronics, meat, hospitals and super-regional banks.

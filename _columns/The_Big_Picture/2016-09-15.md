U.S. stocks rumbled ahead Thursday for big gains, with chips leading the way.


The Nasdaq scored a 1.5% advance while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each added 1%. The Philadelphia semiconductor index was the day's star, popping 2.3%. The IBD 50 rose 1.2%.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE.


The 1%-plus gains in the major indexes marked only the third such session over the past 10 weeks, and this week accounted for two of them.

If the Nasdaq should notch a new high, it might not mean much. The distribution-day count would still be high, and the days aren't old enough to start coming off quickly.


The stubbornly high count means fund managers are still leaning toward lightening their exposure.


What would it take to go from lightening exposure to lighting a fire under this pressured uptrend? A string of significant price gains could do it. The problem: The Nasdaq and S&P 500 need gains of about 3.5% to 5% just to start eliminating distribution days.


Until that happens, individual investors would be wise to tread lightly. Another reason for caution: While the Nasdaq is above its 50-day moving average, the S&P 500 continues to find resistance at that key line.

News is a factor that could energize or drain the market, and there are two items that are currently in doubt.


In the near term, the Federal Reserve's meetings Tuesday and Wednesday are reasons to wait for more clarity. A rate increase isn't expected, but a surprise would be disruptive.


Longer term, the market must price in the presidential election, which on Tuesday will be only seven weeks away.


The latter is a reckoning that brings no joy to the Street. While each voter has passions that define loyalties, Mr. and Mrs. Market have only one concern: What's in it for us?


For the market, it's hard to imagine something bullish coming out of the confusion and lack of clarity endemic to the leading candidates.


However, once the market does price in the election outlook, and the Fed's stance, a rally would not be surprising. The market hates the fog of uncertainty even more than bad news.


Ultimately, as IBD founder William O'Neil has pointed out many times, companies with new products and services eventually shape the market more than politicians do.


Do these companies have names?


A screen of companies that delivered earnings growth of 25% or more in each of the past three years, 25% or more in the past two quarters, return on equity of at least 17%, daily dollar volume of at least $20 million and a price that is 15% or less off its high found only five stocks. They are:


Network equipment maker **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), automotive systems and components supplier **Cooper-Standard** ([CPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPS)), optical components and modules provider **Lumentum Holdings** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)), driver assistance software developer **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), and clinical services outsourcer **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)).
Economic news was mixed Thursday. On the bullish side, first-time jobless claims were fewer than expected. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Fed survey for September was much stronger than expected.


On the bearish side, **[August retail sales were below estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/august-retail-sales-to-skid-but-look-under-hood/)**. The Empire State manufacturing index in September was weaker than expected. And **[industrial production for August](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/3-key-manufacturing-reports-thursday-what-to-expect/)** was below the consensus number.


Friday will be a quadruple witching day, which often boosts volume.

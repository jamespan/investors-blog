The stock market acted buoyantly Monday, building on Friday's bounce as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a gain of more than 1% for the second-straight session.




The Dow rose 1.3% and closed back above the 200-day moving average for the first time since last Tuesday. The S&P 500 added 1%. It closed just above the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) — another incremental step toward recovery.


The Nasdaq composite climbed nearly 0.9%. But, as the flag-bearer of the beleaguered tech sector, it remained well below its 21-, 50- and 200-day moving averages. On a positive note, the index is holding above the October lows.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) illustrated the day's positive vibe.


The stock sold off early after the company disclosed the main iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max factory in China [is operating at reduced capacity](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-falls-on-iphone-14-pro-shortage/) [due to Covid restrictions](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-falls-on-iphone-14-pro-shortage/). That will leave Apple short on iPhone 14s for the holiday season.


Yet, the stock reversed higher. Shares continued to hold above the Oct. 13 low.


**Meta Platform**s ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) was another tech winner. It rose 6.5% after The Wall Street Journal reported [plans to lay off thousands](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-jumps-reports-of-layoffs-thousands/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP110722-218x300.jpg)While the technology sector tries to find its footing, energy stocks continue to outperform. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 1.7% and neared the 93.41 buy point of a cut base.


**Comstock Resources** ([CRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRK)) jumped 10% in heavy volume and drew closer to the 21.95 buy point of a cup base.


**Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) closed above the 162.34 buy point of a 20-week pattern. Energy stocks, though, may be ready for a pullback.


The IBD 50 ETF raced past the main stock market indexes with a 2.6% rally.


While Monday's steps were encouraging, the stock market has more work to do to gain investors' confidence. IBD last week moved the market outlook to "uptrend under pressure" after the nascent rally came under selling pressure.


Stock Market Awaits Election Results
------------------------------------


On the immediate horizon, the stock market is watching Tuesday's midterm elections. Historical trends favor the stock market, short term and longer term.


The eight days surrounding the midterm vote historically bring a 2.8% average gain in stocks, going back to 1934, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.


And indexes tend to climb in the six months and one year after the midterms. The last time the S&P 500 failed to make a six-month advance was 1947, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Polling indicates Republicans will win enough seats for a majority of the House of Representatives, while Senate control is a toss up. If Republicans underperform, the stock market would take that as a surprise and may retreat.


Analysts and big investors generally agree that a mixed result, with Republicans winning control of at least the House, will undermine President Biden's ambitious spending plans and favor the stock market.  When power is divided in Washington, sweeping legislative changes are less likely to happen, which means less uncertainty for markets.


"The status quo usually means that corporations can push on with their plans and investments without the risk of everything being upended by new laws and requirements," says Nigel Green, CEO of global advisory firm deVere Group.


Election Outlook For Biotechs, Tech
-----------------------------------


With a divided Washington, big-tech reforms should not be expected, Green added. That would be a plus for tech stocks.


Pharmaceuticals and biotechs may also benefit if Democrat plans to lower prescription drug prices become stalled. A windfall tax on oil producers would also be less likely.


No matter the outcome, policy impacts are likely to be small, and the stock market will remain focused on central bank policy and inflation. Still, tax increases on households or businesses are probably off the table under a split government, strategists for LPL Financial said in a report Monday.


"There is typically incremental improvement to the policy environment for financials, energy, and defense when Republicans hold more power and incremental improvement for health care under Democrats. But ... larger economic forces tend to be more meaningful," they added.


Larry Adam, Raymond James Financial chief investment officer, Private Client Group, echoed that assessment.


"While it is important to look at the political composition of Congress, there are more important factors such as the state of the economy, the Fed's intended policy path, the trajectory of inflation, and the resiliency of earnings growth when it comes to determining our equity outlook," he said.


No matter how the stock market reacts to balloting, it may pale in comparison to the economic data coming this week.


On Thursday, all eyes will be watching the consumer price index and weekly jobless claims data releases. Economists expect October inflation to remain hot, up 8% on an annual basis, with core prices up 6.6%. The stock market is quite sensitive to inflation data because the Fed is determined to raise interest rates until prices cool off.

Reversal Dents Stocks, But Put-Call Ratio Hints At Bottom
==========================================================

U.S. stock indexes tried to rebound Friday, but gave up the gains in the afternoon.




The Nasdaq lost 0.1% after being up as much as 0.5%, while the S&P 500 closed down almost 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average trailed with a nearly 0.4% loss.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.


The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average kept its toehold above its 50-day line. The two major indexes remained stuck below their 50-day lines.


Friday's action added ambiguity to recent bearish sessions.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP081817-215x300.png)President Trump's chief strategist Stephen Bannon was fired. By early afternoon, the Nasdaq rose as much as 0.5% in apparent reaction to news of Bannon's departure.


Coupled with rising volume, this was shaping up as bullish action. But the gains faded.


In a handful of instances this year (including Thursday), the Nasdaq suffered a drop of at least 1.6% in rising volume. Each time, volume dropped in the next session, and in most cases, the Nasdaq notched price gains.


Friday's action could've been the first rebound in higher volume. But the negative reversal dashed those hopes.


Another item for the bulls to chew on is the put/call volume ratio.


On Thursday, the put/call closed at 1.18, the highest since Jan. 18. On Friday, it closed at 1.14, again a high level. Those kinds of readings are often associated with short-term market bottoms.


While there are plenty of reasons to be cautious with the uptrend remaining under pressure, bulls can find some hope in the action of leaders.


Despite Friday's negative reversal, seven stocks rose for every three that fell in the IBD 50.


**Control4** ([CTRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRL)) led the IBD 50 with a 9% jump in volume 333% above average. The smart-home software provider has cranked up its profit margins. In 2016, pretax margin rose to 10.2%, the best in at least nine years. After-tax margin was 13.7% in the most recently reported quarter, the best in at least 19 quarters.


The small-cap stock has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating.


While distribution days are now elevated, the put-call ratio and a bottoming signal in the CBOE Market Volatility Index suggested the market's downside was limited. Still, the weak performance of most breakouts in recent weeks is reason to be cautious.


In economic news, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge read 97.6, topping views for 94.


On Thursday and Friday, the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium will convene. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is expected to speak Friday.

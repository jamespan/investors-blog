  Stock Market Closes Green, Near Highs; Homebuilders, Retailers Lead The Charge

It wouldn't have been surprising to see some follow-on selling in the stock market Wednesday after sellers came in during the final hour of trading Tuesday. But there wasn't much of it Wednesday as homebuilders and retailers turned in a day of solid outperformance.




The stock market strengthened during the final hour of trading on reports of progress on Capitol Hill regarding additional stimulus. But Republicans are considering extending the enhanced unemployment insurance through the end of the year at a drastically reduced level of $400 a month, or $100 a week, vs. the current payment of $600 a week.


The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 led the way, up 0.6%. The Nasdaq added 0.2% and the Russell 2000 small-cap index edged up 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday's levels.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) had another great day, up 1.1%. Top gainers in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks included **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), up more than 8%. It broke out with conviction ahead of next week's earnings report.

Semiconductor stocks started off strong, but the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) halved a 1.4% intraday gain. Wall Street initially liked the look of earnings reports from **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)), but after-hours and premarket gains for both stocks fizzled by the open.


The Nasdaq 100 was under mild selling pressure in after-hours trading, down 0.2%, despite a 5% gain for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) after the company reported [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-profit-second-quarter-earnings/). But **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) slid 2.5% despite a nice [sales beat](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-earnings-q4-2020-msft-stock/).


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The Nasdaq suffered a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) Tuesday, and the S&P 500 showed [stalling action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), another form of distribution. But the distribution-day count in the Market Pulse remains low, and it's generally been low ever since the Nasdaq and S&P 500 confirmed new uptrends in early April. Mild signs of distribution, strong action in leading growth stocks, plus the fact that everyone seems to be calling for a market pullback, are reasons to feel good about the uptrend.


The major yellow flag at this point is that the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 are near the tops of upper channel lines. Connect the highs for both indexes starting with the April 17 high to see the channel line. Both indexes soared above their upper channels on June 13 but reversed sharply lower below the line by the close.


Market Movers
-------------


IBD's leading enterprise software group performed in line with the Nasdaq Wednesday after falling 2% Tuesday. **AudioCodes** ([AUDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AUDC)) was the top percentage gainer in the group, up 10%. It broke out powerfully from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 40.16 buy point.


In economic news, mortgage applications rose again in the latest week, and June existing-home sales jumped 20.7% from May. That fueled a bullish breakout for IBD's homebuilder group, which soared nearly 10%. IShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) rallied nearly 4%, closing at the top of the 5% buy zone from a 47.46 entry.

Big leaders in the group like [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) and **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) are too extended to buy now, but second-tier stocks in the group are still in buy range like **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)). Meritage rose 4% in after-hours trading after reporting earnings. Results from PulteGroup are due Thursday before the open.


Consumer electronics also had a good day, helped by bullish comments from **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) before the open. Shares jumped nearly 8%. The retailer said sales are up about 15% from a year ago since stores reopened. The company also said that through July 18, online sales were up 185%.


In related news, **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) led the discount retail group to a 3.5% gain, helped by a strong fiscal Q2 outlook. Ollie's on Tuesday forecast a 40% jump in same-store sales for the Aug. 1 ending quarter, with total sales of $515 million. Analysts were modeling sales of around $400 million. Ollie's joined Leaderboard Wednesday when it cleared a 105.30 buy point.


Retailer **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) broke out over a trend line, rising 5% to 86.78. The strong move came as the stock finds support at its 10-week moving average and approaches an alternate entry of 88.37.

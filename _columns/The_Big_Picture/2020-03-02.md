Stocks Rebound Sharply; Now, The Next Signals To Watch
=======================================================

The stock market soared Monday, extending a rebound that began Friday. Now the big question is, will the market continue to rebound?




So far, the rebound is moving the way it should after such a severe sell-off. Indexes fought off some hesitation in the first hour Monday and rallied into the close. The Nasdaq composite leapt 4.5% and the S&P 500 4.6%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 5.1%. Its 1,294-point increase was the largest in history, and the first gain of more than 1,000 points since Dec. 26, 2018. On a percentage basis, however, the Dow's rally remained far from a record.


In favorable fashion, indexes closed at session highs Monday and buying intensified in the closing minutes. But volume was well below Friday's levels. While Monday's rally was a relief, it doesn't remove risk from the stock market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP030220-274x300.jpg)It is important to wait for a [follow-through signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) — a big increase in the Nasdaq or S&P 500 in higher volume than the prior day. Even then, investors will need to be cautious. Not all follow-throughs work, and they tend to fail when indexes have made a vertical violation, that is, steep index declines below the 50-day or 200-day moving averages. In the bear market of late 2018, follow-throughs on Nov. 7 and Nov. 28 failed before a Jan. 4, 2019 signal truly got the market moving higher.


If the stock market weren't hard enough to predict, the main cause of the correction is fraught with uncertainty.


Uncertainty Hurting Stock Market
--------------------------------


The spread of coronavirus is making it hard to corral because those infected may not show symptoms for up to two weeks. That means any progress in containing the disease can be offset by new outbreaks. Compared with the U.S.-China trade war, which caused the last market correction, coronavirus is harder to control.


Last week's uncontrolled sell-off seemed to reflect the uncertainty of the virus and the chilling effect it is causing on the world economy.


It was stunning how quickly the stock market wiped out not just the year's gains, but most gains since the October market bottom. It even surprised market veterans. It was the fastest 10%-plus drop from market highs in history, says Los Angeles-based Churchill Management Group. Chairman Fred Fern said he had "never seen a market fall straight down like that without any technical warning."


To be sure, a rebound from oversold levels is not surprising. The market rebounded on hopes that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will act to fend off an economic slowdown.


Monday's rally started sprouting Friday, when the [Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 found support at their 200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-correction-continues-but-a-few-signs-of-a-low-emerge/). Indexes closed well off session lows. Fear gauges hit elevated levels last week, indicating a possible low. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) rose past 1.2%. The [Cboe Market Volatility Index,](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) or VIX, gave its own extreme readings.



On Monday, the S&P 500 climbed back above the 200-day line — another positive step.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), in many ways a China proxy, soared 9% after an [Oppenheimer analyst upgraded the stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-called-oversold-upgraded-buy-big-drop/). The analyst said Apple's production and demand problems should be temporary.


The technology sector as a whole was a leader Monday. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) jumped nearly 6%. Because it relies heavily on Chinese suppliers, the tech sector also is an indicator of China's coronavirus efforts.


The Stock Market's Next Signals
-------------------------------


But remember, many other countries are just starting to deal with coronavirus. For now, keep an eye on the next steps that are necessary for the market to continue its attempted rally.


First, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 must hold above Friday's lows. If they don't, the market is likely headed for more pain. Second, indexes should recover their 50-day lines. Consider that a marker on the road. Third, a follow-through could come as early as this week.


The IBD 50 rallied 3.1%, lagging the stock market's major indexes.

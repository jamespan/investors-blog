U.S. Stocks Close Mixed Amid Fresh Terrorism News
==================================================

The stock market erased early losses and closed mixed Tuesday, a display of resilience in the face of another international terrorist attack.


The U.S. indexes were down as much as 0.6% as news reports detailed the deadly bombings in Brussels. But the Nasdaq bounced back to close 0.3% higher and the S&P 500 fell barely 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 eased 0.1%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.


The resilient behavior was encouraging, whether it was the market adjusting to new realities or its way of judging that Tuesday's bombings would not alter the global economic picture much.

Wall Street has an indecisive record with major terrorist attacks in the West. On the day of the Boston Marathon bombings (April 15, 2013) the market tumbled more than 2%, but rebounded within several days.


Stocks made a bottom on the first session that followed the Paris attacks on Nov. 13 last year. But U.S. indexes made a top on Dec. 2, the day of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting attack. Going back to July 2005, the market started rallying back from a short decline that followed the London subway bombings. Indexes continued a modest correction when Al Qaeda bombed the Madrid trains in March 2004. The 9/11 attacks in 2001 deepened a bear market that was already underway.


Tuesday's news nonetheless did hurt travel-related stocks, which are most sensitive to terrorist fears. IBD's airline industry group slipped 0.8%, lodging 1.1% and travel booking 2.2%. Energy and retail also were broadly lower.


But biotechs and other medical stocks outperformed and helped the Nasdaq come out on top. Generic drug company **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) soared 40% after the company [issued its first financial report in more than a year](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/akorn-releases-long-delayed-2015-report-2016-guidance-stock-jumps/?ven=YahooCP&src=AURLLED&ven=yahoo). The stock remained deep in a correction, however.


Despite the mixed indexes, the market actually grew in strength in another respect.


The number of distribution days fell by two in one fell swoop. That's because the Nasdaq has climbed enough to make the Feb. 29 distribution day irrelevant to current conditions. Under IBD Market School rules for stall days (basically heavy volume without much price progress), another distribution also drops out of the count, at least for the moment. So, all of a sudden, the Nasdaq now has only three days of higher-volume losses, the type of declines that indicate heavy institutional selling and signal a market top when they come in bunches. For the S&P 500 on Tuesday, the higher volume did not spell a new distribution day since the price decline was so small.


That count is more akin with the path of the indexes, which are vying for a sixth consecutive weekly gain. That's a tall order for any market, and investors should not be surprised if stocks pull back to digest the prolific advance of the past nearly six weeks. That ascent already has been moderating.


Leading stocks have not been nearly as productive from breakouts, and that alone should keep growth investors from having a full exposure to stocks.


With less institutional selling in the rearview mirror, other market indicators are improving. The 50-day moving average of the S&P 500 is curving upward. The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were at C- and B-, respectively, in Tuesday's edition.

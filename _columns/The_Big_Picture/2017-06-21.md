The Nasdaq composite ended solidly higher Wednesday, helped by another day of outperformance by biotech stocks, plus solid earnings reports from **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)).


Price action in the NYSE indexes was more subdued, weighed down by weakness in financials and another sell-off in oil and gas stocks.


The Nasdaq composite ended with a gain of 0.7%; the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.3% and the S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%. Small caps performed mostly in line with the Dow and S&P 500, falling 0.3%. Nasdaq volume fell slightly from Tuesday's levels. NYSE volume rose a bit.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) turned in a solid showing, rising 1.6%, as about half the names in the index rose 1% or more.

That's true, but it's still a market with some risks.


Just look at Tuesday's market action, where the Nasdaq suffered a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), falling 0.8% in higher volume, one day after it soared 1.4% in lower volume. The S&P 500 also registered a distribution day Tuesday but selling was relatively calm.


The Nasdaq currently shows five distribution days, but two of them came with declines of just 0.2% to 0.3%. The takeaway is that it's not a market under meaningful distribution, although price action has been somewhat erratic in the Nasdaq since it plunged 1.8% on June 9.


The 10-year Treasury yield edged higher to 2.16%. It's come well off a high of around 2.6% in March. A low 10-year yield isn't great for financial stocks, but despite Wednesday's drop the sector continues to hold its own. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) is trading tightly as it holds above a 62.63 buy point. Meanwhile, the Select Sector SPDR Financial ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) is setting up in a shallow, cup-shaped base.


Elsewhere, **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) offered up the latest breakout in the biotech space, rising 5% to 132.83. It's still in buy range from a 127.74 buy point but not by much.


Red Hat, featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/software-firms-adobe-red-hat-oracle-in-earnings-spotlight/) column as a call-option play, paid off nicely. Just ahead of earnings, when shares were trading around 90.50, a weekly call option with a 91 strike price (June 23 expiration) came with a premium of $2.60, offering a trade with downside risk of 2.9%. Shares surged nearly 10% Wednesday to 98.58.


[IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) name **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) briefly cleared a 46.93 buy point from a well-formed flat base but ended below the buy point. Shares rose 2.5% to 46.54. China-based **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) also outperformed in the IBD 50, rising 4%, but shares have been rallying in light volume after several heavy-volume declines. Despite signs of institutional selling since late May, Sina is still showing resilience, only 5% off it high.


Meanwhile, the latest Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers showed a slight increase in bullishness. The bulls edged up to 51.5%, from 50% a week ago.


Bullish sentiment is still far off a 30-year high of 63.1% set in late February. Around that time, contrarians were calling for a market pullback after multiple readings above the 60% level. Excessive bullishness has been seen at market tops in the past, but Investors Intelligence reminded readers in its latest update that market tops form slowly, often over many months, while bottoms can be put in much quicker.


After the close, shares of **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) surged 8% to 50.39. Headed into earnings, the software giant was working on a flat base with a conventional entry at 47.09.

Stock Market Falls Sharply On Strong Jobs Data; December Jobs Report Up Next
=============================================================================

The stock market fell sharply Thursday after a stronger-than-expected ADP employment report and a sharp drop in first-time jobless claims. Up next, investors will shift their attention to the Labor Department's December jobs report, which is due out Friday morning.




Meanwhile, three leaders to watch include homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), energy leader **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)).


ADP Jobs Data, Jobless Claims, Earnings
---------------------------------------


ADP's December National Employment Report, a precursor to Friday's jobs report, showed 235,000 payrolls added, much higher than the expected 145,000 rise. Meanwhile, the Labor Department's first-time unemployment claims fell sharply to 204,000 vs. 225,000 in the previous week. Both showed a strong job market.


The December services Purchasing Managers' Index was slightly higher than expected, with a 45.0 reading vs. 44.4 estimate, still in contraction mode. The Institute for Supply Management's December services index is due out on Friday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP010523-285x300.jpg)For the December jobs report, Econoday estimates are for nonfarm payrolls to rise 200,000 for the month, lower than November's 263,000. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.7%. Per Econoday, November was the seventh straight month and nine of the last 10 that payroll growth exceeded Econoday's consensus.


Continued strength in the labor market gives the Federal Reserve more room to raise interest rates, and the stock market loathes that.


The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 3.72%, ending a two-day losing streak. Despite Thursday's gains, the 10-year yield is on pace to fall sharply this week.


Companies reporting earnings Thursday included **Conagra Brands** ([CAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAG)), **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) and Dow Jones stock **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)).


Conagra shares climbed 3.4%, while Constellation Brands dived 9.7%. And Walgreens stock declined more than 6%, dragging on the Dow Jones industrials despite better-than-expected earnings and sales results.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1%, and the S&P 500 dropped 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite sold off 1.5%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1.1%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


Amid more losses Thursday, IBD's stock [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains at ["market in correction"](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/bear-market-rally-loses-more-traction-coal-stocks-burned/) due to the continued weakness. That means investors should primarily be on the sidelines in preparation for a new confirmed uptrend. Thursday was Day 4 of a rally attempt, so a [potential follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom-this-signal-marks-all-major-lows/) could occur any time. However, there aren't very many leading stocks near new buy points, which is a key factor of successful follow-through days.


For now, IBD readers should continue to curate their watchlists of top stocks. You can find many of the stock market's future leaders while the indexes are still weak, so now is the perfect time to find stocks separating themselves from the pack.


The best way to find emerging stock market leadership is by using theÂ [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/).


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.2% Thursday as the ETF holds near its 52-week low. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), Chinese leader **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) rallied 4.8%, hitting a new 52-week high. Shares are above the [20% to 25% profit-taking target](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) from a 72.84 buy point.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch
-----------------------------


Homebuilder D.R. Horton is trying to break out past a 92.55 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a cup with handle. Shares topped the entry Wednesday, and are just below a buy point following Thursday's 0.7% gain. While breakouts that occur during market corrections are expected to fail, it is a sign of unusual strength. The stock's relative strength line is at new highs.


D.R. Horton builds and sells homes under different brands. "Express Homes" is at the lower end of the spectrum. "Emerald Homes" is a high-end brand, and the company also has low-maintenance "Freedom Homes." The company operates in 106 markets. It also owns subsidiaries that offer mortgage financing, title and insurance services.


Oil and gas explorer and producer Hess is building a flat base that has a 149.93 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Hess explores, produces and transports crude oil and natural gas. The company operates onshore in North Dakota, with offshore operations worldwide in the Gulf of Mexico, Guyana, Suriname and Malaysia.


Energy stock Hess is on pace for outstanding growth. After reporting earnings of $2.19 per share in 2021, EPS is expected to jump to $7.58 in 2022. Analysts also forecast that fourth-quarter results, scheduled for release on Jan. 25, will produce a profit of $1.80 per share on revenue of $2.93 billion.



[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Neurocrine Biosciences continues to find support around its 50-day moving average. Shares are close to completing a flat base that will have a 129.39 entry, with an early entry at 122.93.


The company makes Ingrezza, a treatment for the movement disorder tardive dyskinesia. In the second quarter, Ingrezza generated $350 million in sales. This year, sales are expected to surge 28% to $1.45 billion. Still, Wall Street is watching for what's next from Neurocrine, which is testing an array of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.


The firm reported Q3 earnings and revenue growth Nov. 1. EPS jumped 69% to $1.08 a share while revenue increased 31% to $387.9 million.

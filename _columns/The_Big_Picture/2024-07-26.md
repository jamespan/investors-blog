The stock market ended a bruising week on a high note Friday following a favorable inflation report. Now the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision and a slew of Big Tech earnings loom.




The Nasdaq composite rallied 1%, though it wasn't enough to offset a weekly decline of 2.1%. This was its second weekly decline in a row as the index closed below a key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). On the bright side, the tech-heavy composite remains up nearly 16% in 2024.


The S&P 500 popped 1.1% Friday, but ended the week down 0.8%. It is managing to hold above its 50-day line for now. The benchmark index retained a gain of 14.5% for the year so far.


Advancers led decliners by around 4-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. The June 20 distribution day on the S&P 500 elapsed on time.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best among the major indexes on the stock market, popping 1.6%. This helped it rise 0.8% for the week, its fourth weekly gain in a row. **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) was the star here, rocketing 23% following an earnings beat.

By contrast, the Innovator IBD 50 exchange traded fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell for the second week in a row despite notching a daily gain of 1.4%. The midcap S&P 400 rose 2% for the week.


While Friday's bounce was encouraging, it was not enough to stave off painful weekly losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. With some noteworthy events in the coming week, including a slew of tech earnings, it remains prudent to hold exposure to the 40% to 60% level for now.


PCE Boosts Stocks; Powell, Big Tech Earnings Next
-------------------------------------------------


Stocks were able to trim some weekly losses following the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index reading. Core PCE rose 2.6% vs. last year, slightly above views for a 2.5% lift according to Econoday. Headline PCE rose 2.5% year over year, matching expectations. The fact it was largely as expected soothed investors.


The coming week could be make-or-break, with a slew of economic events and key earnings reports on the horizon. Chief among them is the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rates, which takes place Tuesday and Wednesday. With hopes rising for a potential rate cut in September, post-meeting comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could provide more clarity and potentially move the stock market as a result.


A slew of labor readings are also due to drop, including job openings data on Tuesday and the ADP employment report on Wednesday. Friday's U.S. employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is the critical data point though. Economists expect the American economy will have added 206,000 nonfarm jobs in July, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


As if that wasn't enough, [some major tech players are set to post results](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-apple-meta-amazon-microsoft/) in the coming week. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are among the companies set to provide quarterly updates.

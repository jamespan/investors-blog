  Stock Market Rises Confidently Again; UnitedHealth Group, Nike Lead Dow Jones

A confident stock market grew even more self-assured Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite marked fresh all-time highs.




A solid performance by China indexes overnight helped encourage the U.S. stock market. When the Shanghai composite reopened on Feb. 3 after a one-week hiatus, it plummeted 7.7% with the coronavirus outbreak in full effect. Now the index has a seven-session win streak under its belt as the rate of new coronavirus infections slows.


It's important to note that amid fears of an economic slowdown in China, there's still a large number of China stocks acting well in the stock market, including **NetEase.com** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Bilibili** ([BILI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILI)) and **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)).


Alibaba reports earnings Thursday before the open. It's getting support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) for the first time after a breakout in November.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP021220-249x300.jpg)The Nasdaq rose 0.9%, helped by another rally in semiconductor stocks. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) jumped 1.4% to a new high. After the close, **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) edged higher in late trading after the chip bellwether [reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/applied-materials-earnings-q1-2020-amat-stock/).


Keep in mind that the Nasdaq is near the top of an upper channel line again, which means a pullback wouldn't be surprising. But two recent pullbacks for the Nasdaq — one starting in late November and another starting in late January — didn't last very long.


The Dow Jones added 0.9% and the S&P 500 picked up 0.6%. The Russell 2000 rallied 0.7%. The small-cap index has its sights set on the 1700 level again. Nasdaq volume was lower. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly higher than Tuesday.


The Nasdaq's Jan. 14 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the count because the Nasdaq rallied 5% from its close that day. In other words, it's no longer relevant.


Dow Jones Winners
-----------------


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) led the Dow Jones with gains of 4% and 3%, respectively. Both stocks are making solid first tests of their 10-week moving averages. Rather than target stocks building bases at this point, many of which have lagging [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), look for stocks getting support at their 10-week lines.


One base-building stock that looks good is [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)). Its relative strength line is near highs as it forms a flat base with a 243.77 buy point.


Wednesday's gains for the major stock indexes came one day after the S&P 500 marked a [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) session. Stalling is a subtle form of distribution when an index gives back an early gain and closes in the bottom half of its intraday range in higher volume.


But meaningful signs of institutional selling in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 just aren't there, and leading growth stocks continue to show strength.


Bond Market Jitters
-------------------


The stock market might be confident about the health of the U.S. economy, but the bond market is still worried about an economic slowdown. Money has basically been flowing into bonds since the start of the year, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 29 basis points to around 1.63%. The coronavirus outbreak has increased the chances of another rate cut by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell concluded his second day of testimony in Congress Wednesday. He reminded lawmakers that the U.S. economy remains on solid footing and that large-scale asset purchases are still a tool for the Fed to keep interest rates low. For now, the stock market is focused on an accommodative Fed, positive corporate earnings and a healthy U.S. economy with low inflation.


Stock Market Gainers
--------------------


Wednesday's session yielded two earnings winners, but gains for **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) faded by the close.

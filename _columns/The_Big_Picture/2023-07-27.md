Stock Market Gets A Healthy, Well-Needed Pullback; Watch These Key Sell Signals
================================================================================

Like the summer heat dome phenomenon covering much of the United States, the hot [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) needed to cool off. Investors who felt like a pullback was due certainly got their wish Thursday.




Volume rose on both main exchanges, indicating that institutions sold into the morning ally and took profits.


Small caps led the sell-off in higher volume.


A 1.3% decline by the Russell 2000 topped losses of 0.6% for the S&P 500, more than 0.5% for the Nasdaq, and almost 0.7% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Midcap stocks fell almost in lock step with their small-cap sisters.


While the Nasdaq's decline turned out to be mild, the leading index for growth stocks had rallied as much as 1.6% in the early going.


The Russell 2000 came close to testing resistance at the 2000 price level; intraday, it got as high as 1994. The index closed at 2001.22 on Feb. 2 before reversing sharply lower.


The SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund backtracked 1.2%. Like the Russell 2000, MDY ran into resistance in the same fashion as it did almost six months ago.

Stock Market Today: Still A Confirmed Uptrend
---------------------------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP072723-198x300.jpg)Breadth, understandably, turned for the worse on Thursday. Early data showed 3,144 stocks on the Nasdaq fell vs. 1,246 companies that rose for the day.


On the NYSE, losers outmatched winners by a nearly 3-1 margin.


However, as noted in [Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-keeps-win-streak-alive-even-after-11th-fed-rate-hike-these-industry-groups-jam/), the 10-day moving average of the advance-decline lines for both the Nasdaq and NYSE stock market exchanges have been moving higher for weeks in bullish fashion.


Volume jumped on both exchanges vs. Wednesday (up 18% on the Nasdaq, 14% higher on the NYSE). The significant declines, combined with heavier turnover on Thursday, highlight professional selling.


Therefore, the Market Pulse saw a jump in distribution days over a 25-session window to four each for the S&P and the Nasdaq.


Eye This Key Stock Market Sell Signal
-------------------------------------


A sturdy stock market uptrend can weather an occasional [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) here and there. These distribution days eventually fall off the count due to time (at least 25 trading sessions since the actual sell-off day) or due to upward price progress. But a slew of heavy sell-offs over a short time frame can offer the timeliest signal that the stock market is headed for a serious correction.


Some listeners on the [daily IBD Live show on Zoom](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) recently asked if a cluster of distribution days always lead to a significant fall. Not necessarily.

---


While the quantity of distribution days is important, so too is the quality of each decline.


In the most recent case, let's consider the Nasdaq earlier this month. It logged these three straight distribution days:


* July 19: up 4 points to 14,358, a rare stalling session
* July 20: down 2.1% to 14,063, a true distribution day
* July 21: down 0.2% to 14,032.81


If all three of these sessions showed the dramatic drop seen on July 20, then yes, the stock market would likely deal with much more serious problems. However, as the late William O'Neil, [longtime IBD chairman and founder](https://www.investors.com/news/william-oneil-legendary-investor-and-founder-of-investors-business-daily-dies-at-90/), liked to say, a stock market bull run does not die of stalling days.


And a 0.2% decline hardly carves a chink in the armor protecting a strong bull.


A Profit-Taking Sell Rule
-------------------------


At the same time, don't ignore those stocks in your portfolio that are triggering key sell rules. They range from doing a round trip of gains (at least 10% or more) from a pivot point, to a steep drop through the 10-week moving average in massive turnover.


The charts of Dow Jones industrials component and consumer spending play **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), plastic shoes maker **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), laggard airline stock **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) and skyscraper window glass supplier **Tecnoglass** ([TGLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGLS)), a longtime inhabitant of [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), demonstrate how these notable actions on a chart can offer a timely exit.

AXP (44 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/), 65 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/)) dropped more than 7% below a cup-with-handle buy point of 177.04.


[Cutting losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) in disappointing stock market moves not only preserves your valuable capital. It opens the door to latching on to a much better growth play.



Tecnoglass rallied nearly 11% from a 49.06 buy point in a [flawed V-shaped cup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/) last month. Those gains have vaporized.


A Follow-On Buy Opportunity?
----------------------------


Argentine oil and gas explorer **YPF** ([YPF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YPF)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) also sold off in heavy turnover Thursday.



However, the former still holds a cushion above its rising 10-week line. The latter is testing its own 10-week moving average.


YPF boasts a 98 RS Rating over the past 12 months and a solid 91 over a three-month time frame, [according to MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).


Strong rebounds off the 10-week line actually can offer a [follow-on entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), assuming the confirmed uptrend stays in place.


The 10-Year Treasury Bond Yield: Back At 4%
-------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, Thursday's action also saw selling intensify in the U.S. Treasury bond market. When bond prices fall, the yield goes up as new buyers are paying less for the same coupon, a fixed interest payment made regularly to holders of bonds.


Not all sectors followed the sell-off.


Chip stocks outperformed following results in recent days by the likes of **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)). In the auto sector, Jeep, Ram and Dodge brands owner **Stellantis** ([STLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLA)) extended its gains after a breakout.


STLA rose 3.3% and made new highs in volume that surged 142% above its 50-day average.


Stellantis' gain from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and an 18.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) has now hit 6.3%.

Beyond The Stock Market: Psychological Indicators Today
-------------------------------------------------------


The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) surged 9% to 14.41. It tested resistance near its 50-day moving average. The year-to-date low of 12.73 did not undercut its 2019 low of 11.42 that preceded the pandemic bear market of February to March 2020.


Bullishness among newsletter writers polled by Investors Intelligence jumped this week to 55.6%, the highest level since a 56.6% reading in the week ended Nov. 26, 2021. Late November 2021 turned out to be the peak of the stock market ahead of the Fed-driven bear market last year.


The bears ratio also jumped this week, rising to 19.4% from 18% last week. Market pundits expecting an intermediate-level correction stand at 25%.

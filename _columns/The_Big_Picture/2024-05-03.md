The stock market bulls skewered the bears Friday as indexes surged off a soft jobs report. Now an appearance from legendary investor Warren Buffett and a slew of earnings from artificial intelligence players are due.




The Nasdaq composite surged 2% Friday, but its weekly lift was a more modest 1.4%. It rose for the second week in a row and has now reclaimed its key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The tech-heavy index is now up 7.6% so far in 2024.


The S&P 500 also did well, rallying 1.8% for the day. Its 0.6% gain for the week saw it close dead on its 50-day line, though it has pulled clear of its short-term moving averages. The benchmark index is now up 7.5% for the year.


Advancers led decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange but about 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq exchange.


Bullish Action Drives This Shift
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP050324.jpg)Other indexes shared in the gains on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/). The Dow Jones Industrial Average vaulted 1.2%, boosted by a planned stock buyback from tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and encouraging interim results from **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) on an obesity drug currently named MariTide.


Small caps also rose, with the Russell 2000 turning in a 1% lift. It closed a hair below the 50-day line. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund is also below the key benchmark despite a 1.4% gain.


The strong gains Friday justify raising exposure to the 40% to 60% range. Buying opportunities were relatively limited, however, which makes holding closer to the lower end of this range a prudent approach. Remember to increase exposure in a measured, disciplined fashion. Lower volume on the Nasdaq's upward thrust means Friday's action failed to qualify as a [follow-through day.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/)


Soft Jobs Report Cheers Investors; Warren Buffett Looms
-------------------------------------------------------


The critical April jobs report gave bulls a few reasons to charge on Friday's stock market. Nonfarm payrolls showed there were 175,000 jobs created, much lower than the 243,000 forecast. In addition, the unemployment rate of 3.9% was higher than expected. Also, average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in April, lower than views for a 0.3% increase.


It came on the back of dovish speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where he said he expects the panel's next move to be a rate cut even as they chose to hold rates steady.


The week ahead is relatively light on economic data. March's consumer credit reading is due Tuesday while wholesale inventories data is due Wednesday. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey drops Friday.


It is a busier period for earnings, though. **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) reports first-quarter earnings Saturday, with the firm's iconic Chief Executive Warren Buffett set to appear at the company's annual shareholders meeting. [Other noteworthy earnings reports due](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/palantir-stock-q1-earnings-arm-arista-stock/) during the working week include artificial intelligence stocks **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and **Arm** ([AI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AI)).

Apple Earnings Boost This Stock Market Group
--------------------------------------------


Nearly all [S&P 500 sectors closed higher Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Technology and communication services were the strongest areas while energy was the only sector to give up ground.



As ever, the Investor's Business Daily industry groups gave a more granular account of what happened in Friday trading.


Solar stocks, database software firms and consumer electronics retailers were among the best performers. But it was the telecom consumer products group, where Apple is a key component, that made the biggest jump.


In contrast, metal products distributors, cable stocks, tire plays and health insurance stocks all underperformed on the stock market.

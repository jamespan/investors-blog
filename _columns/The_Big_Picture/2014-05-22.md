Biotechs Lead Nasdaq Higher; S&P 500 Backs Off High
====================================================

Stocks trudged higher Thursday amid seemingly constant chatter from the bears that economic data and market internals don't support an upside move.

  

The Nasdaq outperformed, rising 0.6%; the S&P 500 gained 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. NYSE volume eased from Wednesday's level. Nasdaq volume rose 7%.

  

The Nasdaq closed above its 50-day moving average for the first time since April 3. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 came within a few points of its all-time high of 1902.17 before backing off.

  

That the Nasdaq closed above its 50-day line doesn't mean it's time for the bulls to pop the champagne, but it is an encouraging development. That said, buying demand in the Nasdaq has been lackluster since its low of 3946 in mid-April. The Nasdaq has gone 27 days into a rally attempt without a follow-through day.

  

Much of the Nasdaq's strength Thursday came from biotech stocks. IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was one of the day's best percentage gainers, rising about 3%. But there wasn't much conviction behind the buying. Top-rated names in the group like **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Alexion** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) all rose in below-average trade.

  

The IBD 50 performed in-line with the Nasdaq, up 0.6%.

  

The bulls might find some comfort in the fact that the IBD Sector Leaders screen (today on Page B1) is expanding. On May 9, a scant eight stocks made the cut, but the screen has nearly doubled in size to 15. China-based **BitAuto Holdings** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) is back above its 10-week moving as it works on a late-stage base. **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), meanwhile, is crafting a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point of 126.58.

  

Thursday's session didn't offer much in the way of heavy-volume breakouts, but **Flextronics** ([FLEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLEX)) was happy to oblige. A cup-with-handle breakout over 9.64 took a while to get going but shares soared 5% Thursday in heavy volume. It's now 4% above the buy point. It's a low-priced stock, but it boasts a high Composite Rating as well as solid mutual fund sponsorship.

  

Another breakout didn't look quite as good by the close. Oil and gas producer **Sanchez Energy** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)) gapped up and rose as much as 9% past a 31.69 entry, but it closed well off highs and near the middle of the day's range including the gap.

  

In economic news, existing-home sales rose in April to an annualized rate of 4.65 million, according to the National Association of Realtors.

  

That was better than the March sales pace of 4.59 million, but below the consensus estimate of 4.69 million.

  

Homebuilders are not a source of leadership in the market. Many names in the group are working on potential bases but are struggling at their downward sloping, 50-day moving averages. **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) are good examples.

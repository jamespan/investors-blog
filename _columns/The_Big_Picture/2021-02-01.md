Stock Market Rebound Sends Nasdaq Above This Key Chart Indicator
=================================================================

One day after Friday's sharp losses placed the [market's uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) in a tenuous state, the stock market shook off nervousness surrounding the dramatic rise of heavily shorted stocks that put a popular chat room on Reddit.com in the global limelight.




The calculus behind IBD's downgrade of the current outlook rested in large part on the fact that the Nasdaq composite split through its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Friday for the first time since Nov. 4 — the very day that the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 staged a key [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/). IBD research has found that when markets trend higher in a serious way, they respect the 21-day line.


So, the Nasdaq composite's nearly 2.6% rally on Monday fed a big spoon of encouragement for the bulls. Not only did the premier index for growth stocks retake the 21-day line, it recouped all of the prior day's losses. Volume fell.


The S&P 500 did not take back all of Friday's 2% decline. But a 1.6% rebound on Monday highlighted strength by leading companies in areas of software, internet, e-commerce, biotech, chip, medical technology, telecom, construction and alternative energy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, up just 0.8%. It closed the day just underneath the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Watch These Leaders In The Stock Market
---------------------------------------


**![MP020121](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP020121-201x300.jpg)Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), highlighted on Monday's [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), rallied nearly 2.7% and continues to work on the right side of a potential new base. A climb back above the now-falling 50-day moving average would be bullish. The videoconferencing innovator will likely post fiscal fourth-quarter results in early March.


**TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) offers a fine example of how breakouts can be choppy.


The specialist in insulation installation cleared a 190.36 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a base that carried the [elements of a cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). After struggling late in December and shaking new buyers out, the midcap growth stock and [MarketSmith Growth 250 member](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) made a second breakout attempt in early January. Last week's pullback right to the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) was normal action. (Please go to Monday's [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) for commentary by guest panelist Mark Minervini on how he handles post-breakout tests of the proper entry.)


On Monday, TopBuild outperformed. Shares rose 3.6% to 207.22, and they retook the 21-day exponential moving average.


[On Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders), at least eight stocks jumped 3% or more.


Will Advance-Decline Lines Bend Back Up?
----------------------------------------


Positive action in the small- and midcap arenas on Wall Street certainly helped make the stock market internals look a lot better.


Winners beat losers on the NYSE by close to a 4-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers won out by more than 3-to-1.


SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) rallied 2.1%, getting to within 3.9% of its all-time peak of 452.16 set on Jan. 25. Meanwhile, iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) gained nearly 2.5%.


The midcap ETF is trying to keep a solid cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The 50-day line began rising in earnest in early November. Ditto for the Russell 2000 ETF.


Track The Earnings
------------------



The next few weeks will flood the news wires with quarterly results. So far, large-cap companies have been beating tamped-down expectations by a large ratio. [Long-term leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) such as **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)) have issued earnings and sales guidance for fiscal 2021 that's also forcing analysts to raise their forecasts. That's good.


Also good? Last week, media outlets raised concerns among hedge funds. Some may be forced to "throw the baby out with the bathwater" by selling good stocks to cover losses in short positions. Yet the macroeconomic picture hasn't changed much in the past few weeks. As President Joe Biden works with moderate Republican members of Congress to hammer out a compromise plan to further aid the economic recovery, the price of debt hasn't changed much. Data from the Cboe shows the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield slipping to 1.07%.



Meanwhile, Politico.com reported in the late afternoon that the CEO of trading app Robinhood is expected to appear before the House Financial Services Committee. The company has been raising billions of capital to shore up its finances amid a blizzard of individual buying of stocks in companies such as **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **BlackBerry** ([BB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BB)) and **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)).


Robinhood apparently limited new buys in GameStop among its customers to one share per account. GameStop fell 100 points, or nearly 31%, in the stock market Monday to 225.


Be wary of companies that make strong initial runs but don't have the true fundamentals to back up the gains.


**MingZhu Logistics** ([YGMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YGMZ)) made an extraordinary reversal, falling 34% to 23.30 in massive volume after reaching as high as 58 on Monday. The stock is threatening to do a full round trip of gains since clearing a 18.94 buy point in a narrow base. The company's sales in the past two quarters on average fell 8% vs. year-ago levels.

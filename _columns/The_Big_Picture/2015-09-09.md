Stocks' Big Reversal Sends Market Uptrend Back Under Pressure

The stock market got smacked with a nasty reversal Wednesday, a day after powerful gains in higher volume triggered a confirmation of a new uptrend. Most leading stocks behaved in similar fashion. As a result, IBD's outlook was downgraded to "Uptrend under pressure" from "Confirmed uptrend."

  

The quick outlook change means individual investors would benefit from having a high level of cash in the portfolio and being extra cautious on new stock buys.

  

The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 1.2%, taking a big chunk of Tuesday's 2.7% rally. Volume grew mildly.

  

More ominous was the way in which the Nasdaq gave up decent opening gains on Wednesday and finished near the session's low. Also, Wednesday's session featured a wider trading range than on Tuesday, producing a bearish "outside day." (See the price bars of the Nasdaq's chart on Page B2.) The S&P 500 fell 1.4% in higher volume on the NYSE.

  

A distribution day (index losses in higher volume) arriving so soon after a change in trend does not automatically kill a new rally.

  

After a follow-through took place Dec. 20, 2011, the Nasdaq suffered a 1% drop in higher trade the next session. Yet the tech-heavy index closed in the upper half of the day's range. The pullback was mild; the market quickly resumed its fast ride up.

  

An astute investor need not find a crystal-clear reason for any significant decline, including the one on Wednesday. Institutional trading desks plainly decided to sell hard following Tuesday's follow-through; this suggests investor conviction remains wobbly.

  

Small caps fared slightly better. The S&P 600 was off almost 1%.

  

The lack of muscle among top-rated stocks can be seen in the IBD 50; in Wednesday's edition, merely half of the list were trading at or above their respective 10-week moving averages.

  

When a stock is trading below its 10-week line, the prospects for a strong breakout are paper-thin. Such stocks need more time to complete their base work and present an opportunity for the careful speculator to buy stocks.

  

One should not ignore the sudden bulge of bearishness that is weighing on the market. On Wednesday, the Investors Intelligence survey showed a smaller ratio of bulls (25.7%) vs. bears (27.9%), a first in years. (See B11.)

  

The mutual funds share purchases vs. redemptions ratio is now below 1.0, similar to what happened in August 2011. Back then, the major indexes corrected 20% before turning higher.

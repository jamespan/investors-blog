The bad news is that stocks failed to tack on gains following Friday's positive action Monday. But on the bright side, the losses came in lighter volume. Hurt by chip, data storage and software stocks, the Nasdaq lost 0.9%, wiping out gains from Friday's lows. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) also weighed on the Nasdaq, as shares fell 0.7%. The maker of iPhones and iPads kicked off its annual developers' conference Monday. (See [story](http://news.investors.com/technology/060815-756314-apple-announces-apple-music-ios-9-mac-os-x-el-capitan.htm).)

  

The tech-heavy index is back near potential support at its 50-day line and the 5000 level.

  

The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.5%. Weakness in the transportation sector handed both indexes a third straight loss. The Dow Jones Transportation index tumbled 2.1%, as airlines tumbled on bearish analysts comments.

  

Monday's action was disappointing in that no addition buying came in after the stock market staged a comeback Friday. Stocks have had trouble putting in back-to-back gains in recent weeks. The S&P 500 hasn't been up two days in a row or more since May 14-18, while the Nasdaq hasn't achieved the same feat since May 20-21. Both indexes have stuck to sideways trading.

  

Volume ended lower across the board from Friday's pace. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 avoided a distribution day due to the lower turnover on the major exchanges. This was a good sign because the market has suffered a few days of higher-volume selling in the past two weeks, especially on the S&P 500.

  

Leaders down in fast trading were largely contained. Six stocks in the IBD 50 fell 2% or more in above-average volume. Overall, the IBD 50 lost 1%.

  

A small number of leading stocks were able to buck market weakness. New issue **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) poked above a 69.10 entry from a new handle, but finished below it.

  

Chip designer **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) climbed for a fourth straight day in fast trade.

  

This trendless market makes it a tough environment to trade in. While there are buying opportunities in leading stocks, the lack of a tail wind from the market means investors need to be more cautious and tone down profit targets.

  

Consider taking profits at 10% to 15%. And if a breakout isn't working, cut losses at 3% to 5%. There's no need to swing for the fences or give a stock much breathing room when underlying conditions are not optimal.

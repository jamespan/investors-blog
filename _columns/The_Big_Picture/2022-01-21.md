title: Stock Market Tumbles Again As Investors Grow More Fearful; Is A Bottom Near?

The stock market capped a very bad week with more losses Friday as steel producers, regional banks and mining stocks lagged badly. Money flowed into bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 8 basis points to around 1.75%.




Several indicators point toward an oversold market, but that doesn't mean a bottom is near. Renewed signs of accumulation would certainly help the indexes' cause, but there are no signs of it yet as institutional investors continue to unwind positions in growth stocks.


The [Cboe Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) (VIX) spiked 15.5% Friday and more than 50% for the week as option traders grow more fearful. The put/call volume ratio, another fear indicator, hit 0.88%. The stock market isn't showing extreme fear yet, but excessive fear has been seen at market bottoms in the past, including March 2020 when the VIX hit a high of 85.47 after more than doubling in February.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite made an early stand at the 14,000 level after falling 2.1% early but closed well below the round number. It ended with a loss of 2.7%. The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) fell 2.8%, weighed down by earnings sell-offs for **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)).

[Semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) outperformed for while in the Nasdaq 100, but eventually got pulled down with the market. A 3.3% intraday gain for **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) faded to a loss of 0.9% by the close.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP012122--300x259.jpg)The Nasdaq fell 7.5% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March 2020.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.3%, falling further below its 200-day moving average. The next level to watch for the Dow is the Dec. 1 low. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) was the worst performer in the blue-chip index, down nearly 7%, as Wall Street worried about the Disney+ streaming service in light of the Netflix news.


The S&P 500 fell 1.9%, closing below its 200-day line for the first time since June 2020. **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) was the top gainer in the index, up 2.6%. The chart still looks good as it forms an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/).



Volume rose sharply on the Nasdaq and NYSE, but it was skewed a bit by options expiration. Declining stocks topped advancers on the Nasdaq and NYSE by more than 4-to-1.


Just when it looked like financial stocks were ready to provide market leadership, the SPDR S&P Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) fell 9% for the week, closing just below its 10-week moving average. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) also had a bad week, down 6.5%.


What To Do Now
--------------


Watching from the sidelines in cash, waiting for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/)Â and having a watchlist of stocks that are holding up relatively well is the best course of action at this point. Target stocks that have pulled back in orderly fashion. Avoid stocks that are more than 50% off their highs.

Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), small-cap **Amphastar Pharmaceuticals** ([AMPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMPH)) almost completed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) but not quite. Still, it's trading tightly near highs after a recent breakout from a cup base.


**Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) is a good name for the watchlist as it tests the 10-week moving average. Earnings and sales growth has accelerated for three straight quarters. Next week is a busy week of [earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-watch-apple-stock-holds-up-amid-tech-carnage-tesla-battles-near-1000-level-ahead-of-results/) in the data storage group. SIMO reports Wednesday after the close, along with **Seagate** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)). **Western Digital** ([WDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC)) reports late Thursday.


Shipping stocks, a nice pocket of leadership lately, came under more selling pressure. **ZIM Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) fell for the fourth straight session. It's trying to hold its 21-day line. Group peer **Matson** ([MATX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MATX)) is trading just below a 93.28 handle buy point after issuing bullish Q4 guidance Thursday.

title: Stock Market Down, But Nasdaq Cuts Big Losses; This Fear Index Jumps

With fresh instances of higher-volume selling highlighted by this column in recent weeks, you could actually call Tuesday's down day in the [current stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) a bit encouraging.




Meanwhile, volatility continued to amp up. While the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), or the [VIX](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vix-volatility-index-can-confirm-stock-market-bottoms-coronavirus-bear-market/), is nowhere near its stratospheric level of 85 seen in March of last year, the fact that it's rising again actually sounds another encouraging note. Why? Fear — at least among options traders — helps push money to the sidelines. Such money could return back into stocks.


The VIX closed off session highs. Still, at the day's high of 23.73, it still marked the highest levels since early March.


Nasdaq, A Relative Winner Today
-------------------------------


Amid a broad sell-off, the Nasdaq composite performed best. Its 0.1% smidgen of a loss Tuesday nearly wiped away an early drop exceeding 2%. And the day's action compared positively with drops of 0.9% by the S&P 500 and almost 1.4% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


![MP051121_4](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP051121_4-219x300.jpg)Notice on a daily chart how the Dow industrials gapped down for the first time since Jan. 15.


In a downward gap, the session high is below the lowest price encountered in the previous session. Chartwise, that's weakness.


Yet even though bank, cyclical and retail-spending members of the Dow 30 fell hard, the index still respected its 21-day exponential moving average. Plus, the blue-chip average has built a mighty nice cushion above its 50-day line.


Stock Market: Still Choppy And Bifurcated
-----------------------------------------


The Big Picture has often noted that 2021 has behaved like a bifurcated market. While FAANG and digital economy stocks have struggled, commodity and construction-related issues have taken over the driver's seat. But the market can just as easily switch these roles, at least for a day or two.


[MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) shows that among the 197 industry groups monitored by IBD, the day's worst group, residential and commercial building, got walloped with a 4.4% drop. Wood product, specialty retail, discount and variety retail, RV and mobile home, international oil and gas, home furnishings retail, oil drilling and insurance broker stocks all slid 2% or more on a price-weighted basis.


In contrast, enterprise software, gaming software, movie, solar, steel, gold and silver mining, and metal ores enjoyed solid gains in the 1.5%-2% range.

A week ago, IBD's current outlook got ratcheted lower to a cautionary "uptrend under pressure" from "confirmed uptrend" as both tech and industrial firms got socked. Yet as [Friday's Big Picture highlighted](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-on-weak-jobs-report-dow-jones-sp500-hit-record-highs/), the outlook changed again, back to a confirmed uptrend. Such frequent fluctuations in IBD's official stance on the state of the market are generally not welcomed by active investors. Yet they reflect a totally different mood among the biggest forces on Wall Street.


So even if we're back to the green light phase in the market, it doesn't mean that you should proceed as if it's all systems go.


How Nervous Are You?
--------------------


Market skittishness makes it tougher to see outstanding price gains right after a stock breaks out. Instead, you might expect CAN SLIM-quality stocks to run past a proper buy point, then dash back below it — kind of like the small lizards you see on hiking trails all across Malibu and the San Fernando Valley of Southern California.



Just take a gander at **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)), the [IBD 50 stock to watch today](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-mining-leader-southern-copper-eyes-buy-point-copper-prices-surge/). On Monday, shares flirted with an 83.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a three-month [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) before pulling back. Tuesday's positive reversal, however, was bullish action. And at 81.41, its 20% gain quarter-to-date blows virtually all equity indexes out of the water.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose for a third day in a row, hitting as high as 1.63%. Gold and copper futures rallied, with the latter up almost 1%.

  Growth Stocks, Large Caps Hold Up Well Amid Flaccid Jobs Report

A [surprisingly weak U.S. jobs report for August](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-miss-could-delay-fed-tapering-futures-volatile/) provided all the comfort of sweaty bluejeans in hot, humid weather, at least initially. But major equity indexes closed Friday mixed. [Growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) did well overall.




Techs led. Small caps pulled back. Other sector indexes did much worse.


While the Nasdaq composite stretched to new all-time highs during Friday's 0.2% lift, the S&P 500 inched slightly lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.2%, the Russell 2000 0.5%, the Dow utility average 0.8% and the Dow Jones transportation average 1.1%. Yet while the Dow industrials edged 0.2% lower for the week, the Nasdaq added almost 1.6%. The 500 rose 0.6%, making it four up weeks in the past five.


Volume fell Friday on both main exchanges. Essentially, after big news on the previous Friday, in which Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said a future tapering of monthly bond buys does not immediately spell interest rate hikes, the stock market spent the past week generally padding late-summer gains.

Beyond Growth Stocks
--------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP090321--278x300.jpg)The market headed into the three-day Labor Day weekend with a savory melange of leadership among growth stocks, at least sectorwise.


On Friday, Internet topped IBD's combined [NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-sep-02-2021/) as No. 1 among 33 sectors for medium and long-term price-weighted performance. Chips, Apparel, Metals, Electronics and Machine occupied five of the top eight places. Cellar dwellers within the rankings? Aerospace sits at No. 30; its 8.4% gain lags a nearly 21% advance by the S&P 500. Mining ranks No. 32; Alcohol/Tobacco is at No. 33.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose 3 basis points to 1.32%. Yet the rise since the July low remains tame compared with the 3-1/2-month plunge in yields from late March to July.

Is It Still TINA?
-----------------


Veteran economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni.com points out that during the second quarter, the S&P 500's annualized dividend yield had fallen to as low as 1.35% — "almost identical to the current bond yield."


Of course, this highlights in part the robust gains by large caps so far in 2021, on top of the S&P 500's 16.3% rally in coronavirus-infected 2020. But it also affirms just how well companies in the $15 billion to $1.5 trillion category by market value have performed against their "SMID" (small and mid) cap peers.


"The S&P 500's outperformance relative to its smaller-cap counterparts has lacked apparent earnings justification," Yardeni wrote in a note to clients. "That is, the V-shaped recoveries in the forward earnings of the S&P 400/600 SMidCaps have been even more impressive than the impressive rebound in the S&P 500's forward earnings since they all bottomed last year during May and June."


According to Yardeni's Aug. 30 report, Wall Street's consensus forecast for S&P 500 earnings in 2021 stands at $201.84. This means that as of Friday's closing price of 4535, the S&P 500's forward-looking earnings yield of 4.4% has come down quite a lot vs. recent years. But it still reflects a reasonable return vs. bonds.


Go to the 2022 EPS forecast of $220.39, and the earnings yield rises to almost 4.9%.


So, despite the inevitable wiggles, fluctuations, pullbacks and two-day scares in the market, are we still in a TINA — There Is No Alternative — market?

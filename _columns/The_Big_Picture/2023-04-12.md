Nice start, not so tasty finish. The Nasdaq played this somewhat somber tune on Wednesday despite a wee bit of evidence that inflation is cooling.




However, the stock market overall seemed to prefer a tack of indecision and caution, rather than rock the boat wildly in one direction or the other. That, of course, could change when a [few large banks kick the earnings season off](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) by sharing first-quarter results and business outlooks on Friday.


The Nasdaq dropped nearly 0.9% on Wednesday in a disappointing session for the bulls for at least two reasons: Not only did the composite index waste an early gain of more than 0.8%, but volume increased vs. the prior day.


This marked the third [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or session of heavy professional selling, in a span of just five sessions.


A New Nasdaq Distribution Day
-----------------------------


IBD research has found that after a long run-up, a spate of distribution days, which could include stalling sessions, in a short time frame can slay a market uptrend.

While the Russell 2000 lost 0.7% after being up as much as 0.9%, SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) fell 0.6%. Cyclicals fared better amid a 2.1% thrust higher in U.S. crude oil futures. The S&P 500 gave back 0.4%. At 4091, the large-cap benchmark still holds a solid 6.6% gain year to date.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1%. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) led the upside within the 30-stock blue chip index, rising nearly 3 points to 330.24 in dull turnover. Notice on a daily chart that its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) is still slanting lower. Goldman, which reports Q1 results on April 18, also still trades below its 50- and 200-day lines.


Keep in mind that the Dow index is price-weighted. Three more Dow stocks, including emerging tech leader **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), which was discussed with U.S. Investing Championships winner Mark Minervini in [Wednesday's IBD Live session](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), also gained 1 point or more.


Volume paled by just 32 million shares on the NYSE. Thus, the S&P 500 avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). As the Market Pulse shows, the S&P 500's rack of sell-offs in heavier volume stays clean in this regard.


Also, keep in mind that the Nasdaq's three distribution days have lacked serious bite.


Only one of these sessions showed a drop of 1% or more â€” a 1.1% dip on April 5.


Beyond Nasdaq: Inflation Cools Some
-----------------------------------



Moreover, the Nasdaq's 200-day moving average continues to bottom out and is trying to lift. The above chart also shows a slowly rising 50-day line, which is bullish for the market.


Investors initially bid up stocks early in Wednesday's session on news that [U.S. consumer prices rose by just 0.1% in March](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-cools-lifting-s-the-fed-would-be-crazy-to-hike/) vs. the prior month. That came in well below the Econoday estimate of 0.3%. In February, the CPI index rose 0.4% month on month. On a year-over-year basis, consumer prices still advanced at a high rate of 5%. But that was also under the consensus view for a 5.2% rise.


Core prices at the consumer level, which exclude volatile food and fuel prices, jumped 0.4% vs. the prior month and 5.6% vs. a year ago, meeting views.


From these data points alone, it makes sense that the Nasdaq did not preserve its initial gains. Few would dispute that inflation is now at a comfortable level for the Federal Reserve. And the CME Fed Watch gauge of bond traders affirms a strong likelihood that the U.S. central bank will ratchet the cost of money yet again at its May 2-3 meeting. The fed funds rate, currently at a 4.75%-5% target range, currently has a 69% likelihood of going up another quarter point to 5%-5.25% early next month.


That would complete a money-tightening campaign of 5 full percentage points since the Fed's move to a range of 0.25%-0.5% in March of last year.

Interest Rate Uncertainty Still Lingers
---------------------------------------


Meanwhile, some market observers noted that the minutes from the most recent Fed meeting on interest rates, released at around 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, underscored a growing difference among policymakers on what the bank should do to both get inflation to its long-term objective of 2% without causing a serious disruption to the financial system.


"Even though all participants agreed to raise rates by 25 bps (basis points) at the March meeting, there were 'several participants' that considered whether it would be appropriate to hold rates at this meeting and 'some participants' considered a 50 bps rate hike given persistently high inflation and the strength of recent data," Jason Englander, portfolio manager of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors, said in an email comment sent to IBD. "The Fed did acknowledge that the banking sector stresses will likely lead to some tightening of credit conditions, but it is uncertain to what extent. So that, along with lag effects to hikes already done over the past year, the Fed will now be even more data dependent at each meeting."


Indeed, the Nasdaq and other major indexes began to sell off roughly 30 minutes after the Fed's minutes' release. However, the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), representing the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq, had already peaked just 15 minutes into the trading day. Up as much as 0.7% in the early going, QQQ closed almost 0.9% lower. The index slid in the final 90 minutes. The Direxion Nasdaq 100 EqualWeight ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) exchange traded fund also slipped 0.9%.


Where's The Turnover?
---------------------


Nonetheless, volume proved dull in the major averages in recent days. There's been a curious dearth of trading in leading stocks. From this vantage point, it further clouds the outlook for the life expectancy of the current Nasdaq-led rally.


Take the [current IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full). Only six issues saw above-average turnover on Wednesday.



One rare instance on Wednesday of heavy trading in the market leadership? **Mobileye Global** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), which mimicked the Nasdaq's reversal with a 2.2% decline. Volume jumped 24% above average. At 41.37, the leader in advanced driver assistance technology is still hugging its 50-day moving average as a new base takes shape.


Long investors will want to watch for any extra heavy trading that occurs on or around April 24, when a 180-day lockup of shares held by insiders since the Oct. 26 IPO reportedly expires.


The leading stock boasts a 97% gain since its IPO at $21 a share.

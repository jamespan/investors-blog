The Nasdaq composite gapped up to another new high in the stock market early Wednesday, helped by another strong showing for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) stock and continued strength in semiconductor stocks. But an early gain of 0.7% faded for the Nasdaq. So did a gain of nearly 2% for the Philadelphia Semiconductor index.




**Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) fell 1% in after-hours trading after reporting earnings. Results from **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) are due Thursday after the close.


The Nasdaq inched up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 edged lower by less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 avoided stalling-type [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) because volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE came in lower than Tuesday.


At one point Wednesday, the Nasdaq composite was 7% above its 50-day moving average. That's an area where the index has started to pull back in the past. Also keep in mind that the Nasdaq last week violated an upper channel line, another sign the index could be on the cusp of a pullback.

The bulls are now at 59.4%, up from a prior reading of 57%. Bullish readings above 55% call for a more defensive posture. While it's important to give your big winners room to run, trimming positions in other strong performers might make sense.


In the past, excessively bullish readings north of 60% have come ahead of market pullbacks. In January 2018, bullish sentiment was a lofty 66.7%. That came ahead of a 12% decline for the Nasdaq in February and another 12% pullback in March.


Stock Market Leaders Acting Well
--------------------------------


Still, amid plenty of calls for a market pullback and a large supply of extended stocks out there, the action in market-leading growth stocks remains superb.

China stocks sold off Tuesday on news of a coronavirus outbreak in China. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) fell 2% in light volume Tuesday but managed to close near its highs for the session. It's still trading near its 10-day moving average. Last week, Tesla tried to sell off on Thursday, but a 5% intraday loss was shaved to 1% as the stock found support at its 10-day moving average.


The bottom line? Leaders are acting just fine.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), featured in Wednesday's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/), joined the breakout ranks Wednesday, rising more than 2% to 318.30 in light volume. But shares have been under accumulation since the stock hit a low of 282.36 in late December. FleetCor is still in buy range from a 315.85 entry and continues to act well despite news of an FTC lawsuit in December against fuel-card services giant that alleged deceptive fee practices.



**Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)) was another solid gainer, up 5% to 79.08. It ended the session just above a 76.72 double-bottom [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). After a 12% pullback, the pattern could also be interpreted as a flat base with a 77,76 entry. Formerly known as Taser International, Axon was featured in Tuesday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/axon-stock-near-buy-point-amid-ftc-antitrust-fight/).


Another IBD 50 stock, **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), rose for the seventh straight session. It's vying for a breakout from a flat base with a 247.74 buy point.


In the managed care group, **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) is still in buy range after a solid first test of its 10-week moving average last week. Group peer **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) joined [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) last week after a successful test of its 10-week line.


Interest Rates
--------------


The 10-year Treasury yield gave up more ground Wednesday, down 1 basis point to 1.77%, after Tuesday's sharp drop. The 10-year yield has come under pressure of late, helping the cause of homebuilding stocks. Strong price performers in the group include **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)).


A slew of homebuilders have earnings reports due in the coming week, including D.R. Horton, **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)), PulteGroup, **MDC Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)) and **Beazer Homes** ([BZH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZH)).

Indeed, homebuilder have low interest rates working in their favor. For now, the stock market isn't worried about the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to combat inflation. Last month, new projections showed that none of 17 Federal Open Market Committee members expect the Fed to cut rates in 2020 below the current fed funds range of 1.5%-1.75%.Â By 2021, 12 of 17 policymakers expect one or more Fed rate hikes.

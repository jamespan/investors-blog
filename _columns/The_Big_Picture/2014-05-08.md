Stock Indexes Reverse Lower; Oil Stocks Take Pounding

Stocks staged a negative reversal Thursday, erasing respectable midday gains.

  

The Nasdaq lost 0.4% after being up 1%. The S&P 500 turned a 0.6% gain into a 0.1% dip. The IBD 50 underperformed for a third consecutive session, dropping 1.2%.

  

Volume slipped on both major exchanges.

  

Losses were broad. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, losers led winners by a more than 7-to-2 ratio.

  

Oil stocks, which had been rising, took a hard spill Thursday.

  

The trouble in oil was chiefly related to quarterly earnings disappointments among companies that reported either Thursday or after Wednesday's close.

  

Stocks missing the Street's earnings estimates included **Sanchez Energy** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)), **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), **Antero Resources** ([AR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AR)) and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)). Stock price losses ranged from 4% to 5% in heavy volume.

  

The negative mood apparently spilled over to oil companies reporting good results and even those that haven't announced results. **Laredo Petroleum** ([LPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPI)) topped views on revenue and trounced the consensus estimate on earnings. Yet the stock dropped 5% in strong volume.**Canadian Natural Resources** ([CNQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNQ)) has not yet reported Q1 results, but it fell 3% in fast trade.

  

If oil loses its thrust, that raises a question about what if anything is capable of leading the market. Reverse the question, and we might wonder what if anything can resist the market's correction for long.

  

Economic news was positive Thursday. First-time jobless claims fell to 319,000 â€” below the consensus view for 330,000 and below the low of the entire range of estimates. Retail Metrics reported that U.S. retailers notched a 6% same-store uptick in April, the biggest increase in 2-1/2 years.

  

Still, as Gerald Loeb pointed out in his 1935 classic, "The Battle for Investment Survival," an investor is better off using the stock market to predict the news than using the news to predict the stock market.

  

One factor that may be working against the current market is history. As IBD reported in early January, this year faces tough [historical hurdles](http://news.investors.com/investing/010314-685088-whats-ahead-for-stocks-in-2014.htm?ntt=Bullish%20Trends%20In%20Market%20Face&p=full) . After a down year followed by two strong up years, a fourth straight up year is rare.

  

Since 1900, only seven similar cases existed and only one (1951) delivered a gain.

  

"History would seem to suggest that asking for an up year in 2014 is asking for a lot," IBD reported on Jan. 6.

  

What has happened since then that would change that perspective? Nothing.

  

Individual investors who are sitting on cash or on cash equivalents have no reason to re-enter this market, at least not yet.

Stocks finished mixed in a topsy-turvy session Monday, but also spurred at least one key question about one key sector:


Will medical and health care stocks thrive again, and do they have Paul Ryan, President Trump and Congress to thank?


In what was one of the strangest sessions in the U.S. equities market so far this year, institutions actually showed support for the gigantic sector amid chaos in Washington over the future of health care in the world's largest economy (at least in spending per capita).

One exception: **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), a fantastic play — from its January 2013 breakout to new highs to its most recent peak in July 2015. Shares in the large-cap biotech rose more than 1% in above-average turnover to 124.86, holding modest gains past a 122.49 buy point.


Celgene is currently on the watchlist of [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/).


Another important medical play that is emerging as a solid leader: **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), which sank at the open but reversed to end 2.8% higher in big volume.


Early Monday, investors braced for another big drop as the key indexes look poised to post a rare day of 1%-plus losses in recent months. Index futures accurately predicted a 1% drop, on the rationale among market pundits that the failure of the Republicans' plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare cost President Trump a lot of political capital and could greatly hamper his ability to make good on an even bigger policy goal of cutting taxes.


Yet Monday's sell-off ended 15 minutes into the session. At around 9:45 a.m. ET, the indexes reversed and began recouping the fast losses. The S&P 500 failed to recoup all of its lost ground, but finished down just 0.1%. The large-cap index remains up 4.6% year to date.


The Russell 2000 edged 0.2% higher.


Nearly two dozen industry groups rose 1% or more. They included generic drugs (the top-performing group today, up more than 4%), hospitals, medical software, wholesale drugs, biotech, outpatient and home care, medical services and medical systems firms.


On the NYSE, winning stocks nearly matched losers. On the Nasdaq, winners topped by a 4-to-3 ratio, a positive for the uptrend that has been in place since a rare Day 3 follow-through on June 30.


 Elsewhere in the market, **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) bucked the market decline and took a good step forward in forming what may become its first base following its sensational market debut.
Snap's fine day in the market, in one way, hammers home a point made by IBD founder and Chairman Bill O'Neil over the years: Don't worry too much about who's in the White House. Care more about the innovators that are creating new products, new services and new companies that become great investment vehicles for the masses.


Snap has terrific top-line growth. Revenue has grown 890%, 1,255%, 666% and 406% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Wall Street sees Q1 and Q2 revenue also rising at triple-digit pace.


The question is, when will it translate into profits?

title: Indexes Cap October With Halloween Treat; This Stock Could Shift The Market

Major indexes finished the month of witches, ghouls and goblins on a good note Tuesday, and it wasn't just because of big-cap techs.




The Nasdaq composite, driven in part by a third-straight solid gain by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), rallied 0.4% and finished near session highs. Apple, benefiting from price-target hikes and reports of strong orders for the new ultraluxury iPhone X, makes up 7.1% of the Nasdaq's total market value.


Apple's solid advance, coming two days before its highly watched fiscal Q4 results after the close Thursday, has been a boon for the other key benchmarks as well. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both edged 0.1% higher as volume rose slightly on both exchanges.


The Street sees Apple's earnings for the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter rising 12% to $1.87 a share on an 8% increase in revenue to $50.79 billion. If Apple meets that top-line target, it would mark the fourth quarter in a row of revenue growth and a slight acceleration in results. Investors will also be heavily interested in clues to how Apple will satisfy what looks to be strong demand for its newest iPhones.


The 12% EPS increase would stretch Apple's streak of modest double-digit profit growth to three straight quarters.


Another tech heavyweight, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), makes up nearly 6% of the Nasdaq. While the Google search engine operator drifted lower for a second straight session, Tuesday's quiet session capped a thrilling month for shareholders. Alphabet rose 6.2% in October and produced a new breakout, gapping past a 1,006.29 buy point in a sound-looking flat base.


**[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MPv_171031_145113098_335827.png)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MPv_171031_145113098_335827.png)Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) likely had just as exciting an October as the two stocks mentioned above. The diversified tech software and hardware play has risen more than 25% since clearing a very shallow nine-week flat base at the end of March.


When you combine the strength of such megacap techs mentioned above, despite some spills by other former big market winners (think **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG))), it's not that hard to figure out why the Nasdaq still maintains a lead in the year-to-date performance.


For the month, the Nasdaq cruised to a 3.6% gain, padding its advance since Jan. 1 to nearly 25%.


The S&P 500 rose 2.2% in October and is now up 15% for the year.


Small caps led the upside after getting hit hard in the prior session. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied nearly 1%, wiping out a good chunk of Monday's 1.4% drubbing. The gains by companies with market caps in the $5 billion range and lower certainly had a positive effect on Tuesday's market internals. Winners trounced losers by a nearly 2-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq, and 9-to-5 on the NYSE.


While the NYSE advance-decline line (see it on the S&P 500 chart in the General Market Indicators page link below) has edged lower in recent weeks, it doesn't seem to have fallen enough to warrant a concern that the overall market is rising on the shoulders of a narrowing number of gainers.


Another way to put it: Techs are not rallying alone. Numerous nontech stocks, ranging from leisure and consumer spending to construction and finance, are also participating in this rally.


[Top industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-oct-31-2017/) over the four weeks include residential and commercial builders (up 13.1%), desktop software (+12.5%), solar (+10.2%), internet retail (+9.6%), semiconductor equipment (+8.9%), design software (+8.5%), plastics (+8.3%) and fabless semiconductors (+7.8%).


The worst industry groups over the same time frame? Drug store chains, wholesale drug supply, hospitals, department stores, fiber optical gear and ethical drugs headed the list. All of these groups fell 6% or more.


With two months left in the trading year, investors can still expect a ton of news in addition to unforeseen events that could shape the direction of the stock market. You've got the potential for a new U.S. corporate tax cut and a simplified tax code. Bundles of companies are still going to report quarterly results over the next few weeks. Monthly data will potentially reaffirm that the U.S. economy is on track to accelerate, which would benefit companies and consumers.


While a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve, which wraps up Wednesday, is not expected to change the current course of short-term interest rates, investors will still be eager to find any signs of whether the U.S. central bank is growing more confident about the economy and about inflation.


Through Monday's close, the S&P 500's annualized dividend yield is at 1.87%. That is remarkable, given the equity market's strong gains since the [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) of June 30, 2016. Even though interest rates have been creeping up, it's not even close to the pace of past hikes in the cost of money.


The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is currently at 2.38%, only about half a percentage point above the S&P 500's dividend-only yield.


What Could Threaten Stocks?
---------------------------


Still, an equity investor should always keep one eye on the threat of accelerating inflation. A too-fast rise in prices could act as a poisonous witch's brew for equities.


Oil is up big in recent months, even though the U.S. dollar hasn't fallen back too hard. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose nearly 1% to $54.68 a barrel, hitting a 27-month high.


Copper, the so called metal with a Ph.D. in economics, began the year at around $250 per pound. Today, it's hovering near $311, up 24% year to date. And no wonder. Manufacturing activity is robust. So is consumer spending.


As seen in IBD's Economic Calendar, Monday saw a 1% jump in U.S. consumer spending in September, beating the Econoday consensus view of +0.9%. The same day saw the Dallas Fed Manufacturing survey's "General Activity Index" come in at 27.6 in September, blasting the 21.3 forecast and up from 21.3 in August.

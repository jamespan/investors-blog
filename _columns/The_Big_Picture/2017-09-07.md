Stock Indexes Steady; Hurricane Could Test Market
==================================================

U.S. stock indexes stayed in a narrow trading range Thursday as Hurricane Irma headed toward Florida.


The Nasdaq gained less than 0.1% after intraday moves of 0.3% up and 0.2% down. The S&P 500 was just under flat and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.1%.




Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Both major indexes held above their 50-day moving averages, a good sign for those who live and die by technical indicators. Since Tuesday's market sell-off, stocks have avoided further heavy selling.


Weather forecasters aren't sure exactly when Irma will hit Florida, but the aftermath could test the stock market.

Insurance stocks took a nose-dive in the run-up to Harvey and the aftermath, leaving Dow component **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) 11% off its high.


**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) rose about 4% from the eve of Harvey's landfall through Thursday's close. West Texas intermediate crude oil was essentially flat Thursday.


Trailers As Hurricane Plays
---------------------------


RV and mobile home stocks also rose in the sessions related to Harvey. **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) squeezed a breakout out of Harvey's expected recovery spending, but Thor hasn't gained much since. In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, the government bought 145,000 trailers and mobile homes industrywide, spending $2.7 billion.


On Friday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency entered its first post-Harvey order, according to CBS News. FEMA asked prefabricated-housing manufacturers to produce more than 4,400 homes for families hit by Harvey. More orders are expected.



In the manufactured housing space, longtime player but thinly traded **Skyline** ([SKY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKY)) has speared higher in the past few weeks. The stock gained 47% in the week ended Aug. 18, gave back 8% in the next week, rose 9% last week, and is up about 15% so far this week.


Banks Stumble As Bonds Rally
----------------------------


Meanwhile, bank stocks sank further as the rally in bonds continued. As bond prices rise, yields fall. The yield on the 10-year bond fell to 2.05% Thursday.


Why the rally in bonds?


Investors looking for reasons have plenty to choose from: The European Central Bank's dovish tone, North Korea's obstreperous behavior, the hurricanes, the looming departure of Federal Reserve Deputy Chairman Stanley Fischer and a general flight to safety.


For banks, the reason why yields are falling isn't nearly as important as the fact that they are. When Donald Trump won the presidency on Nov. 8, the 10-year yield was 1.85%. As conviction grew that President Trump and the Republican Congress might achieve their goals on tax cuts, ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank regulations and infrastructure projects, the risk-on trade — which sends money out of safe havens and into stocks — boosted the 10-year yield to 2.60% by mid-December.


Mid-December was around the time money-center banks ended a quick run-up and began to shift sideways. One last rally emerged and then the big banks began to consolidate in early March.


The trend toward higher interest rates has helped banks, but that confidence on future rate hikes has faded. CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the probability at 98.6% that the Fed will take no action at its Sept. 20 meeting. In a sign of how far sentiment has shifted, the remaining 1.4% are convinced that the Fed will *lower* rates to a range of 0.75% to 1%. Currently, the fed funds rate is set at 1% to 1.25%.


Overall, the stock market has handled the many negatives surprisingly well — from weather to Republican paralysis to North Korea. Yet sooner or later, the market must get some good reasons to rise, if the uptrend is to stay on track.

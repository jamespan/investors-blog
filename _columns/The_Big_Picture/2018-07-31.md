Stocks Find Relief, And What Apple's Earnings Mean For The Market
==================================================================

Stock gains faded Tuesday afternoon, but the major indexes closed higher and — most important — held at a couple of crucial levels. Apple earnings after the close gave the market more to smile about.




The Nasdaq climbed 0.5% after being up as much as 1%. Notably, the composite bounced back above the 50-day moving average following a brief dip below it. The index needed a resting spot after two days of sharp declines, and the 50-day line obliged.


Another significant low occurred on the S&P 500. The index rose 0.5% and held above the 2800 price level, where support has appeared for nearly three weeks. A drop below that level or below the Nasdaq's 50-day average would damage the market even more.


Apple ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) shares rose after the close in reaction to [the company's quarterly results, which beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-fiscal-q3-2018/). In extended trading, shares were back above the 194.30 buy point of a flat base.


As an industry bellwether, Apple's earnings are always important. But they took on greater significance after other major techs were roiled following their earnings reports.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP073118-230x300.jpg)Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) took heavy hits the past week. Apple's post-earnings rally was a welcome relief for investors.


Because there's so much market weight in the top techs, any retreat in just a few stocks can bring much of the rest of the market lower.


Technology is 25% of the S&P 500. Only five stocks — Apple, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Facebook and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — account for about 15% of the S&P 500. On the Nasdaq, those five account for more than 30% of the composite, if you include Alphabet's class A and class C shares.


To borrow a phrase from economics, if the big techs sneeze, the whole market can catch a cold.


It may not have felt like a successful month after the tech sell-off of the past several days. But July was a good month for stocks. The Nasdaq climbed 2.2% and the S&P 500 3.6%, their best month since May and January, respectively. The Dow jumped 4.7%, also its best month since January.


The Russell 2000 rose 1.6% in July. On Tuesday, though, the small caps led the market. The Russell 2000 jumped 1.1%.

CLOSE




On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4%. Dow component **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) broke out of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) in heavy volume after the pharmaceutical company [beat second-quarter expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-earnings-top-second-quarter-views/) but gave a soft forecast.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Advancers led decliners by 2-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 12-to-7 on the Nasdaq.


The Dow transports also led, rising 1.3% as trucking and logistics groups were among the top 10 of 197 industry groups on the day.


Transportation was one of July's top sectors. Rail, transportation equipment and airfreight were among the [top 30 groups among 197 industries](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) tracked each day by IBD. Hospitals, medical research equipment, steel alloys, oil refineries and semiconductor equipment were some winning industry groups.


While Tuesday's market gave investors relief, the outlook remains clouded after so many top leaders got hammered. Many top stocks have fallen below the 50-day average. The market's wounds certainly aren't superficial. It will take more healing to bring the market to a higher level of confidence.


Tuesday was a good start, though. For now, investors should keep exposure to stocks lighter. New stock purchases should be limited to high-confidence companies. Cutting losses short is especially important. Never let a loss get larger than 7% or 8%. Taking some profits makes sense and going on margin is especially risky.


The IBD 50 rose 1.3% in a good showing for leading stocks. That was another positive layer to Tuesday's market. The IBD 50, whose median market cap is less than $10 billion, saw some of its best gains among small- and midcap components.


**Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) rose 3.8% as it found support at the 10-week moving average. **Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)) added 3.4% and climbed back above its 50-day line. **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) rose 3% and then more after hours on the company's earnings report.


Besides reaction to Apple's earnings, the market Wednesday will have its eyes on the Federal Reserve. The central bank concludes its two-day meeting with a policy announcement at 2 p.m. ET. Almost everybody expects the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged, but the big unknown is how many more rate hikes we will see this year. Three are almost assured, but a fourth is only a possibility.

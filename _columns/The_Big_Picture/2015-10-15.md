Stocks piled on big gains Thursday, as the Nasdaq confidently retook its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq plowed ahead 1.8%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. The IBD 50 popped 1.7%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 was the day's star, thrusting 2.3%. Strength in small caps is a good sign, suggesting at least some bulls are turning aggressive.

  

Although the Nasdaq finished high in the day's range and above the 50-day line, the test at the line might not be over. This has been a volatile market.

  

However, the bulls could be forgiven for locking onto the next challenge: The indexes are only 1% to 2% from a test at the 200-day line. In normal bull markets, the 50-day line is above the 200-day line.

  

The Nasdaq's 50-day line made the bearish cross under the 200-day line in late September, while the S&P 500 did the same in late August.

  

August 2011 was the last time the 50-day line crossed decisively under the longer-term line. The indexes took about six months to correct that situation.

  

On Thursday, economic news was mixed. First-time jobless claims were almost 6% lower than expected, while manufacturing surveys were weaker than the Street's consensus estimates.

  

However, the market appeared to get some help from China. The government there revealed that it would reform the state-owned telecom industry. This raised hopes for a wave of deregulation to step up growth.

  

Results were mixed for China-based telecoms listed on the U.S. exchanges. Still, other China-based stocks appeared to get a boost from the news.

  

E-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) leapt 5%. **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and **Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)) each gained 4%. **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) popped 3%. Online sports-lottery service provider **500.com** ([WBAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBAI)) lunged 6% higher.

  

Among IBD's 197 industry groups, gains were broad. Biotechs, chipmakers and chip designers, finance and retail Internet groups all posted good gains.

  

Biotechs were especially strong. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index roared 4.4% higher. The nearest competitor for the session was the Nasdaq Bank index, up 2.1%.

  

On Friday, the University of Michigan will release its preliminary consumer sentiment survey for October. The Street expects an 89.5 reading, up from September's 87.2.

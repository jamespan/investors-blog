Biotechs Hammered Again, But Crude Oil Helps Give Stocks A Broad Lift

Stocks rebounded mildly Wednesday. Investors have, in large part, crude oil to thank.


Big caps and small caps rose in unison. The S&P 500 and the S&P SmallCap 600 both gained 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite's slightly better lift of almost 0.6% halted a two-day sell-off and took a decent bite out of Tuesday's 1.3% slide.


But oil starred in the day's drama, as April-expiring contracts in light crude oil soared 5% to land north of $38 a barrel. Crude oil is approaching the $40 level that was last seen in early December. That's more proof that when the mass media and Wall Street come up with an extreme opinion ("Here Comes $20 Oil,") the market proves the masses and the pundits wrong.


![MP031016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP031016-199x300.jpg)Returning to equities, volume on both main exchanges was quiet. As seen in the big charts on Page B2, volume on the Nasdaq in fact has been below its 50-day moving average in roughly eight of the past 13 trading sessions. It's been a relatively dull week for both economic news and earnings results.


One cannot ignore the strong correlation between crude oil and stocks right now. Both financial assets bottomed on Feb. 11. The former has surged nearly 50% since that point. But as for energy-related equities, it's largely been a bottom-fishing game.


Look at the top 11 sectors among IBD's daily stock research tables -- the top third -- starting in today's paper on B3. None is energy-related. Rather, it's a mix of both growth and defensive sectors, including mining (up 32% since Jan. 1 as of Wednesday's IBD), No. 4 food and beverage (+3.4%), No. 6 apparel (+9.6%) and No. 10 electronics (+0.7%). Ten of those 11 are outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq since Jan. 1.


One sector conspicuously absent from the top 11? Medical. Biotech stocks, in particular, keep getting trashed. Why? Isn't the long-term future of demand for medicines and life-saving treatments still on the rise?


Quite possibly, yes. But in the stock market, nothing moves in a straight line. Biotech and ethical drug stocks have stoutly led the market for more than four years. Multitudes of bases formed, and those with the best fundamentals busted out of these bases to greatness and new highs.


But as seen among the likes of **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), these companies' earnings and revenue growth have slowed sharply. So, since the second half of 2015, the savvier mutual funds and institutional portfolio managers reaped profits and moved on.


So, who has stepped up to fill in the vacuum? As this [column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/u-s-stock-indexes-cool-off-amid-cold-chinese-export-news-volume-sinks/) noted in Wednesday's IBD, defensive stocks still have a strong grip on the reins. In the latest IBD 50 in the paper, three of the top 15 spots belong to REITs: **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)), **Equity LifeStyle** ([ELS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELS)) and **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)).

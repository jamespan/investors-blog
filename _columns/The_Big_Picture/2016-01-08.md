Stock Indexes Lose More Ground, But At Least Volume Steps Down
===============================================================

Stocks booked sizable losses in fading volume Friday, which almost made the day seem like a win. The Nasdaq fell 1% after being up 1.1% early. The S&P 500 trimmed 1.1%, while the small-cap S&P 600 lost 1.7%.


The IBD 50 skidded 1.6%.


Volume fell across the board.


None of these numbers is good. Yet, at least the market avoided the torrid, high-volume selling seen in three of the previous four sessions.

A rebound of some kind wouldn't be unusual at this juncture, but individual investors should avoid new buys until a follow-through day emerges.


A follow-through involves a sizable gain in rising volume in a major index. Such a surge must occur on the fourth day or later of an attempted rally.


News on Friday provided meat for the bulls and the bears. Payroll numbers for November came in at a stunning 46% stronger than expected.


The market decided that stunning was good only for a half-hour rally after the opening bell.


At 10 a.m. ET, the wholesale trade report for November was released. Inventories slipped 0.3%, missing the Street's consensus view for a flat reading. The data suggested that manufacturers were working off inventory.


The market slid on the news.


In some ways, the wholesale trade figures weren't so shocking. The inventories-to-sales ratio was 1.32 in November, virtually unchanged from a 1.31 reading in the previous three months.


The reaction pointed to a market that is looking for an excuse to go down.


For market timers who have been heeding cues to raise cash and avoid new buys, weighing the news and watching the losses can be relaxing.


Such investors can sit in cash and wait for the market to find a bottom. Longtime market timers don't care how long that takes.


A longer and deeper correction would probably be better. Weak holders need to be driven out. When only high-conviction holders are left in a stock, then new money can ignite a rally.


Until then, patience is in order for buyers of individual stocks.


Patience also is a good strategy for mutual funds investors.


As IBD founder William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks," mutual funds are designed to be held "10, 15, 20, 25 years or longer. Sitting tight for that long requires enormous patience and confidence. It's like real estate. . . . It takes time for your property to appreciate."


So, don't confuse market-timing rules for individual stocks with how you handle a mutual fund. They are totally different vehicles. Fund investors must not panic.


An individual stock may go down and never come back, which is why any stock that falls 8% below your entry should be sold. However, a fund with a proven track record nearly always bounces back.


Two secondary indicators might be worth watching. The put-call volume ratio closed at 1.23 Friday for the second day in a row. This suggests that at least a short-term bottom may be near.


The bulls vs. bears split among advisors has closed to 34.7% bulls vs. 31.6% bears. A crossover in which the bears gain the upper hand would be bullish for stocks.

Stocks Win By Not Losing; 4 Market Factors To Weigh
====================================================

U.S. stock indexes chalked up small gains Thursday, refusing to give back any of the previous session's big advance.


The Nasdaq closed pennies above flat, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.




After trailing earlier in the session, small caps ended the day as the leader: The Russell 2000 rose 0.3%.


Volume faded on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. The major indexes are holding above their 50-day moving average, a good sign.


Thursday's action was normal, considering Wednesday's 1.1% pop in the Nasdaq.


Four factors that recently emerged are worth the individual investors' attention.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MP092817-204x300.png)— Banks are showing signs of life after about seven months of rolling, sideways action. The new highs tally for banks reached 48 in Wednesday's session. This was the most any single sector has posted since March 1, when banks posted 72 new highs. On Thursday, banks made about 30 new highs, according to preliminary data.


These kind of numbers haven't been seen in the bank sector since the so-called Trump rally was in play. Numerous times in November through March 1 the banks delivered four dozen or more daily new highs.


So far, a handful of major banks have been dancing around their buy points. The action has been tentative. Bold moves will have to replace the tentative action if banks are to break out and grab the market leadership baton.



The banks near buy points include **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) and **SunTrust Banks** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)).


Among the six, Western Alliance has the highest Composite Rating, 94. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 94 means the stock is in the top 6% of all stocks in IBD's database.


— The second factor to consider is a secondary indicator, the [NYSE short interest ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nyse-short-interest-ratio-as-signal/). On Wednesday, the indicator hit 5.65, a five-year high. The indicator measures the total number of shares sold short vs. the NYSE's average daily volume. A reading of five means it would take five days of average volume to cover all the short positions in the exchange.


This is a contrarian indicator, meaning the new five-year high is bullish for the stock market.


However, the indicator doesn't always work. The previous five-year high was Sept. 18, 2014. A four-week downtrend followed, lopping about 10% off the Nasdaq. But a six-week rebound was next, delivering a roughly 17% gain.


— The third factor hovering over the stock market is President Trump's tax-cut package. The package appears to have much to please business, Wall Street and conservative Republicans.


The problem heretofore is the Republican Congress' strange ability to turn favorable odds into certain defeat.


Yet, it will take an unusual amount of blundering to ensure defeat this time. The House Freedom Caucus has endorsed Trump's tax package, something that didn't happen in the efforts to partly repeal and partly protect ObamaCare.


— The fourth factor is almost a nonfactor. The Federal Reserve had a big influence on the stock market as long as quantitative easing was the game. But Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues don't appear to be much of a force at this juncture.


The stock market has pegged the Fed as a fixed factor now. CME Group's FedWatch Tool says the odds are 98% that the Fed won't raise rates in November. But the tool puts the odds at 73% for a December rate hike.


Economic Data
-------------


In economic news Thursday, the third reading on second quarter GDP came in at 3.1%, topping the first two readings of 2.6% and 3.0%.


First-time jobless claims were about 1% fewer than expected.


Coming Up
---------


The Street will get reports Friday on personal income and spending; the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index; and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge.

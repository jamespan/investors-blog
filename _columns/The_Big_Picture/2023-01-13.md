Stock Market Ends Week With A Flourish, But Consider This; These Groups Shine
==============================================================================

The stock market shrugged off economic warnings from bankers to reverse higher Friday. Indexes closed the week with solid gains, but it's time to watch for a pullback.




The S&P 500 ended the trading day with a slender 0.4% gain and a 2.3% weekly gain. The benchmark index has mounted both its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and 200-day line, closing just a hair above the latter benchmark. Holding this key level will be an important test of relative strength.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fared better, with a 0.7% lift. It has mounted its 50-day line but is still 4.8% below the 200-day moving average and needs to overcome major [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) to add to short-term gains.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to book a slim 0.3% gain Friday as it ended the week 1.9% higher. It continues to lead the major indexes, with its 50-day line now well above the 200-day moving average. [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were among the best performers.


IBD 50 Shines But This Worry Remains
------------------------------------


Small caps had a relatively positive session, with the Russell 2000 hoisting 0.6%. But the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) really caught the eye, thanks to its 1.2% gain. Even so, it has lots of work to do, still situated well below major moving averages.


The first earnings season of 2023 is now underway, with big banks kicking off with downbeat commentary on the economy.

Dow Jones component **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) CEO Jamie Dimon warned that while the U.S. economy currently remains strong, the effects from geopolitical tensions, the vulnerable state of energy and food supplies, persistent inflation and "unprecedented" quantitative tightening remain unclear.


During the earnings call he said it "may be a mild recession, it may not."


Of more immediate concern for investors is the Cboe Volatility Index ([VIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIX)), which is seen as a key psychological indicator on fear in the markets. It fell 2.6% for the day and now sits at the 18.4 level.


The market has reversed near this benchmark several times, going back to April of 2022. Investors should be on alert in case this proves to be the case once again.

The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave further insights.


Integrated computer system stocks, coal plays, department stores and metal product distributors were the biggest winners


Auto stocks, automobile retailers, home furnishings companies, media periodical stocks and air freight plays were the worst performers.

Some investors may not tire of this refrain in the fourth quarter. The refrain? Stockswise, small has been pretty beautiful lately.




The S&P SmallCap 600 gushed 0.7% on Tuesday, pounding the likes of the Nasdaq composite (up 0.1%) and the S&P 500 (up just a bit more than 1 point). The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.1%, also could not beat this small-cap gauge, even as **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) turned a 6-point loss into a 10-cent speck lower, and as four of the 30 components gained 1 point or more.


Boeing is still deep in [base-building mode](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Will it be a [saucer](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/)? Or will a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) form? Time will tell.


Volume edged less than 1% higher on the Nasdaq vs. Monday and fell around 6% on the NYSE.

The small-cap S&P 600's gain was no fluke. Bolstered in large part by unusual strength in the oil and gas, retail and banking sectors, the Russell 2000 — another popular gauge of small caps — rose almost 0.5%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP121719-257x300.jpg)At 1015.72, the S&P 600 etched a new 52-week high and expanded its quarter-to-date gain to 7.2%. That comes close to an 8% advance since Oct. 1 by Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), another haven of numerous high-octane stocks with market values in the $1 billion to $6 billion range. The ETF eased 0.3% on Tuesday.


Stocks Today Show Warm Economic Glow
------------------------------------


Another batch of good data on the U.S. economy, including [housing starts and industrial production in November](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), gave market bulls reason to stay the course.


The recent agreement on phase one of a comprehensive trade deal between the U.S. and China, Congress' potential passage of the USMCA trilateral trade pact, and news that taxes on medical products and health insurance may end, offer hope that the economy will continue to grow and avoid a recession in the near term.


The thesis behind investing in the housing and finance sectors makes sense. Interest rates are still low. The yield curve, which plots the percentage return to U.S. Treasury bond buyers across a wide range of time frames, is keeping its positive shape. Remember all the media chatter about a yield curve inversion earlier this year? You haven't seen that phrase used in recent months as the curve normalized.


On Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year bond saw its yield stay at 1.89%, 26 basis points above 1.63% for two-year notes and 33 basis points more than 1.56% for three-month Treasury bills. This positive slope in yields blows profitable winds into the sails of banks and lenders. Two of the companies in the "Leaders up in volume" section of today's Market Pulse table provide loans.


Headed into Tuesday's trade, [Finance ranked No. 13 among IBD's 33 sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-dec-16-2019/) for mid- and long-term price performance within IBD's stock tables.


Still A Laggard
---------------


It's hard to see the energy sector, save for battery storage and solar firms, act as another market leader soon. Amid the national debate on whether large institutions should invest in carbon-producing fossil fuel producers, crude oil still has enjoyed a bullish 2019. U.S. crude futures rose 0.6% to $60.57 a barrel, up 33% year to date. That smothers a 27.3% gain by the S&P 500 over the same time frame.


Oil stocks still look rather weak.



Take **Vermillion Energy** ([VET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VET)) of Alberta. Its 2.2% gain in above-average trade shined brightly within IBD's Canadian oil & gas exploration and production industry group. That group was just one of a handful of groups within the 197 tracked each day by IBD that stormed 2% higher or more on Tuesday. Track the daily action of all 197 industry groups each day after the market close at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


Yet as Vermillion's stock chart shows, the small cap ($2.4 billion market value) has simply suffered a bone-crushing hit since it peaked at 72 in June 2014.


At this point, Vermillion and scads of other oil and gas firms need to finish off a [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/) before a real breakout could take place.


Stocks Today And In 2020: 5 Themes
----------------------------------


For 2020, assuming very little change in the cost of money, mortgage firms, real estate-focused REITs and homebuilders may offer some good investment opportunities for CAN SLIM devotees. A few such companies have made their way into places such as the IBD 50. **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), No. 25 on the list Tuesday morning, is a money center bank. But it also participates in the real estate industry big time.


Four more investing themes that may offer a profitable focus in 2020:


1. **Retail and consumer spending**. [The New America](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-new-america/) and [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) have highlighted two well-run discount retailers making strong runs. These sectors also encompass a huge chunk of the U.S. economy.
2. **Medical devices, ethical drugs**. [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) has discussed numerous leading stocks in these dynamic, big-spending areas. Recent IBD Live shows included some perspective on longtime leader **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and cosmetic procedure equipment maker **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)).
3. **Enterprise software, business services**. Just look at the screens within [IBD Stock Lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) and you'll see continued strength, new bases and recent breakouts among these leaders.
4. **China**. Retail, e-commerce, and social media are gigantic industries in the Middle Kingdom. Watch to see if IBD 50 sees another increase in Chinese-based firms making the ranks.

  Nasdaq Suffers 5th Distribution Day; Are We Near A True Correction?

Key indexes cooled on Tuesday and volume heated up. But from the vantage point of a daily chart, the action appeared to be more of a "two steps forward, one step back" nature.


The Nasdaq composite, still the premier index in 2017, led the broad decline with a 0.8% drop that followed Tuesday's 1.4% gap up, the biggest gain so far in 2017. The S&P 500 fell 0.7%. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

A flood of energy and banking names, meanwhile, helped sour the day's market breadth. On both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, losing stocks outnumbered winners by a nearly 5-to-2 margin.


The combination of significant declines in higher turnover is a strong clue that fund managers took profits and sold stocks harder than normal. IBD calls this [distribution](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). A rush of distribution days over a few weeks is the timeliest signal of a major market top.


At five distribution days for the Nasdaq, such a relatively high number would normally be worrisome. And a few of those five were genuine sell-offs (including the 2.6% hit on May 17, which will expire later this week on time; and the 1.8% drubbing on June 9). So, why would it be less the case today?


It's important to note that the count is raised by a dubious distribution day on Friday, when options on stocks and indexes and related futures expired, boosting volume that day. The Nasdaq actually showed a stingy character, losing barely 0.2%, while closing nearly at the top of its intraday range. Notice, too, on the large daily chart (see the link below), the Nasdaq kept a decent cushion above its 50-day moving average.


In a healthy market, the major indexes ride above their 50- and 200-day moving averages, and these two lines are also rising. Such is the case for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500, as well as the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000.


On Tuesday, the Dow lost just 0.3%, yet it still trails the tech-heavy Nasdaq by a country mile. The former is up a respectable 8.6% since Jan. 1, but the latter is up almost 15%. The S&P 500 is up 8.9%.


The strength of internet, e-commerce, chip and software stocks account for most of the Nasdaq's outperformance. And don't forget the nice gains seen in related sectors, such as electronics, which in the latest IBD Weekly ranked No. 1 among all 33 sectors. (See page B4 in the weekly print edition.)


The dynamism of these sectors, coupled with the long-running weakness of energy and most retail sectors, perhaps shoots down the growing belief in the financial media that stock-picking is dead. Far from it. As the IBD Mutual Fund index, which tracks some of the best-run funds, shows. (See the chart via the link below.)



This year is proof positive that the strength of a stock's industry group and broad sector can make a hearty difference in returns. Among the top 20 groups in IBD's 197 rankings, almost all are coming from the computer, telecom and consumer fields. How about the bottom 20? Almost all of them are in retail, energy and metals. Dairy products are the exception.


The action among individual leaders in the past two days suggests that there is renewed institutional interest in the biotech space. **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) has formed a new base quickly, offering a 127.74 cup entry. Keep in mind, however, that the recent action has a bit of a "straight up from the bottom" feel. Nonetheless, Celgene's daily chart shows above-average turnover in five of the seven most recent up days in price. That's a sign of serious institutional-quality buying.


The Street sees full-year earnings of the cancer and inflammatory disease specialist rising 23% in 2017 and another 21% in 2018. Revenue grew 18%, 18%, 21% and 21% in the past four years and is expected to jump 18% to $13.2 billion this year.


**Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) continues to thrive after bolting out of a bottoming base with a 453.06 buy point. And one of Celgene and Regeneron's peers recently joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/).


Institutions are always hungry for companies that are at the forefront of innovation and new products that benefit society. That seems to be the message from the biotech industry lately. The group is now in the top 40 of 197 industry groups.

<p>In the meantime, upon closer inspection of the price-and-volume action, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq showed stalling action. The two indexes edged up for the day but finished in the lower half of the day's session as volume edged up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/">Stalling is a rare form of distribution</a>. Per IBD's rules, a first stalling session within the count always gets recorded within the 25-session cycle. Therefore, the Nasdaq has one distribution day on the count, while the S&amp;P 500 continues to show four distribution days.</p>

Or at least keep its supersize gains from the second half of May through all of June. So far, those hopes have become reality.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average has obliged. That's actually saying a lot, since it's served as the caboose of this current bullish train of stock price movement. Up 0.3% to 35,061, the popular blue chip gauge registered its eighth straight gain on Wednesday.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>
<p>Also impressive? Its sector indexes did pretty well too.</p>
<p>The defensive-oriented Dow utility average outpaced the Dow Jones industrials with a nearly 1.1% gain. And the Dow transportation average climbed 0.8%.</p>
<p>Those two sectors' gains outpaced a rise of almost 0.5% by the Russell 2000 and a 0.2% move up by the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite eked out a gain of 4 points or less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq 100 tracker, Invesco QQQ Trust (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ" target="_blank">QQQ</a>), lost less than one-tenth of 1 point.</p>

<h2>Dow Jones Industrial Average Today: Will It Handle Earnings Season?</h2>
<p>Volume expanded very mildly on both main stock exchanges vs. the prior session.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one has to approve of the way the breadth of the rally keeps improving.</p>
<p>For instance, the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has popped to its highest level since early March. The overall trend? Still less than clear. For this reason, <a href="https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF">MarketSmith</a> has recently added a 10-day moving average to the Nasdaq's A-D line. That is, it's now easier to conclude whether or not the rally is becoming authentic or a head fake. You want to see the 10-day moving average of the A-D line rise, not fall.</p>
<p>On MarketSmith, go to "GMIAB" and "GMIAA" on the daily chart to track the 10-day moving average for both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.</p>
<p>So far, a generally favorable response to banks' earnings helps sweeten the case for investing in the Dow Jones industrials. But has it really been outperforming lately?</p>
<p>Going from the July 7 close to Wednesday's intraday high, the Dow Jones has climbed 4.4%. Not shabby at all. Yet that lags a 5.9% ascent by the Nasdaq 100, which includes the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 has risen 4.1% over the same period.</p>
<p>How about the Dow transports? A 4.7% hoist over the above-noted eight-session time frame now places the sector index nicely above the 16,000 level, something that has not happened since March last year.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones transportation average now stands just 11% below its all-time peak of 18,246 set in early November 2021. This action may reaffirm market observers' view that the U.S. may avoid a hard landing in the economy, even after 10 straight hikes in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield sank 4 basis points to 3.74%.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Bulls Gain More Steam</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, IBD gets the weekly statistics on sentiment among newsletter editors polled by <a href="https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/">Investors Intelligence</a>. A jump in the bulls ratio to 54.2% from 51.4% seems normal; in June alone, the S&amp;P 500 vaulted 6.5%. Meanwhile, the bearish ratio hardly moved, now at 18% vs. 18.1% last week.</p>
<p>IBD research has found that the bulls vs. bears ratio can stay abnormally high for extended periods of time before a real fissure in the bull market gets abundantly clear.</p>
<p>And what about market volatility? From the view of options traders on the S&amp;P 500, well, it's still very low. But not as low as what had been seen in years such as 2019 (11.03), 2018 (10.17) or 2017 (8.56). Currently, the Cboe Volatility Index has rebounded more than 3% for the week to 13.76.</p>

<h2>A Primary Indicator</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 rallied sharply enough to knock out the June 23 <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/">distribution day</a>. Given the stalling day on Wednesday, the count remains at four distribution days on the books, in terms of IBD's 25-session time window.</p>
<p>The remaining distribution days — a 0.4% drop on June 16, a 0.2% dip on July 5, and a 0.8% decline on July 7 — would also face the ax if the 500 rallies at least 5%, on an intraday basis, from the closing prices of these sessions, respectively.</p>
<p>As always, in a bull market or a bear market, your primary indicator of health should not be limited to the price-and-volume action of the Dow Jones industrials, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq and other indexes. Always pay attention to unusually heavy selling among leadership-quality stocks.</p>
<p>The IBD 50 is a great barometer. Other stock lists can help you analyze such action under the market hood.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns "><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=ELF"></iframe></div></div>
<p>On Wednesday, <strong>ELF Beauty</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF" target="_blank">ELF</a>) dropped 4.9% to 113.63 in volume that jumped 20% above its 50-day average. This marked the biggest point decline since the fast-growing cosmetics firm broke through resistance near 57-58 in late January.</p>
<p>Is this an outright sell signal? Perhaps not. For starters, volume did rise above normal. Total turnover did not even approach the heavy-volume sessions in which the stock rose adroitly in recent months.</p>
<p>A big drop through the 50-day moving average or the 10-week line in a whale's amount of volume, however, would spark a signal of a character change. On Wednesday, <strong>Penumbra</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN" target="_blank">PEN</a>) reaffirmed some truly heavy selling going on recently.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns "><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=PEN"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Shares in the medical device firm fell 3.9% to 302.36 in more than double normal turnover. The sell-off took PEN shares more than 6% beneath the 50-day line.</p>

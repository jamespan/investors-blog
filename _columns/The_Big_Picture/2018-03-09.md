  Market Outlook Changes As Indexes Cross Key Technical Levels

After the almost daily distraction of tariffs this month, investors had to start wondering what it would take to get the market onto a happier theme.




 On Friday the market got an answer. The U.S. payroll number for February stunned with a gain of 313,000 jobs, about 52% more than expected.


And the bulls responded the way bulls should.


The Nasdaq sprinted ahead 1.8%, and the Dow Jones industrial average matched the 1.8% move. The S&P 500 was close behind with a 1.7% gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 nearly kept pace with a 1.6% gain.

Resistance Crumbles
-------------------


The Nasdaq punctured resistance at the 7500 level, while the S&P 500 punched above its 50-day moving average. The Dow also just retook its 50-day line.


The action was good enough to flip IBD's market outlook back to "confirmed uptrend." Also, the Nasdaq wiped out the March 1 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) because of cumulative price gains since that day.


Gains were broadly based. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, winners topped losers by a 9-to-1 ratio.


Breakouts Pick Up
-----------------


Breakouts stepped up the pace, including some that carry high [IBD Composite Ratings](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/). (The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 99 means the stock is in the top 1%.)

Friday's breakouts included: tech outsourcer **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), chip equipment provider **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), steel pipe provider **Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)), specialty chemicals provider **KMG Chemicals** ([KMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMG)) and contact lens developer **Cooper Cos.** ([COO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COO)).


Yet for all the positives, the list of leaders up in volume was rather short, as the Market Pulse illustrates.


Is Sloppy Action Over?
----------------------


The major indexes went through a choppy, uncertain period after pegging a high in late January.


Take a look at the Nasdaq's daily chart. Action from late June to late January was tight looking. But then it became sloppy.


Individual stocks sometimes pay a price for that. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) each underwent some difficult days, tainting their leadership credentials. Netflix has recovered, but YY doesn't look so healthy.


The change in market outlook means investors can more freely add stocks. But investors should keep their standards high in this uptrend, which hasn't been an easy one to play.

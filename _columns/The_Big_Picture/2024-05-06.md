  Stocks Rise For Third Straight Day As These Companies Add To Bullish Vibe

Indexes climbed for a third straight session Monday, as the stock market grew more comfortable with the idea that it is in an uptrend. A batch of fresh breakouts among high-rated stocks added to an increasingly bullish tone.




Indexes have done their part by topping important chart levels. The Nasdaq composite added 1.2%, and is about 1% away from a record high.


The S&P 500 climbed 1% — its third consecutive increase of roughly 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5%. Both the S&P and Dow closed back above their 50-day moving averages. The Nasdaq is now 1.8% above its 50-day average, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).


If there was anything to diminish from the day's action, it was volume. Trading fell on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, meaning that the past three index gains came in decreasing volume. In an ideal situation, volume would rise along with index gains.


Indeed, indexes had a few chances to mark a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) but came up short due to lower volume from the previous session.

Small caps made it four gains in a row, with the Russell 2000 index up 1.2% Monday.


The S&P MidCap 400 did even better, up 1.4%. Midcaps offer kind of a happy medium between the higher volatility of small caps and the steadier performance of large caps. The midcap index is up nearly 7% year to date, vs. 8.6% for the S&P 500 and 1.6% for the Russell 2000.


The IBD 50 index jumped 2.4%, its best day since March 12. Six of the 50 stocks rose more than 5%.


Breakouts Enhance Stock Market
------------------------------


It wouldn't do much good for indexes to climb unless there were plenty of quality stocks making buyable moves. On that front, the stock market is also giving bullish vibes.


On Monday, **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), **Arlo Technologies** ([ARLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARLO)), **Booz Allen Hamilton** ([BAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAH)) and **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) were some of the stocks that topped [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) from bases.


**GigaCloud Technology** ([GCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GCT)), which is discussed in today's [IBD 50 Stocks to Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ai-stock-gigagloud-technology-gct-logistics-earnings/), broke out above a trend line entry around 38. **Oscar Health** ([OSCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSCR)) climbed above an 18.55 buy point in heavy volume.



The last two weeks saw other stocks break out and extend gains, including **Howmet Aerospace** ([HWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HWM)), **Futu Holdings** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Itron** ([ITRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITRI)).


That should be enough to satisfy investors who want to raise exposure. On Friday, IBD raised its recommended exposure from a range of 20% to 40% to a range of 40% to 60%. That should be a guide for investors to consider some of the latest breakouts.


By incrementally raising exposure, investors can take advantage of opportunities, even if a follow-through has not occurred.


Market Breadth Improving
------------------------


Monday's trading saw advancing stocks outnumber decliners by about a 7-to-5 ratio on the Nasdaq and by better than 3-to-1 on the NYSE.


The NYSE advance-decline line is near a new high. The Nasdaq A-D line is lagging by comparison, but it has turned higher the past few weeks.


May also has seen a positive shift in breadth in the stock market, building on a trend from April. The gap between the 10-day moving average of stocks up in volume vs. stocks down in volume continues to widen in the bulls' favor.


This month, the NYSE 10-day average of new highs vs. new lows also moved in the bulls' favor. On the Nasdaq, new lows still top new highs, but the trend is going toward the side of new highs.

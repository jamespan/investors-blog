As one editor said nonchalantly in the IBD newsroom, Tuesday was turning out to be one of those trading sessions that one would easily forget days after. And that would probably suit most active investors in growth stocks just fine.




Do you recall the two-day sequence of market action right after the [Federal Reserve decided to go "full dove"](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-dow-jones-fed-rate-hike-quantitative-tightening/) on inflation and interest rates nearly two weeks ago? The Nasdaq's 1.4% gain on March 21 got completely wiped out the next day by a 2.5% trampling in higher volume. The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count jumped. Economic fears sharpened. Just like that, IBD's market outlook changed to "uptrend under pressure."


Let's fast-forward to Tuesday's action. The trading seemed so quiet that on Wall Street, floor traders probably could feel the presence of ghosts in the 21-room, 226-year-old hallowed exchange. But the tiny moves following Monday's bullish upswing gave this clear message from institutional investors: No way is it time to sell hard now.


Growth Stocks Help The Nasdaq Finish Strong
-------------------------------------------


After the Nasdaq composite ran over the bears, gapping up at the market open and rallying nearly 1.3%, it added another 21 points, or nearly 0.3%. At 7848, the tech-weighted index notched its highest close since Oct. 4.


This means the Nasdaq is now well above the price levels seen when the composite plunged more than 4% on Oct. 10. That day ushered a downgrade in IBD's market outlook to "market in correction." We all know what happened after that.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP040219-227x300.jpg)On Tuesday, a small decline after the first half-hour of trade slowly melted away, and the Nasdaq finished almost at session highs. That's bullish. Weak start, strong finish — Tuesday's session exemplified the typical cadence of a new bull market.


So too was the light, dry-as-a-martini action across other key equity indexes.


The S&P 500 ended the day virtually flat, preserving a year-to-date gain of more than 14%. **Walgreen Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) dragged the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.3% on a lackluster quarterly report (EPS down 5%, marking the first year-over-year decline in more than five years). The small-cap S&P 600 eased 0.5%. It gave up a fraction of the 3.6% gain seen over the prior six sessions.


How about top growth stocks? The [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) show a combined price-weighted advance of 32% for the year.


[On Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders), a few tech issues have climbed even more from their respective buy points. Currently, 15 companies — many of which hail from software, e-commerce, retail and consumer spending — hold either a half-size of full-size position on the curated list of market leaders.


Six Things To Watch In Growth Stocks
------------------------------------


After a supersonic quarter of gains in Q1 that followed the bear-market-level drop in the fourth quarter, what should every investor watch closely? As always, the daily price-and-volume action of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 deserve every reader's full attention. So do the biggest positions in your portfolio. Never forget what longtime IBD Chairman William J. O'Neil once said: Every stock is bad — that is, except the ones that go up.


No one owns a crystal ball. But the following six factors may also help investors anticipate, even a bit, how stocks could act in this still-nascent new confirmed uptrend.


**One:** Positive and negative divergences can signal that the overall market is healthy or getting frail. Tuesday offered an example. While the Dow Jones, Russell 2000 and the NYSE composite all tilted slightly lower, new highs exceeded new lows by nearly 6-to-1 on the Big Board.


That's a nicely positive divergence.


(See the entire IBD-screened list of stocks making 52-week or all-time highs and lows in the [Data Tables section](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) of Investors.com, underneath Stock Lists on the main navigation bar.)


**Two:** Track the leading sectors. Utilities ranking ninth may come as no surprise as borrowing costs remain low and Treasury yields trend lower. But the [top 12 sectors through Monday's market close](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-apr-01-2019/) include the dynamic ones: software, business services, retail, consumer, chips and computers.


Watch Abroad
------------


**Three**: Look outside the U.S. The prospects for global trade liberalization and structural reforms may have a positive impact on American equities. A lot is riding on the efforts of a new Brazilian president to spur growth. India elections are coming. Europe is trying to stamp out some serious fires that could cripple the economy, be it a hard Brexit or the ongoing clashes between French authorities and the yellow vest protest movement.



"The world economy is composed of nearly 200 economies, but only three can significantly move the needle when it comes to global growth, trade, investment and related activities: the United States, China and the EU," Joe Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy at both Merrill and BofA Private Bank, wrote in a note to clients. "The rest of the world follows along."


Quinlan notes that while the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) currently sees real economic growth of just 1% in 2019 for the eurozone, he believes "a great deal of negative news is already priced into European equities."


So far, iShares MSCI Germany ([EWG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWG)) has acted as a laggard, despite rising 8.3% since Jan. 1. The ETF is still trading on the south side of its persistently falling 200-day moving average. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), up 0.4% in heavier than usual turnover to 33.91 on Tuesday, extended its year-to-date advance to 22.9%. Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) edged 0.2% higher for a fourth straight gain and a 17.2% lift.


Inflation Still Matters
-----------------------


**Four**: Keep an eye on crude oil. It's still arguably the most important commodity and a good indicator of consumer price inflation. U.S. crude futures ran up 1.6% on Tuesday to $62.59 a barrel, extending an advance since Jan. 1 to 38%. That's not a misprint. Oil is up 38% year to date.


**Five:** Watch how the best active managers perform. As seen in the [General Market Indicators page](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IBD0104152523GMI2.pdf) on Monday, the IBD Mutual Funds Index showed an exquisite year-to-date gain of 17.1%, 270 basis points ahead of the S&P 500.


**Six:** It only seems a week or two ago that the Q4 earnings season finished. Important reports came in throughout March from Chinese ADRs and retailers. Well, the first-quarter results cycle is not far away. Next week, we should see a few Wall Street banks report their January-to-March results.

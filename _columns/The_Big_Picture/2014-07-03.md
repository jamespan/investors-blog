Stocks advanced steadily Thursday, wrapping up a holiday-shortened week.


The Nasdaq posted a 0.6% gain in the abbreviated session while the S&P 500 and Dow added 0.5% each. The IBD 50 climbed 0.5%.


Volume was lower due to the early close on the eve of the July 4 holiday. At the 1 p.m. ET close, volume was tracking higher on the NYSE, but lower on the Nasdaq. The market will reopen Monday.


Breakouts were scarce, not too surprising for the session before a holiday. However, the previous week also was light on breakouts.


Most recent breakouts are loitering in the buy zone, meaning they are within 5% of their buy points.


Such action isn't necessarily bad. Some stocks take awhile to find traction. Yet the best uptrends will feature many stocks shooting above the buy zone quickly.


If truly great action has been missing the past few weeks, there also aren't many flaming failures.


Individual investors should strive to keep losses small — you needn't wait until a stock is 8% below the buy point to sell. (An 8% loss should be the worst you take.)


If a stock notches a decent gain and threatens to cycle into a loss, selling to lock in some kind of a gain is prudent.


Still, the goal in an uptrend is to latch onto the big winners. A few stocks have hit 20% gains in the first three weeks after their breakouts. This triggers IBD's eight-week hold rule. The idea is that the best stocks often advance quickly out of the gate. You don't want to sell a big winner prematurely.


Two stocks recently triggered the hold rule :


**Synaptics** ([SYNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNA)) is up 34% from its June 11 breakout, mostly because of a 29% breakaway gap.


**Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is up 18% after being up 24% recently. (Normally when a stock hits the 20% to 25% profit level, individual investors should sell; most stocks form a new consolidation after such a gain. But like Synaptics, Restoration's 20% gain triggered the hold rule.)


Other winners are on a slower track. Liquefied natural gas carrier **GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)) rose 12% after its recent breakout, but has given back half the gain. Down volume, though, has been softer than the up volume, which is ideal.


Many stocks have languished with midsingle-digit gains for weeks after their breakouts. Cashing in some of those isn't a bad idea. The goal is to shift money into stronger performers.


Bulls found comfort in Thursday's economic data. Payrolls and the jobless rate for June were better than expected. But the participation rate, for the third month in a row, remained at 62.8% — the worst since 1978.


For the week, the Nasdaq popped 2%, the S&P 500 1.2%, the Dow 1.3% and the IBD 50 0.5%.


The traditional start to the Q2 earnings season gets underway in the coming week.

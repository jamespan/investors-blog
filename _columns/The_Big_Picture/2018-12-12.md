title: Stock Market Fades After Strong Start; Software Issues Show More Strength

Wednesday was shaping up to be a great session for the bulls, until sellers came into the stock market in afternoon trading to remind investors that the market remains unsettled.




Reports that China is considering giving foreign companies access to local markets fueled positive sentiment early. Trade-sensitive stocks in the Dow Jones outperformed, including **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). Nasdaq 100 giant **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) exploded higher for the third straight session, rising 3.3%. Shares are up 11.6% so far this week.


After soaring 2.4% intraday, the Nasdaq composite limped into the close, ending with a gain of 0.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 closed with gains of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.


Despite a weak close, breadth was decent. Nasdaq winners outnumbered losers by more than a 2-to-1 ratio. NYSE gainers beat decliners by less than 2-to-1.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MP121218-240x300.jpg)American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) also outperformed in the Dow Jones, perhaps helped by selling in the bond market. The 10-year Treasury yield ended at 2.91%, up 3 basis points. Higher interest rates help net interest margin at financial stocks like AmEx.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


A weak close for the stock market Friday was followed up by a strong close Monday. That was followed up by a weak close Tuesday and another weak close Wednesday. So it goes in a whipsaw market that's been tough for the bulls and the bears. The bulls open some long positions and things don't go as planned. Short sellers put on some bearish trades only to get shaken out.


The price action of [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) offers a good example of why it remains a challenging environment for growth investors. A breakout attempt over a 366.85 buy point looked great early Friday when shares hit a session high of 379.49, but the stock reversed lower in higher volume. It's still dawdling around the buy point.


Without an edge, it makes sense for individual investors to still favor cash and wait for renewed signs of institutional buying. But waiting for new money to start coming in from the sidelines could be a tall order as the end of the year approaches. As always, watch daily price and volume action in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which always do a good job of flagging signs of institutional buying and selling.


The S&P 500 is three days into a new rally attempt that started on Monday when the index undercut its Oct. 29 intraday low. The index marked a follow-through day on Nov. 7 when it rose 2.1% in higher volume. But the rally didn't last long. The Nasdaq also confirmed a new uptrend on that day and flashed another follow-through on Nov. 28. The Nasdaq never undercut its Nov. 20 low, so its rally is technically still intact.


IPO News
--------


In the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) today, **Tencent Music** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) priced an initial public offering Tuesday night at 13, at the low end of a proposed range of 13-15. Shares opened at 14.10 Wednesday and closed at 14.


Tencent Music is China's [largest music streaming service](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-investing-in-ipos/). It's a good name for a watch list because an IPO base could form in no time. Tencent Music also boasts big earnings and sales growth, adding to the bullish thesis.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Kirkland Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) extended its winning streak to 10 sessions. Shares closed at 24.47, up 0.5%. It's still in buy range from the 23.96 entry, although after 10 straight gains the likelihood of a pullback is increasing by the day.


The IBD 50 index outperformed Wednesday, rising nearly 1.3%, helped by gains of 4% or more for **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)).


A daily breakout screen in [MarketSmith](https://www.marketsmith.com) was empty, but the MarketSmith Growth 250 yielded plenty of nice gainers.


Software Stocks Lead Again
--------------------------


In the enterprise software space, **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) hit a new high despite a failed breakout last month. Shares rose 4% to 96.67 Wednesday. **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) also outperformed in the group, up 1.6% to 165.52. The stock was in buy range Tuesday from a conventional entry of 157.22, but it's extended now. An alternative entry existed at 146.98.


Database software firms were also higher, including **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)).

Security software stocks like **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE)) and **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) also outperformed.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) added 1.7% to 32.14 ahead of its earnings report Thursday before the open. It's been getting support at the 50-day moving average after dipping below the 32.43 entry.

The stock market went from dull to weak after broad losses Friday further clouded the market's direction.




Major indexes hit some pressure points, while leading sectors are breaking upward price trends. Market leadership continued to thin out.


The S&P 500 fell 1.3% and closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The index bounced off the 50-day line in January, February, March and May, so support at this level poses a major test for the stock market.


The Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%, wiping out gains from earlier in the week. The composite is holding above its 50-day line and 14,000 â€” two important levels to watch.

Stock Market Outlook Lowered
----------------------------


Volume soared on the Nasdaq and NYSE Friday, a [quadruple witching session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/options-expiration-witching-days-do-they-place-the-market-under-a-spell-or-not/) of option and futures expiration. Losers led winners by nearly 3-1 on the NYSE and by more than 2-1 on the Nasdaq.


The day's losses in higher volume not only added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) but also forced a downgrade in IBD's market outlook, to uptrend under pressure. This calls for investors to avoid most stock purchases and be quick to heed sell signals. Taking some profits to reduce exposure is smart, too.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell further below its 50-day line with a 1.6% drop. The Dow suffered its worst week since late October.


Small caps took a toll, as the Russell 2000 sold off 2.2% Friday and closed below its 50-day line for the first time since May 25. Financials and industrials led the small-cap rout.


Bullard Comment Hits Stock Market
---------------------------------


Financial stocks of all sizes sold off for a second straight day after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC he sees the Fed starting to raise interest rates in late 2022. Inflation is hotter than he and other Fed officials had expected. Bullard's comments followed Wednesday's Fed meeting, where policymakers signaled they expect to raise interest rates by late 2023, sooner than they had previously anticipated.


Rising interest rates normally are favorable for financials. But the Fed's hawkish shift hurt sectors that benefit from an economic rebound such as financials, energy and cyclicals.


Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) ETF broke below the 10-week moving average the past week, off 6.2%. The S&P industrial and materials sector ETFs also broke below their 10-week line. SPDR S&P Transportation ([XTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XTN)) spent a third week below its 10-week line, down nearly 5%. The S&P Energy Select Sector ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) slid 5.4%.


Technology, consumer discretionary and health care are holding up better. But their small moves aren't enough to offset the weakness in other sectors. In other words, market leadership is elusive.


The IBD 50 fell 0.8%. But **Cricut** ([CRCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRCT)) jumped 7%, **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) gained 5% and **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) broke out of a cup at 574.93 with a 4% lift.

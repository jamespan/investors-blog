A fast start in the stock market proved to be a head fake Thursday, as the bullish move stalled.




The Nasdaq rose 0.8% in the first 15 minutes of trade and then reversed to a 0.4% loss at the close. Blue chips outperformed with the Dow Jones' 0.3% gain, while the large cap S&P 500 sagged to a flat finish. Small caps skidded 1.6% on the S&P 600.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq. NYSE volume also was lower, according to preliminary calculations.


Five of the past seven sessions have ended with low closes on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. The action suggests funds are selling into any sign of strength.


Blue Chips Rule
---------------


A glance at the charts confirms that the best action has been in the Dow Jones industrial average.

Blue chips delivered some winners Thursday as **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) gained 2.6% to a new high; **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), 1.6%; and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), 1.3%. The three pay dividends with annualized yields of 3.1%, 2.5% and 4.3%, respectively.


Reasons To Worry
----------------


Just about every market gauge shows reasons for bears to be confident.


— New lows have outnumbered new highs every day but one this month. The beatings have been severe. On Monday, for example, new lows reached 854 on IBD's meter while new highs were a pathetic 22.


— Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears gauge shows too many bullish advisors to suggest the worst is over. Generally, the bears are numerous and the bulls few when a bullish move begins.


— Sector leadership has shifted from software — before the market pullback began — to a fight among utility, media and food sectors for current leadership.


— Going into Thursday's session, only 23% of NYSE stocks were above their 200-day moving average.


— Groups with the highest percentage of new highs included soap, 25%; electric utilities, 24%; and diversified utilities, 22%.


The stock market itself is the chief indicator and a glance at the charts confirms why the current IBD outlook is "uptrend under pressure."


Dagger Makes For Slow Recovery
------------------------------


What can the individual investor do?


The traditional cure for low prices and ugly action is lower prices and uglier action.


Eventually bargain hunters will step in to buy selectively, but the true test is where the algorithm crowd has set its buy signals.


Automatic traders could be approaching the point where the switch goes on. But bulls can't depend on that: A deeper bearish move can't be ruled out.


The dagger moves in the major indexes in early October have made for a much harder recovery. A steady, measured decline would've made for easier circumstances.


In economic news, first time jobless claims hit a 12-week low at 206,000 vs. views for 228,000 and vs. the prior week's revised 233,000. The drop of 27,000 was the largest drop in about two and a half years. The five-year average is 260,000.


Trump Wins A Trade War Battle
-----------------------------


President Trump apparently won some cooperation from China. The U.S. Soybean Export Council said [China has resumed buying U.S. soybeans](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-12/china-purchases-1-5m-2m-tons-of-u-s-soybeans-export-council), according to Bloomberg News.


Meanwhile, a Wall Street Journal survey found that 47.3% of economists regard the trade war with China as the No. 1 threat to the economy in 2019. About 20% consider financial disruptions the top threat and 12.7% regard a slowdown in business investment the No. 1 risk.

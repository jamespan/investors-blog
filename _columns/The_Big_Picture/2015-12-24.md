Stocks did as little work as possible Thursday, as the market slacked off in advance of the Christmas break. The Nasdaq pegged a gain of less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 eased less than 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.3%.


The IBD 50 inched up 0.1%.


Volume fell across the board in the shortened session. The market closed at 1 p.m. ET Thursday and will reopen Monday.


If the market follows its usual playbook, volume will remain below average in the coming week. (The bear market of 2000 was the last time a lower-volume trend for the last few days of the year didn't hold true.)


The uptrend remains under pressure, which should give disciplined investors pause. Even if an individual investor finds a great stock, he or she would be better off with an accompanying market tailwind, which is missing in [the current market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today).

First, support at the 10-week moving average has been shaping up for some leading stocks.


They include **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Sterling Bancorp** ([STL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STL)), **Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)), **A.O. Smith** ([AOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOS)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)).


Secondly, other leaders are in bases, including **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)). The stocks might need more time for construction, but so far the market is granting it.


A premature breakout — before a base is complete, before a stock has tidied up its ratings, before the market is generating a tailwind — is a breakout more likely to sag and roll over.


So, this is a good time to wait. Let the market shake out the weak holders and shake off the market pressure.


One area to watch is regional banks. They were leaders in the run-up to the Federal Reserve's December rate hike and then sold off. This appeared to be a textbook move of "buy on the rumor, sell on the news." Was that the end of the bank play?


Perhaps, but it's hard to be sure. It's also possible that the bank stocks will rest awhile and then find a second wind.


Right now, there's work to be done among the three banks that had been making IBD screens.


**Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) is 6% off a recent high and has sketched a base-on-base pattern with a 39.21 buy point. Up-down volume is a bullish 1.4, but the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a so-so C+. The stock is just under its 10-week line.


**Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) is 8% off a high and is working on a base-on-base. The buy point is 55.06. Up-down volume is a neutral 1.0. Acc/Dist is a worst-possible E. The stock is under its 10-week line.


**Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)) is conducting its first test of the 10-week line since its November breakout. However, there's a problem: The potential 10-week entry is below the previous buy point. Up-down volume is a bearish 0.7, and Acc/Dist is D-.


Each stock has some work to do.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims were about 1% below the Street's consensus number.


For the week, the Nasdaq and the Dow, rose 2.5%; and the S&P 500, 2.4%. The small cap S&P 600 led with a 3.1% gain.


According to preliminary calculations, the IBD 50 gained about 1%.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, five lowly rated groups rose 10% or more for the week, according to preliminary reports. The five were coal, up 16%; specialty steel, up 15%; oil pipelines, up 13%; ore miners, up 12%; and oil royalty trusts, up 10%.

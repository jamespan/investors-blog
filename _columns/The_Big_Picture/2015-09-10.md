========================================================

Stocks advanced after a tentative start Thursday, but the indexes gave back a chunk of gains in the final two hours. The Nasdaq locked in an 0.8% pop after being up 1.5%, while the S&P 500 added 0.5%. The IBD 50 tacked on 0.6%. Volume fell modestly on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE.

  

With the Federal Reserve set to meet Wednesday and Thursday, a drawdown in volume isn't surprising. Institutional investors might be waiting for clarity.

  

Market watchers see an outside chance that the Fed will raise rates this month. CME Group FedWatch pegged the odds for a September rate increase at 23.57%, up from 21.4% earlier in the day.

  

If the Fed does issue a surprise increase next week, would it send stocks spinning further south, or would stocks rally on the removal of uncertainty?

  

Most individual investors who have a chunk of cash on the sidelines probably aren't interested in guessing at either the Fed's action or the market's reaction.

  

So, just as institutional volume has drifted and remained lower this month, individual investors are wise to copy it by limiting exposure to stocks.

  

This is a hard market to negotiate successfully. On Thursday, top-rated stocks showed only isolated instances of strength.

  

**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) leapt 7% in three times its average volume. The big-cap software security stock regained its 50-day moving average.

  

The company reported quarterly results late Wednesday. Earnings and revenue topped the Street's estimates. CEO Mark McLaughlin said at Wednesday's earnings call that Palo Alto is gaining market share. In the fiscal year that ended in July, Palo Alto grew its customer base by more than 35%.

  

Palo Alto's industry group, though, has suffered since the Nasdaq's July 20 closing high. Security software went from No. 2 on July 20 among 197 industry groups to No. 48 in Thursday's Stock Checkup at Investors.com.

  

Top industry groups Thursday were mostly showing strength due to gains from a lone wolf in the group. This was true for education software, wholesale food and truckers.

  

International news has offered only grief recently.

  

Standard & Poor's downgraded Brazil debt to junk late Wednesday. South Africa and Turkey also are in danger of having their debt downgraded to junk. China's producer inflation fell for the 42nd month in a row, threatening deflation. And Japan recently announced that its capital spending contracted 0.9% in Q2.

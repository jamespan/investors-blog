Stock Market Win Streak Continues; S&P 500 Hits 3,200 For First Time Ever
==========================================================================

The stock market hit more record highs Thursday amid the [impeachment of President Donald Trump](https://www.investors.com/politics/trump-impeached-abuse-power-obstruction-charges/). Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was "confident" that the phase-one U.S.-China trade deal will be signed at the beginning of January.




The Nasdaq composite moved up 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained nearly 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.5%, or 137 points. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit new highs, while the Dow Jones came up just short.


Volume was modestly lower across both exchanges relative to Wednesday's turnover.


Stock Market Rally Continues To Set All-Time Highs
--------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP121919-216x300.jpg)The impeachment of President Trump didn't slow the stock market down Thursday. The House of Representatives impeached the president late Wednesday. Next, they will present the charges to the Senate where they must receive more than two-thirds of the vote to remove the president. With Republicans in charge of the Senate (53-47), it is very unlikely that will transpire.


Since Dec. 4, major stock indexes mostly rose in 10 out of 12 sessions; the Nasdaq has risen for seven straight days. All three major stock indexes hit fresh record highs, as the uptrend trudges higher. Meanwhile, stock market leaders like **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) continue to set the pace.


With more stock market highs, investors may be becoming too complacent. The [put-call volume ratio on Thursday](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) fell to 0.54. That indicates the [market is overconfident](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-extends-december-rally-bad-signal-appears/). IBD identifies the 0.6 level as a danger zone, where a market top is possible.

IBD 50: Chinese Leaders Underperform
------------------------------------


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), one of numerous IBD screens of top growth stocks, inched nearly 0.2% higher, again diverging from the major indexes' gains. Weighing on the index's performance was significant weakness in Chinese stocks **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)). Momo declined more than 4% to fall through its 50-day line. New Oriental fell 3.6% to give back the past two sessions of gains. Shares are still above their 50-day line.


On the upside, **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) jumped 5%, as it continues to rebound from a recent test of its 50-day moving average line.


Meanwhile, **NMI** ([NMIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMIH)) jumped above a [34.60 alternate buy point](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/nmih-stock-near-buy-point-new-product-strong-housing-market/), moving up as much as 3.9% to 35.79 before closing at 34.76. Meanwhile, **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)) regained its 43.35 [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) during [today's stock market rally](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) tops out at 45.52.

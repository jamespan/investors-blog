Stocks ended January the way they began the year — under pressure — with an ugly loss Friday adding more of it.

  

The S&P 500 scurried 1.3% lower, while the Nasdaq lost 1%. The IBD 50 fell 0.9%.

  

Bulls found no place to hide: The small-cap S&P 600 dived 2%, while the Dow Jones utility average and Dow transports sank 2.3% each.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

The action was enough to add a distribution day to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

  

The Nasdaq and especially the S&P 500 are positioned to test recent lows, which could make the coming week interesting.

  

Also, crude oil prices jumped 7% Friday on news that the U.S. rig count dropped sharply. Stocks initially rallied on the news and then reversed lower. Traders said some short covering may have driven the oil-price gains. Some market watchers, though, say oil could peg a bottom earlier than expected.

  

This too could make for an interesting week.

  

On Friday, the fourth-quarter GDP report, released before the open, fell short. Growth came in at 2.6%, below views for 3.2% and about half the previous quarter's increase.

  

GDP in Q3 grew 5%, according to the government, but the market never bit on that news. The 5% figure was released Dec. 23 to market yawns — the S&P 500 rose 0.17% and the Nasdaq fell 0.3% that day.

  

Since then, the indexes have moved with sawtooth action in a narrow band.

  

On Friday, top-rated stocks were a mixture of tentativeness, confidence and panic.

  

**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) surged 6% in the first 15 minutes of trade, and then turned hesitant, erasing half the gain.

  

**Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) gapped up 10% and 14%, respectively, and stayed strong throughout the session. **NetSuite** ([N](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=N)) popped 1% at the open and then dropped to an 8% loss.

  

All four stocks reacted to quarterly reports, but the market's reaction showed no clear pattern.

  

In this uncertain climate, individual investors should be aware that the same results that are rewarded in one stock may be punished in another.

  

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.8%, the Nasdaq 2.6% and the IBD 50 1.3%. Earnings season will continue in the coming week with the medical and retail sectors offering the most reports.

Nasdaq And S&P 500 Trim 0.1%; Small Caps Lose More
===================================================

Stocks stuttered Thursday, posting small losses.


The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each trimmed 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 lost 0.4%.


The IBD 50 rose 0.5%.


Volume fell across the board.


Small caps have lagged in this uptrend. The S&P 600 is up 12% from its mid-October low vs. a 16% gain in the Nasdaq. Also, the main indexes have made new highs since early November, while the small caps have not.


Ideally, bulls would like to see the more aggressive issues lead.


However, the technical picture improved Thursday.


The Nasdaq shed its Oct. 29 distribution day because it's now too old. After about five weeks, a distribution day isn't relevant to current conditions any longer. This move evened the count at two each for the major indexes.


Two is a modest tally for distribution, especially considering that the uptrend is more than 30 sessions past the follow-through day. While logic might suggest that some sort of pullback is in order, logic has never killed a bull market.


The usual killers of bull markets are recession, war, hysterical bullishness among amateurs (the last buyers) or economic shock such as OPEC's early-'70s oil embargo.


None of those factors appears likely. The only recent shock has been positive â€” the plunge in the price of oil, which should boost more sectors than it will hurt.


Yet recently, the indexes have done more throat-clearing than anything clearly bullish. The last time the Nasdaq or S&P 500 gained 1% or more in rising volume was Oct. 31.


One positive in this uptrend is that leadership is fairly broad.


For example, in the IBD 50, the medical sector leads with eight stocks. Close behind are chips and finance with seven each; Internet, five; and retail and software, four each.


(In mid-October, the medical sector accounted for about a third of the stocks in the IBD 50.)


Breakouts have also come from diverse sectors.


The best gainers from valid buy points include **Sierra Wireless** ([SWIR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWIR)), up 30%; **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), up 25%; **Cimpress** ([CMPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMPR)), up 25%; **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)), up 22%; **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)), up 20%; **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), up 19%; **Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)), up 18%; and **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)), up 16%. There's a slew of breakouts up more modestly, including **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), up 11%.


The Nasdaq has risen about 8% since the close on Oct. 21, the day of the follow-through.


On Friday, the employment report will be out before the open.

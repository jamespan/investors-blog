Indexes rallied to record highs Wednesday in a stock market session marked with superlatives that greeted unambiguous election victories for former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party.


For starters, the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to all-time highs as the Dow and S&P made their best one-day gains since November 2022. For the Nasdaq, it was the best day since Feb. 22 of this year. The Dow surged 3.6% and the S&P 2.5%.




Stock Market Records Broken
---------------------------


The stock market made history, too: The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 had their best day after Election Day ever recorded. The Nasdaq's 3% gain was the largest since the November 2020 election, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Volume was the highest since the Nov. 20 triple witching session. Trading swelled 68% on the NYSE and rose 15% on the Nasdaq, making Wednesday's index gains analogous to a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). It effectively ended a soft patch that clouded the stock market heading into Election Day.


Breadth was positive but not as much as the index gains would have you think. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by an 8-to-5 ratio and by about 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.


Still, gains were broad. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) jumped 2.4%. First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) vaulted 2.4%. Both ETFs broke out above [trendlines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/?refcode=BBB-04262022-2-B-9:04:2022:2Q:NewsLetter:Email:BBB-04262022:na:na:na:na:26:10:2:B:9&j=1566189&sfmc_sub=172274927&l=222_HTML&u=20328680&mid=100016628&jb=1) drawn from their October highs.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP110624-179x300.jpg)The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) and iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) both rose more than 2.5%. The Russell surged 5.8%.


Market Outlook Improves
-----------------------


Wednesday's sharp gains wiped away the Nasdaq's Oct. 7 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), leaving only the high-volume declines of Oct. 15 and 17 as markers of institutional selling. The S&P 500 still carries four distribution days.


With the market outlook turning more bullish, IBD raised its recommended market exposure from 60%-80% to 80%-100%. Investors could look at the various sectors that rallied Wednesday to add to their portfolios.


Financials, industrials and energy — sectors that may see less in terms of government mandates — led the stock market with gains of 3.8% to 6.1%.


Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) climbed more than 3%. But the defensive consumer staples, real estate and utilities fell Wednesday. Utilities also compared unfavorably to rising Treasury yields.


Stock Market Winners & Losers
-----------------------------


Although control of the House of Representatives remained unclear late Wednesday, Trump's decisive victory and GOP control of the Senate means a win for many businesses and [multiple potential changes in policy](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-surges-trump-win-signals-bull-run/).


"Trump is viewed as supporting lower corporate tax rates, deregulation, and industrial policies that favor domestic growth, all of which could provide more stimulus to the U.S. economy and benefit risk assets," Janus Henderson strategists Marc Pinto and Lucas Klein said in a report. "These policies could also lead to a stronger dollar, which would be a boon for U.S. small-cap firms with a domestic focus."


In the 2016 election, the S&P 500 gained nearly 5% from the day before the presidential election through the end of the year in the first Trump rally, Pinto and Klein wrote. "We expect a similar trend could play out this time around, too."


Perhaps more importantly for investors, the nation avoided a contested election, removing one of the biggest clouds hanging over Wall Street. Gold assets, which acted as a hedge against political turmoil, fell broadly. Gold for November delivery fell 2.7% to $2,667.60 per ounce. The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), often called the stock market's fear gauge, slid 20.6% in its biggest drop since Aug. 6.


Of course, the so-called Trump Trade came out a big winner. **Trump Media & Technology** ([DJT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DJT)) [social media company's stock](https://www.investors.com/news/donald-trump-stock-djt-presidential-election/) closed nearly 6% higher after trimming earlier gains.


With Trump favoring cryptocurrencies, [bitcoin prices climbed to a record high](https://www.investors.com/news/bitcoin-price-outlook-2024-us-election-trump-kamala-harris-nov-6/) late Wednesday.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) gapped up nearly 15% in double its usual volume. It regained a 264.86 buy point and topped an alternative entry at 273.54. While Trump and Congress may scale back electric-vehicle goals, CEO Elon Musk may have a role in the next administration. Some shareholders, though, worry it may become a distraction for Musk.


Treasury Yields Spike
---------------------


The 10 year Treasury yield rose nearly 14 basis points to 4.425%, the highest since July 2. Yet, the increase in borrowing costs didn't hurt the stock market.


The long-dated 30-year bond shed 15 basis points to 4.6% as bond traders worry of rising U.S. budget deficits.


A changing of the guard in Washington also made losers of other sectors and asset classes.


IBD's solar energy industry group was Wednesday's worst performing, down 11.5%.


The German DAX fell 1.1% and STOXX Europe 600 Index lost 0.5%. Europe faces the prospect of backing Ukraine's war against Russia with less aid from the U.S. The threat of more import tariffs also appeared to hurt overseas stock markets.

Stock Market Bulls Defy Coronavirus Fear; Can Small Caps Pass This Test?
=========================================================================

The coronavirus may not be short-lived. But Wall Street seemed to make this statement Tuesday: The latest pullback in stocks just may be.




Encouraged by plenty of mainly positive news on different fronts — including solid quarterly earnings from a variety of leading companies — institutions voted with their trades that the bull market still has legs. The Nasdaq composite led the way, rising 2.1% and bolting to a new high. The S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 spanked the bears with 1.5% gains. The small cap S&P 600 rose 1.2%.


With the Nasdaq cruising to an all-time high, the S&P 500 successfully navigating its test of the 50-day moving average, and growth stocks showing good action overall, IBD's market outlook returns to a market in confirmed uptrend. Yet small caps face a key technical test.

At this point, a rebound by the S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 over their respective 50-day moving averages would justify a continued bullish view.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP020420-182x300.jpg)Long-dated Treasuries sold off. The yield on the key U.S. government 10-year bond vaulted 7 basis points to 1.61%, a five-session high. That's still well below the 1.88% level seen on Jan. 2.


Coronavirus Risk
----------------


The death count among those infected with coronavirus continues to climb. So far, the death rate of around 2% has not reached the 10% figure that SARS caused in 2002-2003.


Meanwhile, new economic data point to a rebound in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Factory orders in December jumped 1.8%, trumping the Econoday forecast of 1.3%. The economic report also said November orders were revised downward to a 1.2% drop.


Crude oil futures edged up 0.4% to $49.80 a barrel. But West Texas Intermediate prices remain down 18.4% for the year. Copper has fallen nearly 9% over the same time frame.


Growth Stocks Lead
------------------


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF sailed 2.3% higher and carved a new multiyear closing high of 36.76. The exchange traded fund, up 25.7% in 2019, has now gained 5.8% since Jan. 1.


In sessions like these, you want to see volume increase vs. the prior session. Tuesday did not disappoint. Volume edged up just 1% on the Nasdaq. Nonetheless, higher volume on a day in which the Nasdaq marked new highs is undeniably positive. NYSE turnover grew nearly 5% to 3.78 billion shares.


Go to a [daily chart of the Nasdaq](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), and you'll see that the Nasdaq has now scored 13 up days in above-average turnover in 2020 already. Such price-and-volume action points to institutional accumulation, and outnumbers the down days in high volume.


Just two sessions ago, IBD made its first downgrade of the current outlook for stocks in nearly five months. As the globe confronted the issue of the deadly new disease that started in the commercial hub of Wuhan, China, fund managers clearly used the news as an excuse to take some profits off the table.


From Jan. 24 to Jan. 31, the Nasdaq suffered a mini-cluster of intense sell-offs, called [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). And while one of those three distribution days was a rare [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) (on Jan. 29), the other two showed some bite: a 0.9% drop on Jan. 24 and a 1.6% retreat on Jan. 31. Yet, the Nasdaq kept the size of its pullback quite modest.


Will Large Caps Keep Leading The Stock Market?
----------------------------------------------


As noted in [Monday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bounces-as-50-day-moving-average-trend-lines-provide-clues/), the sudden dive by the Nasdaq's advance-decline line gave genuine cause for concern. A rising market and narrowing breadth would mark a negative divergence. On Monday after the close, the Nasdaq's Accumulation/Distribution Rating had shown a bit of tarnish, falling to a still-positive B on a scale of A (heavy net institutional buying) to E (thick selling).


On Tuesday, gainers on the Nasdaq thumped losers by more than a 2-to-1 margin.


If fear over the impact coronavirus may have on the global economy subsides, some investment pros believe smaller companies could become more attractive.


"Small cap earnings actually declined in 2019 as a slowing economy weighed on revenue growth. However, we believe small cap earnings are poised to reaccelerate in 2020," Buffalo Small Cap Fund portfolio managers Jamie Cuellar, Bob Male and Alex Hancock wrote in the January edition of their "Advisor Education" series. "Per Bloomberg, consensus estimates call for the small-cap Russell 2000 index to grow earnings in excess of 30% in 2020, materially faster than the large-cap S&P 500's 10% forecasted earnings growth rate."


[On Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), at least 14 companies, ranging from small caps to megacaps, posted larger gains than the S&P 500.


Be mindful of a stock's volatility level. Know that companies with robust revenue gains but holes in the bottom line tend to trade more wildly.


**Luckin Coffee** ([LK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LK)) offers a fresh example. Even before the company got attacked by a short selling research firm last week, the coffee house chain and quick delivery service had shown quite a deep decline after making its peak of 51.38. While the stock has reclaimed its 50-day moving average, it still lies 29% below that high.



In other words, the midcap growth stock has fallen sharply enough to justify waiting for a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) to form before deploying any hard-earned capital.


Wall Street expects the consumer spending play to cut its net loss to 30 cents a share in 2020 vs. an expected loss of $1.41 a share in 2019. The Street also expects top-line increases of 501% (to $740 million) in 2019, and 181% (to $2.08 billion) this year.

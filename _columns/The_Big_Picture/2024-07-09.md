Financial stocks outperformed in the stock market Tuesday, and the Nasdaq composite stretched its winning streak to six sessions, even as software stocks struggled again. Wall Street also digested comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to the Senate Banking Committee.




The Nasdaq and S&P 500 edged higher by 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1%. Volume was slightly higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq, with losers beating winners on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.


The S&P 500 closed near session lows and marked a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/). A narrow price range for the index Tuesday diminished the significance of the stalling action. Yet, it met the requirements of this type of [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/).


The Nasdaq had the look of a stalling day, but it didn't qualify due to lower volume.


The Russell 2000 gave back 0.5%. The small-cap index continues to lag after reversing below its 50-day moving average two times in the last four sessions.


Stock Market Today: Powell Speaks
---------------------------------


In the first of two days of testimony on Capitol Hill, Powell reiterated that the economy remains strong and [progress has been made on inflation](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-congress-testimony-rate-cuts-sp-500/). He also acknowledged some recent softness in the labor market and said holding rates high for too long could stunt economic growth.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP070924_3-217x300.jpg)At the June meeting, Federal Open Market Committee members signaled one rate cut before the end of the year. Markets are still leaning toward two rate cuts, with the first one coming at the September meeting.


The next piece of inflation data comes Thursday with the release of the Consumer Price index. The Producer Price index, which measures wholesale prices, is due Friday.


**JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) outperformed in the Dow Jones index. JPMorgan rallied 1.2% and reclaimed a 205.88 buy point with [earnings due Friday before the open](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-jpmorgan-shoots-higher-q2-earnings-report/). Goldman Sachs gained 1.7% and moved back above a 471.48 entry after a breakout attempt stalled Monday. Goldman reports next week, along with **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), which rallied 2% and closed at the top right side of a cup base with a 103.25 buy point.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) lagged again in the Dow Jones after another day of selling in the enterprise software group. Salesforce shares are down 4.1% so far this week compared with a 3.5% decline for the enterprise software group. Group peer **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) extended losses, one day after Guggenheim chimed in with a sell rating.


With the confirmed market uptrend still intact, it makes sense looking for stocks to buy. But it's not exactly easy making new buys with confidence with the Nasdaq about 8% above its 50-day moving average and hitting new highs in light volume. Upside volume has dried up as well in **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) after the stock dropped sharply June 20-24. Before that, Nvidia was hitting new highs in light volume.


Nvidia rallied another 2.5% Tuesday, helped by a price-target hike from KeyBanc to 180 from 130.

That said, the stock market continues to serve up actionable stocks. India-based online travel firm **MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)) surged out of a shallow cup base, rising 4.7% in strong volume.


Brazilian aircraft maker **Embraer** ([ERJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERJ)) rejoined the [Leaderboard model portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com) after the stock jumped above its 50-day moving average and broke out of a downward trendline. Embraer is still in a six-week consolidation as it closes in on its June high of 29.95. A convincing move above this level could give Leaderboard an opportunity to increase the position.


Meanwhile, in the computer sector, **Agilysys** ([AGYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGYS)) is still in the early stages of trying to clear a cup-with-handle base with a 104.84 buy point.



Chip equipment firm **Onto Innovation** ([ONTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONTO)) cleared a flat base early in the session with a 238.13 buy point. But a 2.5% gain faded to less than 1% by the close, and Onto closed below the buy point. The base isÂ [late stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/), too.


Watching For New Leadership
---------------------------


Leading restaurant stocks fell sharply again, with Leaderboard stock **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)), **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) closing with losses of 3% to 5%. Leaderboard trimmed Cava down to quarter position from half after a sharp break of the 21-day line. Cava first joined the Leaders list on April 26 at 64.31.


With software and restaurant stocks under pressure, it's important to keep an eye out for new leaders. Semiconductor stocks continue to act well, but many are well extended past proper buy points.


Leading chipmaker **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) is set to report June sales data early Wednesday. TSMC reports earnings next week, along with chip-equipment firm **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)).


Continue to look for new names in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com) and [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Both screens do a pretty good job of uncovering new leaders.

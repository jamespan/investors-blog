Stocks got pummeled for a fourth loss in five sessions Wednesday, but a mid-afternoon rally took some sting out of the blow.

  

Volume grew sharply on both major exchanges.

  

A few sector indexes, meanwhile, rebounded off their lows just enough to end slightly higher. The Dow transports edged up 0.2%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 index rose 1%.

  

The IBD 50 gained 0.9%.

  

A highly disappointing U.S. retail sales report, with core sales down 0.1% in September vs. a consensus forecast for a 0.5% jump, unleashed a floodgate of early sellers. News of a second case of Ebola contracted in the U.S. also spooked the market.

  

The Nasdaq composite fell as much as 2.6% to 4116, a level last seen in May. That would have eclipsed Friday's 2.3% mauling. But on Wednesday, the Nasdaq shaved that loss to less than 0.3%. The Nasdaq 100 fell 0.6%.

  

The S&P 500 also swung sharply off its intraday low, but still got knocked 0.8% lower. At the day's low of 1820.66, the large-cap benchmark fell 9.8% from its all-time high, just shy of the textbook definition of an intermediate-level correction of 10% or more. Small-cap indexes have already fallen 12% or more.

  

On the Nasdaq, advancers actually exceeded losers by a slim 14-to-12 margin. But that doesn't erase the fact that large swaths of the market's leadership are still under heavy selling pressure.

  

Leading names in the medical sector, from large-cap drug firm **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) to mid-cap staffing expert **Team Health** ([TMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMH)), have dropped below their 50-day moving averages. Ditto for the airlines, consumer goods, Internet and software sectors.

  

Such action typically ushers the start of work on fresh bases, which must be a minimum seven weeks for cup with handles and can be much longer.

  

Plus, the Nasdaq may as well brace for a weak open on Thursday. After Wednesday's close, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) tanked more than 20% on disappointing net subscriber additions. ([See story](http://news.investors.com/technology/101514-721992-nflx-falls-on-weak-subscriber-growth-q4-eps-forecast.htm))

  

The current correction likely reflects concerns about future growth, both in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, now that QE3, the Federal Reserve's so-called quantitative easing strategy of buying massive amounts of bonds to keep the cost of money low, is set to end when the central bank meets on Oct. 28 -29 to discuss interest rates.

  

With the yield on the 10-year U.S. treasury bond at 2.14%, the price of "safety" isn't cheap. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 is at 2.05%; the earnings yield, when using 12-month-forward profit estimates, is close to 7%.

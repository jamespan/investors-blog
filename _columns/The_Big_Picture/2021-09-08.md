Small Caps, Growth Stocks Lead Stock Market Decline; Nasdaq Tests Short-Term Support Level
===========================================================================================

Top-rated growth stocks lagged in the stock market Wednesday, but a 0.6% decline for the Nasdaq composite was relatively tame and simply amounted to a test of the 10-day moving average for the tech-laden index. And several institutional-quality growth stocks withstood the selling quite well.




Small caps took the hardest hit, with the Russell 2000 down 1.1%. Selling was less intense in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. The Dow Jones industrials eased 0.2%, while the S&P 500 gave back 0.1%. Volume on the Nasdaq rose, giving the index a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). NYSE volume was close to Tuesday's level, but the S&P 500's decline was too small to qualify for distribution.


Nasdaq breadth was negative early in the session by 3 to 1 but improved by the close, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers by just over a 2-to-1 ratio. Losers beat winners on the NYSE also by just over 2-t0-1.


Stock Market Sentiment
----------------------


In economic news, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, an early monthly read on consumer confidence, [fell into pessimistic territory](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/u-s-economic-optimism-collapses-amid-covid-surge-fiscal-fade-ibd-tipp/) for the first time since December. The index slid 5.1 points to a 12-month low of 48.5. Readings above the neutral 50 level reflect optimism.

The six-month economic outlook index fell even more, slumping 8.9 points to 41.3. That's the lowest level since September 2020.


Meanwhile, the latest market sentiment reading from Investors Intelligence showed a modest rise in bullish sentiment among stock market newsletter writers. Bullish sentiment increased slightly to 52.6% from 52.1%. Before the 52.1% reading, the bulls were at 50% â€” the fewest since May 2020, when the stock market was in the early stages of a confirmed uptrend.


The survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.


The market's defensive nature was on full display with four of the day's top-10 performing groups hailing from the utility sector. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) jumped 1.8%. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) added 0.9%.


Money flowed into bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 4 basis points to 1.33%.


What To Do Now
--------------


Wednesday's session was a perfect opportunity to assess current holdings. If gains are fading in some of your big winners, trimming positions probably makes sense, especially with stocks that have breached support at their [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


If you've nibbled at some breakouts that aren't making much headway, keep these stocks on a tight leash. And if a modest gain turns negative, don't be afraid to cut losses well before the [7% to 8% benchmark](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


But with the stock market still in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), it's equally important to respect strength in your portfolio. Don't be too quick to lock in gains with stocks that aren't doing anything wrong. If you've got a big gain in **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)), for example, there's no reason to sell after the stock bounced nicely off its 10-day line Wednesday.


Institutional-quality names on Leaderboard like **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)), **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) and **Avantor** ([AVTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVTR)) ended with losses of less than 1%.



Sellers finally hit the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) after a period of strong outperformance. But a 1.6% decline didn't look too bad after a bullish move over the past two weeks. The fund jumped 6% two weeks ago and 5.4% last week.


New Issues Pressured
--------------------


IBD 50 component **SentinelOne** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) pared a 7.7% morning loss to 3.9% ahead of its earnings report after the close. Shares were down 1% in late trading despite a sales beat and bullish sales guidance.


SentinelOne was among of group of top performing new issues under selling pressure Wednesday.

CLOSE




**Maravai LifeSciences** ([MRVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVI)), which went public in November, slumped 10% on news of a stock offering late Tuesday. The biotech looks like it's ready to form a new base after a bullish breakout from a cup base in early August. Another scenario is that Maravai pulls back to its 10-week moving average. A bounce with conviction off the key support level would put the stock in a follow-on buy zone.


**Academy Sports & Outdoors** ([ASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASO)), **Doximity** ([DOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS)) and **Global-e Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) also suffered sharp losses. Academy Sports is testing a prior buy area with earnings due Thursday before the open. Doximity is still holding above its 10-day moving average, while Global-e looks poised for another test of its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/).


Outside of the IBD 50, **Staar Surgical** ([STAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STAA)) slumped nearly 5% after topping a 157.94 buy point Tuesday. Staar is the latest example of how challenging it is for breakouts to make headway when volume is light. Breakouts have the best chance of succeeding when there are unequivocal signs of institutional buying. That's been a missing ingredient lately.



Despite the selling, a few stocks bucked the trend and remain in decent technical setups. **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) added 0.9% to 687.70. The health care name has been trading tightly near its 10-week moving average as it forms a flat base with a 707.05 buy point. It's a third-stage base, which is considered later stage, but the stock could still have more room to run.

Among oil and gas producers, **Cimarex Energy** ([XEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XEC)) continues to perform well after retaking its 50-day moving average last week. It's near the top of a cup base with a 76.49 buy point.


In the building sector, **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 229.99 buy point. A low-volume pullback and tight trading in the handle are two big positives.

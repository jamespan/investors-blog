title: Stock Market Tells Powell To Pound Sand, Races Toward Highs; Overbought-Oversold Overload

Stock market indexes ignored cautionary comments on rate hikes from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday, after Friday's blowout labor report, and raced back toward weekly highs. Visions of former Chair Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" comment came to mind as market players bought tech stocks aggressively into the closing bell.




Volume edged higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. The S&P 500 is rangebound but well-positioned above 4000 and the 50-day line. Other indexes are rangebound as well, in constructive price action that may build stairsteps toward higher prices through the first quarter.


The 10-year Treasury bond yield held above support, trading near 3.67%. WTI crude oil futures surged off the low 70s per barrel and are again looking at steep resistance at and above $80 per barrel.


IBD raised its outlook to "confirmed uptrend" at the start of 2023, in recognition of a [Jan. 6 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) and stronger stock market price action in general. That has played out into February, with progressively-higher prices and legitimate buying of 2022's most beaten-down tech names.


Major benchmarks have mounted major moving averages, suggesting that exposure be increased to the 60% to 80% range, to take advantage of higher prices.


Overbought Markets
------------------


It's all about supply and demand. And based on some market measures, demand is drying up after big gains by major market indexes through the first six weeks of 2023.![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MP020723-229x300.jpg)


Technical indicators are now flashing overbought technical readings that favor new trading ranges. These may build steppingstones for higher prices, or trap doors to tests of 2022 lows. In either case, patience will be the key in coming weeks.


Bulls are in charge right now, so upside resolution make sense, but that doesn't mean investors should abandon the risk management techniques that have kept them in the game these many years.


[Overbought-oversold indicators](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overbought.asp) help investors gauge how high or low prices can go before all-powerful mean reversion kicks into gear. After big gains in the first weeks of the new year, bulls are complacent, raising odds for a shakeout of weak hands.


Stochastics and Bollinger bands are two indicators that investors can look at to examine overbought-oversold conditions.


Eyeballs also work because straight up or straight-down markets look lopsided and dangerous, even to novice market watchers.

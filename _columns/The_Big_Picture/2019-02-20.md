A lackluster session for the stock market Wednesday didn't bother the bulls one bit, as more earnings reports and the minutes from the January Federal Reserve meeting took center stage.




Earnings winners in the stock market included **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) and **Garmin** ([GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)), but [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) took heat ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. Shares plunged 7% after Stifel Nicolaus downgraded shares to hold from buy.


Strong showings for **DowDuPont** ([DWDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DWDP)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) fueled a 0.2% gain for the Dow Jones. The S&P 500 added nearly 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite edged higher by less than 0.1%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index outperformed with a 0.4% gain. Nasdaq volume rose and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE was also higher than Tuesday's levels.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MP_022019-206x300.jpg)The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lagged, falling 0.5%. The exchange traded fund was weighed down by weakness in Trade Desk as well as **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), which lost 2%. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock has been a top performer after a breakout over a 101.49 buy point.Results from Veeva Systems are due Feb. 26 after the close.


Other Stock Market Movers
-------------------------


Analog Devices added 2.5% to 106.82. It's still in buy range from a conventional entry of 103.69. It was featured in IBD's latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/options-trading-analog-devices-stock/) column, which highlights possible call-option trades.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rallied 0.9%, helped by strength in other semiconductor stocks like **KLA-Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Steel producers were among the day's best performers, although most stocks in the group remain far off highs. Top gainers in the group included **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) and **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)). Steel Dynamics was added to [Swing Trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com) Wednesday morning.


The SPDR Gold Shares ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)), meanwhile, extended gains after a powerful breakout from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base Tuesday. But shares reversed modestly lower by the close. Gold tends to rise amid weakness in the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. Dollar Index has been trending lower since Feb. 14.


Inside the IBD 50, **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) outperformed, rising 4%. It's still 30% off its high, but Autohome could try to break out over a descending trend line soon.


What The Fed Said
-----------------


In late January, the Fed pledged "patience" with additional rate hikes, and [the minutes](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-minutes-confirm-quantitative-tightening-will-end-this-year/) reiterated that stance. The minutes also indicated that quantitative tightening, the shrinking of the Fed balance sheet as bonds and other securities mature, will end later this year. There were no surprises in the minutes, which is exactly what the bulls wanted. The bears wanted a hawkish tone, but it was nowhere to be found.


Currently, futures traders aren't expecting any rate hikes this year.


The 10-year Treasury yield didn't move much on the Fed minutes. It edged up 1 basis point to 2.65%. Amid a dovish Fed, the 10-year yield has been in a pronounced downtrend since hitting a high of nearly 3.24% on Nov. 8.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


When it comes to overall market health, there's still plenty to like. Growth stocks have come under a bit of selling pressure in recent days, but some profit-taking isn't unusual in light of recent strong gains. Many other growth stocks continue to hold on to big gains post-breakout. And sell signals in leading growth stocks have been the exception, not the rule.


Keep in mind that even though the Nasdaq composite notched its third straight close above its 200-day moving average Wednesday, it still needs to conquer the 7500 level. The Dow has a round number of its own to conquer at 26,000. For the S&P 500, it's 280o.


Until the stock market starts to show meaningful signs of distribution, or institutional selling, the market uptrend still must be respected.

Stock Market Extends Rebound, Nasdaq Rallies As This Sector Shapes Up Favorably
================================================================================

Thursday's gains kept the major indexes in a tentative rebound, while the stock market goes through some sector rotation that's furnishing some fresh leadership.




With Fed Chairman Jerome Powell making a second straight appearance in Congress, the stock market's direction wavered for much of the day. But buyers took control of the market in afternoon trading.


The Nasdaq composite closed 1.6% higher and the S&P 500 climbed almost 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% as the main indexes ended near session highs.


No Follow-Through For Nasdaq
----------------------------


The Nasdaq is now up more than 6% from last week's low, which marked a new trough for its bear market. Despite Thursday's big gain, the index failed to make a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). An extremely mild dip in volume from Wednesday's levels kept that from happening. Still, a rally attempt continues to develop.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP062322-272x300.jpg)While the stock market tries to sustain its advance, some sector rotation is taking place, namely in the health care sector. A mix of pharmaceutical, medical tech, managed care and biotechs are topping key chart levels or forming [bullish chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


**Harmony Biosciences** ([HRMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRMY)) is already extended after breaking out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) Wednesday. **Privia Health Group** ([PRVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRVA)) is holding above a 29.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Managed care provider **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) is forming a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/).


Some of the new health care leaders are [now in the IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/growth-stocks-today-shows-tide-new-names-flows-onto-ibd-50/).


Health Care Sector Leading Stock Market
---------------------------------------


Health Care Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) is up 6% so far this week, the best performance among S&P sector ETFs. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is at new highs. **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) (forming a double-bottom base) and **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) (nearing new highs) are some of its largest components.



Energy and cyclical stocks are on the losing side of the new rotation. A raft of oil stocks have broken support levels such as the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/). Fertilizer, coal, mining, building and other industrial groups are in sharp declines.


**Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)), **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)), **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)) and **Archer-Daniels-Midland** ([ADM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADM)) were the biggest laggards on the S&P 500. ADM saw its largest loss since Oct. 30, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The IBD 50, which is still heavily weighted with cyclicals, underperformed badly. It fell 0.7%.


Powell Firm On Tightening
-------------------------


Appearing before the House Financial Services Committee, [Powell didn't back down from pressing forward with interest rate hikes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-jerome-powell-to-head-to-the-house-with-interest-rates-in-focus-11655976603?mod=hp_lead_pos2) as the means to control inflation. Powell said the Fed would be reluctant to break its tightening path even if it faced an economic slowdown. The central bank, he told lawmakers, wants to see clear evidence that inflation is falling.


Jason England, Global Bonds Portfolio Manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said Powell's determination could be seen when asked about a full percentage point rate hike. The chairman's comments that "nothing is being taken off the table" showed that resolve.


"The data will guide this Fed and until there is compelling evidence that inflation is falling, our view is that the Fed is on a path to do another 75 (basis point) hike at the July FOMC meeting," England said in comments to the media.

Outside The Stock Market: Yields, Oil Prices Fall
-------------------------------------------------


With Powell acknowledging the Fed's tightening could cause a recession, Treasury yields continued to fall Thursday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell 9 basis points to 3.07%.


The price of U.S. crude oil fell again. Nymex crude for August delivery fell 1.8% to $104.27 a barrel, the seventh decline in the past 10 sessions and the lowest close since May 10. Oil futures are now off 15.7% from the 52-week high of $123.70 on March 8, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


June is proving to be a bad month for oil, with prices down more than 9% so far. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)), which plunged more than 17% last week, is down nearly 4% this week.


Economic data Thursday morning gave the stock market some of the medicine it needs: Slower growth that may tame rate hikes and cooling costs.


The S&P Global purchasing managers index for June showed a drop to 51.2 in June from 53.6 in May. It was the weakest reading in five months. Weaker demand led to the first contraction in new orders since July 2020. The flash PMI report also noted that while costs remain high, the rise in input prices was the slowest since April 2021.

The Nasdaq and top-rated growth stocks rebounded Wednesday after three days of selling. With a light distribution-day count and plenty of bullish stock charts, Wednesday's market action showed why the stock market uptrend is still very much intact.




The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ended a three-session slide, rising 2.5% and climbing above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Just like the Nasdaq composite, the 21-day line has been a support level for the fund since the S&P 500 and Nasdaq confirmed new uptrends in early April.


Semiconductor stocks scored strong gains in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), including **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)). ASML is finding support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) for the first time after a breakout.


Eight [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks in the 20-stock list rose 2.5% or more Wednesday, including **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). Shares soared 13% and reclaimed the 1,500 level, helped by news of a 5-for-1 stock split.

The Nasdaq closed above the 11,000 level with a gain of 2.1%. The Nasdaq 100 rallied 2.6%, helped by strength in other leading chip stocks like **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)). Applied Materials, featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/) column, reports earnings Thursday after the close.


The S&P 500 rallied 1.4% and came to within six points of its all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added just over 1%. Financial stocks like **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) were early leaders in the Dow. But all three reversed lower as money flowed into technology stocks like **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in well below Tuesday's levels.


Microsoft is in a follow-on buy zone as it finds support at the 10-week line, but Apple is extended from a test of its 10-week line. Microsoft on Wednesday said Surface Duo, the company's two-screen Android phone, will launch on Sept. 10 starting at $1,399.99.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The latest Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a small rise in bullish sentiment to 58.1%, after a small dip to 56.7% the prior week. Bullish sentiment is again approaching its mid-January 2020 peak at 59.4%. In September 2018, the bulls hit 61.8% just before a sharp pullback for the major stock indexes. The survey is a contrarian indicator  because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.


According to Investors Intelligence, readings above 55% bulls call for defensive measures like tight stops and trimming some big winners. When bulls are around 60%, it may require even more defensive measures.

The Nasdaq rose to the top of an upper channel last week before its three-day pullback. But the selling only amounted to a brief break of the 10-day moving average Tuesday. The S&P 500 suffered an outside day but managed to hold above its 10-day line. In other words, the three-day pullback didn't do much damage.


Broad gains in top-rated growth stocks were good to see after the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 logged [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) Tuesday. But the distribution-day count remains light, and several leading growth stocks continue to trade bullishly near highs.


Remember that meaningful stock market pullbacks feature repeated signs of institutional selling in the major stock indexes and leading growth stocks. Neither is happening now. There's been some distribution in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, but not enough to raise a red flag. Meanwhile, institutional-quality growth stocks with healthy charts are the rule, not the exception, at the moment. That bodes well for the uptrend.


Base breakouts are getting hard to find these days, but stocks testing support at their 10-week lines are plentiful. Low-risk entries look pretty good for [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks Microsoft and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) as both stocks find support. **EBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) is also getting support.

Other stock market leaders like **Quidel** ([QDEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QDEL)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) and **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) are testing their 10-week lines but haven't made convincing bounces yet.


Recent IPO **Vroom** ([VRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRM)) was one of the top gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), up 6.5%, but shares cratered 17% in after-hours trading after the company reported earnings and guided Q3 sales well below expectations.


Another new issue, **Ping Identity** ([PING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PING)), lost 5% in after-hours trading, also on earnings.

================================================================================================

The stock market powered higher despite mixed retail data, buoyed by more positive earnings reports. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), one of the most watched issues among investors, is now set to report.




The Nasdaq composite continues to look mighty, powering up an impressive 0.8%. It is already up nearly 2% so far this week. The tech-heavy index is at highs for the year and clear of its [short-term moving averages.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/) Most important, it shed its last two remaining [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to the 5% gain rule.


The S&P 500 opened lower but closed with a meaty daily gain of 0.7%. The benchmark index is lagging the Nasdaq with a weekly gain of just over 1% but continues to pull away from its 10-day moving average.


Advancers outnumbered decliners by around 2.5-to-1 on the NYSE and just over 1.5-to-1 on the Nasdaq. [Volume was higher, a positive](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/). With the stock market uptrend looking strong, IBD recommends holding exposure at the 80%-100% level. But as indexes advance, the risk of a pullback increases, so keep on top of any sell signals within your portfolio.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average actually did best out of the major indexes, thanks to a 1.1% vault. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) fared best as it surged 4% after it detailed its [plans to monetize AI](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-spikes-to-record-high-on-ai-pricing-details/). In contrast, **Honeywell International** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) lagged.


But small caps and growth stocks turned in particularly impressive performances for the day. Both the Russell 2000 and the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) bloodied the noses of bears by punching 1.3% higher.


Retail Data Mixed As Tesla Earnings Loom
----------------------------------------


Stocks opened lower as investors digested mixed retail data. U.S. Census Bureau data showed retail sales were up 0.2% in June, below expectations for a 0.5% lift.

Positive big bank earnings reports made the news. **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), the second-largest U.S. bank, topped views, as did **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)). Banks have been boosted by higher net interest income tied to higher interest rates.


"We are done with the majority of the big banks and the overall takeaway is that they did OK despite a weakening economy and all the turmoil that stemmed from the regional banking crisis last quarter," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients.


He also thinks that investors could remain hopeful that a resilient U.S. economy "should translate into decent spending despite all the headwinds."


Tesla earnings now loom after the close Wednesday. This is an important report as TSLA is one of the most active issues on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).



Earnings per share are seen rising 9% to 83 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research. Analysts expect top-line growth to jump 47% to $24.88 billion.


Tesla is a member of the prestigious [IBD Leaderboard list of top stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


These Stock Market Groups Energize
----------------------------------


Most of the S&P 500 sectors ended the session in the green. Technology and energy led the upside while real estate and utilities, defensive areas, lagged.


For a deeper insight into the stock market action, it's wise to reflect on the relative performance of the IBD industry groups.


A variety of oil and gas groups, movie stocks, desktop software companies, and radio and TV stocks all had strong sessions.


In contrast, toymakers, solar plays, medical systems stocks, educational software firms and electrical utilities all suffered.

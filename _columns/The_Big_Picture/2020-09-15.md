Big cap and megacap techs, which sparked a [vertical-violation-type sell-off](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/) less than two weeks ago, led a decent rebound on Tuesday. But while the other indexes underperformed, a look beneath the hood revealed bullish elements consistent with a stock market turn that took place more than five months ago.




Volume came in higher vs. Monday, even as Wall Street focused on an upcoming announcement Wednesday by the Federal Reserve on interest rates. Meanwhile, the September reading of 17 on the Empire State manufacturing survey blew past the [Econoday forecast of 6.5](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) and soared from 3.7 in August. This signaled a further pickup in economic activity.


The Nasdaq composite gained 1.2% to 11,190. That marked its highest close since Sept. 4, which served as the second day of a three-day sell-off that yanked the premier index for growth companies 11% off its all-time high of 12,074 set just eight sessions ago.


![MP091520-](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP091520--210x300.jpg)Only the Nasdaq 100 could beat the Nasdaq composite's advance, with the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF rising 1.4%. Both indexes came within fingertip distance of crossing over their respective [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


A daily chart of QQQ on [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) with the 21-day exponential moving average shows that the past week and a half serves as the longest period of time spent underneath this useful technical level.

Other key indexes gained ground. But sharp declines in bank, insurance, building, oil and gas, and a few consumer-oriented industry groups weighed on their progress. The S&P 500 gained 0.5%; another strong gain of 1.4% or higher would allow the large-cap benchmark to recoup half its losses since its Sept. 2 peak at 3588.


Outside The Nasdaq, Inside The Dow
----------------------------------


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund added 0.1% to Monday's 2.6% rebound. The ETF closed near session lows. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 0.7%; it closed practically at its still-rising 50-day moving average.


Meanwhile, at least six of the 30 components in the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 point or more as the blue chip index ended flat. That offset nice gains in true growth stocks that happen to be part of the Dow, such as digital marketing and customer service platform **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)). The Dow, however, continues to lag the growth-focused Nasdaq.


Home Depot's archrival, **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), has carved a spot in the watchlist of [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/). Lowe's has seen growth in the top and bottom lines accelerate. That's helped it earn a spot in the [top 10 among the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10).


Under The Stock Market Hood
---------------------------


At this point, keep an eye on the [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) for the major indexes. You can view them on the large General Market Indicators page. Access it via the [Market Trend section](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) or via a link at the bottom of every Big Picture article.


Headed into Tuesday's session, those ratings seemed to have caught an early version of the flu. The Nasdaq's E grade implies that over the past 13 weeks, fund managers have on net been selling stocks. Yet in reality, few sessions in the market over the past 12 weeks have seen above-average turnover, especially on the Nasdaq.


In Monday's Big Picture, we noted an encouraging piece of data on the market internals â€” namely, rising stocks outmatched falling ones by a 7-2 margin on the Nasdaq, and more than 4 to 1 on the NYSE. Tuesday wove this bullish thread again. Early data showed winners edging losers by roughly 7-to-5 on the NYSE, 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


Breakouts populated the landscape of Tuesday's session, another positive. The Market Pulse table highlights some of these new leaders among growth stocks. **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), **Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) and **Charles River Labs** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) got attention during the [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).



Meanwhile, one hedge fund manager noted that the innovative spirit of entrepreneurs, the dynamism of the economy in adapting to Covid-19, and super-low interest rates are creating more reasons to seek high-growth companies as a way to build muscular returns.


"We now have a new regime of leaders burgeoning under the FAANG stocks, with $10 billion to $20 billion in market cap each," Robert Maltbie, managing partner of the Argonaut 2000 Fund, told IBD. His fund ranked in the top 12% in year-to-date performance and top 2% over the past 12 months through July among hedge funds tracked by HFRX. "We feel these companies can grow to $100 billion to $150 billion in value over time."


Some of the names in Maltbie's concentrated equities fund have become almost regulars in key stock lists such as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


Is Fear Subsiding?
------------------


The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vix-volatility-index-can-confirm-stock-market-bottoms-coronavirus-bear-market/), or the VIX, slid for a third straight session. (Please go to the IBD Psychological Indicators section at Investors.com to see the chart; it had recently marked a short-term bottoming signal.)

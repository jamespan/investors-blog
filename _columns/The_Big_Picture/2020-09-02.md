  Stock Market Surges Again; Nasdaq Hits Another High As Semiconductor Stocks Lead

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 led the stock market Wednesday. But the Nasdaq composite held its own with a close above the 12,000 level, for the first time. Stocks strengthened into the close and volume rose on the Nasdaq, giving the index another accumulation day.




The Dow Jones industrials jumped 1.6% to 29,100 and now have their sights set on the 30,000 level. The Nasdaq proved its mettle again, rising 1%, after falling 0.9% near midday. But the index is very extended after 13 gains in the past 16 sessions. Broad-based strength in semiconductor stocks offset weakness in the enterprise software group.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index picked up 0.9%.


Nasdaq volume rose. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly higher than Tuesday.


The S&P 500 rallied 1.5%, with Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) doing the heavy lifting, up around 3%. Top-weighted **NextEra** ([NEE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEE)) gave a buy signal, resulting in its addition to [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader).


![MP090220](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP090220-210x300.jpg)Advancing stocks beat decliners on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1. Breadth was better on the NYSE, with advancers beating decliners by nearly 3-to-1.


Some growth stocks ended with sharp losses, including **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)). But the selling didn't do any chart damage. Meanwhile, plenty of other growth stocks outperformed, with 18 [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stocks up 2% or more.


Bullish Sentiment Rises
-----------------------


While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are showing signs of overheating, it could still take a while for a meaningful pullback to take shape. Even so, adopting a defensive posture by trimming some winners and getting off margin makes sense.


A 5.7% pullback for the Nasdaq would take the index down to its 21-day exponential moving average, where it's been finding support in recent months. A 10% pullback would take it down its 50-day moving average.

Investors Intelligence on Wednesday released its latest weekly sentiment survey of stock market newsletter writers. The bulls rose to 61.5% from 60% the prior week. That's the highest level this year and the most bulls since September 2018, just before a sharp market pullback occurred. It's a contrarian indicator because sentiment tends to be very bullish near market tops and very bearish near market bottoms.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


IBD's semiconductor equipment group was one of the day's top performers, rising 4%. The chip-equipment group had a rough August, down 7%, but it's still holding support at the 10-week moving average. (Industry group charts are available with [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).)


Notable movers in the group Wednesday included institutional-quality names like **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)). Both stocks jumped above their 50-day moving average in heavy volume. A lesser-known name in the group, **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)), showed strong action early with a breakout over a trend line. Entegris' weekly chart paints a bullish picture.



Fabless chip firms also did well, with the group up nearly 3% to an all-time high. Top performers in the group included **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which got several price-target hikes Wednesday. **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) stayed in rally mode after a breakout from a flat base a month ago, and **Marvell Technology Group** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) continues to perform well after a breakout from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) with a 37.92 entry.


Applied Materials, Broadcom and Lam Research were top gainers in the Nasdaq 100, along with **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), which is near the top of a flat base with a 326.46 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


In other stock market news, **Oak Street Health** ([OSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSH)) closed off highs but still cleared an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 48.34 entry. There's no doubt that buying base breakouts has gotten tougher with the market up so much since April. It's still OK to target stocks forming good bases. But it's also a good idea to focus on the true stock market leaders giving alternate entries, either by finding support at their [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) or forming [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) patterns.


First Stocks Out Of The Gate
----------------------------


Stock market leaders like Nvidia, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) joined [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) when they broke out of bases just after the Nasdaq's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) on April 6. Dexcom made another bullish stand at its 50-day moving average Wednesday, rising 6% in strong volume.

**Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) is still in buy range after a breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). It reclaimed a 251.49 buy point Tuesday and followed through Wednesday, rising 3% to 261.35. It's still in the 5% buy zone.


**Zendesk** ([ZEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEN)) extended gains and closed near its high after a breakout over a 102.04 alternate entry Tuesday.


In the homebuilder group, [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) jumped 6%. It's making a solid first test of its 10-week moving average after a breakout from a base July 7. Support at the 10-week line puts the stock in a follow-on buy zone.

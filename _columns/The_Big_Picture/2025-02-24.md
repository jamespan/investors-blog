**Cryptocurrency News:**  Cryptocurrency prices continued falling Tuesday, with bitcoin dropping to a three-month low after crypto exchange Bybit on Friday suffered a $1.4 billion ethereum hack. CEO Ben Zhou [noted on social media](https://x.com/benbybit/status/1892969284587966869) that Bybit is solvent even if the hacked tokens are not recovered, as all client assets are backed one-to-one.


Bitcoin fell below $89,500 early Tuesday — marking its lowest price since the election — and has held under $100,000 for most of February.  Ethereum fell near $2,400 on Tuesday after trading around $2,800 prior to the hack.

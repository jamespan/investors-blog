  Stock Market Posts More Weakness After Recent Selling Pressure; Meta Stock Faces This Key Sell Rule

The S&P 500, one of the most popular gauges of stock market activity, undercut its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) on Monday. The Nasdaq composite fell further below this critical technical level. And for regular readers of this column, such negative technical action by these two key indexes likely came as little or no surprise.


With the suggested exposure to equities already ratcheted lower two days in a row to a current range of 40%-60%, Monday's moves illustrated what you'd typically see in a stock market under pressure.




On Wednesday, Investor's Business Daily suggested active stock investors to maintain their portfolio at 80% to 100% invested. However, on Thursday that strategy got reduced to 60%-80%. And after Friday's smackdown, recommended exposure fell again â€” this time to the 40%-60% level. That's commensurate to shifting the outlook from a stock market in a "confirmed uptrend" to an "uptrend under pressure."


On Monday, amid continued tough talk on "reciprocal tariffs" by President Donald Trump and more uncertainty surrounding the employment situation for many federal government employees, the major indexes did not attract bargain hunters. After an initial small gain in premarket futures and the opening minutes of the fresh session, sellers quickly seized the upper hand.


**Stock Market Today: An Unusual Move For S&P**
-----------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 fell 0.5% for its third straight decline. The large-cap benchmark closed in the lower half of an intraday trading range of 5,977 and 6,043.


Notice on a daily chart how the S&P 500 closed very low in its intraday range for the second straight session. That had not happened before in 2025.



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP022425.jpg)Bullish opens that turn into bearish closes also affirm the questionable health of a stock market uptrend.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was the day's big loser, off 1.2%. The Nasdaq 100 fell the same amount, much more than a 0.7% slide by the small-cap Russell 2000. Bolstered by gains of 2 points or more in at least six of its 30 components, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a fractional gain, up less than 0.1% at 43,461.


Volume dipped on both main exchanges vs. Friday's triple-witching session that saw weekly and monthly options on indexes and stocks expire.


A Revised Distribution Count
----------------------------


As the accompanying Market Pulse shows, the number of instances of pronounced heavy selling remains weighted to the high side. Having [six distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the count over a rolling 25-session count? Not normal during most bullish market conditions.


Also, the graphic shows a corrected tally for the S&P 500. For days, the Feb. 12 distribution day had not been counted in The Big Picture. But the S&P 500's 0.4% decline in heavier volume counts legitimately as a day of intense profit-taking by fund managers, as do the other four distribution days. Specifically, they are Jan. 27, down 1.5%; Jan. 31, off 0.5%; Feb. 20, down 0.4%; and Feb. 21, off 1.7%.


Given the way the IBD 50 has been treated lately, raising cash quickly offers the active investor many advantages.


One, the cash acts as a cushion against further marketwide sell-offs. Two, that cash could go into a new winner once the stock market acts more bullishly. And three, the extra funds could also end up getting used to add shares in a true market leader that continues to shape a long-term trend of higher highs and higher lows.


Notice, too, that the table shows an overwhelming number of leadership-quality companies falling at least 1% or more in heavy trading vs. leaders up in significant turnover.


AI Sector Shakeout
------------------



Take **Vertiv** ([VRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRT)). The expert in cooling systems for artificial intelligence data centers fell 5% on Monday to 91.02. Volume zoomed twice its usual amount over the past 50 sessions.


Four weeks ago, the stock garnered vital buying support at its 200-day line after Vertiv reported strong fourth-quarter results. Not many companies can boast profits rising 77% in the latest quarter, or even sales by 26%. Yet the maxim of "buy on fundamentals and technicals, but sell on technicals" still rings true in 2025.


After a strong rebound up to 126.53 on Feb. 10, heavy selling has resumed. Vertiv has now fallen in eight of the past nine sessions. It also punched easily through the 200-day moving average. While Vertiv stock is still up more than fivefold after a breakout past a first-stage [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) at 17.88 in May 2023, it's certainly lost a big chunk of gains in just one month.


Mutual fund owners have increased in the large-cap firm from Westerville, Ohio, going from 1,172 at the end of 2023 to 2,015 at the end of the fourth quarter last year. Yet don't forget this piece of IBD research on the biggest stock market winners: Once a true leader has finally topped, the average correction is 72%.


While Vertiv has fallen 41% off its peak of 155.84, it indeed is not alone in making a serious correction within the AI space.

Taking Profits On Meta Stock
----------------------------



Meta, part of the Magnificent Seven, [was a full-size position on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/?_gl=1*hcfy6u*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2Ljk3NDU5MzM4My4xNzM4ODY5Mjc4LjE3Mzg4NjkyNzg.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDQwNzQ3MC4yODEuMS4xNzQwNDA3NTI0LjYuMC4w#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) up until Friday, when the stake got trimmed to three quarters on the stock's slide below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Shares slid an additional 2.3% on Monday and volume remained heavy.


Therefore, the position got trimmed by another quarter to go down to half size, or roughly 5% of the Leaderboard model portfolio. The 5% weighting is based on its initial entry on the stock list, not its current value.


When a growth stock leader shows exceptional action, it tends to break out of an excellent base, climb to new highs, and not touch its 21-day line for weeks, if not months. Eventually it cools off, then tests support at this short-term technical level as some traders exit the stock on its excellent run.


Meta also could face another key sell rule: a [sharp cut through the 50-day moving average in heavy volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). For now, the social media giant holds a cushion above its 50-day line.


According to IBD Stock Checkup, the operator of Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram heralds a top-flight Composite Rating of 99 on a scale of 1 to 99. As a result, META also ranks 1st within the Internet-Content industry group.


The [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) shines brightly at 92. This rating covers 12 months of Meta's stock action vs. the rest of the IBD stock database.


Keep an eye on its shorter-term Relative Strength scores.


[According to MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF&_gl=1*1j8ddhc*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2Ljk3NDU5MzM4My4xNzM4ODY5Mjc4LjE3Mzg4NjkyNzg.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDQwNzQ3MC4yODEuMS4xNzQwNDA3NTMxLjYwLjAuMA..), in the Technicals section of the stock chart's "Related Information" right-hand panel, for now, Meta Platforms' 3-month RS Rating of 89 and six-month RS of 90 also look handsome. But the weekly chart also highlights a potential seventh major test of support at the 10-week moving average going back to December of 2023.



The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) is also rubbing shoulders with the line's own rising 8-week moving average. The RS line is also still floating nicely above the rising 21-week moving average.


Bonds And The Economy
---------------------


The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell to a nadir of 4.38%, undercutting its monthly low, before closing the day at 4.39%.


Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, wrote in weekly commentary that inflation remains a serious concern.


Last week's data from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey showed inflation expectations over the next 12 months jumped 1 full percentage point to 4.3%, the highest level since November 2023. That's notably above the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2% inflation. But Schutte added that "perhaps more importantly, expectations for inflation in the coming five to 10 years also rose, coming in at 3.5%, up 0.3% from January's final reading."


"The growing concern about prices appears to be seeping into consumers' overall outlook as well as their expectations for their personal financial situations," he wrote.

Volatility Picture
------------------


The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), which tracks options volatility on the S&P 500, rose for a third straight session. On Monday, the VIX jumped 7.5% to 18.97.


"There are still reasons for optimism on the market broadly, but investors may want to consider hedged strategies like covered calls that outperform choppy markets," Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, told IBD via email.


The Nasdaq 100 also has its own volatility measure. The Cboe Nasdaq Volatility Index â€” type in zero-VXN on [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) â€” ascended 2.3% to 21.45 on Monday and notched a three-week high.

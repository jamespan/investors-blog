The major stock indexes rebounded with moderate gains Thursday, but strong gains faded in afternoon trade. The stock market is trying to recover from its worst day since October 2020, yet the confirmed uptrend holds. Meanwhile, the social-media-fueled short squeeze in GME stock — and other short-squeeze targets — faltered after Robinhood banned new purchases.




The Nasdaq gained 0.5%, while the Russell 2000 reversed 0.1% lower as small caps sharply underperformed. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1% apiece.


Leading growth stocks outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.9% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 1-ranked **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) rallied 4.7% to snap a three-day losing streak. Shares remain above a [20%-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-growth-stocks-sell-rule-magic-small-cap-leader/) from a 154.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


Volume fell on the Nasdaq from Wednesday. Preliminary data showed volume also dropped on the NYSE.


Stock Market Rebounds
---------------------


The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials remain within striking distance of their recent record highs following Thursday's gains. The Nasdaq rebounded from its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which has been a support level for the Nasdaq since the index's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) in early November. The Dow 30 found much-needed support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP012821-219x300.jpg)But the indexes' late-day weakness could indicate that the selling may not be finished. The Nasdaq closed near the day's lows, up just 0.5% after advancing as much as 1.8%.


With five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 and just one on the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the market shows a modest amount of institutional selling over the past 25 trading sessions.


Despite Wednesday being the worst day since October, most top growth stocks are simply pulling back to their 10-week lines, which serve as critical support levels. How they rebound from this crucial area should help clarify whether the recent heavy selling is short-lived or potentially the start of something more.


Short-Squeeze Stocks: GME, AMC
------------------------------


The social-media-driven short squeezes faltered Thursday, as [Robinhood blocked clients](https://www.investors.com/news/gamestop-stock-reddit-short-busting-curbs-spark-double-standard-cries/) from making new purchases, only allowing clients to sell their existing positions. Meanwhile, major brokerage firms **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) and TD Ameritrade have placed their own restrictions on these highly volatile stocks.


**GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) plunged 44%. **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)) crumbled 56%. **BlackBerry** ([BB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BB)) plummeted 41%.


Late Thursday, Robinhood amended its ban on purchases, [saying in its blog](https://blog.robinhood.com/), "Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We'll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed." All three short-squeeze stocks jumped in extended trade.

Key Stock Market Technique: Buying Off The 10-Week Line
-------------------------------------------------------


Many top stocks are trying to find support and rebound from their [10-week moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), as the stock market bounces following Wednesday's sell-off. During an ideal pullback, a stock will fall in lighter volume, and then rebound in heavy or increasing volume. This indicates key institutional support.


Typically, investors should be adding to existing positions during rebounds from the 10-week line. Be careful about buying too many shares; oversize purchases could drive up your average cost too far, too fast.


Keep in mind that a stock's rebound could quickly turn tail and fail, breaking down through the 50-day line instead. An overdue break of the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/palo-alto-vs-apple-why-not-every-break-of-support-is-a-sell-signal/) in heavy volume is a key sell signal.

Nasdaq Posts Follow-Through Following Mild Correction
======================================================

The Nasdaq composite flexed leadership Wednesday, rising 1% in heavier volume.


In a year where low volatility has been a mantra of the financial media, the gain was good enough to mark the confirmation of a new uptrend.


The S&P 500 and the Dow transports — representing strength in airline, railroad and shipping stocks — both rose 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100 gapped up 1.1%.


For true market watchers, the Nasdaq continues to be the most worthwhile for monitoring the market's health. And on Wednesday, the tech-heavy index served up a Day 4 follow-through that began with an up day on Aug. 8.


The IBD 50 ran ahead 1.5%. The fact that leading growth stocks participated in Wednesday's follow-through should give individual investors more confidence in wading back into the market.


Longtime readers know that in a typical market correction, the indexes fall from their 52-week high by anywhere from 4%-5% to a lot more. So this latest pullback feels like a blip. Then again, it hasn't been a normal market. The indexes have shown impressive strength since a 20% drop by the Nasdaq in mid-2011.


With a new follow-through in play, one should not necessarily go whole hog and load up to 200% market exposure with the use of margin. Stocks can and should be selected and bought one at a time. If a new buy works, providing a profit cushion, that's the market signaling that another buy has a reasonably good chance of working out.


Taking profits earlier — at 15% rather than 20% to 25% — and cutting losses more quickly also makes good sense.


Wednesday's advance coincides with a well-needed cooling off of bullish enthusiasm among market pundits. The weekly Investors Intelligence survey showed the ratio of bullish newsletter editors falling to 46.4%, a five-month-plus low. (See the Bulls vs. Bears chart on Page B11.)


Why is this key?


Excessive optimism implies that market participants are fully invested in the market. They want the market to go higher and believe that it will. If nothing else, a rising market would prove them wise. The market continues to run not only on earnings and economic prospects but also on greed, hope, fear and despair.


For weeks, this column noted that market internals showed fatigue. On Wednesday, conditions improved. Winners thumped losers by more than 2 to 1 on the Nasdaq and nearly 3 to 1 on the NYSE. The new high list expanded modestly (see Page B1).


Today's Big Picture moves to a new page with the expansion of space for the charts of the major indexes, as seen on Page B2.

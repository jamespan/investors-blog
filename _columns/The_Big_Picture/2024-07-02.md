The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 marked all-time closing highs Tuesday as buyers maintained the upper hand. **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)) joined the breakout ranks with a decisive move above a buy point of 69.59.




Investors parsed comments from [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-powell-disinflation-10-year-yield-trump-effect/), who spoke at a monetary policy conference in Portugal. He again acknowledged that inflation is moving in the right direction, but he also reiterated that the Fed needs to see more data before it starts cutting rates. Fed funds futures traders tracked by CME FedWatch think there's a 69% chance that the first Fed rate cut will come at the September meeting.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite and S&P outperformed, rising 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 small-cap index added 0.4% and 0.2%. The Nasdaq closed above the 18,000 level for the first time after poking above it Friday.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The stock market will close for the July Fourth holiday Thursday, and on Wednesday it will close early, at 1 p.m. ET.


In the Dow Jones index, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) hit a fresh all-time high after the stock broke out in heavy volume on June 11. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) also outperformed in the Dow and hit an all-time high. Amazon broke out of a flat base last week with a 191.70 entry.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP070224-1-224x300.jpg)As the stock market improved in afternoon trading, so did market breadth, at least on the NYSE. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by about a 2-1 ratio. Advancers barely beat decliners on the Nasdaq.


The best-performing S&P 500 sector exchange traded fund was the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)), which rallied 2%. Amazon and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are the top-weighted holdings and make up nearly 40% of the ETF.


Tesla shares surged 10% after the company [delivered more cars than expected](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-vehicle-deliveries-q22024/) in Q2. But after six straight up sessions,Â  Tesla is too extended to buy right now. But it is a good candidate for a watchlist. Tight, sideways trading from here could yield an alternate entry.


What To Do Now
--------------


While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are near all-time highs, the environment has gotten more challenging for growth stocks. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio is currently about 69% invested on the long side and 4% short with the Tradr 1.25x NVDA Bear Daily ETF ([NVDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDS)). The ETF is only a partial hedge at this point because **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) currently makes up 19% of the portfolio.


Leaderboard is a little below IBD's recommended invested percentage of 80%-100%. But that's only because we've done some pruning lately, getting rid of some dead weight while giving our winners more room to run. We're still on the lookout for new adds, but growth stocks are painting a mixed picture as some leaders come under selling.

Inside the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), **Blue Bird** ([BLBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLBD)) slumped below its 50-day moving average, falling nearly 7%. Meanwhile, after a bad break of its 50-day line Monday, retail leader **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) extended losses in the stock market Tuesday, falling an additional 2%.


Meanwhile, some leaders in the restaurant group have come under pressure, including **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Sweetgreen** ([SG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SG)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)).


Another area of softness has been homebuilders and a slew of building-related stocks. In the air conditioning and heating products group, **Comfort Systems** ([FIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIX)) looks poised for its fifth straight weekly close below its 10-week moving average. In the maintenance and service group, **Emcor** ([EME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EME)) recently lost support at its 50-day line with an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) of E.


Large-Cap Tech Leads
--------------------


But large-cap technology stocks continue to attract buyers. Besides Amazon and Apple, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) continue to show relative strength. Nvidia is holding support at its [21-day exponential average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) after selling off June 20-24.



Meanwhile, sentiment was negative around **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) and **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) early in the session, but both stocks pared losses. In a USA Today op-ed piece, President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders said both companies charge "unconscionably" high prices for their weight-loss drugs. Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic, along with Eli Lilly's Mounjaro, were called out specifically.


Separately, the Food and Drug Administration approved Lilly's drug [Kisunla](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-stock-fda-approval-alzheimers-treatment-kisunla/) for the treatment of adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.


It's a very quiet week of earnings but fairly busy in terms of economic data. The ADP Employment Report, due Wednesday at 8:15 a.m. ET, is expected to show June private payrolls up 161,000. The report comes ahead of Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up 189,000.

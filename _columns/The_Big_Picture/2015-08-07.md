===================================================================

Stock indexes on Friday limped to their fourth loss in five sessions. The Nasdaq, though, scored a positive reversal, trimming a 1% deficit to less than 0.3%. The S&P 500 reversed a 0.8% loss to 0.3%. The IBD 50 gained 0.3%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

The decisively lower volume suggested there was little institutional interest in piling on to Thursday's sell-off.

  

The Nasdaq's chart shows that Thursday's session wasn't unusual for this market. The indexes have been showing speed-bump action since March — never gaining much velocity on the way up or down.

  

During that period, the Nasdaq lost 1.5% or more in rising volume in a single session five times — March 10, March 25, April 17, April 30 and May 5. Lower the threshold to 1% and there are more instances.

  

Whatever the yardstick, the result is the same: The one-day losses didn't usher in aggressive selling. In fact, the losses often came near a short-term low in the market.

  

Individual investors can't be sure that will happen again, but it'd be no surprise if the market keeps the same pattern.

  

On Friday, the S&P 500 appeared to find support at its 200-day line, while the Nasdaq halted near the 5,000 level. But some market watchers attributed the market's turnaround to good news for a prominent blue chip.

  

**American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), a component in the Dow and S&P 500, was down almost 1% when news hit the Street around 1:30 ET that hedge fund ValueAct Capital had acquired a $1 billion stake in the company. The blue chip thrust to a 6% gain.

  

Intraday charts of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showed a sharp reversal around the same time.

  

American Express has an EPS Rating of 88, but its Relative Price Strength Rating is 33. A rating of 33 means the stock trails about two-thirds of the market in price performance. In February, **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) announced it will terminate its exclusive deal with American Express in 2016.

  

At this juncture, bulls will take encouragement wherever they can find it. One area of hope is the put-call ratio. It closed at 1.11 Thursday and 1.09 Friday. This is near areas where the market set a short-term bottom in the recent past.

  

Other economic news lacked muscle.

  

Nonfarm payrolls rolled in at a 215,000 increase in July. However, that only topped the consensus estimate by about 1%. The data showed average hourly earnings climbed 2.1% from the year-ago level, which was less than the Street expected.

  

Also, the labor participation rate remained at 62.6%, a miserable level not seen since the Jimmy Carter era.

  

Overall the data were sufficiently mixed to make it unclear whether the report increases or decreases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 and the Nasdaq each clocked a 1.7% loss. The S&P 500 lost the least at 1.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the small cap Russell 2000 each fell 1.8%.

  

Earnings season continues this week. Many retail-related companies will report, including Internet seller **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), department store **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) and casual restaurant chain **Red Robin Gourmet Burgers** ([RRGB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RRGB)).

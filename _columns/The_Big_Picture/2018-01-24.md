Nasdaq Hit By Sellers, Dow Transports Slammed; This Commodity Broke Out
========================================================================

If the bull run in U.S. equities were in need of a break, Wednesday served as a constructive session. Yet perhaps far more interesting for traders and observers was the action going on in the commodity pits.


Â While the Nasdaq composite scored its second [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in recent weeks and the S&P 500 let early gains vaporize, money gushed into gold and silver, a pair of commodities that for a while seemed to stand limply in the shadow of Bitcoin and other alternative digital currencies.


The SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) ETF, which tracks the price of gold futures, gapped up at the open and rose 1.2% to 128.83 as the dollar remained weak and Bitcoin plays pulled back again. For some investors, Bitcoin serves as a hedging tool in a similar way that gold does. Gold Shares also cleared a 128.42 buy point in a nearly five-month flat base after near-term gold futures on the Comex hit their [highest level since September 2013](https://www.investors.com/research/futures/gold-price-could-start-new-uptrend/).

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.6%, its biggest drop of the year so far, while the Nasdaq 100 sank the same amount. Blame a big share of the significant losses on heavy-volume selling in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and other big and megacap tech entities.


The S&P 500 finished down less than 2 points but, at least on a daily chart, the reversal wasn't pretty. The size of the decline did not meet the minimum requirement to log a [new distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) for the large-cap benchmark. Still, the session showed at least some elements of institutions eager to sell into strength.


The Dow Jones industrials edged up 0.2%, benefiting from more buying in big banks such as **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)). But the Dow transports got trampled by selling in the airline sector and fell 1.4%. Transportation stocks have had a big year so far, though.


The Russell 2000 lost 0.6%.


As seen in the accompanying Market Pulse table, the S&P 500 holds just one distribution day, or session of intense professional selling, over the past 25 trading sessions. The Nasdaq doubled its count. But two distribution days typically are not enough to kill a bull market.


Plus, the size of each distribution on the Nasdaq (-0.5% on Jan. 16, -0.6% Wednesday) was not scary. You have to go back to Dec. 4 to find a Nasdaq distribution day in which the tech-rich index fell at least 1% in higher turnover vs. the prior session.


Still, both new IBD readers and advanced investors should always keep an eagle eye on what not only the major indexes are doing but also how the very best growth stocks are faring.


On Wednesday, they didn't fare that well.


A week ago in this [column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/s-5-signs-why-this-market-rally-may-heat-up-in-2018/), the Market Pulse noted no fewer than 18 companies as market leaders that rallied in heavy volume. Only one compatriot fell in heavy trade, as seen among the stocks making screens including the IBD 50, Sector Leaders and Big Cap 20. But on Wednesday, the tone among leaders showed notes of resistance, tests of support at key moving averages, and pullbacks to or below proper buy points in decent bases.


If you see the Market Pulse table continue to see a heavier tilt toward market winners falling sharply in active trading, you're getting a sign that a true break is due.


Overall, however, the market's internals still look fine.


Breadth was notably worse on the Nasdaq, as losing issues beat winners by a 9-5 margin. On the NYSE, falling stocks beat risers 4 to 3. Yet as seen in the General Market Indicators page (go to the link at the bottom of this article), the slope of the NYSE's advance-decline line remains positive and strong.


New highs continue to generally swamp those hitting 52-week or all-time lows. Take the Nasdaq on Monday and Tuesday: 358 hit new highs vs. 24 new lows on the former, and it was 395 vs. 14 on the latter. Finance, Bank, Retail, Medical and Software sectors have done the heavy lifting. If you're making some good money in your breakouts, it's highly likely that your stocks hail from these or other high-growth industries.



Yet Wednesday's session was a bit unusual in that cyclical and commodity companies made the grandest breakouts. Just look at building products chain and tool distributor **W.W. Grainger** ([GWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWW)) (surging 18% and well past a 240.59 handle buy point on nice Q4 earnings growth of 20%), leisure services play **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)) (up 4%, cruising past a 69.99 flat base entry), **Weyerhaeuser** ([WY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WY)) (at a 37.02 buy point) and **General Dynamics** ([GD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GD)) (211.85).


As the business and political elite hang out in Davos, Switzerland, and make headlines, it's worth keeping an eye on the continued signs of correlation among various asset classes.



Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sang the praises of the weak U.S. dollar, and Google chief Sundar Pichai reportedly welcomed the prospects of higher taxes globally. When the dollar weakens, dollar-priced assets such as gold and crude oil become even more attractive. On Wednesday, U.S. near-term futures rallied to as high as $66.05 a barrel, now up 55% from a June 2017 low near $42.


That's good news for big explorers such as **PetroChina** ([PTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTR)), a former big winner during the commodity bull run from 2002 to 2007. The megacap energy play cleared a 76.94 buy point in a [large cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).

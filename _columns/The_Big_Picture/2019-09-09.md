  Indexes Little Changed, Masking Rout In Software, Other Sectors

The stock market indexes may not have shown it, but one of the market's pillars took an uppercut Monday when the once-solid software sector sold off broadly.




The Nasdaq composite, of which [nearly half is technology](https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/Breakdown/COMP), fell just under 0.2% as it felt the weight of software stocks more than other major indexes. In a positive aspect, the composite held above its 50-day moving average.


The S&P 500 was flat and the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](http://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis) rose 1%. Both held above their own 50-day lines, which supports the market uptrend.


But sellers specifically sought out software stocks — a leading sector this year, but one slowing down for weeks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP090919-238x300.jpg)Enterprise, security, database, medical and specialty enterprise software groups were five of the six weakest industry groups Monday. The enterprise software industry group had a number of notable sell-offs in what was a [broad strike on the leaders](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/paylocity-paycom-atlassian-veeva-systems-issue-key-profit-taking-sell-signal/).


**Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Aspen Technology** ([AZPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZPN)) closed sharply below their 50-day averages in heavy volume. Such breaks of support levels are [considered sell signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-wait-for-analyst-downgrade-learn-how-to-recognize-sell-signals/).


**Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) closed below the 50-day line too. **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) skidded for a third session in a row as sellers piled on in response to the company's earnings report Thursday.


In specialty enterprise software, **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) buried deeper below its 50-day line. **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) slid below its own 50-day moving average and is more than 8% below its buy point. That's a sell signal. All those were in high regard among growth investors just weeks ago.


Software Slowing For A While
----------------------------


To be sure, some of the sector leaders started breaking down a while back. Cybersecurity company **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) snapped below its 50-day line Aug. 19 and continued to sink. On Monday, it closed below the 200-day moving average.


Paylocity became volatile the past several weeks. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) fell below the 50-day line July 31 and remains below it. **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) met resistance at the 10-week line in July, and started another leg down.


It's not clear what triggered the selling. Institutional investors may be selling into strength, now that the general market is again trending higher. In another sign that Monday's weakness was concentrated, the Russell 2000 jumped 1.3%.


Stock Market Sees Sector Rotation
---------------------------------


When most of the market hardly moves and a top sector gets clobbered, sector rotation is occurring, and it's not necessarily a sign of a market top. Semiconductor, financial, energy, retail stocks plus cyclicals such as transportation, machinery and industrials led the market.


In retail, a mix of specialty chains and major stores such as **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) have [emerged in this rotation](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/stock-market-today-sees-retail-sector-rotation-gain-strength-as-walgreens-soars/).


That's why it's important to pick the right sectors to have success in the stock market.


Payment stocks such as **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) came under selling Monday as well. A number of health care leaders also struggled. Mastercard is in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), but Leaderboard has avoided adding software companies.


The IBD 50 tumbled 2.9%, its worst day since Aug. 5, and it wasn't just software shares doing the damage. Fifteen of the 50 stocks lost 4% to 9% on the day. That included video technology leader **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), which lost 6%. Medical research firm **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) shed 4%.


Payment leaders PagSeguro, **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)), **Qiwi** ([QIWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIWI)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) were in that dubious group.

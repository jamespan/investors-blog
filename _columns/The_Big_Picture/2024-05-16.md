The Dow Jones Industrial Average made history Thursday, crossing the 40,000 mark for the first on record as **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) rallied on strong results. But the major stock indexes reversed lower by the close.




The Dow Jones index dipped 0.1% while the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite, which had been up as much as 0.3%, moved down 0.3%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.6%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, but fell on the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session. In fact, Thursday's Nasdaq volume was highest since May 28, 2019, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


A revived [meme stock mania](https://www.investors.com/news/amc-stock-sheds-debt-gme-stock-meme-stocks-reverse/) is affecting market volume. On Thursday, **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) and **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)) extended Wednesday's declines. GameStop stock plunged another 30%, while AMC shares lost 15%.


GameStop volume topped 72 million shares Thursday, 300% above its average. GameStop volume ranged from about 131 million to 207 million shares the previous three days. Volume in AMC topped 123 million shares Thursday, 174% more than average.


Thursday's higher Nasdaq volume meant the composite's loss resulted in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). It came just one day after the major indexes climbed to new highs. The S&P 500 also carries one day of institutional selling, a stalling day on May 7.

Dow Jones Movers: Cisco, Walmart
--------------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and Walmart were the biggest movers after their respective earnings reports. Cisco shares reversed 2.7% lower, while Walmart rallied 7% to break out past a 60.89 double-bottom entry.


[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) reversed 0.3% lower, still holding above a 922.20 buy point. Nvidia is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.5%, still just shy of a 52-week high. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **PDD Holdings** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) is trying to break out past a cup-with-handle's 142.32 buy point.



Stock Market Today
------------------


Wednesday's bullish action raised IBD's recommended market exposure to a range of 80%-100%. That makes sense given that the major stock indexes climbed to all-time highs.


And Thursday's reversal did little to dispel the bullishness of the stock market. A mild day of distribution isn't concerning. But a clustering of distribution days over a period of several days could be concerning.


Further, a number of recent breakouts continue to provide fresh opportunities to raise exposure. Remember, the best stocks will have strong [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/). RS lines that hit new highs on or before the breakout day could be poised to be market leaders.


In [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list Thursday, financial leader **Jefferies** ([JEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JEF)) edged past a 47.39 buy point in a cup base. But volume was light. Meanwhile, **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) is rapidly nearing a 403.76 buy point as it shapes an orderly flat base.

Dow Jones Leader Microsoft Eyes Buy Point
-----------------------------------------



**Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), along with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) are among stocks to watch as they trade near buy points.


Costco shares finished squarely in the 5% buy zone past a 787.08 [cup-base entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The buy area tops out at 826.43. Costco was the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/costco-stock-of-the-day-breaks-out-amid-rising-profit-estimates-surging-gold-sales/)


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) KB Home closed Thursday in buy range past a 72 buy point in a cup base despite a 2.1% decline.


Dow Jones component Microsoft dipped 0.5% Thursday, but remained within striking distance of a flat base's 430.82 buy point.


Trade Desk rallied 3.3% Thursday, briefly taking out a 94 buy point before closing just below it. A handle entry at 92.19 is also viable.


And chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor, better known as TSMC, is in buy range above a 148.43 double-bottom entry.

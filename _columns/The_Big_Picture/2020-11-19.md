Nasdaq Leads Stock Market Rally; Tesla Hits Record High, While AMD Nears New Buy Point
=======================================================================================

The major stock indexes reversed from early losses to end with mixed gains Thursday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the stock market higher with a 0.8% advance, as tech giant Tesla jumped to record highs.




Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average followed up with a 0.2% gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.8%.


Leading growth stocks handily beat the major stock indexes, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) trading up 1.8% on Thursday.


In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) soared to all-time highs on [strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/futu-earnings-q3-2020-futu-stock-jumps/) with an 8% surge. Meanwhile, **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) bullishly regained its 50-day moving average with a 5.9% gain. The retailer is forming a new base.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP111920-237x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq from Wednesday's totals. Preliminary numbers showed a modest drop in NYSE volume.


Nasdaq Leads Stock Market Rally
-------------------------------


On Thursday, the Nasdaq more than made up for Wednesday's 0.8% decline, which saw the tech-heavy composite add its third [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The S&P 500 has two days of institutional selling.


For now, stock market sentiment remains moderately positive despite the recent stock market rotation. The Nasdaq still faces a test of the 12,000 level. Amid the current back-and-forth action, investors should be flexible in case they need to add or reduce exposure.


Investors should continue to buy strong breakouts past [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). In recent sessions, there have been a number of solid breakouts among stock market leaders like **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), [IPO Leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-futu-stock-approaches-new-buy-point/) Futu, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). All four breakouts are extended above their buy points.


As always, cut losses short if a stock falls more than 7% or 8% below the correct buy point.

Stock Market Earnings: Intuit, Workday
--------------------------------------



Late Thursday, **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) both reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.


Intuit slipped about 1% in extended trading in the wake of the company's results. The stock ended Thursday's regular trading in the 5% buy zone past a 354.08 buy point in a cup with handle.


Workday fell slightly after the close. The stock is approaching a 236.94 early entry in a cup with low handle. The proper entry looms at 248.85.


Stocks To Watch: AMD, Bilibili, Target
--------------------------------------



Chip giant **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is rapidly approaching an 88.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/), according to MarketSmith chart analysis. Shares are about 4% away from the entry after Thursday's 3.6% advance. A potential handle entry offers a slightly lower buy point, at 87.15.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [AMD stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.aspx) boasts a 98 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The Composite Rating — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.


AMD is a new [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) member.


Chinese leader **Bilibili** ([BILI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILI)) surged past a 54.10 buy point in a choppy cup base, roaring more than 22% higher Thursday. Shares quickly entered and then exited the 5% buy zone after the [company's strong sales results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/bilibili-stock-earnings-china-social-media-bili/).


Bullishly, the stock's RS line is at new highs, cementing the online entertainment provider as a stock market leader.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) again rose above a 167.52 buy point in a short consolidation. Shares advanced 2.7% to retake the entry after dipping below that level on Wednesday.

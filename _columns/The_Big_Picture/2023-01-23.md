  Stock Market Firms Up On Views For Smaller Rate Hike; These Obscure Stocks Lead

The first stock market rally of 2023 strengthened Monday, with another day of solid gains and more barriers getting knocked down.




The ticker tape is in a funky phase where bad economic news is good news, prompting buying interest. Investors figure poor economic performance means less incentive for the Fed to keep hiking interest rates.


So on Monday, the Conference Board's composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators did its part for the Wall Street rally. The December index fell 1%, worse than views for a 0.7% drop. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported the Federal Reserve is set to [raise rates by a milder quarter point](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-sets-course-for-milder-interest-rate-rise-in-february-11674362567) at the next meeting.


The news — along with other catalysts last week — means a 25-basis point increase is [all but confirmed](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) at next week's Fed policy meeting. The 10-year Treasury yield continued to rebound, up 4 basis points to 3.52%.


Nasdaq, Small Caps Lead Stock Market
------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite rose a hair more than 2%, marking back-to-back gains of more than 2% for the first time since early October.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and fell on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP012323-206x300.jpg)The Nasdaq is taking the 2023 stock market leadership mantle so far, up more than 8% in January, vs. 4.7% for the S&P 500 and 1.5% for the Dow. Small caps are also leading, with the Russell 2000 gaining about 7% so far this month.


Small caps tend to outperform this time of year in the so-called [January effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/januaryeffect.asp).


The S&P 500 climbed 1.2%, jumping over some hurdles along the way. It closed more than 1% above its 200-day moving average, which has been a ceiling for the index in recent months. It also closed above 4,000.


The advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE have been trending noticeably upward since late December.


[MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s market indicators also are flashing bullish signs. The number of Nasdaq new highs now exceeds new lows — the first time that's happened in more than a year.


A spike in the [put-call volume ratio on Dec. 28](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) pointed to a washout of sellers. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 registered [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) last week, but both indexes are now above the price bars of those higher-volume declines.


Stock Market Risks Rising
-------------------------


The bullish turn in the stock market also invites the risk that indexes are overshooting their trends. Case in point: The MarketSmith short-term overbought-oversold oscillator is near the highest level in more than a year on both the Nasdaq and NYSE.


The S&P 500 hasn't quite penetrated a trend line touching its highs since the January 2022 peak and the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) is at levels that suggest complacency.


Those are reasons why an exposure level of 40%-60% seems adequate for now.


Turning to leading stocks, more are breaking out of bases. That's ultimately the best way to make money in growth stocks.


In another encouraging sign for the stock market, more than a dozen stocks have regained their buy points after dipping below them.


**Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)), **Timken** ([TKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TKR)), **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) and **AerCap** ([AER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AER)) are all examples of companies that dipped, never falling more than 7% from their buy points. That would have resulted in a [sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Catalyst Pharma Drags But IBD 50 Rises
--------------------------------------


The IBD 50 index rose 1% Monday and would have performed better, except for **Catalyst Pharmaceuticals** ([CPRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRX)). The biotech plummeted 29% in heavy volume, breaking below its 50-day moving average.


**Teva Pharmaceutical** ([TEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEVA)) [plans to make a generic version of Catalyst's Firdapse](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cprx-stock-ibd-50-longtime-leader-plummets-as-generics-come-for-its-only-product/), a treatment for an autoimmune condition called Lambert-Eaten myasthenic syndrome. Firdapse is Catalyst's only product in the market.


The IBD 50 index is up nearly 5% for January so far and is getting  much of its strength from a batch of lesser-known companies.


**Par Pacific** ([PARR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PARR)), which operates refineries and gas stations in Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest, is up 17% from a breakout last week.


**Perion Networks** ([PERI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PERI)), a provider of digital advertising services, is up 25% this month. **Axcelis Technologies** ([ACLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACLS)), which provides chip-fabrication services, has rallied 35% in January.


The sudden emergence of these companies into stock market leadership is a good reason for investors to keep an eye on the IBD 50, Stock Spotlight and other screens.

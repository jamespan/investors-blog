The stock market rally gathered pace on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all surging higher. But risks remain despite the bullish action.




The Nasdaq composite fared best out of the major indexes, surging 3.3% for the day. It is up a muscular 5.7% for the week and nearing the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). However, it remains marooned under the critical 50-day line.


The S&P 500 vaulted 3.1% and is now up 5.8% for the week. It also looks to have snapped its downtrend but remains more than 5% below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and almost 10% below its 200-day line.


Volume data was encouraging, with transaction levels higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Blue chip stocks also partook in the high-percentage gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 2.8%. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) performed best among the biggest names.


However, the potential for overhead supply to trigger a reversal at the 50-day moving average is also in play this week.

Stock Market Today: Small Caps Surge; Hurdles Remain
----------------------------------------------------


Nevertheless, the bulls enjoyed another very strong session, with the Russell 2000 small-cap index leading the way, posting an 3.9% advance. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) also impressed, sporting a 3.4% gain.


A fall in the dollar and easing of Treasury yields served as a balm for U.S. stocks.

Another factor: Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed that U.S. job openings fell to almost 10.1 million in August, down from nearly 11.2 million in July, and well below expectations.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said the report was a positive sign but warned about more pain ahead.


"The labor market is starting to lose its tightness. The August JOLTS report showed job openings posted its first significant decline, which could be the start of data points that are needed for the Fed to pivot from their aggressive tightening stance," he said in a note to clients.


However, he added  "It is too early to say a Fed pivot is justified but if we continue to see a couple sharp drops with job openings, that will wake up the doves in the Federal Open Market Committee."


This is a big week for employment data, with the ADP Employment Report due Wednesday, weekly jobless claims on Thursday and the September nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.


Smart investors will be watching index price action at their 50-day moving averages in coming sessions. They are trading below those key levels at the moment and the barriers could generate significant resistance if the rally continues.


Keep in mind this is just the second day of the rally attempt and the market remains in a correction. Investors should avoid getting sucked in too deeply because no one can rule out another brutal reversal.


Stock market investors should always keep tabs on the performance of the 197 IBD industry groups.


Elon Musk Twitter Move Helps This Industry Group
------------------------------------------------



**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) CEO Elon Musk's offer to complete his mooted **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) takeover for the originally-agreed $54.20 per share, [per a regulatory filing,](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1494730/000110465922105787/tm2227435d1_sc13da.htm) underpinned a rally in the Internet Content group. Nevertheless, it remains mired in 149th place overall.


Instead, media periodical plays, transportation airline stocks and casinos were among Tuesday's very best performers.


At the same time. downside action was extremely limited, with dairy products stocks the only group falling for the day.

Stock Market Rallies But Fades Off Highs; Goldman Sachs Earnings Report Lifts Financial Stocks
===============================================================================================

The stock market rallied nicely on the fourth day of its rally attempt Tuesday. But the bulls were left disappointed as major stock indexes closed well off highs and buy prospects remained in short supply.




The Nasdaq composite gapped up at the open and came close to the 11,000 level, but the index ultimately got turned away at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). After rising 2.8% early, the Nasdaq closed with a gain of 0.9%. Volume rose from Monday. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by nearly 2-1.


Stocks took a turn for the worse just after 2:30 p.m. ET, when The Information reported that Apple is cutting production of the iPhone 14 Plus less than two weeks after its debut. A 3% intraday gain for Apple stock faded to 0.9% by the close. Apple on Tuesday also unveiled [new iPads](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-rises-on-new-ipads/) along with an upgraded Apple TV streaming video box.

Small-cap **Aehr Test Systems** ([AEHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEHR)) was a bright spot in the technology sector, up 10%. The chip-equipment stock gapped up in heavy volume and closed just below a 19.53 buy point in a nine-week-old consolidation.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrials rallied 1.1%, helped by strong performances from **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) as well as financial stocks like **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)).


Salesforce jumped 4.3% after activist hedge fund Starboard Value announced an undisclosed stake. But CRM stock is still far off highs and below its down-trending 50- and 200-day moving averages. The news comes just days after Starboard announced a nearly 5% stake in enterprise software firm **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)).


GS stock, which is still on a downtrend, gapped up close to its 50- and 200-day moving averages, rising 2.3%. A [Q3 earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-of-america-goldman-sachs-bank-of-new-york-mellon-q3-earnings-2022/) that showed a 22% jump in revenue was the catalyst.


Goldman Sachs is the fifth highest-weighted stock in the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)), which rallied 1.6%. Utilities also outperformed Tuesday, with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) up 1.8%.


The S&P 500 added 1.1% and the Russell 2000 small-cap index rallied 1.2%. Preliminary data showed higher volume on the NYSE. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by 2.5-1.


West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $82.82 a barrel, down 3.1%. The 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 4% at 4:45 p.m. ET.



Defense contractors outperformed in the S&P 500, helped by a strong earnings report from **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)). LMT stock soared 8.7%, while **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) and **L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) closed with gains of around 6% or more. A lesser known name in the group — **Huntington Ingalls** ([HII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HII)) — surged above its 50-day moving average, up 4.6%, as it forms a flat base with a 243.56 buy point.


Year-End Rally?
---------------


When the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed gains north of 2% in the morning, the session had the feel of a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) taking shape on the fourth day of the rally attempt. But the S&P 500's gain of 1.1% didn't qualify. That's fine, because you still have to look far and wide for actionable setups among leading stocks.


Even if we do see a follow-through day in coming days, proceed cautiously with new buys. If you're only 20% invested at this point, you might considering raising it up to 30% if a follow-through happens. But add exposure only if the stock market gives you good feedback with new buys.


A tradable rally between now and the end of the year is still possible, because the stock market still has weak sentiment working in its favor.


Last week, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers showed bullish sentiment at 25%, the lowest since early 2016. In March 2020, bullish sentiment was at 30.1% just before a powerful stock market rally. The weekly survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms. Just like excessively bearish sentiment has been seen at market bottoms in the past, wildly bullish sentiment has been seen at market tops in the past.



Another case for a tradable rally from here is the price action of the Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish ETF ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)). The fund came off its high with some volume starting on Sept. 28. It rallied in light volume for several days before another heavy-volume decline on Oct. 13. Price action has knocked UUP's Accumulation/Distribution Rating down to D. The ETF eased less than 0.1% as it holds just above the 21-day exponential moving average.


The stock market tends to like a weak dollar because it helps earnings at blue-chip firms that do business overseas.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**Booz Allen Hamilton** ([BAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAH)) was an outlier Tuesday as the consulting firm cleared a flat base with a 99.41 entry. Shares gapped up and rose 4.6%.  The only other legitimate breakout in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) came from **Sanmina** ([SANM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SANM)), which cleared a cup base in light turnover.



**Sarepta Therapeutics** ([SRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRPT)) rallied for the fifth time in six trading sessions. It's near the top of a flat base with a 120.33 entry.


IBD's biotech group currently ranks No. 5 out of 197 groups. Groups are ranked by six-month price performance. Other high-quality biotech stocks that continue to trade well in the current market include **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) and **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)).


Biogen is holding gains well after soaring 35% during the week ended Sept. 30. That's when the company, along with Japanese partner Eisai, said an experimental Alzheimer's drug slowed cognitive and functional decline in a large trial.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) shares fell 1.7% during the regular session, but soared 13% in extended trading after reporting [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-jumps-as-video-streamer-returns-to-subscriber-growth/). Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.2% in after-hours trading.


Results from **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are due Wednesday after the close.

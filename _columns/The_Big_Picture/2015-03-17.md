Indexes Reverse Positively, Build On Rebound
=============================================

The stock market bounced from session lows Tuesday in a new sign that last week's bottom could hold. The Nasdaq rose 0.2% after erasing a 0.5% morning loss. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), the composite's largest component, climbed nearly 2% on news that it is planning a TV subscription service.

  

The S&P 500 also pared losses, but still closed 0.3% lower.

  

The Russell 2000 rose 0.2%. The small-cap index helps confirm strength in growth stocks because so many of its components are faster-growing companies.

  

Volume rose on the Nasdaq, only the second time this month that the index has risen in higher volume. By comparison, this month the Nasdaq has been down four times in higher volume â€” i.e., distribution days. In short, institutions have been doing more selling than buying.

  

Trading slowed on the NYSE.

  

Advancing and declining stocks were nearly even.

  

Financial and transportation stocks were among the day's best. Air freight, mining and some media stocks lagged the most.

  

Indexes have been recovering since last week, while leading stocks have picked up some momentum.

  

But all this reconstruction work could go to waste if the market reacts badly to the next Fed policy announcement, due out Wednesday afternoon.

  

The market figures to be tense until the statement comes out.

  

Since last year, the central bank has been hinting that it will raise interest rates. With each new meeting, expectations (and fears) increase that a rate hike will be inked into the Fed's calendar.

  

Even as selling subsides, the market remains under pressure. The distribution days of the past few weeks point to apprehension among institutional investors.

  

Yet, the distribution hasn't spread to many leading stocks. Most of those are performing reasonably well.

  

The IBD 50 is up nearly 12% so far this year, far above the gains of the major indexes. The IBD 50 added 0.2% Tuesday.

  

That doesn't take away the need to be a good stock-picker. Relative few leaders have been runaway winners.

  

Moreover, there are plenty of leaders showing limited strength in recent rallies. **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) are examples of those.

  

Sometimes calm and tight price activity can be a plus, if done correctly. 

  

**Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), for instance, crafted a tight, shallow pattern for five weeks, then darted to new highs Monday.

  

The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is one indicator to watch. Two weeks ago, it was poised to climb past the peak notched at the end of last year. But the line has hooked downward.

  

After the close, earnings reports were mixed among some bellwether techs.

  

**Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) tumbled in extended trading after the software company's forecast for Q2 earnings sharply missed expectations. The stock closed the regular session up nearly 2% and near a new high.

  

But **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) rose on its earnings report for the February-ended quarter and news that the database-software giant will raise its dividend.

Stocks Find Their Stride, Thanks To A Calm China
=================================================

The stock market held onto sizable gains Thursday, as China refused to escalate the trade war and President Donald Trump said talks had resumed at "a different level."




The Nasdaq rose 1.5%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3% each. Small caps as gauged by the Russell 2000 surged 1.6%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed higher NYSE volume.


Bulls bought on the hint that a trade agreement was possible, but cooler heads noted that this scenario has played out before.

Stay Close To The Rules
-----------------------


For IBD-style investors, the way to play this market is to stay close to the rules. Breakouts can be bought with an uptrend under pressure, but investors should strive to keep risks low.


How might that be done?


First, losses should be cut as quickly as possible. If a stock shows weakness in price and volume, then you don't have to wait for the loss to grow to 7% or 8%. Get out early.


Second, start with a half position and only add shares if the initial purchase is working.


Third, individual investors should not buy a stock before it breaks out. No breakout is certain just because a base has formed. Wait for the stock to cross a buy point in exceptional volume.


Stocks That Gap Up Are Showing Muscle
-------------------------------------


Give special attention to [gap-ups](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/). The stock that opens above the ideal buy point is showing great strength.


On Thursday, a number of stocks gapped up. Several had high IBD ratings.


Cement and asphalt maker **CRH** ([CRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRH)) popped 3% in brisk volume. The large-cap stock is only 2% off a recent high.


In the electronics wholesale group, **Tech Data** ([TECD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECD)) jumped nearly 16% as it fell just short of its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Volume was heavy. Tech Data's earnings beat views by 16%.


Variety store chain **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) jumped 6%, retaking its 50-day and 200-day lines in busy volume. Recent earnings matched the Street's views. Company management said it was using price increases and would move production to other countries to counter tariffs.


Off-price retailer **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) vaulted 18%, clearing a long and rolling consolidation.


Discount retailer **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) gapped up 11%, clearing a cup without handle.


During the regular session, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) rose 2% in fast trade. The company reported quarterly results after the close, missing on earnings and offering weak guidance. [Ulta collapsed 22% in after-hours trade](https://www.investors.com/research/ulta-stock-sets-buy-point-ulta-beauty-earnings-q2-2019-due/).


Despite the bullish session, the stock indexes failed to climb above their 50-day moving averages. Until those lines are retaken and turned into support, bullish hopes remain restrained.


Economic Data
-------------


The second reading on Q2 GDP matched expectations for 2%. Real consumer spending quarter to quarter rolled in at 4.7%, easily topping the highest estimate in the range.


First-time jobless claims came in a bit more than expected. Claims hit 215,000 vs. views for 213,000.

The stock market ended a powerful week in an optimistic mood, rallying into the close as the strong dollar fell. Investors look to be rotating into a more aggressive stance.




The Nasdaq, which has been brought to its knees in 2022, fared best. It rose 1.9% for the day and ended with a weekly gain of over 8%. Crucially, it is now back above [the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). It remains down more than 28% for the year, however.


The S&P 500 managed to squeeze out a gain of 0.9% Friday, raising the weekly total to nearly 6%. The [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) now looks in reach after it climbed away from its 50-day line.


Blue chip stocks lagged the other major indexes following recent outperformance. Nevertheless, the Dow Jones Industrial Average still closed up 0.1% for the day and more than 4% for the week. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) were among the top performers.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index squeezed out a 0.8% advance while the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) edged up 0.3%.


Volume was down on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, no surprise given Thursday's massive volume. Breadth was solid in both exchanges, with advancers outnumbering decliners about 2-1.

With many near-term hurdles cleared, the stock market looks to be in a good position to rally, heading into the Thanksgiving holiday and beyond.


Weakening Dollar Bolsters Stock Market
--------------------------------------


The strong dollar has been a big headwind for the stock market, but signs of peak inflation have seen the currency fall in recent days.


Friday's weakness in the U.S. Dollar index extended a move that began Thursday amid cooler-than-expected U.S. consumer inflation data.


Many companies have seen their bottom lines hit due to expensive foreign exchange rates. If the dollar continues to weaken, it will conversely boost earnings for firms with foreign operations, bolstering their stock price.

These Stocks Shine, Struggle Amid Rotation
------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 [sectors were mixed,](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) with energy and communication services faring best. Health and utilities, more defensive areas, had the toughest time in Friday's stock market.


The daily performance of the IBD industry groups further underlined the point. Out of favor areas shined, with cable stocks, department stores, internet retailers and the **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX))-dominated leisure movies group shining.


On the downside, education software makers, insurance brokers and wholesale drug stocks suffered. Managed care stocks also fell, with industry behemoth **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) plunging 4% in high volume.

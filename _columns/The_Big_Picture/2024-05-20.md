The technology sector led the Nasdaq composite to another record high Monday, while a spate of breakouts among high-quality stocks gave the stock market more ammunition for buyers.




**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rose 0.5% to 2.5%. The heavy market caps of those stocks helped translate to a gain of nearly 0.7% for the Nasdaq.


Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) climbed 1.2%, the best performance among the S&P 500 sector indexes. In fact, the tech exchange traded fund is breaking out from a flat base.


The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq stocks, also took advantage of the tech rally, rising 0.7%.


But the S&P 500 — whose technology weighting is about half the Nasdaq's, or about 30% vs. 60% — climbed only 0.1%.


Financials hit the S&P hard. Notably in this sector, **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) slid 4.5% in heavy trading after Chief Executive Jamie Dimon [downplayed the chance of stock buybacks](https://www.investors.com/news/jpmorgan-stock-buy-zone-lifts-net-interest-income-forecast/) and suggested he may retire earlier than planned. Large and regional banks were broadly lower.


Excluding tech, the S&P 500 would have fallen also. ProShares S&P 500 Ex-Technology ETF ([SPXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPXT)) fell 0.4% Monday. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) fell 0.1%.


Stock Market Sees More Breakouts
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP052024.jpg)Breadth was mixed, as advancing stocks had a modest edge over decliners.


But what the stock market lacked in breadth, it made up in [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). More than a dozen higher-rated stocks climbed past buy points.


* **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)), the [best stock of 2023](https://www.investors.com/news/best-stocks-2023-nvidia-stock-among-magnificent-seven-stocks-listed/), broke out of a cuplike pattern with a 140.28 buy point.
* **Archrock** ([AROC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AROC)), which specializes in natural gas compression, broke out of a cup with handle.
* **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) edged above a 639 entry from a cup base, although it's a [late-stage pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/), which tend to do worse than early stage ones.
* **Wix.com** ([WIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WIX)) and **Hims & Hers Health** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)) made potent breakouts on earnings and a product launch, respectively.


Financial, travel and new issues also topped buy points. **Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)) closed above a 20.55 cup-base buy point. **Viking Holdings** ([VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)) emerged out of an initial public offering base less than three weeks since it held its IPO.


The longer-term breadth picture continues to improve. For about four weeks, the advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange have been largely if not entirely above their 10-day moving averages and trending higher.


Dow 40,000 And What It Means For The Markets
--------------------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a 0.5% drop Monday, and it's not conquering the 40,000 level with ease. The index, which closed above 40,000 for the first time on Friday, spent little time above that level Monday, ending at 39,806.


History shows crossing 40,000 is not just a psychological boost for the stock market, but a material one too. When the Dow topped each of its 5,000-point milestones, it climbed an average of 2.6% one month later, 4.3% three months later and 5.2% six months later.


Moreover, the Dow has always been higher one month after making a 5,000-point milestone, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The index was also higher 85.7% of the time three months later, and 71.4% six months later. When the Dow makes a 10,000 milestone like it did Friday, it has always been higher one, three and six months later. The average gains in those periods are 4.3%, 6.4% and 8.1%.


In other key indexes, the Russell 2000 rose 0.3%. The IBD 50 added 1%. Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq from Friday's levels.


Stock Market Complacent?
------------------------


Is the stock market getting too complacent? A look at the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) may have you believing it is. The VIX closed at 12.15, one session after it closed below 12 for the first time since November 2019.


But Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research and an expert on the VIX, says the so-called stock market fear gauge is not yet at statistically unusual levels.


"The upshot here is that every U.S. equity bull market sees the VIX close below 12.0 hundreds of times: 243 days from 1992-1995, 247 days from 2004-2007, and 308 days from 2013-2019," he wrote in a report. "The first sub-12.0 reading is just the beginning; there is never just one. Moreover, every period noted in the chart is a classic "mid-cycle market," one where annual stock market returns are almost uniformly positive."

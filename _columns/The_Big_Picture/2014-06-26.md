Nasdaq Shaves Early Losses, Narrows Gap With S&P 500
=====================================================

When the stock market can virtually wipe away considerable opening losses by the day's finish, it augurs well for the bulls. That's essentially what happened Thursday.


Premier growth stocks did especially well. The IBD 50 rose 0.2%.


The major indexes almost completely reversed the damage that took place in the first 20 minutes of trade. Volume thinned on both the Nasdaq and the Big Board, another sign that the sellers lacked teeth.


The Nasdaq composite chopped an early 0.7% decline down to less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 did the same, going from an early decline of nearly 0.8% to down just 0.1%. The Russell 2000 edged 0.2% lower.


When the major market indexes pull back in lighter trade, they indicate that pension funds, hedge funds, banks and mutual funds are generally reluctant to give up stock. They see value in holding stocks vs. loading up in gold, real estate or bonds.


U.S. Treasury bonds continue to give puny gains. The heavily traded **SPDR Gold Trust** ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) ETF has shown some pep lately, but at 126.72, it's still 32% off its 2011 peak of 185.85.


The Nasdaq's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is narrowing. While the former is lagging by more than a full percentage point in year-to-date gains, the difference is nearly inconsequential in the current quarter. Since April 1, the Nasdaq is up 4.3%, just slightly lagging the 500's 4.5% advance.


It's still not easy to beat the market. Sector rotation remains actively in play. Without looking at Page B11 in today's paper, can you guess which sector ranks last among 33 IBD broad sectors?


Yes, it's hard to believe, but software is dead last in performance. This sector is obviously too big and too important for professional money managers to ignore.


Interestingly, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) has proved its mettle with outstanding fundamentals and technicals. On the IBD [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) since May 28, Palo Alto has done well and is leading the next generation of firewall security software.


While this week's dose of data proves that the U.S. economic recovery is still piecemeal, it hasn't stopped the institutional crowd from focusing on high-growth plays. In fact, as the IBD Value Funds Vs. Growth Funds chart (today on A12) shows, value has been a stark underperformer since the end of April.


Still, one must be choosy. Solid profit growth is important but remains only part of the picture. Homebuilders have been putting some hefty increases in sales and earnings. Yet the group has failed to catch fire. **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) (RS 58, C+ Accumulation/Distribution) stumbled with a 20-cent loss to 41.32 Thursday despite posting good top- and bottom-line growth.

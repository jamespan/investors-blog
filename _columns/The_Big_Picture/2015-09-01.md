Stocks Plunge, Wiping Out Much Of Rebound
==========================================

The stock market suffered a relapse Tuesday, as sellers returned in droves. The Nasdaq plunged 2.9% and the S&P 500 3%. Both closed near session lows, and roughly two-thirds of last week's three-day rally has been erased.

  

The week before Labor Day may be traditionally slow on Wall Street, but that didn't keep sellers from swarming: Volume was sharply higher.

  

Declining stocks topped advancers by a more than 6-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq. The energy sector returned to its losing ways after crude prices skidded about 8%. Plastics, auto, machinery and other cyclicals were among the day's worst performers.

  

Chip stocks also lagged. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 3.4%.

  

This week's slide in the major indexes has diminished hopes that the Aug. 20-25 sell-off would be short lived and nothing more than the machinations of program trading.

  

Leading stocks paint a market in need of catharsis.

  

The average IBD 50 stock is more than 12% below its prior high, and many of those charts look like they haven't yet formed the lows of their patterns.

  

To be sure, the rout and quick rebound on Aug. 24 skewed many charts. Thus, the lows generated that frightful day are not as significant as the day's closing prices, something that needs to be factored into the chart analysis.

  

Still, no breakouts seem imminent among the leaders. The IBD 50 fell 2.5% Tuesday, the second-straight drop of 2% or more.

  

Some institutional favorites faltered. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) gapped below its 50-day moving average in active trading on news of potential competition from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).

  

**Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) gapped down to the lowest level since January after the discount chain missed sales expectations for the July-ended quarter.

  

By now, growth investors should have little or no exposure to stocks.

  

Regardless of how far indexes will sink, there's no other prudent course than to seek shelter in cash.

  

Brokers' yields on cash investments may not be enticing, but they're better than losing 5%, 10% or more on futile stock purchases.

  

Sharp declines tend to draw bargain hunters, and another snap-back could be in the cards. But it would be foolish to buy on impulse while the market remains so volatile.

  

Last week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were in range of a bullish follow-through signal, but it didn't quite happen. The fact there was no follow-through served as a valuable indicator, as this week's losses have shown.

  

The Nasdaq gapped lower at Tuesday's open on news that China's economic troubles are deepening. A new manufacturing report showed that sector contracted in August.

  

Then, another report showed the U.S. economy also under stress: The Institute of Supply Management index fell 1.6 points to 51.1, the lowest since May 2013. (See [China Slowdown Spreads To U.S., Testing Fed's Resolve](http://news.investors.com/technology/090115-769161-federal-reserve-rate-hike-tested-by-china-us-factories.htm).)

  

With question marks about the two largest economies in the world, the Federal Reserve's next move is clouded. A rate increase that many expected to occur this month now seems less likely. That's adding uncertainty to the stock market.

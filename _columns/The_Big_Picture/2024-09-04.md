  Stocks Fall Again, But Modestly; This Signal Holds Clues On Market's Outlook

Major indexes remained wobbly Wednesday, although the stock market made a stand at a critical level that will help determine its course.




A day after the stock market suffered its worst day since Aug. 5 and the worst start to any month since the spring of 2020, buyers remained absent. Yet, there was nothing like the wave of selling that hit Wall Street Tuesday.


Indexes were higher until about 11 a.m. ET Wednesday, when sellers started to resurface. Then the market trended lower the rest of the session. The Nasdaq composite closed 0.3% lower and the S&P 500 fell 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, managed to edge up 0.1%.


Market statistics also showed seller exhaustion, for now. Volume fell on both major exchanges. Declining stocks topped advancers by a 6-5 ratio on the Nasdaq but winners edged out losers on the New York Stock Exchange, according to FactSet.


While comparisons to the start of August seem apt, the market so far is not exactly echoing that rout. Back then, the Nasdaq fell 4.7% in two days. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq's two-day loss is not quite 3.6%.


The S&P 500 is down 2.3% this week, which is better than its 3.2% drop in the first two sessions of August. Granted, the early-August crunch took three days, in which the S&P 500 slid more than 6%. So it's a bit early to draw comparisons.


Was Stock Market Due For Drop?
------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP090424.jpg)This week's losses present another talking point: The market's August rebound lacked strong volume, and indexes rolled over as soon as they hit significant levels. The S&P peaked last week when it neared prior highs. The Nasdaq could not penetrate the 18,000 price level. And the Dow backed off after making record highs Thursday and Friday.


For now, the S&P 500 holds the key to the stock market's immediate outlook. It closed just above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) for a second straight day. A clear drop below that level would surely worsen the outlook for stocks.


Small caps face a test of their own as the Russell 2000 sits right at the 50-day moving average. The index fell 0.2% Wednesday.


Picture Among Stock Market Leaders
----------------------------------


Despite the fact that some are damaged, many growth leaders are holding up. The IBD 50 index rose 0.1% Wednesday and is finding support at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). Bellwethers such as **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) found support at the 50-day moving averages.


But **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), arguably the current market's most consequential stock, fell further below its 50-day line. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) [closed below its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-dow-jones-stock/) for the first time since Aug. 8. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are testing their 200-day lines, while Tesla faces resistance at its 50-day line.


IBD continues to recommend 40% to 60% exposure to stocks, mindful that the important technology sector is under pressure. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) is down 4.8% so far this week, more than double most other S&P sectors.


Economically sensitive sectors such as energy (down 3.8%), industrials (down 2.1%) and materials (off 2.7%) have also been hit this week.


Economic Data And The Market
----------------------------


A couple of months ago, weak economic data was a boost for stocks. The thinking was that if the economy slows enough, the Fed will have more reason to start cutting interest rates. Now that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has essentially committed to a rate cut this month, the stock market's thinking has shifted: How big a rate cut? And is the economy slowing too much?


Weak manufacturing data sparked Tuesday's market sell-off, and on Wednesday a report showed the pool of job openings shrinking. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey report fell to the lowest level since January 2021, to 7.7 million in July, the Labor Department said. Economists [expected 8.1 million openings](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=596029&year=2024&lid=0#top).


Factory orders, however, [climbed 5% in July](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=591593&year=2024&lid=0#top), rebounding from a decline in June and beating forecasts.


Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says slowing economic growth boosts recession worries and rate-cut expectations. Rate cut expectations, in turn, favor a sector rotation from highly valued big techs toward nontech sectors.

"But the expectation of (a) jumbo rate cut is bad for all stocks, regardless of their technology exposure," Ozkardeskaya said. "Bad news is bad news for everyone."


Historically, September is the worst month for the stock market. The S&P falls an average of 0.7% and the Nasdaq an average of 0.9% in September, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. The Russell 2000 also falls 0.7% on average and the Dow 0.8%. However, the average losses are smaller during election years, from 0.4% to 0.5%.


The longer-term outlook is more favorable. From Labor Day to the end of the year, the S&P rises 70% of the time and on average gains 2.8% over that period, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq climbs 68% of the time and climbs an average 3.4%. The Dow moves up 72% of the time and adds 2.7% on average.

  Stock Market Bounces As 50-Day Moving Average, Trend Lines Provide Clues

After stepping in mud Friday, the stock market was able to wipe away much of the muck with a promising rebound Monday. The next move will be an important indication of where the market goes from here.




The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.3%, erasing most of Friday's 1.6% tumble. A trend line touching index lows since the October bottom was slightly penetrated on Friday, but the composite closed back above it Monday. One negative is the index's advance-decline line, which hooked sharply lower the past two weeks.


On the positive side, Monday's action revealed a nearly 2-1 margin between winning stocks and losers on the Nasdaq.


The S&P 500 bounced 0.7% and made up a smaller chunk of the Friday sell-off. Unlike the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 is sitting below a trend line along its four-month lows. Still, the S&P 500 is finding support at the 50-day moving average. Its behavior at this line also is important to watch.

If the index can continue to rebound from that level, it will be a good sign for the stock market's next step. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly climbed back above its 50-day line after ending Friday just below it.


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq. It would have been better if Monday's bounce had come in higher volume, which would indicate a larger buying appetite. For now, the stock market will take what it can.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP020320-236x300.jpg)So far, the market's pullback has been more a normal pause than a total breakdown. A long-term upward trend remains in place. After Friday's slide, IBD's market outlook went to "uptrend under pressure" partly because the market was looking too hot even before the coronavirus contagion fears. That market status should put investors on guard to limit their exposure to stocks.


One good element of the current market is that most leading stocks are still performing well. The IBD 50 outperformed the general market with a 1.5% increase Monday. With that, [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) erased most of Friday's drop. A half-dozen stocks in the index rose more than 3%.


The main worry for global stocks remains the deadly coronavirus. Its spread is forcing the closing of stores and commerce in parts of China and other business hubs. Oil and gas stocks are reflecting worries of a recession, and one that could ripple beyond China.


The price of U.S. crude oil slid below $50 a barrel Monday before closing at $50.11 a barrel. The energy sector is ranked dead last among [33 sectors that IBD tracks](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jan-31-2020/). The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) undercut its December 2018 previous low and touched the lowest price since January 2016.


Manufacturing Report Lifts Stock Market
---------------------------------------


U.S. indexes unexpectedly climbed at the open, then got a boost at 10 a.m. ET with a strong report on manufacturing. The [U.S. manufacturing ISM](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) rose for the first time since October and topped forecasts. All of the report's key components provided support, Jennifer Lee, an economist with BMO Capital Markets Economic Research, said in a report. New orders returned to the 50 level, to an eight-month high of 52. That's a positive indicator of future activity.


Risks for Wall Street aren't limited to coronavirus. The Iowa caucuses are Monday night, and investors will be watching, especially the performance of progressive candidates who are railing against Wall Street.



More urgently, earnings reports continue to be filed at a busy pace. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) earnings came after the close, and the stock fell as much as 5% in extended hours trading. The parent of Google beat profit expectations but its [fourth-quarter sales missed estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-googl-stock-q42019/).


Alphabet is one of the largest stocks, so its performance will undoubtedly impact the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in Tuesday's trading. The stock is extended from a [pullback to the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) at the beginning of the year, and its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit new highs before the earnings report.

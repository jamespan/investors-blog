The Nasdaq made a record high Tuesday as it extended an already stretched advance.


The composite closed 0.3% higher, although it had been up as much as 0.6%. The S&P 500 climbed 0.2% as it too trimmed gains. It came just shy of making its own record high. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.7% increase.


Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 gapped up at the open but closed in the lower regions of the day's price range. That gave the day a stalling look, although it didn't result in a new distribution day. In fact, the Nasdaq's July 19 distribution day was scratched off because it is too old to be relevant any longer.


Volume rose on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq. Breadth continued to be positive: Winners topped losers by roughly 2 to 1 across the board.


![MP082316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP082316-173x300.jpg)With the Nasdaq up the past eight weeks in a row, it's hard to imagine its rally continuing even longer. No one can tell if a correction is at hand, but at least a pullback should be expected. That doesn't necessarily mean it's time to cut back on exposure to stocks. Rather, be careful about increasing it, and consider taking some profits.


Despite the Nasdaq's record, the index's eight-week advance keeps slowing. Both broad indexes have moderated, and leading stocks have little to show. Predominantly, it's been earnings and buyout news that have triggered the big price moves. Absent those, many leaders haven't capitalized on the broad market's gains and in numerous cases faded soon after the headlines came out.


The IBD 50, nonetheless, has kept abreast of the Nasdaq since the June 27 lows. Both are up about 15%. The IBD 50 rose 0.7% Tuesday, outperforming the market. **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) was its star stock, gapping up nearly 7% on news of a pact with **Delphi Automotive** ([DLPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLPH)) to develop technology for self-driving cars.


Sector movements influenced much of the day's proceedings.


Homebuilding, construction and mortgage stocks rallied after new-home sales soared 31.3% in July, hitting a new post-recession high that surpassed expectations.


**Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) soared 9% in big volume. The luxury homebuilder matched earnings estimates in its report and edged past revenue expectations. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) jumped back above the 32.20 buy point of a pattern it cleared initially on July 6. **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) climbed 5% after finding support at the 50-day moving average.


IBD's mortgage industry group rose 1.7% as IBD 50 member **LendingTree** ([TREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREE)) jumped nearly 5% and reclaimed a 104.36 buy point.


Retail also was strong after electronics chain **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) beat expectations. The company's results gave hope to brick-and-mortar chains that are threatened by online competition. Best Buy shares surged nearly 20% to the highest level since March 2015.


But health care, food and metals stocks generally were weaker.


**ResMed** ([RMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMD)) fell 3.5% in more than triple its average volume after Jefferies downgraded the medical devices maker to underperform from hold. **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)) fell 1%. Both are recovering from long price declines. ****Surgical Care Affiliates**** ([SCAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCAI)) reversed lower as support failed to materialize at the 200-day moving average. A July breakout for the operator of day-surgery centers has failed.


In the food sector, **J.M. Smucker** ([SJM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SJM)) collapsed below its 50-day line in heavy volume after it cut its sales forecast for 2016.

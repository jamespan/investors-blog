The stock market kicked off the second quarter on shaky ground Wednesday as Wall Street pondered another Federal Reserve policy statement and more earnings reports. Apple was one of many top stocks that jumped on earnings.




Selling in the stock market picked up during the final hour of trading as indexes reversed lower. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) gapped up on better-than-expected [earnings and guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-q2-earnings-beat/), but the stock's gain of nearly 5% wasn't much help to the Dow Jones industrials. The blue-chip index lost 0.6%.


The Nasdaq composite also gave back 0.6% as software names in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) sold off, such as **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), **Zendesk** ([ZEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEN)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)). The S&P 500 slumped nearly 0.8% and the Russell 2000 small-cap index lost 0.9%.

Nasdaq volume rose from Tuesday's level, resulting in the index's second straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE close to Tuesday's level.


All Eyes On The Fed
-------------------


As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its key lending rate unchanged at 2.25% to 2.50%. The [statement](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-may-2019-rate-cut-dow-jones/) was generally regarded as dovish as the Fed once again cited a strong labor market with low inflation. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also said that low inflation is likely "transitory." The market took that to mean that a rate hike is more likely than a rate cut at this point. And that brought sellers into the stock market.


President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the Fed should cut rates by 100 basis points and also called for more quantitative easing to keep rates low. The stock market has liked the sound of a dovish Fed in recent weeks, but first-quarter GDP data released Friday surprised to the upside, clocking 3.2% growth. That gave inflation hawks something to talk about, although inflation is not an immediate concern for the Fed. Earlier this week, the core personal consumption expenditures index came it at 1.6%, below the Fed's target of 2%.


In economic data Wednesday, the latest data from ADP showed private payrolls up 275,000 in April, well ahead of the consensus estimate of 180,000. The data came ahead of Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up 180,000.


Ahead of the Fed statement, the 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 2.48%, down 3 basis points. Around 5 p.m. ET, it was at 2.50%.


Top Stocks On The Move
----------------------


Among the FANG stocks, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) reclaimed a 379.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) early, but gains faded. Netflix closed in the bottom half of its intraday range, up 2% to 378.81.


China-based **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), meanwhile, topped an alternate handle entry of 189.89. But it also faded late and closed below the entry.


Three stocks that broke out and held gains on earnings were **Timken** ([TKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TKR)), **Harris** ([HRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRS)) and **Royal Caribbean Cruises** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)).


With the market still in a confirmed uptrend, it still makes sense to target stocks breaking out of bases. But for growth investors, the environment is getting more challenging as some leaders are showing hesitant action after breakouts.


For example, Twilio's breakout attempt Wednesday looked good for a while, but the stock reversed sharply lower in heavy volume.


IPO Market
----------


**Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) cleared a short [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) early in the session, but gains faded. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock is just below the 74.27 buy point.


Another recent new issue, **Jumia Technologies** ([JMIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JMIA)), held up well Wednesday as it is works on an IPO base with a 49.87 entry.

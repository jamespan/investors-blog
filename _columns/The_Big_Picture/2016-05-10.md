Stock market skeptics who thought that this latest market uptrend lost its footing might want to reconsider their position.


Bullish buyers knocked down the bears on Tuesday as the Nasdaq composite regained some of its leadership composure, thanks in big part to one of its heavyweights, IBD Leaderboard member **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).

Investors appeared to also like the morsels of better-than-expected data on the U.S. economy, including a rise in sentiment among small businesses surveyed by the NFIB, a jump in the Jolts survey of job openings, and a pickup in retail sales last week as tracked by the Redbook survey.


The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 rode shotgun, with gains of nearly 1.3%. The Nasdaq 100, reflecting the action of the 100 biggest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq exchange, rose 1.4%. Small caps trailed. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.8%, but the Russell 2000 hopped 1% higher.


Volume was mixed. While NYSE trade fell, it rose sharply on the Nasdaq, which has sort of been a subtle trend since the start of the second quarter. Among the 11 up sessions since April 1, a surprising seven of those daily gains saw an increase in volume vs. the prior day.


That may seem unusual in the face of a barrage of professional selling in recent weeks. Yet the April 5 distribution day, in which the Nasdaq composite dropped 1% in higher volume, expired on time.


Make no mistake: The distribution-day count is still disturbingly high, with eight on the Nasdaq and six on the S&P 500. However, other factors seem to indicate that the market is not yet ready to roll over.


First, the S&P 500 is acting just the way you'd want following Friday's test of buying support at the 50-day moving average. The large-cap index continues to keep a nice air pocket above the longer-term 200-day line. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, at nearly 4810 finished within spitting distance of reclaiming its critical 50-day line.


Second, the NYSE advance-decline line, which plots the difference between rising stocks and falling ones, got a big boost on Tuesday as winners dwarfed losers by a more than 3-1 margin. Such positive action has kept this A-D line (see it on the General Market Indicators page via the link at the bottom of this column) on course for a 13-week-long uptrend, despite a flattening of the line in recent days.


On the Nasdaq, advancers beat decliners by an almost 2-1 ratio.


More rising stocks mean more stocks are hitting new highs across a wide band of industries. Joining Amazon in the new highs Tuesday were **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), F-35 fighter jet maker **Lockheed-Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), shopping mall REIT **Simon Property Group** ([SPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPG)), missile maker **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)), Corona beer and spirits giant **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)), and road construction materials play **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)).


All of these companies are experiencing the N in IBD's [CAN SLIM investment paradigm](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749), and the N stands for "new." New food menus, new military threats across the globe, a new zest for dividends, new consumer tastes, and new funds for ailing U.S. roads are all helping to fuel these and other emerging winners of 2016.


Vulcan is a new member of [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), which saw nine stocks rise 1% or more on Wednesday. When leading stocks rise in tandem with the major averages, it's a positive sign for the long-only investor. In contrast, the [Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/) has just two names on the "Short Sales list," which are struggling to make money for the shorts.

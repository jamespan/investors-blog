  Fed's Measures Fail To Stop Selling; What Needs To Happen In Stocks

The stock market made new lows for its coronavirus correction Monday, dashing hopes for a [market bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/). The Federal Reserve's latest steps to shore up the economy were drastic but failed to stanch the selling.




Also, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite undercut last Wednesday's lows. So the brief advance that began that day is now all gone, and the market is back to square one.


The first day of the latest rally attempt technically was Thursday, when the two indexes closed higher. But it was the previous day that truly set the floor for the rally attempt. Either way, indexes just went further south.


While it was another day of broad losses — declining stocks led advancers by 13 to 4 on the NYSE — the Nasdaq fared considerably better. The composite closed only 0.3% lower and above last week's low. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, by contrast, slid 2.9% and 3%; both were significantly below last week's lows.

The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)), which tracks the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, jumped 3.6%. The ETF and its sister index are working on a possible bottom.


Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index, closed about 0.1% lower but inched up in extended-hours trading. Some heavyweight Nasdaq components such as **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are still showing or trying to find a pulse. If the market can find a bottom, [stocks showing relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) could be the ones to lead it out of the abyss.


But for now, the [coronavirus crisis continues to deepen](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/), and the stock market is not responding to medication.


Federal Reserve said Monday it will [buy an unlimited amount of Treasuries and mortgage securities](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-qe-smashes-record-coronavirus-stock-market-crash/) via quantitative easing to battle an expected recession. The Fed also announced plans to support the flow of credit to businesses, governments and individual borrowers. A credit crunch is adding stress to financial markets.


Congress Frustrates Stock Market
--------------------------------


But a bill in Congress with massive sums of economic aid remained stalled. By late Monday, lawmakers struggled to get past a procedural vote. In U.S. hospitals, the [number of Covid-19 patients](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) continues to swell, topping 33,000 with 400 fatalities according to the Centers for Disease Control.


Utilities were rocked and are not providing investors with much help, as investors find no solace in dividends. The Dow utilities average plunged 5.5% Monday. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) is down nearly 28% this month alone.


Some pockets of strength are in stocks that happen to find themselves part of the new coronavirus economy. Video game companies **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) and **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)) were among Monday's leaders up in volume, as the Market Pulse table shows. Pizza delivery is the choice for diners shut out of restaurants. **Domino's** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) is in the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watchlist. **Casey's General Stores** ([CASY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CASY)) does pizza delivery and is in favor with Wall Street.


What Needs To Happen Next
-------------------------


Many growth stocks are now in the sixth week of their price corrections. Once consolidations reach six or seven full weeks, [proper bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) start to form, and you can look for [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But keep in mind that no buy area is good until the bear market can end. Investors must wait for a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to confirm a new rally, and we haven't even started with a new rally attempt. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq need to not only make a low, but more importantly a follow-through, which could happen as few as four days from the low. In the meantime, be patient.


Health care companies are rushing to develop tests, cures and vaccines for Covid-19. **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) says its system [can no longer fulfill most compassionate-use requests](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-treatment-gilead-suspends-compassion-use-access/) for its experimental coronavirus treatment, remdesivir. Gilead says it's working out an expanded access program for remdesivir. It won't accept new individual requests for compassionate access to the drug in the meantime.

It's been said that America would be better off if leaders spent more time in places like Wyoming and less in Washington, D.C.




If so, the stock market didn't get the memo Thursday. As the Federal Reserve and its international counterparts from more than 40 countries convened for the economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the stock indexes stepped down.


The Nasdaq and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average each trimmed 0.1%, while the S&P 500 closed down 0.2%. The small cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 0.3% advance.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


That slapped the S&P 500 with a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), bringing its count up to six. A distribution day involves a loss in rising volume in a major index. Distribution points to institutional selling.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP_9x6_082417-215x300.png)The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are back to battling at their 50-day moving averages, a condition bulls hoped was over when IBD changed its market outlook to confirmed uptrend.


Still, the bears haven't been able to gain consistent control of the stock market this year.


If the action at times seems like a table-tennis game, the bulls are the ones putting the spin on the ball. The Nasdaq is up 17% this year and the S&P 500 9%, leaving the bears confident only in select sectors.


Going into Thursday's session, the energy sector was down 12% for the year and the savings and loans sector was off 17%. The metals and bank sectors were down about 5% each.


Most everything else has belonged to the bulls. Even the retail sector, which is supposed to be dead, has lumbered forward like a zombie for an almost 7% gain this year.



In Thursday's session, retail found a live wire. **Guess** ([GES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GES)) zoomed 19%. Other big gainers in retail included **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)), up 17%; jewelry chain **Signet** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)), up nearly 17%; retail jeweler **Fossil** ([FOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOSL)), up 10%; crafts store chain **Michaels** ([MIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIK)), up 8.5%; and sporting goods chain **Hibbett Sports** ([HIBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIBB)), up 6%.


Most of the gains were related to significant earnings beats, a welcome sign to the beaten-down retail stocks.



As if to mock the bears, the lowly rated metals sector (No. 30 among 33 sectors as of Thursday's open) is perking up. Recent breakouts or moves toward buy points include **Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)), **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)), **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)), **Mesabi Trust** ([MSB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSB)) and **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)).


The impressive element for these metals stocks is that each has a Composite Rating of 91 or higher. A rating of 91 puts the stock in the top 9% of all the stocks in IBD's database. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.


Does the strength — in what has been the bears' turf this year — bode well for the overall market? The best way to answer that question is not to answer it: Let the market itself supply the answer. A strong up day in heavy volume would build confidence in the bulls' camp.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims were about 1% under the consensus estimate.


Existing homes sales for July missed the target by 2%. Homebuilder stocks were mostly down but not aggressively so.


But the iShares U.S. Home Construction ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) exchange-traded fund has dropped about 3% under its 50-day line. The ETF lost the line about a week ago. This represents its first violation since a breakout Jan. 25.


Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is expected to speak Friday. The speech will begin at 10 a.m. ET, which is about a half-hour after the market's open.


Also on Friday's agenda is the durable goods report for July. The Street expects a 5.8% drop. The range of estimates runs from down 8.3% to down 1.9%.

Indexes ended squarely lower Thursday as the stock market pulled back on another hotter-than-expected inflation report.




Ahead of Thursday's market open, the Labor Department said the [overall consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/core-cpi-inflation-eases-but-services-prices-are-hot-sp-500-futures-rise/) rose 0.4% on the month, above 0.3% forecasts. The 12-month CPI inflation rate held at 3.7%. Economists had expected the inflation rate to dip to 3.6%.


The core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3% vs. August levels, matching forecasts. However, the annual core inflation rate eased to 4.1% from 4.3% in August, undercutting estimates of 4.2%. The core CPI inflation rate peaked at a 40-year-high 6.6% in September 2022.


The 10-year Treasury yield settled squarely higher Thursday, ticking up to 4.71%, snapping back from two straight days of losses.


Meanwhile, third-quarter earnings season kicks off Friday, with results due from **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), as well as banking giants **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)).


Amid the nascent stock market uptrend, [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) and **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) are stocks to buy and watch in [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?).

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, indexes closed well off session lows, but still finished solidly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite also declined 0.6%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 2.2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP101223-250x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the New York Stock Exchange compared with Wednesday's session. That gives the young stock market uptrend its first distribution day. That's one for the Nasdaq and one for the S&P 500.


For the Dow, **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) was the best performer Thursday, surging 7% after the company's earnings results. Still, shares remain more than 40% off their 52-week high.


Top growth stocks followed the market trend lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 1.7% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) jumped nearly 2% Thursday, hitting a new high before backing off a bit by the close.


What To Do Now: Nasdaq At Key Level
-----------------------------------


Following Friday's follow-through day, the major stock indexes look to continue their trudge higher. While Thursday's losses ended the Nasdaq's four-day win streak, investors still have the greenlight for new purchases, with a recommended exposure level of 20%-40%.


The Nasdaq faces a key test of resistance around its 50-day line. A decisive retake would be bullish for the uptrend, while further weakness would indicate a need to reduce exposure.


Meanwhile, two useful [IBD MarketSmith lists](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) to check right now are "Breaking Out Today" and "Near Pivot." The latter shows stocks nearing buy points in bases, and the other flags stocks rising past buy points during the session.

Stock Market Leaders: Arista, DraftKings, Uber
----------------------------------------------



Some stocks are approaching new buy points during the new market uptrend and should be followed closely.


One is Arista, which ended a tw0-day pullback Thursday, rising 0.6%. A bullish rebound from the 50-day line in recent sessions placed the stock in a new buy area. Meanwhile, shares are just shy of a 198.70 buy point out of a flat base. ANET reports third-quarter results Oct. 30.


Another is [Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/draftkings-stock-flirts-with-new-buy-signal-after-167-percent-rally-on-sports-betting-boom/), DraftKings. It slid more than 4% Thursday, ending a two-day rally. On Wednesday, shares flirted with a downward-sloping trendline but backed off along with the broader market. Investors could use Wednesday's high of 31.10 as a trigger point, still close to the 50-day. Investors also could use 32.65 as another early entry.


Finally, [Uber Technologies](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/uber-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-just-flashed-this-bullish-signal/) is in a flat base and nearing a 49.49 buy point, with a bounce from its 50-day line offering a potential early entry point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Tuesday's high at 47.28 is an early entry for aggressive investors.

The stock market dived Thursday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite broke down below its 50-day moving average. Recent breakouts **Array Technologies** ([ARRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRY)), former [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) and **Lattice Semiconductor** ([LSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSCC)) have already faltered, another sign of deteriorating market conditions.




Jobless Claims, Retail Sales Fall
---------------------------------


The Labor Department reported that first-time jobless claims fell to 211,000 vs. 230,000 the prior week. The report pointed to a job market perhaps too resilient for the Fed's taste. Other economic data included the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey for December, and the Commerce Department's [U.S. retail sales](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-economy-retail-sales-november-2022-11671059629) for November.


The Philly Fed Index improved to -13.8 in December, still in a contraction, vs. -19.4 in the previous month. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales missed estimates, falling 0.6% in November following October's 1.3% rise.


The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 3.45% Thursday, headed back toward its December lows.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.2% and the S&P 500 declined 2.5%. While the S&P 500 remains above its 50-day line, it fell below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and to its lowest level since Nov. 10.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP121522_2-238x300.jpg)The Nasdaq plunged 3.2%, breaking below its 50-day line. The tech-heavy composite had held above that line since Nov. 10, and Thursday's breach was a bearish signal. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 2.5% and also went below its 50-day line.


Volume edged higher on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, and appeared to be lower on the NYSE. The rise in volume means the Nasdaq added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Amid this week's mounting losses, and the Nasdaq's breach of its 50-day line, IBD lowered its stock [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) from "confirmed uptrend" to an "uptrend under pressure." That means investors should be cutting back their already reduced exposure. It's clear that defense is the priority over buying breakouts in the current market.


Still, it's a good time to find out which stocks will shrug off the stock market volatility. As IBD readers know, stocks that hold up the best during weak markets can become big winners in the future when the market turns around.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost nearly 3% Thursday, as the ETF hit a six-year low. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), homebuilders **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) and **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) were rare bright spots in the aftermath of **Lennar**'s ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) earnings report. Lennar reversed from early losses to rally nearly 4%. Meritage climbed 2.6% and Pulte shares rose 1.6%.


Chip Stocks Drop On Oversupply Worries
--------------------------------------


Chip stocks tumbled Thursday amid [warnings of industry oversupply](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/wdc-stock-western-digital-micron-nvidia-fall-on-chip-glut-amid-recession-fears/). **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) dropped 4.1% after HSBC initiated coverage with a reduce rating, citing a short-term chip inventory correction and demand uncertainty.


**Western Digital** ([WDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC)) sold off more than 10% after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to sell, warning of a looming oversupply in memory-chip markets. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) lost 3.5%, and is now testing its 50-day line.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) [plunged 8.6% after a report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-drops-as-streaming-service-disappoints-nflx/) said the streaming giant's ad-supported video streaming service isn't building a big enough audience to satisfy spending from marketing executives. The company is falling short of ad-supported viewership guarantees made to advertisers, allowing them to take their money back for ads that have yet to run, according to a report from Digiday.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) touched a new 52-week low Thursday before reversing slightly higher after CEO Elon Musk [disclosed share sales](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-sold-more-than-3-5-billion-worth-of-tesla-shares-11671071099) worth more than $3.5 billion this week.

3 Faltering Breakouts To Watch: Array, Celsius, Lattice
-------------------------------------------------------


Solar leader Array Technologies hit the [7% sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a cup with handle's 23.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), just one day after a strong promising breakout.


Energy drink maker Celsius dived 7.7%, again triggering the 7% loss rule from a cup base's 118.29 buy point. Thursday's weak action resulted in the stock's removal from [IBD Leaderboard.](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard)


Chip leader Lattice Semiconductor fell sharply for a second straight day, dropping further below a cup with handle's 73.63 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). During Tuesday's breakout, volume was noticeable light, indicating a lack of institutional demand.

Stocks Extend Rebound As Market Risk Suddenly Eases; 3 Reasons For Caution
===========================================================================

After rebounding for two days, the stock market finds itself on better footing, and investors can breathe a little easier.




The S&P 500 rallied 1.4% Tuesday, adding to Monday's 1.6% charge. The Nasdaq composite added 1.6% and is up more than 4% so far for the week.


Both indexes found support at critical levels. The Nasdaq bounced after pulling back to its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The S&P 500 saw similar support, but at a different gauge: the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 on Tuesday made it back above its 21-day line, too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6% also.


With market signals quickly improving, IBD's market outlook was moved to "uptrend resumes." This means investors should resume buying quality stocks in proper buy areas and generally maintain a high level of market exposure.

Stock Market Breakouts, Buy Zones
---------------------------------


As if to encourage buyers, a few more high-quality stock broke out past buy points Tuesday.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) rose past the 375.10 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) in double the average volume. A Credit Suisse analyst gave bullish comments on the cybersecurity company. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), a longtime [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock, broke out of a flat base with a 566.84 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


A number of IBD 50 stocks are rising from [support at the 10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), another type of buy area. Those include **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)), **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) and **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)), [today's IBD 50 Stocks to Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/vipshop-stock-chinese-online-retailer-offers-buying-opportunity-amid-powerful-run/).


The IBD 50 jumped 2.1% Tuesday, outperforming the broad stock market.


While the stock market now has a better look and feel, three reasons should keep investors from going overboard buying stocks.


Three Reasons For Stock Market Caution
--------------------------------------


First, the Nasdaq is still looking a bit extended. The composite closed Tuesday 6.5% above its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq has a tendency to pull back whenever it climbs more than 6% above its 50-day average. The composite was above that level before last week's sharp drop.


Second, market sentiment remains uncomfortably bubbly. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) was 0.54 Tuesday and has been trending below 0.6% for weeks. That indicates a market that's more bullish than usual, and can be considered a warning sign.


Third, earnings season is underway, and with it the risk of disappointment, especially with bullish expectations for the S&P 500 companies.


After 37% of the S&P 500 reported fourth-quarter results, more than 80% beat earnings expectations and 76% beat revenue estimates. FactSet says that's on track for the second-highest percentage of positive EPS surprises since the research firm began tracking this metric in 2008.


The trend among analyst estimates also reflect a bullish tone. In January, analysts raised the median aggregate earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies for Q1 by 3.2% to $38.82, says John Butters, the vice president and senior earnings analyst at FactSet.


"In a typical quarter, analysts usually reduce earnings estimates during the first month of the quarter," Butters noted in a report. During the past five years, the average decline in the EPS estimate during the first month of a quarter has been 2.2%. In fact, the first quarter marked the second-highest increase in the aggregate EPS estimate during the first month of a quarter since Q2 of 2010. Granted, analysts made big cuts to Q1 estimates in the pandemic-stricken first half of 2020.


Reddit Stocks Deflate
---------------------


Volume rose on the Nasdaq from Monday's total, and turnover was indicated higher on the NYSE.


**GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)) and other [heavily shorted stocks targeted in a Reddit online forum](https://www.investors.com/news/gamestop-stock-amc-reddit-stocks-unravel/) continued to have huge volume as the short-squeeze trade appears to unwind. GameStop shares plummeted 60% in 76.4 million shares traded, while AMC plunged 41% in 455 million shares.

Nasdaq Wraps Up Best Week Since July; S&P 500 Suffers Stalling

The stock indexes posted moderate gains Friday as the Nasdaq wrapped up its best weekly percentage gain since mid-July. The Nasdaq tacked on 0.6% Friday, while the S&P 500 added just under 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%. The small-cap S&P 600 led the field with an 0.8% gain.

  

The IBD 50 matched the small-cap index with an 0.8% gain of its own.

  

Volume rose solidly on the NYSE and fell modestly on the Nasdaq. Friday was an options expirations day, which often boosts volume.

  

While Friday's session appeared positive at first glance, a closer look revealed a bit of trouble in the S&P 500.

  

The S&P 500 reversed off its high in strong volume and met the technical definition of stalling. Stalling is a form of stealth distribution that occurs on an up day.

  

This action brings the distribution count to a nervous level, six on each major index. Most of the distribution has occurred in November, which means that it will take some time or big gains to work off the distribution.

  

Still, some top-rated stocks are showing good action. Leaders making progress Friday included the four top stocks in the building products industry group.

  

**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) leapt 3.35 to 130.21 in heavy volume. The stock notched a new 52-week high and moved just above the 5% buy zone. The megacap has the best overall rating in the group, according to Stock Checkup at Investors.com.

  

Rival **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) popped 2.38 to 75.77 in strong volume. The stock cleared a 74.67 buy point in a long consolidation's handle. Lowe's closed less than 2% above the entry, which means that it can be bought.

  

**Tile Shop** ([TTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTS)) pushed 0.59 to 16.26 in heavy volume, clearing the 5% buy zone from an early November breakout past 15.26. The stock is on the thin side, with daily dollar volume of about $8 million.

  

**Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) added 1.57 to 90.81, but volume was below average. The Tennessee-based stock is working on a consolidation that dates to July.

  

These stocks are somewhat indirect housing plays. The homebuilder group was up 3.3% for the week, according to preliminary calculations. This was a good gain, though the wholesale building group posted a 4.3% gain.

  

On the downside, one former leader was hammered hard Friday. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) dived 75.32 to 536.19 in volume more than 600% above average. Bad news drove the 12% drop. An E.coli outbreak, which started in the Pacific Northwest and appeared to be over, spread to additional states Friday. The Centers for Disease Control said that new cases were reported in California, New York and Ohio.

  

Chipotle's stock chart is a shambles. The stock is now trading at an 18-month low.

  

While Chipotle's fundamentals still look strong in many respects, individual investors should resist the temptation to guess at the low. Successful investing is built around buying stocks that have hit new highs, not new lows.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 gained 3.7%; the Nasdaq, 3.6%; the Dow, 3.4%; the S&P 500, 3.3%; and the small-cap S&P 600, 3%.

  

Earnings season will continue in the coming week. Companies reporting quarterly results include telecom field services provider **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) on Monday; **Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)) on Tuesday; and farm equipment maker **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) on Wednesday.

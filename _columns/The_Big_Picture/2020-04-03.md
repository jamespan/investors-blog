Stock Market Hit By Selling On Weak Jobs Data; Leading Growth Stocks Pressured Again
=====================================================================================

The nascent [coronavirus stock market rally](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) took a bit of a detour Friday, one day after the S&P 500 confirmed a new uptrend with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). The silver lining to Friday's session was that volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Thursday's levels.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite gave back 1.5% each. The Russell 2000 index slumped 3.1%. The small-cap index flashed a follow-through day on March 24, when it soared more than 9% in higher volume on the fourth day of its rally attempt. But it's a secondary index at best and not known for launching new uptrends by itself.


A weaker than expected [March jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/coronavirus-shutdown-jobs-report-jobless-benefits/) fueled negative sentiment Friday. After two weeks in a row of surging weekly jobless claims, nonfarm payrolls plunged 701,000 in March, well above the consensus estimate for a 150,000 drop. The unemployment rate jumped to 4.4% from a half-century low of 3.5%. It was the largest monthly increase in the unemployment rate since 1975.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP-040320-234x300.jpg)It's never good to see a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) soon after a follow-through day, but the stock market avoided one Friday as volume trailed off from Thursday. The S&P 500 also managed to hold above Thursday's low, another small victory.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


But several top-rated growth stocks fell sharply Friday, not the type of price action you want to see in the early stages of a confirmed uptrend. **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), which had the look of a leader earlier in the week, extended losses after crashing nearly 9% Thursday.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) were among the worst percentage decliners in the Nasdaq 100.Â Nvidia fell back below its 50-day moving average Friday as it tries to form the right side of a base. AMD is also getting resistance at its 50-day line, along with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) made a run at its 50-day line Tuesday but got turned away.

**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) also lagged in the Nasdaq 100. After rising above its 200-day moving average in the latter part of March, it's back below the line.


In the early stages of a confirmed uptrend, it's good to see the stock market serving up new buys on a silver platter, but the market's message is pretty clear at this point: There's just not much out there to buy. The bottom line is that bases need more time to form. That's OK, though, because it can take several weeks from a market low for new leaders to emerge.


Some setups are still worth watching, including **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) and **Akamai** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)). Qualys is forming the right side of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 94.82 entry. Akamai is just below a 98.35 buy point.

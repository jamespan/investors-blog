Will 2018 become a true stock picker's market?




 If U.S. equities repeat what they did in February, you just might hear that phrase more often.


The major indexes dropped broadly Wednesday following another so-so reading on fourth quarter U.S. GDP, and volume was higher across the board. On the final trading day of February, institutions decided the time was ripe to take more profits off the table.


While the indexes certainly fell in unison, the stronger hit taken by the S&P 500 (down 1.1%) and the Dow Jones industrial average (off 1.5%) helped reaffirm the dominance by the Nasdaq composite. The latter dropped 0.7% and continues to outperform year to date; at 7273, the Nasdaq is still up 5.3% since Jan. 1. The S&P 500 is up 1.5%.

Meanwhile, a handful of travel, retail, medical and computer-related industry groups actually bucked the decline with gains of 0.5% or more.


The Nasdaq dropped 1.9% in February while the S&P 500 got slammed, down 3.9%.


Small caps struggled in February too. The Russell 2000 fell 1.6% on Wednesday; at 1512, the popular gauge got throttled with a 4% loss in February and is down 1.5% since Jan. 1.


Meanwhile on Wednesday, stocks bobbed between decent gains and small losses throughout the session, but heavy downside trading in the final hour coincided with a big sell-off. The major indexes finished practically at session lows, a bad sign.


The indexes also stamped a [third day of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), or intense professional selling, on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. A confirmed uptrend can weather an occasional sell-off every week or two and still show the fight to keep rising.


But if these significant declines in higher volume persist and clusters of distribution begin to reappear, take that as a primary clue that trading will become choppy like it did in the first two weeks of this past month.


U.S. gross domestic product grew 2.5% in the fourth quarter, meeting the [Econoday consensus estimate](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), but it's down from a 2.6% gain in the first reading. Stronger imports helped dampen the overall number.


Already this year, the action so far in U.S. equities has been dramatically different from 2017. Last year, scads of talking heads and money managers wondered aloud if the S&P 500 would ever move 1% or more in a single session — in either direction. The Cboe VIX continued to hit record low after record low. People began to forget when was the last time the indexes engaged in a "healthy" correction of 5% or more.


Then in February this year, those who don't follow distribution days got caught off guard. From Jan. 29 to Feb. 8, the Nasdaq got striped with six distribution days over just a nine-session period that ranged from a 0.5% nick to a 3.9% bloodletting. Such a cluster of heavy institutional selling essentially sparked the 11% correction by the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.


How will the market behave in March? We already get a sense that investors are getting weary of a potential major top. The bull run, after all, is super-long in the tooth. Yet unemployment remains low, U.S. taxes have been cut, inflation is rising but not raging, the U.S. economy is still growing, and companies keep innovating. Nevertheless, here are a sampling of issues that remain front and center:


**Risk 1: New days of heavy distribution**. When the major indexes fall hard, the leading stocks fall harder. Since Feb. 1, the Nasdaq has posted six days of significant declines in higher volume vs. the prior session, and four showed drops of 1% or more. Since the Feb. 14 follow-through there are three distribution days, including Tuesday's.


The Nasdaq slumped 2% on Feb. 2, 3.8% on Feb. 5, 3.9% on Feb. 8 and 1.2% on Tuesday.


**Risk 2: An exogenous shock**. The Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games presented an inspiring message of peace and harmony on the Korean Peninsula. But the event is over, and fears over isolationist regime North Korea's nuclear weapons program appear to keep growing. A breakdown in NAFTA talks, meanwhile, could dampen international trade.


**Risk 3: Poor action and failed breakouts by leading stocks**. Numerous winners in the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders have gained a lot of ground after building stacks of bases. But at some point, future breakouts will fail. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF is flat for the year after a 37% romp higher in 2017.


**Risk 4: A sudden new surge in interest rates**. As reported in an earlier Big Picture column, the chances of U.S. equities faring well even as Treasury bond yields climb are actually pretty good, but only when the long-term bonds show yields of 5% or lower. When rates go above that threshold, history has shown that investors, particularly the institutional kind, take the bait in search of stable income and lighten up on stocks.


However, in a stagnant economy in which inflation is raging and interest rates go up, both equities and debt do poorly. Think the early and late 1970s. In such a scenario, alternative securities do well, such as gold.


Near-term gold futures are at $1,319 an ounce on the Comex, up less than 0.8% since Jan. 1.


**Risk 5: Wild action in the currency market**. U.S. Treasury Security Steven Mnuchin touted the benefits of a weak greenback during the Davos economic summit in January. However, some market observers and economic experts wholeheartedly disagree, saying that a strong dollar is great for Americans. Why? They have more purchasing power. And consumer spending still makes up at least two thirds of the U.S. GDP. Future gyrations in the U.S. dollar could lead to uncertainty in corporate earnings, the lifeblood of stock prices.


**Risk 6: China politics**. After the Chinese new year, Xi Jinping and the ruling communist party have done away with the two-term limit on the presidency. Experts worry that such acts could lead to an erosion of free-market principles that have helped boost the Middle Kingdom to the No. 2 economy in the world.


"The consolidation of power into the hands of an authoritarian leader in recent years in China makes complete sense from a social mood perspective. That's because authoritarian leaders tend to arise during periods of negative social mood," Mark Galasiewski, chief strategist for Asia at Elliott Wave International, said. "Our best measure of a nation's social mood is its stock market, and China's main stock market index, the Shanghai Composite Index, is still down by 46% since its 2007 high."

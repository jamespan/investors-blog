After Wild Session, Has Stock Market Bottomed?
===============================================

Investors went from despair to relief at various times during a wild session Tuesday that saw the S&P 500 go from a loss of 2.1% to a gain as high as 2%.




 The S&P 500 closed 1.7% higher, after bottoming near the 2600 level. The Nasdaq surged 2.1% for its best gain since Oct. 27. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.3%.


Sellers may have been pacified at the end of the day, but that doesn't mean they're done. Even with Tuesday's bullish reversal, indexes were erratic. The S&P 500 changed direction seven times Tuesday.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. Advancers led decliners by a 5-2 ratio on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP020618-231x300.png)With the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering the steepest declines in more than 18 months — and all in the space of a few days — volatility is likely to stay in the market for a while. Thus, investors must remain guarded.


If it wasn't obvious to investors, program trading fanned the market volatility. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that algorithmic trading played a role in the sell-off as he sought to reassure jittery investors.


The S&P 500 fell as much as 9.7% from its peak. That's practically the definition of a market correction, which is commonly understood to be a decline of at least 10%. The small-cap Russell 2000 did sink more than 10%.


Institutions have been unwinding some of the rich holdings earned during a strong 2017 and an even better January. But at the closing bell, the market had solid gains and was well off session lows. That's how a lot of market bottoms begin.


Has the market indeed put in a low? Signals are mixed so far.


The Nasdaq closed back above its 50-day moving average, a good sign. But the S&P 500 remains below its own 50-day line.


The put-call volume ratio has been rising but still is not at peak levels that have marked index bottoms in the past year-plus.


The [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, is way above levels that have marked market bottoms. But that's precisely one of the concerns on Wall Street. Shares of **Cboe Global Markets** ([CBOE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBOE)) plummeted Tuesday as [trading was halted on several inverted volatility products.](https://www.investors.com/news/cboe-shares-dive-below-key-support-on-inverted-volatility-turmoil/) The intense volatility is causing worries about the impact on trading volume at Cboe's Chicago Board Options Exchange.



If the market is bottoming, don't necessarily look for a [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) to get the market back to a confirmed uptrend. Such a signal is not likely to occur if the sell-off is of short duration. Follow-throughs — in which a major index makes a sizable gain in higher volume to confirm a rally attempt — are best used for longer corrections.


A continued rebound in the major indexes would be enough to get the market back on its feet.  Also, there are reasons to believe the market is not in a full-fledged correction.


The economy is still improving. Friday's employment report saw 200,000 jobs added in January, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%. The IBD/TIPP Poll finds [consumer confidence at a 13-year high](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/ibdtipp-poll-economic-optimism-hits-13-year-high-on-trump-tax-cuts/).


S&P 500 earnings are on track for another strong quarter. FactSet says there was a rapid increase in earnings expectations for the first quarter of this year that started just after the tax bill was signed into law. Aggregate S&P 500 profit growth for Q4 is running at 13.4%.


The market had become overheated in January. The Big Picture noted that risk last week and [cautioned investors to tap the brakes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-fall-as-market-shows-3-signs-it-may-be-ready-for-a-break/). A combination of a long advance and low volatility eventually bubbled over at the first sign of trouble. Inflation, valuations and other factors have contributed to the sell-off.


Another important factor is that leading stocks are weaker but there's been no avalanche of sell signals. More than half the IBD 50 stocks are trying to find support at the 50-day line or near their latest buy points. No doubt, many others have slid below those key levels.

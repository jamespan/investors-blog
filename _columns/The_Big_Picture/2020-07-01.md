Nasdaq, Growth Stocks Lead Mixed Market; S&P 500 Holds This Key Level
======================================================================

The stock market continued to rebound Wednesday as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 made it three gains in a row, although market leadership was weirdly uneven.




The second half of 2020 started with the Nasdaq up 1% for the day, and the S&P 500 0.5% higher. But small caps fell 1% on the Russell 2000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed modestly lower to close down 0.3%.


Growth stocks outperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 1.4%. But utilities and real estate, two sectors normally treated as defensive plays, performed even better. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) climbed 2.7% and Utilities Select Sector SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) added 2.4%.


The Nasdaq has now erased all losses it piled up since June 24. That's when a mix of [coronavirus and tariff news hit stocks hard](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-slumps-virus-fears-sp500-marks-distribution-day/). More than other indexes, the composite has shown an ability to rebound from news-driven sell-offs. It took only a few days to recover from sell-offs on June 11 and 26.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP070120-263x300.jpg)The composite continues to diverge higher from other major indexes. The S&P 500 is about 8% below new highs. The Dow is off 12%. Technically speaking, wide divergences can be problematic.


But after a superb second quarter, the market is in shape to extend gains. The S&P 500 surged 20% in Q2, making it the best quarter since 1998 and the best Q2 since 1938, according to LPL Financial.


"A 20% quarterly gain is quite rare, but the catch is [previous large quarterly gains have actually led to continued strength](https://lplresearch.com/2020/07/01/the-best-quarter-since-1998/)," said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. "In fact, a quarter later stocks have been higher the past eight times after gaining at least 15% during the previous quarter." A 20.9% gain in Q4 of 1998 led to a 4.6% increase the next quarter and an 11.7% jump the next two quarters.


Of course, the economy faces unprecedented risks, making it hard to apply historical models. The coronavirus pandemic caused a deep recession from which some industries will take longer to recover. A resurgence of cases and hospitalizations in some areas raise worries that businesses may need to shut again. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) again closed stores in four states last week, and on Wednesday [expanded closings to 30 more stores](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/apple-to-re-close-30-more-retail-stores-as-coronavirus-cases-spike.html). Texas halted its reopening plans.


Yet, the stock market appeared to focus on the positive news, namely a positive trial for a Covid-19 vaccine. **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) announced promising trial results for a coronavirus vaccine. The news sent Pfizer up more than 3%, the best stock in the Dow Wednesday. BioNTech initially soared, but reversed 3.9% lower.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is near a record high as well, up 1.3% Wednesday. Indeed, the strength of leading stocks is a big reason the market has shaken off coronavirus scares. Despite several [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500, the indexes are not rolling over. The S&P 500 seems to have held the 3000 level well.


Breakouts In Health Care Stocks
-------------------------------


The few breakouts Wednesday were concentrated in health care.



**Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) broke out of a shallow base with a 245.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Volume was heavy.


Amgen said Wednesday that [a federal appeals court ruled in its favor](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-pops-after-winning-enbrel-patent-battle-novartis/) in a patent case involving Enbrel, a treatment for inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis. Amgen accused **Novartis**' ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)) Sandoz of violating patents in Sandoz's biosimilar of Enbrel.


**NeoGenomics** ([NEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEO)) climbed above the 31.52 buy point of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). **Agios Pharmaceuticals** ([AGIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGIO)) lifted past the 54.62 buy point of another shallow pattern.


In solar energy, **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) busted out of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Shares are extended from the 81.56 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Solid Economic Data Bolster Stock Market Uptrend
------------------------------------------------


The stock market got some good economic news this morning with strong manufacturing reports. The monthly ISM manufacturing index jumped in June to 52.6. It was the first reading over the 50 mark since February and the highest since April 2019.


"New orders (highest since January 2019) and production (highest since November 2018), critical reads for future and current activity, also hit the 50 mark (and beyond) for the first time since the start of 2020," noted Jennifer Lee, senior economist for BMO Capital Markets Economic Research.


The IHS Markit U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a seasonally adjusted 49.8 in June, up a record 10 points from May.


"U.S. manufacturers have reported a marked turnaround in business conditions through the second quarter, with collapsing production and demand in April at the height of the COVID-19 lockdown turning rapidly to stabilization by June," said IHS Markit Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson. The PMI's record month saw unprecedented gains in output, employment and order book gauges. "The record rise in the New Orders Index, coupled with low inventory holdings, bodes well for a further improvement in production momentum in July."


On Friday, the June employment report will be out before the market opens. In a preview, the ADP estimate of private sector jobs showed an increase of 2.37 million jobs.

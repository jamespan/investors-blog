  Stocks Extend Win Streak In 2018, But Breakouts Aren't Convincing

U.S. stock indexes kept their 2018 win streak alive Thursday, as the Dow Jones industrial average led the advance for the first time this year.




 The Dow rose 0.6% and traded above 25,000 for the first time, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq added around 0.4% and 0.2% respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 tacked on 0.2%.


Volume was up slightly on the NYSE and down a bit on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.


The Dow Jones utility average fell 0.9%, extending its recent troubles. The chart action is just plain ugly. The utility average began declining in early December and hasn't been able to find support. The utility index lost its 50-day line in mid-December and its 200-day line about a week later.


Weakness in utilities could be a good thing, if the money flows into either more aggressive vehicles, such as Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) which is up 3.3% so far this year, or into neglected cyclical issues.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's leaders included tires, consumer loans and specialty steel.


The day's biggest percentage loser was department stores.


Breakouts were fairly common Thursday, but most lacked convincing volume. Some retreated back under the buy point.



**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) crept above a sloppy flat base, but volume was 7% below typical trade. The buy point was 154.75.


Analysts expect earnings to grow 30% in Q4. On Feb. 1, Mastercard will release Q4 and full year results.


Software security provider **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS))Â popped above a flat base, but volume was 35% slower than usual. The base is third stage.

Real estate services provider **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)) cleared a flat base intraday in soft trade but then retreated under the 155.35 buy point.


All three stocks feature Composite Ratings above 90. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A reading of 90 puts the stock in the top 10% among all stocks in IBD's database.


For those investors willing to consider stocks with Composite Ratings in the 80s, breakouts Thursday included plastics and chemicals manufacturer **DowDuPont** ([DWDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DWDP)), internet network play **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) and specialty steel manufacturer **Allegheny Technologies** ([ATI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATI)).



DowDuPont climbed above a 73.95 buy point in a flat base. Volume was 22% above average. The base is first stage.


F5 gapped up above a 136.45 buy point in a long saucer-with-handle base. Volume was 1% below average.


Allegheny edged above a 26.69 buy point but then closed just under the entry. Volume was 1% above average.

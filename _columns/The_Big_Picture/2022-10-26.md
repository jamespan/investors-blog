  Microsoft, Megacap Techs Sink Nasdaq On Mixed Day; 3 Factors To Watch Now

Wednesday turned in one of the most lopsided performances among the major indexes in quite a while. So, for that reason, IBD readers may want to examine the session well beyond what happened to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.




While the headlines-making Nasdaq composite index sank 2%, halting a three-day rally, keep in mind that this index is market-cap weighted.


Put another way, what the 10 biggest companies do has tremendous sway every trading day over the premier index for growth companies.


According to Tuesday's General Market Indicators Charts page — available as a link at the bottom of each day's Big Picture, as well as at [Market Trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) at Investors.com — these top 10 firms make up almost 41% of the Nasdaq's total market value.


The top three companies alone, including **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which tanked 7.7% in massive turnover Wednesday, grab more than a quarter of the Nasdaq's valuation. Microsoft fell fiscal Q1 results that marked further deceleration.


So it may be helpful to look at an exchange traded fund that treats every one of the largest companies on the Nasdaq as equally weighted.


In this case, Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) showed only a 0.3% decline after rising 2.2%, 0.4% and 2.4% in the prior three sessions.



Nasdaq 100: 2 Ways To View
--------------------------


The Nasdaq 100-linked Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF, in contrast, slumped 2.2%.


QQQE's drop more or less fell in line with what other indexes did. The S&P 500, also impacted by the widespread selling in large-cap techs, lost 0.7%. But Invesco S&P Equal Weighted ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), another ETF that gives equal weights to all 500 members of the popular benchmark, actually edged up 0.2%. That marked its fourth straight gain.


Small and midcap stocks, meanwhile, also did better than the names that once were fondly known as the FAANG firms. The Russell 2000 rose almost 0.5%. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) closed nearly 0.3% higher.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 2 points higher. Year to date, the blue chip index is still down 12.4%. However, that's a lot less ghoulish than a drop of 19.6% since Jan. 1 for the S&P 500 and 29.9% for the Nasdaq composite.


Breadth turned out bullish on the session.


On the Nasdaq, winning stocks outpaced losers by 800 issues, according to early data provided by ThinkOrSwim. In fact, while 2,752 issues on the Nasdaq rose for the day, the number of NYSE issues gaining ground totaled just 2,054. However, the ratio of gainers vs. decliners proved slightly stronger on the New York Stock Exchange at nearly 3-to-2 in favor of the winners.

Lens On Industry Leaders, Laggards
----------------------------------


Which industries fortified this advance?


Looking at [IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-26-2022/), the biggest winners hailed from areas such as oil and gas drilling, solar energy, agricultural operations, transportation equipment, international oil exploration, leisure products, and gold and silver miners. In total, at least 20 industries gained 2% or more on the day.


On the other end of the performance spectrum, desktop software, internet networking and content, enterprise software, toys, shoes, chipmaker and homebuilding stocks dropped at least 2%.


Crude oil futures jumped nearly 3.5% on Wednesday, while natural gas continued its rebound after a six-session walloping that took its price below $5 per million BTUs. The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond skidded 9 basis points to 4.01%. According to Cboe data, that marks a sharp drop from last Friday's peak of 4.33%.


The probability that the Federal Reserve will bump up short-term interest rates by another 75 basis points at the Nov. 1-2 policy meeting has eased a bit in recent days, yet remains high at 87.3%, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.


Professional Selling Day
------------------------


Volume rose on the Nasdaq vs. Tuesday's session. This handed the index its first distribution day since IBD called a follow-through day on Oct. 21. This follow-through arrived on the eighth day of a new rally attempt after the Nasdaq made a new multiyear low of 10,088 on Oct. 13.


NYSE turnover eased, which kept the S&P 500 from getting its first distribution day since the change in the IBD outlook for stocks.


With just one such session of pronounced institutional selling on the books, growth investors may proceed with buying excellent breakouts. However, given the shaky action seen in a number of follow-through days throughout the year, it makes sense to limit long exposure in both the general stock market and in top stocks to a range of 20% to 40% of a portfolio.

Beyond Nasdaq: Boost Portfolio Exposure Now?
--------------------------------------------


What would have to happen to justify raising that level of equity exposure?


First, take a look at the daily charts of the key benchmarks, Nasdaq included. With the exception of the Dow Jones industrials and the Russell 2000, they all have yet to cross back above their respective 50-day moving averages. Plus, the 50-day lines are showing negative slopes lately. This means the general trend in stocks is still down.


Healthy markets see the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and other key indexes rising well above their 50-day and 200-day lines, even leading them higher. That simply has not happened in a significant way this year so far.


Two, keep a daily log of breakouts among stocks with [CAN SLIM traits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). How are they holding up after they surpass key buy points? Are they finishing strong for the day or the week? The stocks highlighted in the Market Pulse and in key screens including [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) offer a great barometer of market conditions.

Three, keep an eye on the market internals.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been rising for less than two weeks. The progress is limited. But further gains amid a rising number of sectors could reflect an inflection point. The NYSE's A-D line has a more bullish slope, but has yet to crack a downtrend sculpted since mid-August.


You can track the daily statistics of advancers vs. decliners, both on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE, in the General Market Indicators PDF page below.


More Breakouts? Watch For More 52-Week Highs
--------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, the number of new highs vs. new lows is still bearish. You can track these statistics as well as the strongest sectors in terms of stocks making new highs by going to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) at Stock Lists on Investors.com.


Wednesday's session revealed a bullish change; [116 stocks made 52-week or all-time new highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-26-2022/) on the Nasdaq. New lows receded to just 33. The ratio also looked positive on the NYSE side. The top three sectors on the new highs list: Medical, Banks and Energy. Insurance came in fourth place, as six stocks in this finance-related sector hit new highs.


Elsewhere, bullishness among newsletter editors increased sharply over the past week to 36.9% from 31.3%. Yet that figure remains a touch below pundits' overall bearishness ratio at 38.5%, down from 40.3% the prior week. The [bulls-bears survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) gets a refresh once a week on Wednesday.

Faced with inflation data and a Fed meeting this week, the stock market threw caution to the wind Monday.




With the [consumer price index due out Tuesday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) before the market opens, you'd think Wall Street would take it easy and gird itself. The stock market this month, however, seems fearless.


Indexes extended their rally, with the Nasdaq composite rising 1.5% to a 14-month high. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to its highest close since April 21, 2022.


June — [historically a poor month](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bulls-may-be-ready-to-rest-what-apples-price-action-says-about-the-market/) for the market — is so far a success. The S&P and Nasdaq are up roughly 4%. Of eight sessions so far this month, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose in six of them. The strength of the S&P's rally in recent sessions caused the removal of the May 9 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), leaving that index with a more manageable four days of higher-volume selling.


Even the lagging Dow Jones Industrial Average acted well, rising almost 0.6%. It closed just above the 34,000 level, as it makes yet another attempt to beat that resistance level. The Russell 2000 rose 0.4%. Volume rose Monday from Friday's totals.


Strength in megacaps, as usual, helped the stock market extend gains. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rose more than 2%, extending its win streak to 12 days. It's Tesla's longest win streak ever, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The EV leader rose more than 35% over that period.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) climbed nearly 1.6% to an all-time high, topping its previous record close on Jan. 3, 2022. It is getting close to a market cap of $3 trillion. **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), a smaller company with a $314 billion cap, gapped up 6% in heavy volume on an analyst upgrade. After the close, shares added 4% as [quarterly results topped views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/orcl-stock-oracle-earnings-top-estimates-on-cloud-computing-growth/).


Volume Could Be A Warning
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP061223-230x300.jpg)Not every indicator is bullish. Volume in the Nasdaq and NYSE has softened a bit while indexes extend gains. That's a sign that institutional investors may still be reluctant buyers.


On May 26, the Nasdaq's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) was a splendid A-. Last Friday, it was B. The S&P's rating went from B- to C in the same period. That's not a great shift, but it's a trend that needs to be monitored.


Much has been said about the stock market advance resting on the shoulders of just a few major stocks. Seven megacap techs are up more than 70% on average this year, according to Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), by comparison, is up only about 3% year to date.


Yet, by some measures, participation in the stock market advance is broadening.


IBD's tracking of Nasdaq 52-week highs topped 100 in seven of the past 10 sessions through Friday. In the NYSE, the number of 52-week lows diminished to single digits or teens. At the same time, NYSE 52-week highs swelled 45 to 150.


Indeed, the ratio of new highs to new lows is tilting much in favor of new highs. (IBD counts only stocks with [EPS Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 60 or higher, so this list of new highs and new lows is of higher-quality companies.)



Homebuilders, which a few weeks ago showed signs of fatigue, are bouncing back. Of 23 stocks in the group, eight are at new highs, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) regained a 130.68 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-base-on-base-pattern-can-turn-disappointment-into-success/) Monday.


Software, Chips, Travel Help Lead Stock Market
----------------------------------------------


Software, semiconductors, construction, electrical infrastructure and travel stocks also are providing a good share of market leadership.


**Confluent** ([CFLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFLT)), **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)), **Hubbell** ([HUBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBB)) and others have reached their [20% profit targets](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) from buy points.


The number of failed breakouts — **Smartsheet** ([SMAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMAR)), **Zoetis** ([ZTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTS)), **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)), **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) and **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) to name a few — so far is limited.


On Wednesday, the [U.S. producer price index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) will show May wholesale inflation. The report will arrive just as the Fed winds down a two-day meeting on interest rates. Most traders expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged at a target range of 5%-5.25%. But comments from various Fed officials indicate another rate hike is possible at their late-July meeting. Thus, the policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell's comments will be telling.


Besides the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates when it meets on Thursday. And the Bank of Japan also meets this week.

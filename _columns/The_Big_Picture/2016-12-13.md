Stocks presented another bullish session in the spirit of a Santa Claus rally. While the Russell 2000 almost played the role of Scrooge, finishing just a hair higher, most other gauges gained nicely Tuesday.


The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.9%, ending not far from intraday highs, in posting an all-time high. Ditto that for the S&P 500, which rose 0.7% despite a dose of significant selling in metal ores, fertilizer, solar, coal, farm machinery, trucking, metal fabrication and specialty steel shares.


Strong buying amid a bunch of tech-related names, from chip and integrated circuit designers as small as **Monolithic Power** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) (market cap of $3.4 billion) to tech services giants as big as **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) ($160 billion market cap) helped lift the Nasdaq 100 to a 1.3% gain, better than the S&P 100's 0.8% rally.


![mp121316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP121316-178x300.png)The Dow Jones industrial average enjoyed a 0.6% gain, while the Dow Jones transports settled for a less than 0.3% rise.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, indicating urgency among equity trading desks in and out of Wall Street to accumulate shares with less than three weeks left in the year and just a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year on interest rates.


Did you notice how banking stocks, which have been so hot since Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election win that they have already spurred some skeptics to say the equivalent of "too far, too fast," traded rather tightly Tuesday? That too is a good sign that the institutional crowd isn't all that eager to let go of their shares ahead of the key meeting by the central bank.


While it's virtually a given that Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Co. will decide to bump up the fed funds rate for the first time in a year with a quarter-point hike, the market does not anticipate the Fed to quickly ratchet up interest rates in 2017, at least for the first four or five months of the new year.


According to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, which looks at 30-day fed fund futures prices, an investorÂ would have to wait until the June 14, 2017, meeting in which the probability that another 25-basis point hike or higher in rates reaches more than 50%. In contrast, in the May 3 meeting, less than 30% of the crowd sees rates going to a level of 0.75%-1% or higher.


Back to the tech sector, IBM is joining the likes of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and other big-cap techs that are either approaching valid buy points in long bottoming base patterns or are still in buy range after recently breaking out. Late on Tuesday, IBM announced a plan to add as many as 25,000 U.S. jobs in the next four years.


Such news reaffirms the recent positive data on U.S. employment, consumer sentiment and activity in both the manufacturing and service sectors.
Apple, posting its fifth gain in six sessions and finishing the day up 1.7% at 115.19, is now within just several points from completing a new cup base on a long bottoming base pattern.


In 2016, Apple's initial breakout came on Sept. 14 when the iPhone giant lurched past a 110.33 entry in a five-month cup with handle.


One question many investors may have is this: Will a long series of rate hikes eventually damage the stock market's uptrend?


One way to answer this is by comparing the so-called "earnings yield" of the S&P 500 with the yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, which finished Tuesday near 2.47%. If S&P 500 firms are able to match Wall Street's current forecast of approximately $127.18 in earnings over the next 12 months, as noted by S&P Global Investment Advisors, then the yield of the index is roughly at 5.6% ($127.18 divided by the 500's closing price of 2271 on Tuesday).


That earnings yield still towers over the 10-year government bond yield. Plus, cash dividends boost the overall return of equities. Conclusion: Stocks still have room to run.


Market history, meanwhile, offers a second way to look at valuations between stocks and bonds. Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial, notes that stocks and the 10-year Treasury yield have been shown to move in the same direction when the yield itself is below 5%.


"While we would certainly not consider 5% a magic number, we do think yields have room to move before they become worrisome for the stock market," White wrote in a note to clients. "Starting from low yield levels, rising interest rates tend to reflect rising economic growth expectations and ebbing deflation fears. And bond market losses may make investors sell bonds to buy stocks."

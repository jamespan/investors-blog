Indexes Jump Again, But Hurdles Remain; Apple Powers Dow Higher
================================================================

If the bulls liked solid percentage gains for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 last Tuesday and Friday, they certainly were encouraged by Monday's price action, which saw the Dow Jones industrial average lead the way, rising 1.7%.




 The blue-chip index was led by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which rose 4%. But heavy-volume declines have knocked its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) down to E, the worst possible.  **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) notched gains of more than 3%.


The Nasdaq composite added 1.6%, and the S&P 500 picked up 1.4%. Small caps were curious laggards Monday morning but picked up the pace late. The Russell lagged but still rose 0.9%.


Nasdaq and NYSE volume fell from Friday's above-average levels.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP021217-233x300.jpg)Make no mistake: The major stock indexes still have to prove themselves more to convince the bulls a new uptrend is in the works.


Don't forget, the S&P 500 briefly pierced the 200-day moving average Friday, falling nearly 1.9% before rallying strongly into the close. The broad-based NYSE composite, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 small-cap index showed similar action.


Also noteworthy Friday was that the put/call volume ratio shot up to 1.26. Readings above 1.15 indicate excessive fear, and excessive fear has been seen at many market bottoms in the past.


But a clustering of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) from Jan. 30 through Feb. 8 (four higher-volume declines with percentage declines ranging from 1.1% to 4.1%) were indicative of heavy institutional selling that will most likely take some time to repair.


A look back at the Nasdaq in August 2015 when it crashed more than 15% in five trading sessions offers some perspective. It showed two straight big gains on Aug. 26-27, but the index eventually met with resistance at the 50-day moving average. After another pullback, the index rallied above the 50-day line, resulting in a short-term tradable rally that was eventually met with more selling.


The point is that when the market goes through bouts of institutional selling — not mild institutional selling but heavy institutional selling — it usually takes some time for the selling to run its course. When institutional buyers start coming in from the sidelines again, that's when you'll see chart setups and new leaders emerge.


If a tradable rally ensues from here, be conservative with new buys and make sure positions are small-than-normal to start.


Small caps lagged early Monday but eventually picked up the pace to narrow the gap with other indexes. Small caps are particularly sensitive to higher interest rates, and rates have certainly started heading higher. Near the end of last year, the 10-year Treasury yield was around 2.40%. The yield on Monday was mostly unchanged around to 2.85%.


The battle going on between the bulls and the bears right now is the health of the U.S. economy. The bulls like the look of an economy that continues to improve with tame inflation so far. The bulls also like a healthy corporate earnings environment and the prospects for more M&A activity.


The bears, on the other hand, say it's only a matter of time before the economy heats up and inflation becomes an issue. That could force new Fed President Jerome Powell to more aggressive with rate hikes down the line.


Futures traders aren't expecting a more aggressive Fed, at least for now. For the March meeting, according to the [CME Group FedWatch](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/) tool, there's a 77% chance the Federal Open Market Committee will raise rates by a quarter point to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%. For the June meeting, they see a 44% chance of another quarter-point hike to 1.75% to 2%.


For now, the Nasdaq composite's 50-day moving average around 7078 and the S&P 500's 50-day line around 2720 are potential resistance levels to watch. Last week, the S&P 500 got turned away at the 50-day line, reversing off its high Wednesday.


The other question to ask is this: After two straight sessions of solid gains, are there good setups to buy? Perhaps some, but they're certainly not plentiful. That's another cue from the market to stay patient with new buys.


Steel producers outperformed Monday after President Trump's plans for infrastructure spending came into better focus. After five straight closes below the 50-day moving average, **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) reclaimed the line, rising 6%.

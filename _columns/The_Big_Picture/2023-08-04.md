Stock Market Falls As Bears Attack Despite Soft Jobs Report; This Inflation Gauge Looms

The stock market reversed lower late Friday, despite a soft jobs report, after a cyberattack disrupted hospital computer systems across the country. A key inflation gauge looms large in the week ahead.




After being up more than 1%, the Nasdaq composite fell 0.4%, causing it to lose some ground on its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Its loss for the week was more severe, coming in at almost 3%. Nevertheless, bulls will point to the fact the tech-heavy index remains up about 34% so far in 2023. In light of these mammoth gains the current pullback could ultimately prove to be constructive.


The S&P 500 struggled more, falling 0.5%. The benchmark index suffered a weekly drop of more than 2% and failed to get support at the 21-day line. But it remains well clear of its major moving averages. The S&P remains up around 17% for the year despite its broader exposure to the overall economy.


**Amazon.com**'s ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) surge of 8.3% following a [strong quarterly report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-jumps-after-tech-giant-beats-q2-goals/) made it a standout on both the S&P and the Nasdaq. It was also one of the biggest one-day market cap gains in history, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average is backing off now after its July sprint, closing the day down 0.4%. Despite this, it remains above its 21-day line. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was the key loser here, falling 4.8%. It breached its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in high volume, a sell signal, after a negative response to earnings.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP080423_2-272x300.jpg)Small caps were relatively strong, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.2%. The same could not be said for growth stocks, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) plunging 1.6%.


With the stock market uptrend under pressure, IBD is recommending investors to reduce exposure to 60% to 80%.


Now is a good time to lock in some gains after the tremendous rally so far in 2023. It is also key that investors keep on top of any sell signals, such as stocks round-tripping double-digit gains or big breaches of the 50-day moving average.


Key Inflation Gauge, Earnings Reports Loom
------------------------------------------


Stocks initially rallied after the [July jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-is-pretty-solid-but-the-fed-is-patient-sp-500-futures-rise/) showed that the U.S. economy added 187,000 jobs last month, below economist estimates and down from June's 209,000 increase. However, wage pressures remained and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.5% from 3.6%.


Some key inflation data is due next week, with the much-watched consumer price index due Thursday. July CPI is seen rising 3.3% and core CPI is expected to pop 4.7%. Producer price index data is due Friday.


In addition, a host of big-name companies will report earnings. Warren Buffett-led **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) leads the way this weekend.


**Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) and **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) are among the key growth stocks to watch when they report next week.

Security Software Hurts Stock Market
------------------------------------


Security software plays were a sore spot, with **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) cratering 25.1% on a mixed report and disappointing revenue guidance. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) was among the more heavily damaged cybersecurity stocks.


The S&P 500 sectors ended the session in mostly negative territory. Technology and consumer staples lagged most while consumer discretionary and energy were the only areas in the green.


Among IBD industry groups, wireless telecom services stocks, travel booking plays, oil & gas royalty trusts and radio and TV stocks were among the best performers. Cable TV, wholesale drug and telecom consumer products lagged.

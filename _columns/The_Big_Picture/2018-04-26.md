U.S. stock indexes galloped ahead Thursday on strong earnings, economic data and hopes that a trade deal can be reached with China.




The Nasdaq spurted 1.6%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1% each. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 gaining 0.5%.


Volume rose across the board but not with much gusto.


Before the market's open, durable goods orders for March were released. New orders grew 2.6% on a month-to-month basis. The growth topped the consensus view for 1.7%.

Whenever an interpretation differs from the main data, it's best to turn to the ultimate authority: the stock market itself.


Confident stock gains in rising volume — even if the volume was somewhat routine — told the analysts their spin was wrong.


Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims came in 9% fewer than expected, underlining the day's bullish bent.


Another bullish factor was Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's upcoming trip to China. Other officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, are expected to accompany Mnuchin to China next week.

President Trump said the U.S. has "a very good chance of making a deal."


Breakouts And Good Moves
------------------------


Strong earnings from some major companies were another bullish element in Thursday's session. Breakouts aren't commonplace with a market uptrend under pressure. But there were a couple of notable breakouts Thursday on earnings reports.



**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) gapped up about 5% to clear a 125.54 buy point in fast trade. Earnings jumped 29% in fiscal Q2 ended in March. This was about 9% above the consensus view. Revenue rolled in at $5.07 billion, which was 5% higher than expected. The fiscal year ends in September.


**CenterState Bank** ([CSFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSFL)) rose almost 4% in heavy volume. It also beat profit views.


Restaurant stocks did well. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) gapped up 24%. Earnings grew 33%, which was about 36% above the Street's consensus estimate. Chipotle named a new CEO in March.


Cowen Group upgraded the stock Thursday from underperform to market perform. Chipotle stock has been generally declining since August 2015 but began its latest rebound in February.


Other restaurant stocks advancing included **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), up 7%, and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), up about 3%.


Domino's U.S. same-store sales rose 8.3%, while international popped 5%. Overall, quarterly revenue burned 26% higher, the best in at least 19 quarters.


Starbucks reported after the close, matching expectations on earnings and beating views on revenue slightly. The stock fell 3% in after-hours trade.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) gapped up 9% to retake its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Earnings surged 63%, topping views by about 25%.


Sloppy Index Chart
------------------


Despite the bullish action Thursday, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow remain under their 50-day lines. The small-cap Russell 2000 is barely above its 50-day.


If an individual investor looks at the broader picture, the Nasdaq's chart has looked sloppy since early February.


Consider the changes in the Market Pulse since early February. No trend, whether it's been correction, pressure or confirmed uptrend has lasted longer than 10 trading days.


Compare that to Aug. 22 to Jan. 31, when the Market Pulse stayed in confirmed uptrend for 112 sessions.


Sometimes investors complain when the Market Pulse makes "too many changes." There is no such thing. A choppy market is a choppy market, not a mistake in labeling.


Until the market begins to show sustained upward action again, there is little hope for making money in this atmosphere.


Above all else, individual investors should not get into arguments with the stock market. An investor should learn how to think like a California surfer: No one surfs when the waves lack quality.


Given the choppy action since February, individual investors might watch for double-bottom bases to develop. They often form in such circumstances.


After Hours
-----------


Online retailer **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) reported terrific earnings and sales. Q1 earnings leapt 121%, while revenue rose 43%. The stock surged 6% in after-hours action. Amazon also announced it was raising the price of its Prime membership 20% to $119 per year.


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) also reported after the close. The chipmaker grew earnings 37% on a 4% gain in revenue. Intel gained 8% in extended trading after the close.


Tech stocks overall were indicated sharply higher.


Coming up Friday: The first take on Q1 GDP will be released before the open. The Street expects a 2% gain, down from Q4's 2.9% pop. The range of estimates runs from 1.3% to 2.8%.

Stocks Erase Part Of Loss; Should Divergence Worry Bulls?
==========================================================

U.S. stock indexes suffered damage Thursday, but the market popped out most of the dent.




The Nasdaq dropped as much as 1.5% in early afternoon action but ended the session off only 0.6%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each fell 0.4%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, but the NYSE trade fell.


While the bulls welcomed the positive reversal, the action slapped the Nasdaq with distribution. A [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), which involves a loss in rising volume, points to institutional selling.

The current distribution count has a bipolar quality: six on the Nasdaq and one on the S&P 500. None of the distribution days, though, had what might be called knockout power. The negative action has been more like jabs.


Still, divergence in the stock indexes are worth pondering, especially from a distribution standpoint.


The distribution count was one for the Nasdaq on Oct. 17. The count started tilting against the Nasdaq on Oct. 18, when the Nasdaq suffered a stall day and then incurred distribution in three of the next five sessions.


What was happening?


One angle to consider is stock rotation. Since Oct. 18, the best-performing areas include solar, up 17%; homebuilders, up 13%; computer software, up 10%; crude oil, up 9%; and logistics, up 6%.


During the same period, metal-ore mining, biotechs and specialty steel each fell 5%.


Chip stocks, which have been a leading sector for months, have their own intramural form of rotation. From Jan. 1 through Oct. 18, the chip equipment group soared 60%, while chip designers and chipmakers rose 19% and 22%, respectively. But since Oct. 18, chip designers have led with a 5% gain vs. a nearly flat performance from the other chip groups.


Profit-taking more than bearishness is probably the story in the chip world, given the sizable gains in many of those stocks.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and the FANG stocks — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — have been a mixed story.


Apple is up 10% since the distribution count began rising, while Amazon.com is up 13%. The other FANG stocks have made small moves.


On Thursday, bulls had few places to hide.


Department stores rebounded, but the action had the profile of a dead-cat bounce. **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) rose 11% but is still 57% off its 52-week high; **Dillard's** ([DDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDS)) rang up a 12% gain but is 31% off its high; and **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) popped almost 5% but is 36% off its high.


Meanwhile, quality dominated the loser camp. The highly rated chip groups and mortgage services took hard hits.


What Should An Investor Do?
---------------------------


Recently, IBD's emphasis has been on [taking profits at the 20%](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/taking-the-profit-too-soon-can-lead-to-riches/) to 25% level from buy points. That advice stands, though as an investor would be [wise to sell](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/chip-charts-raise-question-is-it-time-to-take-profits/) a laggard as well.


The IBD investor doesn't want to take profits in winners and leave laggards in the portfolio. Getting rid of the weakest link makes sense.


One additional consideration: Fear hasn't yet risen to the level where the contrarian put-call volume ratio signals a market low. On Thursday, the put-call ratio closed at 0.91, well below the 1.15 reading that often signals a short-term low. The last time the ratio closed at or above 1.15 was Aug. 17. That was two sessions before the market low was pegged, and then the Nasdaq rose 10% in about 11 weeks.

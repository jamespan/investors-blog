The stock market fell Friday despite a soft jobs report as fears over Trump tariffs and inflation intensified. Now the latest consumer inflation reading and retail sales data await around the corner.


The Nasdaq composite opened higher, but ended Friday down 1.4% and suffered a weekly decline of 0.5%. It ended the day back below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), a disappointment after it retook the benchmark on Tuesday. The tech-heavy index is now up just 1.1% for the year so far.




The S&P 500 suffered a daily drop of 1%, but managed to hold above its 50-day line and its 21-day exponential moving average. The benchmark index surrendered just 0.2% for the week and is up 2.5% in 2025.


Decliners outnumbered advancers by roughly 3-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq, but the distribution day count remains the same as the Dec. 31 distribution day was expunged due to time.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was punched 1% lower Friday, which accounted for its weekly loss of 0.5%. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was one of the worst components following a post-earnings sell-off, but **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) lagged most.


Small caps were also bitten by the bears, with the Russell 2000 ending the session down 1.2% Friday. Growth stocks outperformed though, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rallying 1%.


Investor's Business Daily is holding its recommended exposure level at the 60%-to-80% level for now due to the S&P 500 holding above its 50-day line. The Direxion Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) exchange traded fund also held above this important benchmark. However, it makes sense be at the lower end of the exposure band due to recent negative action.


Trump Tariff, Inflation Fears Rock Stocks
-----------------------------------------


Stocks started off higher initially after the January jobs report showed the U.S. economy had added 143,000 nonfarm jobs, less than economists expected. But the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4% due to upward revisions to December's figures. Wages also popped 4.1% vs. a year ago.

But indexes hit the reverse gear after the University of Michigan consumer survey for February showed respondents expect inflation to be at the 4.3% mark a year from now. This was up from January's reading of 3.3% and is the highest reading since November 2023. It rose due to worries over tariff policy. Consumer sentiment also fell about 5%.


President Donald Trump then fueled further worries Friday afternoon by saying he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs in the coming week. However, he did not cite the countries affected. Rather than a flat rate, these tariffs would match tariffs imposed on U.S. goods.


The coming week hopefully will add further clarity to the economic picture. A sprinkling of Fedspeak is expected to prevail throughout the week, while January's consumer price index report drops Wednesday. Meanwhile, Friday will see the release of U.S. retail sales data for January. This should give more insight into the economic health of the consumer.


[Earnings season will also continue](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/shopify-stock-reddit-stock-headline-busy-week-tech-earnings/) apace. Fast food giant **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), Warren Buffett stock **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), recent initial public offering **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)) and [Leaderboard stocks](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) are among the noteworthy firms reporting.


IBD 50 Stock Boosts This Stock Market Group
-------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors all ended the session lower Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Communication services and consumer discretionary took the hardest blows while energy and utilities suffered the smallest losses.



As ever, investors could take in a more nuanced view of the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by studying the performance of IBD's 197 industry groups. Video game firms, oil and gas royalty trusts, travel bookers and alternative energy stocks all outperformed.


The medical software group was also strong after **Doximity** ([DOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS)) soared after earnings. [The IBD 50 stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10) cleared its 20% profit target from a 61.75 entry and ended the session with a 36% gain.


In contrast, fiber-optics stocks, telecom infrastructure plays, specialty retailers and home furnishings retailers were among the worst performers.

Stocks patched some losses from the previous two sessions, but Thursday's gains couldn't repair all of the damage.




In the two-day decline, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 stabbed 3.8% and 2% lower, respectively.


On Thursday the Nasdaq took back 1.6%, while the S&P 500 reeled in 1.4% after paring some gains late in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average and the small cap Russell 2000 rose 1.1% and 1%, respectively.


Volume rose modestly on the Nasdaq. Preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume as the market prepared for a three-day weekend. The market is closed Good Friday.

Not every follow-through day works, but disciplined investors will test each one.


What needs to change for the uptrend to return?


Circumstances surrounding the stock market's weakness in March mostly were related to the threat of a trade war.


President Trump is pushing hard for tariffs despite a consensus among economists that tariffs are a bad idea.


Understandably this feeds fear.


The put/call volume ratio, one measure of fear, closed at 1.16 Wednesday. Normally, a reading of 1.15 or higher signals a short-term bottom in the market is near.


Yet, tariff skirmishes would probably have to be settled in the minds of fund managers for this market to find traction.


Stock Gains And The RS Line
---------------------------


If deals are the real motivation, then good stock picking will be critical for investors.


Look for stocks with relative strength lines at new highs. The RS line points to outperformance vs. the S&P 500, and that is strength in a market correction.


Stocks with RS lines at or near highs include Brazilian payment technology provider **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), apparel retailer **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), retailer **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)), financial software provider **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)), cosmetics maker **Estee Lauder** ([EL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EL)) and online marketplace for vintage goods **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)).


Key Areas On The Index Charts
-----------------------------


Individual investors also should watch the indexes' charts.


The Nasdaq chart shows a battle going on at the 7,000 price level. Ultimately, 7,000 will either become a springboard or a trapdoor.


On the S&P 500 chart, the 200-day line and the 2,600 level virtually coincide.


Patience is important during a market correction. Investors shouldn't let one day's action determine their actions.


Gains in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 Thursday were strong enough that they could be the start of a rally attempt. But investors shouldn't buy prematurely. On March 26, indexes looked ready to start rallying, too, only to sink some more.

The stock market declined practically across the board on Thursday, but the style of the decline showed a subtle change.


The Nasdaq composite fell 0.6%, slightly more than the S&P 500's 0.4% drop. Small caps suffered a fiercer sell-off, as the S&P 600 lost 0.8%.


Volume fell almost 7% on the Nasdaq; NYSE composite turnover, which includes trades in NYSE-listed stocks across all major exchanges, also declined.


The Nasdaq has now fallen in five of the past seven sessions. But Thursday's action differed in that a steady afternoon rebound shaved a big chunk of the indexes' intraday losses. The Nasdaq had fallen as much as 1.3% by noon ET. The  S&P 500 was off as much as 1.1%. Both indexes finished well in the upper half of their intraday ranges, which suggests support for stocks -- not an all-out exit.

Yet equity trading desks across the country were clearly still shaken by the realization that the Federal Reserve may prove more hawkish on short-term interest rates than previously thought.


On Thursday, highly respected bond fund manager Jeff Gundlach told Bloomberg News that he sees a change in thinking among members of the U.S. central bank's committee on setting interest rates. "The Fed has shifted from, 'if the data pattern improves we will have the green light to hike,' to 'unless that data pattern weakens we have the green light to hike.' "


At this stage, the Fed is highly unlikely to go ballistic on rates. Last December's 25-basis point rise in the fed funds rate still leaves it miles below the 5% level seen exactly 10 years ago. Was Thursday's afternoon rally a reflection that another rate hike ahead of the November presidential election is an expression of confidence in the overall economy? Or does it reflect the Fed's resolve to keep its mandate of keeping a heavy lid on rampant inflation?


Perhaps investors should worry more about signs that the U.S. potentially returns to the era of high inflation and low economic growth that plagued the 1977-1981 presidential term of Jimmy Carter. Higher prices eat away at investors' returns. Poor increases in economic output make it much harder for corporate profits to grow.


Today, we obviously don't see the same wild gyration in prices or interest rates that badly bruised stock investors during much of the 1970s. From early 1977 to the first quarter of 1980, the Fed raised the discount rate, also known as the primary credit rate, from 5.25% to 13%. (Today it remains at 1.0%.) But recent economic data point to an undesirable mix. While consumer prices in April jumped the most in a single month since 2013, on Wednesday the Atlanta Federal Reserve's business inflation expectations index jumped 1.9% in May, up from 1.7% in April. The Fed has repeatedly hinted that it wants to see inflation meeting its 2% target before taking strong action on rates.


Meanwhile, manufacturing continues to be weak. On Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey index came in at -1.8, signaling contraction and below the Econoday consensus forecast of +3.0.


Psychological indicators remain mixed. Options players are clearly bearish; the put-call volume ratio jumped to 1.20, likely the highest since a 1.25 reading on March 8 .(See the graph right below the Nasdaq daily chart on IBD's general market indexes page via a link at the end of this story.) The 1.20 figure means that traders bought and sold 120 bearish puts for every 100 bullish calls.


However, the Investors Intelligence survey still shows bearishness among newsletter writers at a relatively low 21.7% vs. 40.2% bullishness. IBD research has shown that at major market bottoms, high levels of bearishness often exceed bullishness. However, today the market remains in a fragile uptrend since its recent near-term bottom on Feb. 11.


While the distribution-day count remains heavy for both key indexes over the past 25 days, interestingly the Nasdaq has given back only a third of its gains since its 4209 low. Meanwhile, a decent-size pocket of leaders, from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and China's **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) to recent new leaders **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and housing play **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), are showing positive action in light of strong quarterly results. While fewer stocks are hitting new highs lately, another market leg up could change that picture.

Stocks rebounded sharply, thundering higher into the close. But volume quieted down from Tuesday's terrible sell-off. Given the recent mayhem in the market, a regular reader of IBD would naturally not expect to see stocks breaking out, even on a solid up day like Wednesday.

  

He or she would be right.

  

Few leadership-quality names are close to breaking out. However, it's still a good time to build a watch list of newer companies and other leaders that are growing fast and impacting the economy.

  

The Nasdaq composite led the major averages on Wednesday, rising 2.5%. The Nasdaq 100 was up 2.7%. This gain reflected strength among the beaten-down chipmaking and biotech stocks.

  

**Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) (97 Composite Rating), showed strength of conviction at its 50-day moving average as the stock bounced more than 2%. Volume was 31% below average. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) (88 Composite), which regained its mojo earlier this year, behaved well around its 50-day line with a 3% gain in flat trade. Among large-scale retailers, it's clearly the fastest grower on the top line.

  

The S&P 500 rallied 1.8%. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 1.4%.

  

On the Nasdaq's daily chart (Page B2), all of the composite index's seven up days in price since Aug. 12 featured a very high close for the day. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq in fact finished smack dab at its session high.

  

Normally, this activity is positive. The problem: The stock market is still in a general correction.

  

No one knows what event could trigger a change in the market's trend. But everyone can time his or her re-entry into the market simply by closely watching the daily action and by observing potential new breakouts. The IBD 50 (see Wednesday's paper, B2-B5, or every day in [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/top10/)) is a smart place to look.

  

Dismay and fear over China's economic troubles seemed to take a back seat on Wednesday to a rush of generally positive news about the U.S. economy. The ADP private sector jobs report for August missed the consensus view, but Q2 [U.S. productivity](http://news.investors.com/economy/090215-769286-productivity-rises-solidly-but-longterm-trend-is-tepid.htm) grew 3.3% annualized, a positive surprise.

  

The market rally shifted into higher gear late Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's Beige Book revealed numerous elements of economic growth. Retail sales "continued to expand"; real estate activity was "mostly positive"; and tourism was "strong."

  

The bulls' gauge by Investors Intelligence fell hard for a second straight week to 27.8% (see Page B11), the lowest since a 26.4% reading back when the market bottomed in March 2009.

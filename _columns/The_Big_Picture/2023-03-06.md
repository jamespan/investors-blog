============================================================================================================

Early gains faded for the stock market Monday as Wall Street braced for another busy week of earnings reports, economic data and testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Capitol Hill.




Small caps took the biggest hit, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) down 1.5%.


The stock market was in a good mood early, cheered by a drop in the 10-year Treasury yield down to 3.92%. But the yield bounced back to around 3.97% just after 4:30 p.m. ET.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit resistance at its 50-day moving average as a 0.5% gain morphed into a loss of 0.1% by the close. **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) outperformed in the blue-chip index after the company reported positive Phase 2 trial results for a cholesterol medication. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), meanwhile, gained nearly 2% after Goldman Sachs started coverage with a buy rating and 199 price target.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 pared an 0.8% gain to 0.1%. It would've been a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) for the index if volume was higher, but volume fell slightly from Friday. The S&P 500's Jan. 27 stalling session fell off the index's distribution-day count due to time.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP030623.jpg)The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) was one of the worst-performing S&P 500 sectors, down 1.6%, but after eight straight up sessions, XLB was due for a breather. The fund was weighed down by weakness in top-10 holdings like **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) and **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)).


Mining, steel and coal stocks lagged after China set a 5% GDP growth target this year, the lowest in more than a quarter-century, according to the Wall Street Journal.


The Nasdaq composite reversed slightly lower for a loss of 0.1%, also in lower volume. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by nearly 2-to-1.


Powell On Tap
-------------


The Fed's Powell will appear in front of a Senate committee on Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET and at a House hearing on Wednesday at the same time in the Fed's semiannual monetary policy report to Congress.


The next FOMC meeting will be on March 21-22. Federal funds futures traders have fully priced in a quarter-point hike. But the odds for a half-point hike have risen to nearly 35%, up from 24% a week ago.


The stock market seems to be growing more confident that the Fed will be able to tame inflation without sending the U.S. economy into a harsh recession. That said, a hawkish tone this week from Powell wouldn't be surprising as recent readings on inflation have revealed stubbornly high prices amid strong hiring and consumer spending. Inflation will eventually come down to the Fed's preferred target around 2%, but how long will it take?


The February employment report also looms large at the end of the week. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase by 214,000 with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.4%. Last month, the Nasdaq composite slumped 1.6% on Feb. 3 on news the economy created 517,000 jobs, more than double the 185,000 consensus. The Fed wants to see some slack in the labor market to help bring inflation down but it's not getting it yet.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


After soaring nearly 16% last week, IBD's solar group tacked on another 2%. **Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) was one of the top gainers in the group, but the former leader is still well off its highs and below its key moving averages. **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) is approaching an alternate entry of 345.90, but the weekly chart shows wide-and-loose chart action, which makes the pattern flawed.


In other stock market news, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) shot past a 1,250.58 entry. The moves comes after MELI pulled back and tested a prior buy area while holding support at its 21-day exponential moving average. On a day that saw several top stocks close near lows, MELI closed near its session high.


MELI first joined the Leaders list as a quarter position on Feb. 14. It was a raised to a half position Monday, giving MELI a weighting of about 5%.


On the downside, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) slumped nearly 8% after the Food and Drug Administration gave the go-ahead to **Abbott Labs** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) to pair its body-worn glucose monitors with insulin pumps. Previously, it was only Dexcom's continuous glucose monitors that could connect with insulin pumps.


The stock market uptrend resumed Friday after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite powered above their short-term moving averages and found support around their 200-day lines. Exposure can be kept between 60% and 80%, but Monday's weak action reminded investors that sellers are still around.


Market conditions could get volatile again with Powell talking monetary policy on Capitol Hill and the February jobs report on Friday.


Keep starter positions small and don't be afraid to trim your winners. As always, keep losses small if a new buy doesn't go as planned.

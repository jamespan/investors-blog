Stock Market Retreats As Fed Tackles Inflation; These Groups Show Strength Amid Weakness

The stock market finished off session lows, but still suffered a bruising day as the latest Fed minutes revealed a hawkish consensus amid spiraling inflation.




While indexes briefly rallied following the release of the document, the growing clarity on the pace and scale of Fed balance-sheet reductions was a net negative for stocks.


Nasdaq Fares Worst In Stock Market
----------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite fared worst as tech stocks and high price-earnings ratio stocks in general took a beating. The Nasdaq ended the day down 2.2%. However, the fact it found support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) is a positive.


The S&P 500 also fell, albeit by a more moderate 1%. It fell below the [200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/), but that it found buyers at the 21-day exponential moving average was a bit encouraging.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average actually fared best out of the indexes. Its balance of mature blue chips helped it to a slighter decline of 0.4%. It tested the 50-day line, which is sitting below the 200-day line, underlining that stocks in general have been finding it tough in 2022.


The small-cap Russell 2000 dipped 1.4%, but the bears saved the most brutal beatdown for growth stocks. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ended the day with a painful 2.9% loss.


Bearish Action Triggers Outlook Change
--------------------------------------


With both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 selling off in higher volume for a second straight day, and the Nasdaq making a test of the 50-day line, the market outlook has changed.


We have now switched the outlook from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure."


Now is the time to exercise extra caution before making any new buys. In addition, go over your portfolio and make a defensive game plan for every stock you own. Now is a good time to lock in profits or to set a level at which you will unload your holdings.


Remember, at this stage it is not clear how the current rally attempt will unfold. While it has been a bearish week so far, there is still a chance indexes could fight their way higher. Watch how the Dow and Nasdaq handle their tests of the 50-day line.


Balance Sheet Clarity Emerges As Fed Eyes Inflation
---------------------------------------------------


A key unanswered questioned was finally resolved Wednesday with the release of the latest minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee.


Bankers will look to shrink the balance sheet by $95 billion per month, slightly lower than the expected $100 billion.


According to the minutes from the March Fed meeting, FOMC members "generally agreed that monthly caps of about $60 billion for Treasury securities and about $35 billion for agency MBS (mortgage backed securities) would likely be appropriate."


They will phase the $95 billion per month cap in over three months and will likely begin in May.


In addition, the minutes showed that half-percentage-point interest-rates hikes could be in the cards.


The news comes hot on the heels of Federal Reserve Gov. Lael Brainard making hawkish statements in a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Tuesday. Many view Brainard as one of the more dovish committee members.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya believes an aggressive tightening cycle might not necessarily lead to turmoil for stocks.


"Investors, however, won't be aggressive buying these dips in stocks because no one knows (if) the Fed will ease up tightening once growth concerns emerge in the middle of the year," he said in a note to clients.


These Groups Flex Muscles On Stock Market Amid Weakness
-------------------------------------------------------


Not all industry groups were losers despite the painful overall market action. Diversified medical stocks, drugstore firms, tobacco plays and utilities made the best gains Wednesday.



In the diversified medical arena, pharma **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) was one of the best performers. It ended the day with a gain of 4.5% and a new high.


This move powered the stock, which is a member of the prestigious [IBD Leaderboard list](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), out of its buy zone from a 284 entry. It was boosted after Morgan Stanley named it a top pick.


Gaming equipment makers, leisure services, fiber optics firms and enterprise computer software makers fared worst.


This saw sellers turn their ire on **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), which ended the day down 6.4%. The stock knifed below a 133.97 buy point and led to exposure to the stock being trimmed on Leaderboard.

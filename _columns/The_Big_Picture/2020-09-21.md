How The Nasdaq Nearly Erased A 2.5% Plunge
===========================================

The stock market's September swoon continued Monday with a broad decline, especially in cyclical stocks. But the Nasdaq made an impressive recovery.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average gapped below its 50-day moving average and fell 1.8%. It was the latest major index to break below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The Nasdaq composite fell below its 50-day line more than a week ago, and the S&P 500 broke its line on Friday.


Monday marked a fourth-consecutive decline for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, but that doesn't tell half the story of Monday's session.


The S&P 500 reduced a 2.7% early loss to 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite was even more impressive, extinguishing a 2.5% drop to only 0.1%. Credit the technology sector for much of the big bounce.


![MP092120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP092120.jpg)The S&P technology sector — tracked by the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) — rose 0.6% and led the market out of its early difficulties. At one point, the exchange traded fund dropped nearly 2.4% before the late-afternoon burst of buying.


No wonder the Nasdaq, which is [made up of nearly 50% tech stocks](https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/Breakdown/COMP), benefited the most. Software and semiconductor industry groups were among Monday's best performing.


Stock Market Down Broadly
-------------------------


While those rebounds offered reason for hope, the fact remains they weren't so broad. Most stocks fell, after all. Decliners led advancers by nearly 6-to-1 on the NYSE and by more than 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Also, small caps were roiled. The Russell 2000 plummeted 3.4% and made a fresh drop below the 50-day line, little more than a week since it last closed below the 50-day average.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE. Friday's quadruple witching — the expiration of options and futures contracts — caused volume to soar. So, Monday's lower volume shouldn't necessarily be treated as a respite in institutional selling. Nasdaq volume was still higher than on Thursday. The same appeared to be true for NYSE volume.


Stock Market Distribution Still High
------------------------------------


The S&P 500 is burdened with seven [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), and the Nasdaq has five. Investors must remain cautious, being careful to [cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) and avoid most new stock purchases. Monday's partial reversals suggest the selling may subside. For now, IBD is keeping its market outlook at "uptrend under pressure."


Wall Street opened lower after foreign markets sold off broadly, in big part due to coronavirus worries. London's FTSE 100 tumbled 3.4%, the German DAX lost 4.4% and the CAC 40 in Paris plunged 3.7%.


In Europe, British officials are working to draw up new restrictions, while Madrid faces new social distancing measures. After seeing the pandemic ease, many [European nations are experiencing a resurgence in Covid-19 cases](https://apnews.com/0e5766bdb37e735169281fa5a4ff1b3f). In the U.S., [11 states reported more than 1,000 new cases](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-news-09-21-2020-11600676779) on Sunday, as U.S. deaths attributed to the coronavirus neared 200,000.


Most S&P sectors fell, and declines were steeper among cyclical sectors such as materials, energy, industrials and transportation.



Financials also were hit hard, down more than 3%, after news organizations found that some [major banks moved more than $2 trillion in suspicious transactions](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-fall-on-suspicious-money-flows-report/) over a period of nearly 19 years.


The IBD 50 outperformed the market with a 0.4% gain. Its tracking ETF, Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), made a splendid bounce of its own, erasing a drop of more than 2% to close a fraction higher.


Consumer stocks such as **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) and **SciPlay** ([SCPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCPL)) (the [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-small-cap-leader-sciplay-on-breakout-watch/) company) led the IBD 50.

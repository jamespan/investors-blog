Risk Back On? Growth Stocks Thrive, Major Indexes Up In Higher Trade

"Risk on" again, anyone?


Judging by the way the market behaved Wednesday, such a thought may have popped in some investors' heads.


There are reasons to justify it.


Unlike Tuesday, when one key index rose while another fell, the major averages on Wednesday rose in unison.


The Nasdaq composite gained nearly 0.7%. It also wiped away the prior two days' worth of measly losses. The S&P 500 was only a few steps behind, up 0.5%.


Volume grew sharply on both main exchanges. Plus, both major indexes are not far from painting new highs.


The [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/) gained 0.5%. It's up 13.5% for the year, a strong hint that growth is in vogue.


When the market rises in heavier volume than the prior session, it's a good omen for those going long. They show the footprints of the [heavyweight investors](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/687927-i-in-can-slim-methodology.htm) — from mutual funds to pensions, banks to sovereign wealth funds — eager to accumulate stocks.


The problem today, of course, is that even though the March 10 distribution day fell off the count due to time, the count is still high. The Market Pulse shows six distribution days for the Nasdaq alone.


There have been cases when the presence of five or six sharp sell-offs in higher volume was enough to kill the bull market.


Today is not such a case.


The economy isn't growing like gangbusters, but it clearly isn't going off a cliff like it did in the fourth quarter of 2008.


The front-page story on retail sales in Wednesday's paper shows that consumer spending is rebounding.


While the Nasdaq remains locked in a multimonth trading range, that alone should not stop someone from building a great watch list. The IBD Sector Leaders list has expanded in recent weeks. Tuesday's IBD Big Cap 20 screen showed **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)), **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)) and **Moody's** ([MCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCO)) near valid entries.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), meanwhile, represented a positive market reaction to recent [quarterly results](http://news.investors.com/business/041415-747789-jpmorgan-chase-swoons-wells-fargo-stumbles.htm). The stock moved past a 62.97 buy point in big trade. More moves like that would get the Dow Jones industrials, normally a laggard index, to catch up with rival benchmarks.


Indeed, it's the small- and midcap names that are still leading the way. As seen in the Market Indexes table on Page B11, the New America index — which tends to feature small and midcap issues — is thriving with a year-to-date gain near 10%.


The Dow utilities continue to lag, off 4.7% since Jan. 1.

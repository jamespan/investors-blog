Stock Market Falls Again; Bears Give Bulls A Nightmare Before Christmas
========================================================================

The stock market was clobbered again Friday despite a weak, late fightback by the bulls. A few industry groups managed to shine even amid the broader downward pressure.




The S&P 500 ended the session down 1.1%. This means the benchmark index ceded more than 2% for the week and closed below the 50-day moving average. If it fails to rebound back above this key level it would be a worrying development.


The Nasdaq composite ended the day down 1%. The tech-heavy index fared even worse than the S&P 500 as it skidded nearly 3% for the week. After the week's battering it has now lost more than 32% so far in 2022. The Nasdaq closed below the 50-day line the past two days.


Blue chips, which have been an area of relative strength, did not escape the wrath of the rampaging bears. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a loss of nearly 0.9%. After a long and strong period above its major moving averages, a test of the 50-day line could be imminent. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) lagged as did **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), which reports earnings Tuesday.


Volume surged on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE due to quadruple witching. This added [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Decliners outnumbered advancers by around 2-1 on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


Stock Market Today: Small Caps Dig In
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP121622-300x300.jpg)The Russell 2000 small-cap index managed to hold up better than the major indexes as it booked a 0.6% loss. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.9%.


Meanwhile, U.S. private-sector activity retreated further in December amid weaker demand, according to purchasing managers index data from S&P Global. The preliminary composite index fell to 44.6, the lowest in four months. Analysts had expected 46.7.


The report came after the Federal Reserve struck a hawkish tone on interest rates on Wednesday.


With overall sentiment worsening amid rising recession fears, stock market bulls will be hoping that a last-minute Christmas rally can help narrow painful losses. But they could be disappointed because there is not much evidence that the market is oversold.

Industry Groups: These Stocks Shine Amid Carnage
------------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors all suffered. Real estate and consumer discretionary were the worst areas while materials and communication services held up the best.


The performance of the IBD industry groups gave further insight.


On the upside, integrated computer system and desktop software plays were among best performers. Metal products distributors, diversified companies and specialty consumer products also did well.


Downside performance was, of course, heavier. Periodicals, automakers, oil and gas realty trusts, solar stocks and department stores were among the worst.

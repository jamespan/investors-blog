Stock indexes turned in another week of indefinite results, as the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 squabbled over direction for the fourth time in five weeks.




On Friday, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. The Nasdaq lagged with a 0.1% gain.


Small caps led as the S&P 600 drove 0.6% higher to a record high.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. Friday was an expirations day, which often increases trade.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have mostly moved in opposite directions on the weekly charts. The S&P 500 has climbed moderately while the Nasdaq has been basically flat. The Dow has sided with the large cap S&P 500 in each of the past five weeks.


Why the divergence?


About half of the Nasdaq comprises technology stocks vs. about a quarter for the S&P 500.


Over the past five weeks, technology issues have struggled. Data storage stocks dropped 8%; chipmakers, 7%; and biotech, 5%.


Most stocks in those groups are listed on the Nasdaq.


Meanwhile, big gainers included hospital stocks, such as **HCA Healthcare** ([HCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA)) and **Universal Health Services** ([UHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UHS)). They advanced 19% and 11% over the past five weeks. Both are S&P 500 stocks.

Good Week For Apple
-------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) had a solid week, rising five straight days and almost 5% for the week. The stock has a place in the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average.


Apple scored a new high Friday, gaining 2% in volume 42% above average. The stock is extended from a 194.30 buy point.


Shareholders who bought the year-ago breakout at 156.75 could be sitting on a 38% profit. During the run-up, losses never reached the 7% to 8% level that triggers an [IBD sell signal](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/). Apple did fall about 5% under the buy point, testing investors' conviction.


Conviction could've been built with Warren Buffett's help. Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple in each of the past four quarters.


Apple now accounts for 23.5% of Berkshire's assets, making it the biggest position in the portfolio.


Economic Data
-------------


In economic news, the University of Michigan's consumer confidence gauge for August rolled in at 95.3, below the consensus estimate of 97.9 and under the lowest estimate in the range.


Leading indicators for July came in at 0.6%, above views for 0.4%.

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 broke four-week win streaks with the worst session of the week on Friday. Indexes slipped below significant chart levels as the stock market cooled off from its summer rally.




The Nasdaq led the selling with a 2% tumble after major components also suffered their worst days of the week. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fell 1.7%, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) 1.4%, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) 2.5%, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) 3.8%, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) 4.9% and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) more than 2%.


For the week, the Nasdaq reversed lower and lost 2.6%. In addition, the index fell below a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/?refcode=BBB-04262022-2-B-9:04:2022:2Q:NewsLetter:Email:BBB-04262022:na:na:na:na:26:10:2:B:9&j=1566189&sfmc_sub=172274927&l=222_HTML&u=20328680&mid=100016628&jb=1) touching the lows on July 14, July 26 and Thursday.


For its part, the S&P 500 fell 1.3% Friday, its worst day since June 28. It capped a 1.2% weekly loss. The index also broke below a trendline, this one touching lows on July 14, Aug. 9 and Thursday.


On Tuesday, the S&P hit a ceiling right at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/), and the subsequent losses indicate the line is indeed a resistance level.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, off 0.9% Friday, fell below a trendline as well. The index slipped back below the 200-day line after spending a few days above it. The 200-day average roughly coincides with the Dow's 34,000 level.


Stock Market: Small Caps Also Down Sharply
------------------------------------------


Small caps also took a hit, with the Russell 2000 sliding 2.2%.


Volume fell by less than 1% on the Nasdaq despite options expirations Friday. NYSE volume rose, which gave the S&P 500 a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). That's still a minor amount of institutional selling, but right now the stock market's charts are more of a concern.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP_2x1_081922-288x300.jpg)The Nasdaq had climbed nearly 25% from its June 16 low. The S&P 500 had cut more than half its 24.5% bear-market loss before the declines of the past week.


The rally could use a breather, and the stock market losses point to at least a period of rest for the major indexes. That's not necessarily a reason for investors to flee entirely to cash, but do make sure your gains don't evaporate.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed nearly 11 basis points to 2.99%, approaching the 3% level for the first time since July 21. It was the sharpest rise in the benchmark yield since Aug. 5.


St. Louis Fed President James Bullard [told the Wall Street Journal Thursday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-bullard-leans-toward-favoring-0-75-percentage-point-september-rate-rise-11660842768?tpl=cb&adobe_mc=MCMID%3D41634994139940988431829159716067847337%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1660934939) that he is leaning in favor of a 75-basis-point rate increase at the next Fed meeting. Bullard said it "would make sense to continue to get the policy rate higher and into restrictive territory."


And [Bloomberg quoted Richmond Fed President](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-19/barkin-says-fed-will-do-what-it-takes-to-curb-inflation?sref=3zYETA5s#xj4y7vzkg) Thomas Barkin as saying he is committed to bringing down inflation even if it costs a recession.


IBD 50 Falls 1.4%
-----------------



The IBD 50 fell 1.4% on a day when growth plays lagged value in the stock market.


IBD 50 company **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) fell back near its 187.61 [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) buy point. **Commercial Metals** ([CMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMC)) closed below the 42.99 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of the Aug. 10 breakout.


**Sociedad Quimica y Minera** ([SQM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQM)) extended losses below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).Â **Green Brick Partners** ([GRBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRBK)) gapped down to a 9% loss after JPM Securities downgraded the homebuilder from market outperform to market perform.


The weight of the market fell mainly on consumer, solar, bank and travel stocks.

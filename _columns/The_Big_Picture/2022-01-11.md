  Nasdaq, S&P 500 Notch Another Nice Reversal, But Oil Steals The Show; Will The VIX Climb?

Two positive reversals in a row by the stock market's major indexes suggest the sell-off in early January got somewhat overdone. The Nasdaq barely edged the S&P 500 in terms of daily performance. Yet neither could hold a candle to Tuesday's meaty gain by crude oil.




Monday's swing off the intraday lows was one of the most dramatic in months. So, Tuesday's move off morning lows — coming amid a Senate confirmation hearing for a new four-year term for Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve — proved milder.


At this stage, it's still far from clear if big fund managers are collectively putting more capital to work. Hence, IBD's current outlook for stocks — uptrend under pressure — stays put.


This means be extra choosy with your new buys.


The Nasdaq composite turned an early 0.7% loss into a 1.4% gain by day's end. That's the bullish kind of swing you'd like to see when the market is in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-fed-policy-decision-time-to-get-back-in/). However, at 15,153, the tech-weighted index still lies more than 400 points below its close of 15,565 on Dec. 15 — the day in which both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 posted a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).


The Nasdaq Today: Intermediate Correction
-----------------------------------------



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP011122-208x300.jpg)From that perspective, the S&P 500 sure looks healthier.


At 4713, the large-cap benchmark has returned above its own close of 4709 set on its own [Dec. 15 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-fed-policy-decision-time-to-get-back-in/). What's more, the index, in snapping a five-session losing streak, lumbered back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Plus, it's now sitting just 2% beneath an all-time peak of 4818.


In contrast, the Nasdaq has now fallen more than 10% off its peak. This makes for a healthy pullback, on the order of what IBD likes to call an intermediate-level correction. It's not as deep as a bear market, but not as light as a mild pullback on the order of a 4% to 9% decline.


Small caps have also struggled since the Russell 2000 notched new highs during the first week of November. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund, up 1% on Tuesday, is still looking up at its own 50-day moving average.


Plus, the ETF would need to rally more than 12% to reach its all-time highs.



Volume fell sharply on both major exchanges.


Top industry groups for the day naturally included oil and gas companies. According to Oilprice.com, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures jumped 3.8% to $81.21 a barrel. News outlets reported efforts by the Biden White House to reduce the area of land in Alaska open to oil drilling as a reversal of former President Trump's legislative actions that opened up 82% of the National Petroleum Reserve for drilling.

It now boasts a 12.2% gain year to date.

Indeed, breakouts in general are sparse in number. Yet **Oasis Petroleum** ([OAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OAS)) has done well since it cleared a [2-1/2-month cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) at 98.70 on Sept. 27. Shares of the Leaderboard half-position play are trying to extend gains after a month-long challenge of support at the 50-day moving average.


In the third quarter of 2021, Oasis' earnings vaulted to $3.16 a share vs. 22 cents a year earlier. Sales lifted 48% to $402 million.


As stocks gained ground, the surge in long-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields took a break, at least for one day. Cboe data showed the 10-year note's yield falling 3 basis points to 1.74%. That's still up 23 basis points from 1.51% on the final day of 2021, however.

Beyond Nasdaq: What Will U.S. Treasury Yields Do?
-------------------------------------------------


David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com, advises investors to be prepared for greater price volatility this year. The reasons? One, we've clearly entered a new period in which interest rates are likely to keep rising.


A weekly chart of the 10-year bond yield shows a massive drop in yields from the fall of 2018 until early 2020, when coronavirus hit the globe. The market saw yields plummet from 3.24% to 0.50%. Using a typical 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of that slide, Keller notes that there is potential for the 10-year bond yield to rise to at least as high as 2.16% in the near term.


Higher inflation numbers could stoke a more hawkish Federal Reserve. On Wednesday, [the latest monthly data on U.S. consumer prices](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) hits the Street.


"A lot of investors are surprised by the strength of commodities, such as oil," Keller told IBD. "But I've learned that you never confuse the bottom of the chart page as support and the top of the page as resistance."


In other words, respect the trend until it's clearly broken.


The recent move up in rates comes amid forecasts by at least two banks, **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), that the Federal Reserve will raise the cost of money not simply three times this year but four times.


The VIX
-------


Keller, who spent years performing quantitative and institutional portfolio research at Fidelity Investments before joining StockCharts.com, also expects market volatility to grow more this year than in both 2019 and in 2021, based on an analysis of the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/).


The VIX, down 5.6% on Tuesday to 18.32, saw its latest sharp spike in early December, when it hit a multi-month high of 35.32. That, of course, hardly compares to some of the huge spikes we saw in 2020, especially the move to 85.47 in March 2020. But he's counting on 2022 to be a year in which the VIX perhaps spends more time above the 20 level than below it.


"A lot can happen in the the next 12 to 24 months in terms of how the Fed implements its new interest-rate policy," he said. "If we see the market go into a 10% or 20% correction, then I could see the Fed make tweaks. I think we're rotating into a more volatile environment vs. 2021 that reflects elevated uncertainty."

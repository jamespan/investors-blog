Stocks Lose Most Of Gains; When Will Trough End For Starbucks?
===============================================================

U.S. stock indexes stepped lightly Friday as volume once again sagged while prices rose.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 booked puny gains of less than 0.1% after negative reversals erased first-hour gains of almost 1%. The Nasdaq turned lower just as it touched the 50-day moving average, a move that underscored the weak price action. The IBD 50 slipped 0.2%.


Volume declined on both major exchanges. The distribution-day count eased as the Sept. 9 distribution day fell off because of time.

**IBD'S TAKE**: *The [investing skill that pros would choose](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/which-investing-talent-is-the-one-wise-investors-want/) is different from the one amateurs dream of having.*

Recently, volume has been declining on up days and rising on down days. This is bearish action, showing that sellers have more firepower behind them than the buyers do. Yet, the bears haven't been able to make much of the situation. At their nadirs, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 pulled about 3.5% off their highs and now are down only about 2%.


![mp101416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP101416.png)Market action has been more like a series of annoying speed bumps than a smooth ride up or down.


Economic news Friday illustrated part of the market's problem. Even the news is inconsistent.


A day after China reported a bearish 10% plunge in September exports, the world's second-biggest economy reported a bullish figure: Factory output prices in September grew for the first time in five years.


China will report third-quarter GDP on Wednesday. (The first reading on U.S. third quarter GDP will be released Oct. 28.)


U.S. economic reports delivered their own mixed verdict.


The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge ticked down to 87.9, which was more than 4% lower than the consensus estimate.


But retail sales for September popped 0.6%, matching views and ending two months of misses.


Within the retail sales data, receipts at restaurants and bars increased 0.8%, the biggest advance since February. IBD's restaurants industry group is in the middle of the pack among 197 groups. Few restaurants have strong ratings.


For example, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), often a leader in the group, is now a laggard. The stock has been consolidating for a year and carries a Relative Price Strength Rating of 15. This means about 85% of the stocks in IBD's database are outperforming Starbucks in price performance.


Starbucks is 17% off its high and trading near the bottom of its long consolidation. The stock has sunk to the 52 and 53 price level several times -- February, June, September and now in October. Previous yearlong troughs for Starbucks eventually led to vigorous climbs.


For the week, the IBD 50 sliced off 1.7%; the Nasdaq, 1.5%; and the S&P 500, 1%.

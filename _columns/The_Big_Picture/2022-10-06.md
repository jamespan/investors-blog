The stock market fell for a second straight day Thursday, as the major stock indexes ended with moderate to heavy losses ahead of [September's payroll report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/why-friday-jobs-report-may-extend-this-sp-500-rally/) due out Friday morning.




Amid a stock market that continues to search for a market bottom, [recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/anet-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-tech-leader/) **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) is a potential stock market leader to watch.


Jobless Claims, Treasury Yields, Jobs Report
--------------------------------------------


The Labor Department's first-time unemployment claims came out ahead of Thursday's open. Initial claims rose to 219,000, above estimates that called for a rise to 203,000 from 193,000 in the previous week, according to Econoday.


The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 3.82% Thursday. The benchmark yield fell as low as 3.56% this week before rebounding. Last week, it briefly topped 4%, which hadn't been done for more than decade. The yield is tracking toward its 10th straight weekly advance.


[September's jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/why-friday-jobs-report-may-extend-this-sp-500-rally/)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MP100622-289x300.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/why-friday-jobs-report-may-extend-this-sp-500-rally/) is due out ahead of Friday's open, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The U.S. economy is expected to grow by 250,000 jobs in September, down from August's 315,000 increase, per Econoday estimates. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.7%. A soft jobs report would strengthen the case for Fed moderation and lower the risk that aggressive tightening will cause a global financial market train wreck.


**Conagra** ([CAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAG)), **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) and **McCormick** ([MKC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKC)) gave key earnings reports Thursday. [Conagra](https://www.investors.com/news/top-packaged-food-stocks-lamb-weston-and-conagra-to-report-earnings/) reversed from early gains, ending down 3.7%, while Constellation fell 1.5% despite [topping second-quarter earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/constellation-brands-earnings-q2-2022/). And McCormick shares declined 1.2% after giving up big early gains.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.1%, while the S&P 500 closed down 1%. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.7%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.6%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain above their latest lows, so [the rally attempt remains intact](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom-this-signal-marks-all-major-lows/).


Volume rose on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and appeared to be lower on the NYSE.


Top growth stocks ended at session lows, as Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.5%. The ETF is trying to rebound from Sept. 26's 52-week low. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), energy stocks were among the best performers, as U.S. oil prices continued to rally. Oil names **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) and **Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) logged respective gains of 4.1% and 2.9%. Both energy stocks decisively reclaimed their 50-day lines this week.


U.S. oil prices extended this week's rebound, rising more than 1% Thursday, with West Texas Intermediate futures trading near $89 a barrel. On Wednesday, OPEC+ agreed to slash production by up to 2 million barrels a day, the [biggest cut since April 2020.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-agrees-to-biggest-oil-production-cut-since-start-of-pandemic-11664978144)


Stock Market Rally Attempt Continues
------------------------------------


Thursday was Day 4 of the stock market's rally attempt, so investors are now patiently awaiting a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), which will signify the beginning of a new uptrend. Be mindful that not all follow-throughs work, so it's important to raise exposure slowly and methodically, as the uptrend proves itself.


In the meantime, continue to build watchlists of top-performing stocks, like Arista Networks and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)). Check out [last Thursday's The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dive-kills-fledgling-rally-attempt-amd-apple-nvidia-tesla-tumble/) for why Vertex is a stock market leader to watch. Vertex is rapidly approaching its latest buy point.


One challenge to forming a watchlist during a correction is that, as you wait for a follow-through day, stock charts may change. That means some bases among your watchlist stocks may deteriorate. So updating is important. One strategy is to keep a list of stocks that are at or close to [real breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Another list might have attractive stocks that are further below buy points or in consolidations that haven't matured into [valid bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


Check out [IBD Stock Lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), like the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/), for additional stock ideas.

Arista Is A Potential Stock Market Leader
-----------------------------------------


Arista Networks is a potential stock market leader to watch during the stock market's latest rally attempt.


[The company provides](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/anet-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-tech-leader/) cloud networking software and hardware and is expected to benefit from the growth of data centers.


Arista's biggest revenue growth driver has been high-end Ethernet switches that speed up communications among racks of computer servers packed into data centers. Two of the company's biggest customers have been Dow Jones software giant **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and Facebook owner **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)).


[In the latest quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/anet-stock-arista-earnings-arista-stock-q22022/), earnings and sales jumped 59% and 49%, respectively, Earnings and sales growth accelerated for a third straight quarter, which are bullish fundamental metrics common in historical stock market winners.



ANET stock rose nearly 0.5% Thursday, extending a win streak to four sessions and moving back above the 50-day line.


There are a couple interpretations for Arista's stock chart. Some investors may see a larger cup with handle forming with a 132.97 buy point. Another viewpoint is a soon-to-be seven-week double bottom within a larger consolidation that has a 126.80 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


Either way, the stock is showing big stock market outperformance during a difficult environment. The best way to view this positive divergence is to use the relative strength line. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. An [RS line at new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) during a stock market correction is a key indicator of technical strength.

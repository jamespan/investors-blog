 Major stock indexes ended quietly lower Wednesday, but it was a far from quiet session in the bond and gold markets as Wall Street decided to play a little defense.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 eased 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average gave back 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose from Monday's levels, resulting in a mild [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.

The Nasdaq slumped 1.8% in higher volume on March 21. Another sharp decline was when the index lost 2.6% in fast turnover on May 17. In both instances, it didn't take long for the stock market to recover. When distribution days start to cluster, it can be problematic, but it's not happening yet. In fact, Tuesday was the first distribution day since that 2.6% sell-off.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) turned in a solid showing, rising 0.4%, helped by strength in **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)), **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **Medidata Solutions** ([MDSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDSO)), which showed gains of 7% to 9%.


Gold for August delivery settled at its highest level since November, ending at $1,297.50 an ounce, up 1.2%. The move prompted a 1.1% gainÂ for SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)). The popular exchange-traded fund closed at 123.03. It's trying to clear a base with a 123.17 buy point.


Among gold miners, **Royal Gold** ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD)) gained 1.5% to 80.38. It's working on a big cup-with-handle base.


Meanwhile, the bond market saw more inflows as the 10-year Treasury yield fell 4 basis points to 2.14%.


Wall Street is anxiously awaiting the outcome of several events later in the week, including congressional testimony from fired FBI Director James Comey on Thursday. Abroad, the U.K. general election and the European Central Bank monetary policy meeting are occurring in the coming days. ABC News reported late Tuesday that Comey will stop short of saying President Trump interfered with the agency's investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.


Oil and gas stocks outperformed as July-delivery U.S. crude oil rose 79 cents, or 1.7%, to settle at $48.19, but bullish charts in the sector are hard to find after sharp sell-offs. Oil strengthened ahead of U.S. inventory data Wednesday that could show a ninth straight weekly decline in crude supplies.


The bulls like the fact that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are trading tightly and holding near highs. Leading growth stocks are showing similar action, holding above key support levels. But it's still a complacent market, and complacent markets can be tricky to navigate.


Currently, the market landscape is home to many extended stocks, i.e., stocks too late to buy after big price runs. Be careful not to chase. Instead, look for instances of support at the 50-day moving average (on daily charts) or 10-week moving average (on weekly charts). After a growth stock breaks out of a base, the strongest ones tend to show supporting action after a pullback. Pullbacks in light volume and support in heavy volume is ideal, but sometimes it doesn't always work out that way.


Among the day's movers, **Wal-Mart Stores** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) was a laggard in the Dow, down 1.7%, after **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) announced a discounted Prime membership for low-income shoppers in government-assistance programs.


Department store operators have been hurt badly by booming online competition, and they underperformed badly again Tuesday after **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) warned that gross margins would be worse than what was forecast in February. IBD's department store industry group was the day's worst performer, down around 5%. Nine out of the top-10 worst performing groups Tuesday came from the retail sector.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) capped its fourth gain in five sessions ahead of its earnings report after the close. Shares gained nearly 3% to 70.17, but shares fell around 3% in after-hours trading after the restaurant chain reported earnings.

Just as the intensity and concern of the coronavirus build, U.S. stocks continued to build a bullish case on Monday.




The Nasdaq striped the bears with a 1.1% advance and ran into new high ground. Its gain outshone gains of 0.7% by the S&P 500 and almost 0.7% by the Russell 2000. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose roughly 0.4%.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) leapt 1.3% to snap a three-session losing streak.


The major indexes stumbled out of the gate as investors reacted to burgeoning deaths and known infections for the Wuhan, China-originated coronavirus. Yet 10 minutes into the session, most of the key equity indexes reversed into positive ground and kept rallying steadily into the close. Weak start, strong finish? That's a signature step of a bull market's dance.

Volume fell mildly on both main exchanges — down 3% on the Nasdaq, 7% lower on the NYSE.


A gain by the growth-centered Nasdaq indexes in lower turnover vs. the prior session has felt like a rarity lately.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP021020-235x300.jpg)If you zoom in on the Nasdaq's daily chart in the [General Market Indicators PDF](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), which is found at both the [Market Trend page on Investors.com](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) and at the bottom of each day's Big Picture column a few hours after the market close, you'll witness a flurry of up days in the Nasdaq composite in either above-average turnover or higher volume than the prior session.


You just need two words to describe this phenomenon in charts: institutional accumulation.


No tradable rally in growth stocks can exist without the spirited buying of top-rated companies by mutual funds, banks, pension funds, university endowments, large investment advisors and the like.


Beyond Nasdaq: 4 More Reasons For The Bullish Outlook
-----------------------------------------------------


1. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq on Monday rose enough to render the Jan. 31 distribution day obsolete. Why? From that day's close of 9150.94, the index has rallied as much as 5%. Such a solid gain implies that the Jan. 31 sell-off painted more of a picture of short-term profit-taking then an arenawide rush for the exits.
2. Other evidence of unusually heavy institutional selling is diminishing. The [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) for the S&P 500 fell to three days Monday after the Jan. 3 distribution day expired on time.
3. The market's internals remain rosy. On Monday, winners beat losers by a healthy 3-2 margin on the Nasdaq. New highs on the same exchange have outmatched new lows by nearly a 4-1 margin over the past three trading sessions through Friday. On the NYSE? The ratios have proved even more bullish. (At [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), you can see the new highs lists statistics for both exchanges and leading sectors within the lists by adjusting the month and date within the webpage URL.)
4. Investor giddiness is not widespread. The [bullish ratio among stock market pundits](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) surveyed every week by Investors Intelligence has plunged in the past two weeks from a 2020 high of 59.4%. And no wonder. The World Health Organization reportedly called the number of coronavirus cases outside China as possibly only the "tip of the iceberg."


Good Bull Markets Present Fresh Ideas
-------------------------------------


Meanwhile, a solid bull market should present new ideas and new breakouts on a consistent basis.

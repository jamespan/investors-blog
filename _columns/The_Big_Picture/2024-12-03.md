  Small Caps Pressured, But Stock Market Holds Near Highs; Top Growth Stocks Shine Again

Small caps lagged in the stock market Tuesday, but several growth stocks outperformed once again below the surface. One of them was [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), which cleared a flat base with a 602.95 buy point in higher volume.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index slipped 0.7% and looks poised for a test of the 2,400 level, which happens to coincide with the index's 10-day moving average. But selling was contained in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which eased 0.2%.




A 2% decline in **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) weighed down the Dow Jones index. But the weakness was largely offset by strength in technology names in the Dow like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Amazon is just past the 5% buy zone after reclaiming a 201.20 alternative buy point early last week. Now it has its sights set on another alternate entry at 215.90. Apple, meanwhile, is still in a buy zone from an entry of 237.49. But after 12 gains in 15 sessions, the stock could be ready for a pullback. Nvidia continues to hold support at its 10-week moving average


**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) edged higher in the Dow ahead of its earnings report after the close. But shares popped 5% in extended trading after the enterprise software giant reported better than expected [earnings, revenue and operating margin](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-news-q32024/).


Stock Market Today
------------------


Some buying near the close helped lift the Nasdaq composite to a gain of 0.4% as leading growth stocks like **Astera Labs** ([ALAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALAB)), **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) ended with gains ranging from 7% to 12%.

AppLovin was one of the first stocks out of the gate when the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 reversed sharply higher on Sept. 11. AppLovin topped a 91.91 buy point on that day, soaring 13% in huge volume, and never looked back. Two days earlier, Palantir broke out over an alternate entry of 33.13.


The S&P 500 inched up less than 0.1% Tuesday. Breadth was negative on both main exchanges, but not heavily, with decliners outnumbering advancers by less than 2-to-1. Volume fell from Monday's totals.

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury reversed slightly higher after testing a key support level around 4.17%. But the yield hasn't recovered much after plunging more than 14 points on Nov. 25. That's when President-elect Donald Trump nominated Wall Street veteran Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. Bessent is expected to keep a tight leash on deficits and is also viewed as a moderate when it comes to tariffs.


The odds for another 25-basis-point cut at the Dec. 17-18 Federal Reserve policy meeting have increased in recent days. Traders now see a 70% chance of a rate cut after Fed Gov. Christopher Waller on Monday said he's leaning toward a rate cut. But he said he's also concerned about sticky inflation.


Last week, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, came in at a 2.8% annual increase. That was in line with estimates, but above September's reading of 2.7%. It's the number the Fed wants to see closer to 2%.


What To Do Now
--------------


The stock market uptrend continues to show signs of underlying strength, but the crop of actionable stocks has gotten a lot smaller. As noted earlier, the big leaders started coming out in September. Leaderboard added **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) and Meta Platforms on Sept. 13. **Axon Enterprise** ([AXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXO)) was added on Sept. 12.


There's not much to do if you're holding some big winners since September. But if you've trimmed some winners, reallocating capital has become more challenging. If you see a stock building a base that's near a proper buy point, make sure it's one of the leaders in the group. The risk now is that stocks building bases could be the laggard performers in a group.


In the enterprise software group, **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)) offers a good example. The stock on Tuesday cleared an early entry in an eight-week base, but it's generally been a laggard with a middling [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-relative-strength/) of 76.


Buying leaders on pullbacks is perfectly sound strategy. The issue here is that with so many extended stocks, most are still holding well above their 50-day and 10-week lines. Buying a group leader after a pullback to the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has generally worked well. But it's a riskier entry.



**Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), **Fiverr** ([FVRR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FVRR)), **Macom Technology** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) and oil and gas producer **LandBridge** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)) are recent examples of stocks that have done well after recent bounces off the 21-day line.


**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), meanwhile, is still a stock market leader as it tests support at the 10-week line for the second time after an earnings breakout Sept. 10.


In the semiconductor sector, chip foundry **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) gave a buy signal Monday when it jumped above its 50-day line.

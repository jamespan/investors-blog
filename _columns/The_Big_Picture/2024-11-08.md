The stock market ended a banner week sharply higher on the ebullience surrounding the election victory of Donald Trump. Now a fresh inflation reading and U.S. retail sales data is due.


The Nasdaq composite ended Friday with a slim 0.1% gain. However, the true story was the tech-heavy index's blockbuster weekly lift of 5.7%, the best week since March 2022. It has now risen in eight of the past nine weeks and sits well above its [50-day moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) The Nasdaq now holds a sizzling year-to-date gain of 28.5%.




The S&P 500 closed at record levels after rising 0.4% Friday. It snapped a two-week losing streak as it booked a weekly gain of 4.7%. The benchmark index bounced off its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and is now up 25.7% in 2024.


Advancers led decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, with hundreds of issues notching new 52-week highs. Additionally, the Oct. 31 distribution day came off the S&P 500 [because the index climbed more than 5% from that day's close](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average tested the 44,000 level and closed at fresh heights after notching a Friday gain of 0.6%. The big news here was **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) making its debut as it replaced **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) on the vaunted index. It was a gently ignominious debut for the AI stock as ended the day down 0.8%.


Small caps outperformed on the stock market, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.7% Friday and turning in a muscular 8.7% weekly lift. It was its best week since April 2020. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) jumped 3.2% for the day and surged 11.5% for the week.


Trump Rally Continues, But Inflation Data Looms
-----------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP110824-287x300.jpg)Stocks rallied furiously the past week as the election results removed a key overhang. And with President-elect Trump expected to pursue pro-growth policies, such as loosening policy on dealmaking, further gains could be in store. The latest Fed meeting was also benign.


However, the coming week will see a fresh inflation reading, and negative news on this front could give the stock market bulls reasons for pause. The consumer price index for October drops on Wednesday, with headline CPI seen rising 2.4% year over year, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). This would be the same as the prior reading. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy, is expected to hold steady with a 3.3% annualized lift.


Producer price index data will be released Thursday, with economists expecting a year-over-year gain of 1.8% in the headline data. Other noteworthy economic reports include U.S. retail sales data, which drops Friday. This should give additional insight into the health of the all-important American consumer.


There are also a few [noteworthy earnings reports in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/cava-stock-shopify-cisco-systems-rally-earnings-reports/). These include [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) name **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)).


Tesla Retakes $1 Trillion Level
-------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday mostly higher](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Utilities and real estate fared the best, while communication services and materials lagged the most. The tech sector fell slightly.

Telecom infrastructure stocks, fiber optics firms and specialty financial services plays all had good days. The automakers group also had a good day, boosted by a gain of more than 8% for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) as it [moved back above a $1 trillion market cap](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-1-trillion-market-cap-for-first-time-since-2022/)Â for the first time since 2022.


Security stocks also stood out, boosted by [the performance of Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) name **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)). The Taser maker soared nearly 30% after [the firm smashed earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/axon-stock-soars-axon-earnings-q3-guidance-raised/) and gave sunny guidance.


On the flip side, TV stocks, computer networking plays, solar energy companies and metals miners were among the worst performers.

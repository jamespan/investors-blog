Stock Indexes Erase Early Losses; Michael Kors Climbs Steadily
===============================================================

Stocks rebounded in the final 90 minutes Friday, turning moderate losses into moderate gains.

  

The Nasdaq rose 0.5% after being down 0.6%. The S&P 500 added 0.4%, while the small-cap S&P 600 retook its 200-day line with a 0.8% thrust. The IBD 50 gained 0.5%.

  

Volume fell on both major exchanges, despite expirations in options. Expirations will often lift volume.

  

With the Market Pulse wearing the correction label for the longest period since 2008, and recent breakouts mostly fading, there isn't any reason to be tempted to trade this market. If an investor's temperament is naturally optimistic and aggressive, doing nothing can be difficult. Yet, that's exactly what this market calls for.

  

Wait for a bullish trend in the general market. Then look for fundamentally strong stocks breaking out of patterns.

  

Right now, breakouts that act like breakouts are rare. This month, about two dozen stocks with Composite Ratings of 90 or better have cleared buy points. However, only two are now above the 5% buy zone â€” railcar maker **Trinity Industries** ([TRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRN)) and aircraft seat maker **B/E Aerospace** ([BEAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAV)).

  

Many are either moving sideways in the 5% buy zone or have sagged below the buy point.

  

This kind of action doesn't create any expectations that a change in market dynamics is near. However, it's a mistake to trust expectations. As long as the market doesn't undercut its recent lows, a follow-through day is always a possibility.

  

At this point, a positive change in the market might seem and even be far-fetched. But investors should remain flexible to the possibility of change.

  

If the market does shift back into an uptrend, the potential for a slew of breakouts is high. Many strong stocks have had time to form bases.

  

For example, apparel marketer **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) popped 1.58 to 92.85 Friday to close just over its 10-week moving average. Volume was mediocre. The important element, though, is that the stock is fairly far along in a base-on-base pattern. The company will report quarterly results May 28 before the market open.

  

Other stocks that broke out recently and sagged back under the buy point could do better on a second try in a strong market uptrend.

  

Economic news was mixed to negative Friday.

  

The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey missed not just the Street's consensus but the lowest number in the estimate range.

  

Housing starts in April, meanwhile, popped over expectations, but apartment building accounted for virtually all of the increase. Homebuilder stocks didn't show much of a reaction.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq added 0.5% while the S&P 500 was virtually flat. The IBD 50 advanced 0.9% for the week.

Why The Bad News For The Dow Wasn't Just Its 1.6% Tumble
=========================================================

Financial stocks led a sell-off Tuesday that saw the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average break below significant levels.




Indexes bounced a bit in the final half-hour, just as the Dow's loss had swelled to 2%.


The S&P 500 slid 1.2% while the Dow average lost 1.6%. Both indexes left a bruise on their charts, as they fell below the horizontal price ranges they had crafted over the past two weeks. After that period of direction-searching, the indication Tuesday was that more declines were likely.


The Dow also closed slightly below its 50-day moving average. That line has been trending lower since late March.  The industrials, which have struggled to make headway consistently in 2018, are now mildly negative for the year.

The composite closed in the middle of the day's price range and still has a 7.1% increase for the year. Semiconductor, data storage and other technology industry groups outperformed.


Volume rose, an almost foregone conclusion after Friday's trading slowed ahead of the Memorial Day weekend. The higher volume added a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) to the Nasdaq and S&P 500, and the latter now has a weighty seven days of high-volume declines.


Still, the selling was concentrated mainly on banking, financial and foreign stocks. The SPDR Financial ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) slid 3.3%, breaking below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Superregional and money-center banking industry groups were the day's worst performing, down 3.9% and 3.4%, respectively.


Financials became the casualties after a political crisis emerged in Italy. President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the appointment of a finance minister who supports Italy leaving the euro. Instead, Mattarella named as prime minister-designate a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who supports the eurozone. Worries that Italy may leave the eurozone caused uncertainty in Europe's financial markets, and on Wall Street.


This ETF Gets Hammered
----------------------


IShares MSCI Europe Financials ([EUFN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EUFN)) was atop the [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=up) losers table, down 5.3% in volume nearly 10 times more than usual.


That wasn't the only factor hitting financials. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield tumbled 16 basis points to 2.77%. Just over a week ago, the yield was above 3% at four-year highs. The yield curve tightened, which directly impacts banks' margins.


**JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) [added to the sector's worries](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-fall-italy-spain-political-turmoil-eurozone/). JPMorgan warned that second-quarter trading revenue so far is running about flat from a year ago. Morgan Stanley said its key wealth management division saw activity slow in March and stay slow in April and May.


Trade anxieties are one reason for the pullback. On Tuesday, the White House said it will [impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-donald-trump-readies-tariffs/) by June 15.


With the big shift in yields, stocks sensitive to interest rates outperformed. The Dow utilities average rose 0.1%. Dividend-rich assets such as utility stocks compete with bonds for yield. The SPDR Dow Jones REIT ([RWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RWR)) and iShares U.S. Real Estate ([IYR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYR)) each rose 0.3%.


How The IBD 50 Stocks Fared
---------------------------


The sector-focused nature of Tuesday's selling was reflected in leading stocks. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell less than 0.6%, and the bulk of selling in the IBD 50 was in payment processing, brokers, other financials and biotechs.


**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) climbed past the 63.52 buy point of a cup base in heavy volume but closed below the entry. The relative strength line made a new high, a positive sign. The base is late stage, which makes it riskier. Mizuho Securities reiterated a buy rating with a price target of 70. A Mizuho analyst said Micron should benefit from tight supplies of DRAM memory chips for PCs.


Small caps trimmed losses as the Russell 2000 closed with a 0.2% decline and the S&P 600 not even 0.1% lower. That's impressive, considering that about 18% of the Russell is financials, one of its largest sectors along with technology and health care.

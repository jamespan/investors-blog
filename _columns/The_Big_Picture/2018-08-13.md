Turkey Currency Crisis Weighs As Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq Fade, Close Near Lows

The Turkey currency crisis weighed on the stock market again Monday as sellers came into the market during the final half-hour of trading to quash an afternoon rebound. The selling wasn't intense, but the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended near session lows.




For the bulls, it was a disappointing performance on the heels of a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 Friday. But the bulls also know that the confirmed uptrend is still very much intact.


Turkey Currency Crisis Fuels Selling
------------------------------------


Wall Street continued to ponder the sell-off in the Turkish lira and the possibility for contagion. After crashing nearly 21% last week, iShares MSCI Turkey ([TUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TUR)) lost another 11% Monday.


The stock market basically followed the path of the Turkish lira. The currency rebounded in premarket trading after last week's shellacking, but gains quickly faded. That's around the time the major stock indexes started to bleed. Stocks recovered a bit in the afternoon even as sentiment in Turkey stayed weak, but major stock indexes closed with a whimper.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MP_4x3_081318-208x300.jpg)After falling 0.6% intraday, the Dow Jones industrial average ended with a loss of 0.5%. The S&P closed near its session lows, falling 0.4%. Selling was never intense in the Nasdaq composite. It ended lower by 0.2%.


Small caps took some heat as the Russell 2000 gave back 0.7%. More notably, the small-cap index closed below its 50-day moving average. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) performed mostly in line with the broad market, down 0.6%. **Nanometrics** ([NANO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NANO)) was the star of the day, surging 8% to 45.17. The weekly chart shows a [cup-with-handle breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/nanometrics-stock-nears-buy-point/) over a 43.10 entry. The 5% buy zone goes up to 45.25.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost 0.7% Friday in higher volume, resulting in a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for each index. But the distribution-day count for each index isn't daunting by any means. At this point, the overall price action of leading growth stocks trumps mild signs of institutional selling in the major stock indexes.


Bull Case Still Holds Water
---------------------------


Turkey. Slowing global momentum. China trade war fears. Interest rate hikes by the Fed. The bears are hanging their hats on all four talking points. But amid a lot of scary headlines, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are only 1% off their recent highs. And plenty of institutional-quality growth stocks continue to boast bullish charts.


Some like **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH))and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are setting up in bases, while other high-quality names like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) are holding gains smartly after recent breakouts. So are several IBD 50 names like **Ligand** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)), **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)), and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)).


In the retail sector, RH notched its seventh gain in eight sessions. Shares rose 5% to 151.62. It's working on the right side of a cup-shaped base with a 164.39 buy point.


Homebuilders were a sore spot Monday as the group lost nearly 3%. Broad-based weakness was due, in part, by comments Friday from real estate brokerage firm **Redfin** ([RDFN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDFN)) about demand softness in some key markets.


Gold stayed on a harsh downtrend amid more strength in the U.S. dollar. SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) slumped 1.5% to a fresh 52-week low. **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) crashed through its 50-day moving average, falling around 7.5% in heavy volume.

Stock indexes on Thursday gave back all of the big gains from the previous session as worries about Europe's economic situation intensified.


The Nasdaq dropped 2%, while the S&P 500 lost 2.1%. The IBD 50 flopped 2.6%.


Volume fell across the board.


Europe took over the franchise of anxiety Thursday on a report that Germany's exports fell 5.8% in August, the biggest drop since January 2009. It added another brick to the wall of worry that Europe could slip into recession.


The market's failure to keep any part of Wednesday's big gains raises questions. The chief question is whether or not the indexes have found their short-term lows. The indexes barely avoided fresh lows Thursday.


The Nasdaq's performance in the past couple of weeks has been emphatically negative. The 50-day line was lost, and attempts to retake it have failed.


For IBD-style investors, the correction is not much of a problem. With IBD's market outlook in correction mode since the close on Oct. 1, disciplined investors have by now raised cash while keeping only stocks that are still working.


For example, if a stock is moving sideways or up, there might be no compelling reason to sell it. However, this is not the time to add to current holdings or make fresh stock buys.


Losers led winners by a 6-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and by about 7 to 1 on the NYSE Thursday.


Ratios like that make every buy a long shot.


Good action among higher-rated stocks also is hard to find.


On Thursday, **BRF** ([BRFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRFS)) advanced 2% in strong volume. The Brazilian provider of meat and dairy products notched its sixth straight gain. The food sector was No. 2 among 33 sectors in Thursday's IBD. Yet this is not the place where bulls usually look for aggressive and sustained market leadership.


If there is a bright spot in the market, it might be sentiment. Financial headlines have taken on an urgent, panicked tone. Words and phrases like "gloom," "worries," "flashing sell," "bear market" and "recession" dominated the headlines in the online financial columns the past couple of days. Bullish sentiments in columns are hard to find.


Normally, that would serve as a contrarian indicator. However, sentiment indicators don't come with a clock. It isn't clear how deep the market will bend before it either breaks or finds support.


The put-call ratio closed at 1.08 Thursday, a level often associated with short-term lows.

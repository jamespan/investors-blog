How you viewed the stock market's performance on Tuesday may have depended on what industrial sectors are more heavily weighted in your portfolio.


Have you been playing the "cash into trash" turnaround seen in commodity stocks? If yes, you likely high-fived your trading buddy or your dog. Or are you heavy in tech stocks? Then maybe no high-fives today.


![MP-041916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP-041916-154x300.jpg)The stock market gave mixed vibes on Tuesday. A 0.3% gain by the S&P 500, on top of Monday's 0.7% advance, offset a disappointing 0.4% decline by the Nasdaq composite. Small caps kept apace, with the S&P 600 also up 0.3%. The Dow transportation average ran 1.3% higher. The Philadelphia semiconductor index sank 1.2%.


The S&P 500 finished above 2100 for the first time in 2016. All throughout last year, the large-cap benchmark had supreme difficulty mounting a meaningful advance past that milestone.


Volume jumped on both major exchanges, which meant that the Nasdaq chalked up a fifth distribution day, or bout of heavy professional selling. That's not the kind of day an investor going long wants to see, especially after the Market Pulse's current outlook saw an upgrade on April 13 to "Uptrend resumes" from "Uptrend under pressure."


Tuesday's 0.4% drop is in fact the smallest decline among the five distribution days that currently count over the past 25 trading sessions. Nevertheless, it's a relatively high level of institutional profit-taking that should not be ignored.


There are two more reasons why investors should consider very carefully if they want to be aggressive buyers. One, earnings season is adding to the market's volatility, even if the CBOE Market Volatility Index (currently near multi-month lows) does not show it. Just look at **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) (down 13% Tuesday in volume 260% above average), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN))(-23%, volume 821% above normal) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) (down 6%, volume up 172%), all of which scored weaker than expected results or light guidance.


None of these three former big winners have finished completing bases or triggered proper buy points. Even Netflix, which had climbed back above the 200-day moving average last week, was still 16% below its 133.27 peak. IBD's study of the greatest stock market winners going back to the 1880s shows that in most cases, a stock is primed to break out after it has rallied to within 5% to 15% of its 52-week or all-time peak. So the CAN SLIM investor who is following all the rules for selecting growth stocks would not have been hurt by their sell-offs.


On the other hand, construction, steel, oil and building products stocks continue to firm up. Consider **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), which is making its second appearance in [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx). The LED lighting expert is showing handsome gains following a base breakout at 143.77 in January 2015. Acuity has grown earnings per share 49%, 57%, 37%, 29%, 24% and 53% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. No wonder it gets a 98 EPS Rating from [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


Check out the top 40 industry groups listed daily in the "What's The Market Trend?" page, today on B4. Most of the groups in the top 20 are cyclical or commodity-related, a notable change from the food, utility and defensive groups that dominated in January. Amid still near-zero interest rates in the U.S. and "negative" rates in other parts of the world, this makes sense. However, a few storage REITs sold off Tuesday (see the Market Pulse), a good reminder that even profits in "growth + income" stocks need to be taken on the way up.

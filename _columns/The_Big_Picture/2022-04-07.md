The stock market snapped a two-day losing streak with modest gains Thursday after reversing higher, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite tested a key support level.




After Thursday's positive action, tech titans **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are among the top stocks to watch in today's stock market.


Struggling Stock Market Uptrend
-------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% Thursday, while the S&P 500 ended 0.4% higher and back above the long-term [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). The small-cap Russell 2000 trimmed losses to 0.4%, but still fell further below its 50-day line.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off as much as 1.4% before reversing higher to close up less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq appeared to find much-needed support at its key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), but there hasn't been a definite show of support yet.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP040722-250x300.jpg)Volume ended lower on the Nasdaq and it appeared to be also lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Top growth stocks also rebounded with modest gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 0.6%. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), some health care stocks continue to show strength. **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) advanced 4.3%. **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) jumped 1.9%, moving further out of buy range past a 673.96 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) entry.


On the IBD 50's downside, **Darling****Ingredients** ([DAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAR)) declined 1.5%. The stock triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting rule from a cup-with-handle's 80.31 buy point.


Treasury Yields Extend Gains
----------------------------


The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose for a fifth straight day Thursday, advancing to 2.65%, its highest level since March 2019. For the week, the 10-year Treasury yield is up more than 11%, sparked by [hawkish Fed minutes](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-to-shrink-balance-sheet-this-fast-nasdaq-leads-stocks-lower/) and comments from Fed Gov. Lael Brainard.


The [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) remains unchanged: three on the S&P 500 and two on the Nasdaq. On Wednesday, after two straight days of heavy selling, IBD shifted the market outlook from a "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure."


Even though the underlying uptrend is still intact, it's time to proceed with a greater degree of caution. Be wary of most new purchases and focus only on stocks that have exceptional fundamentals and heavy-volume breakouts past correct buy points. Also, be flexible. The market may rebound and move back into "confirmed uptrend," or the heavy selling could reemerge and lead to a correction.

Alphabet, Apple, Tesla Near Buy Points
--------------------------------------



Following Thursday's positive reversal, Alphabet, Apple and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Tesla are among the top stocks to watch despite the now-struggling stock market uptrend.


FANG stock leader Alphabet shows a 2,875.97 buy point in a cup with handle, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. GOOGL shares are about 5% away from the entry after Thursday's 0.5% fall. The stock is trying to hold at the 50-day line. A sharp break of this level could indicate further weakness is impending. Meanwhile, a strong show of support would likely propel shares to the buy point.



Dow Jones leader Apple is more than 2.5% below a [double bottom's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) 176.75 buy point following Thursday's 0.2% gain. Along with that entry, a handle buy point is also in play at 179.71. Look for a decisive move above those levels as a buy signal. Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), AAPL stock shows a solid 95 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Tesla advanced 1.1% Thursday, recovering a portion of Wednesday's 4.2% decline. Shares of the EV giant are about 12% away from a cup base's 1,208.10 buy point. Meanwhile, a handle is likely to form amid this week's poor showing. It would create a 1,152.97 entry. For now, the  handle is only three days long — five days, or one week, is the proper length of a handle.


The company's Cyber Rodeo event is [scheduled for Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-set-to-launch-austin-plant-amid-extended-china-factory-closure-tesla-stock-slips/). Tesla is expected to deliver its first 4680 battery-powered Model Y vehicle at the Texas factory launch event.

Stock Market Bulls Power Back On These Hopes, But Key Ingredient Is Missing
============================================================================

The stock market powered back with aplomb Wednesday as earnings season began, with the S&P 500 index holding above a key level. The show of power came despite yet another heightened inflation reading.




While the rally was encouraging as Wall Street gears up for the Good Friday holiday, the fact is volume fell on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. That's disappointing because big gains should come with good volume.


Investors seem to be hoping that inflation is hitting a peak, with the worst possibly in the rear-view mirror. But sentiment remains fragile amid recent whipsaw market action, so a prolonged spell of upward momentum would be welcome.


In fact, investors were able to shrug off the producer price index, which came in hotter than expected for March. On a year-ago basis, the PPI rose 11.2% after a 10.3% increase in February. Given the negative reaction to the consumer price index Tuesday, negative sentiment seemed to have already been baked in.


Nasdaq Flexes Muscles As Growth Shines
--------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP041322--207x300.jpg)The Nasdaq punched higher after a three-session losing streak, gaining 2%. It remains below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), but the fact it is fighting back before reaching March lows is an encouraging sign. It needs to show more, however.


The S&P 500 rose by a more moderate 1.1%, ending its own three-day losing skid. It was not damaged to the same extent as the Nasdaq, and has now climbed above its 50-day line. The fact it was able to hold above the 4400 level is a positive indicator.


In addition, most S&P [sectors closed higher.](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) Technology and consumer discretionary were the best performers. Even the losers, financials and utilities, were barely negative.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average made a bullish move by jumping clear of both its [50-day and 21-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) in one fell swoop. It ended the session with a gain of 1%.


Small caps made up good ground, with the Russell 2000 rising 1.9%. Growth stocks, which have taken a battering, punched back strongly. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) turned in a gain of 2.4%.


There was some respite for stocks from the bond market. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond slipped 2 basis points to 2.7%. As yields fall, investors often turn to stocks.


JPMorgan Earnings: Dimon Shares Economic Wisdom
-----------------------------------------------


Earnings season is once again upon us, with **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) slipping 3.2% on [mixed results](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-jpmorgan-earnings-goldman-sachs/).


Investors often listen closely to the words of CEO Jamie Dimon on the state of the American economy. Given he is chief executive of the biggest U.S. bank by assets, he is able to offer a broad perspective.



Dimon sounded bullish on the short-term prospects, but was more equivocal about the longer-term outlook. He pointed to inflation and Fed tightening as key worries.


"You've never seen that before. I'm simply pointing out that those are storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear, they may not," he told analysts.


The influential CEO is preparing for all eventualities, with the bank adding $902 million to its loan loss reserves, which serve to cover bad debt. This is a stark contrast to a year ago, when the firm took out $5.2 billion from its reserves.


But JPMorgan was not the only notable report Wednesday. **BlackRock** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)), **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) and **Fastenal** ([FAST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAST)) all served up reports that beat Wall Street expectations.


The reopening trade got a shot in the arm after Delta said it expects to get back to profitability this quarter.


These Groups Shine As Market Charges
------------------------------------


A look at the day's performance of the 197 IBD industry groups always provides key information for investors.



On Wednesday oil and gas drillers, lodging, metal products distributors, airlines and leisure booking stocks were among those that fared best. The bullish noises from Delta boosted the leisure and bookings areas.


**Marriot International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)) spiked 7.5% higher in strong volume. It is now closing in on a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) entry of 179.40. With consumers surely keen to spend some time away from home following the Covid pandemic lockdowns, this has the potential to be a big winner going forward. Analysts expect 71% EPS growth in 2022 and 28% in 2023.


Dairy products, a range of utility providers including water and electricity suppliers, and hospital stocks had the worst luck Wednesday.


Bulls Pull Back On This Key Gauge
---------------------------------


The latest advisors sentiment report from Investors Intelligence showed weakening bullish sentiment. Nevertheless, there was still a positive bull-bear spread. It narrowed to +3.7%, from +8.1% last time.


More bulls shifted to projecting a correction, but there is a heartening caveat. At 32.1%, the reading was only gently higher than the previous reading of 31%.


As always, the day-to-day action of the indexes and leading stocks will be your principal guide.

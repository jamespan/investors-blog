An early stock market advance faded into the close Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrials turning red in the wake of Wednesday's Fed interest rate cut. All three major stock indexes are still within striking distance of record highs amid the current stock market rally.




The Dow Jones industrials rallied as much as 125 points Thursday before reversing lower to fall 52 points, or 0.2%, at the close. All three main indexes — the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials — are above their 50-day moving average lines. The Nasdaq found support near that level Wednesday in the immediate aftermath of the [Fed's policy decision](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-cut-fed-meeting-sends-mixed-signals-dow-jones/).


The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the trading session with a less-than-0.1% gain, while the S&P 500 was almost unchanged. Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 closed with a 0.4% loss. Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed lighter volume on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's trade.

But Thursday displayed a number of high-profile breakouts — a bullish sign for the overall market. Look to see if these breakouts result in any significant upside moves, or if institutions use their recent wins to lock in profits.


Leading stocks in general outperformed, another positive sign for the market.


IBD 50 Outperforms; StoneCo Breaks Out
--------------------------------------


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) gained 0.2%, outperforming the major stock indexes amid strength in **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) and **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)). In total, seven IBD 50 stocks gained more than 2%.


SolarEdge notched a new high with a 7.7% advance to close at 89.42. Shares continued to rebound from their 10-week moving average line after testing that support level last week in heavy volume.


StoneCo broke out above a 38.57 buy point in a cup base, rising as much as 7.9% to 39.45 before paring gains to just 1.9%. Shares closed more than 3% below the entry. The new buy point comes on the heels of [failed breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/fastest-growing-companies-stoneco-sales-earnings-swell/) above a 37.67 buy point in a cup with-handle-base in August.



On the downside, **Ares Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)) and **Funko** ([FNKO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNKO)) were two big losers Thursday. Ares Management declined 4.7% after it announced an offering for 7 million shares.


Top collectibles maker Funko slid nearly 7%, as the stock closed below its 50-day line. Shares triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) from a 25.58 entry. On Tuesday, Funko stock sold off 10.6% after the company announced a secondary offering.


Today's Breakout Stocks: Huya, Microsoft
----------------------------------------



**Huya** ([HUYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUYA)) broke out above a 26.48 entry in a double bottom. The Chinese stock rallied 7.6% to close at 27.93 in heavy volume. The 5% buy zone tops out at 27.80, so the stock is barely extended.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) stock broke out above a 141.78 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-growth-stocks-how-to-spot-the-flat-base-amid-long-winding-chart-action/), but closed at 141.07, just below the entry amid the reversal in the major indexes. The Dow Jones stock was added to the [IBD Leaderboard service.](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard)


Top Stocks To Watch: Costco, Essent
-----------------------------------



**Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) slid 1.6% after an analyst downgrade based on the stock's valuation. Keep a close eye on this retail leader. The stock's RS line is declining precipitously after two separate downgrades in as many weeks. Still, the stock is holding above a flat base's 284.41 buy point and the 50-day line. If the stock is unable to hold the 50-day moving average line, then further weakness could be next.


Elsewhere, [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Essent** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) is approaching a 50 buy point in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/). According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Essent [holds a 95](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-essent-group-ltd-esnt.aspx) out of a highest-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) Essent was today's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch pick.](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-essent-stock-near-buy-point-business-booms/)

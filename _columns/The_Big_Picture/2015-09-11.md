Stocks netted some gains Friday as oil issues skidded, while retail, homebuilders and medical groups offset the losses. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 added 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, while the Dow popped 0.6%.

  

The IBD 50 also gained 0.6%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

West Texas intermediate crude oil fell 2.8% to under $45 a barrel. Goldman Sachs said that prices could fall to as low as [$20 a barrel](http://news.investors.com/business/091115-770625-oil-glut-continues-goldman-warns-of-20-dollar-crude.htm?ref=HPLNews), Bloomberg News reported.

  

Crude-tied stocks haven't needed fresh catalysts to make them fall, but Goldman's analysis added to the glum mood in oil.

  

According to preliminary data, about half of the 20 biggest losers Friday were oil industry groups. Losses ranged from 1% to 4%.

  

On the upside, four groups mustered gains of 1.5% or more: consumer electronics, homebuilders, restaurants and medical research equipment.

  

In some ways, the day was a microcosm for the trend over the past eight weeks.

  

The homebuilder group is the No. 1 performer over the past eight weeks (up about 9%), while five oil-tied groups have fallen 15% to 25%.

  

Therein lies the problem for the stock market. Losses among commodities groups have been too huge to let the rest of the market consistently erase the red.

  

As long as the commodity-tied stocks are staggering lower, it's harder for the overall market to make progress.

  

On Friday, hardly any top-rated stocks stepped up to lead.

  

Among 2015 [initial public offerings](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm), **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) found thrust. The restaurant stock jumped more than 13% in double its average volume.

  

On Aug. 10, Shake Shack reported a dazzling same-store sales increase of 12.9% for Q2. However, the January IPO announced a secondary offering the same day. The stock then dropped roughly 40% over 11 sessions.

  

On Friday, Shake Shack cleared a shakeout +3 pattern. (Its price, however, makes it proportionally a +5 pattern. It sets the buy point around the first low of 48.21 plus 5, or roughly 53.)

  

Shake Shack lacks the great fundamentals associated with top stocks. The new issue passes the current earnings test but not the test for annual growth. Return on equity was about 13% last year, below the 17% minimum that top stocks often show.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 and Nasdaq each rose 3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each added 2.1%.

  

In the coming week, the Federal Reserve will meet Wednesday and Thursday. The CME Group FedWatch calculates the odds of a rate hike at 23.1%.

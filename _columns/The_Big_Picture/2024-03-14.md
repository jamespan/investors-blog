The stock market dropped Thursday, as Wall Street digested a hotter-than-expected inflation report, along with falling jobless claims and lackluster retail sales.




Meanwhile, stock market leaders **Block** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)) are in or near buy zones on the stock market today.


Ahead of Thursday's stock market open, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the [producer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-fed-rate-cut-hopes-sp-500/) rose 0.6% in February vs. the 0.3% economists estimated. Excluding food and energy, producer prices rose 0.3%, topping 0.2% forecasts.


Further, the Labor Department's initial unemployment claims fell to 209,000 vs. 217,000 the previous week â€” no sign of a slowing labor market. Economists expected claims to dip to 215,000.


Retail sales rose 0.6% in February, while January's initially reported 0.8% decline was revised to -1.1%. Economists were expecting a 0.7% rise for February, according to Econoday.


Excluding autos, retail sales rose 0.3% vs. 0.4% expectations, even as January's stumble was revised to -0.8% from -0.6%. Factoring out spending on both autos and gas, sales rose 0.3% vs. 0.2% forecasts, while January's data was revised to -0.8% from -0.5%.


In response, the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 10 basis points, settling just below 4.3%, its highest close since late February. It was its largest one-day yield gain since Feb. 13, per Dow Jones Market Data, bigger than the yield's rise on Tuesday after the release of the hotter-than-expected consumer price index.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped almost 0.4%, while the S&P 500 moved down 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slid 2%, falling four of the last five sessions. The small-cap index closed at its lowest level since Feb. 26.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session. That adds another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) to both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes, taking their totals to five apiece.


Breadth was poor, with declining stocks over advancers by nearly 4-to-1 on the NYSE and by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.


In the Dow Jones industrials, software giant **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) rallied 2.4% to hit a new high. Shares are rebounding from their 50-day line. Microsoft was the biggest positive contributor to the Dow.

On the Dow Jones' downside, **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) slipped 1.2%, slipping below the 50-day line as a flat base takes shape.


Among the Magnificent Seven stocks, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) were big losers, with drops of 3.2% and 4.1%. Nvidia remains far above a 505.48 flat-base entry. But Tesla stock hit the lowest point since May.


And top growth stocks fell sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 1.5%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **SentinelOne** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) plunged 16% to break down below its 50-day line, a sell signal and a big reason for the index's underperformance.


One of the top-performing industry groups, homebuilders, was hit hard, as **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) [dived 7.6%](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lennar-1q-revenue-rises-as-homebuilder-leans-on-incentives-to-boost-sales-bc19cc30) to close below the 50-day line. Shares are now below a 156.01 flat-base entry. Lennar missed sales estimates and its [margin guidance disappointed](https://www.barrons.com/articles/lennar-earnings-stock-price-cb87602b?mod=hp_DAY_1).

What To Do Now
--------------


After Thursday's gains, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to hold just off their all-time highs. Thus, IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60%-80%, keeping in mind that a pullback now would not be surprising.


While the overall outlook remains "confirmed uptrend," investors could be at the lower end of the exposure threshold as small-cap stocks tumbled Thursday. Another worrisome note is the rising number of distribution days. While the totals aren't daunting, they are worth monitoring.


A persistent issue for investors is a shortage of actionable ideas. For example, [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list showed zero stocks Thursday.


Instead, be patient and wait for better opportunities to put your capital to work. A sustained breather in the major stock indexes would lead to new base formations, which would offer new entries.


Keep track of emerging bases with the [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Near Pivot" list. Currently, it shows only a handful of stocks. For example, **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) is [approaching a 133.77 flat-base entry](https://www.investors.com/research/cruise-ship-royal-caribbean-rcl-stock/).

Stock Market Leaders: Dexcom, Square
------------------------------------



Meanwhile, market leaders Block, Dexcom, IBM and XP are in or near buy zones Thursday.


[Square parent Block](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/square-stock-square-expands-cash-app-consumer-banking/)'s recent breakout took a big step backward, as shares tumbled more than 5% Thursday. The stock is back below a cup-with-handle's 83.29 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) charts.


[Dexcom shares](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dexcom-stock-buy-zone-diabetes-obesity-continuous-glucose-monitors/) declined further below a 132.03 entry in a flat base, with a 1.7% drop Thursday.


Dow Jones component IBM moved down 1.7% Thursday, closing just below a 196.90 entry. Shares haven't made any progress since a March 6 breakout attempt.


Finally, Brazil-based XP dipped 2.5% Thursday, finishing right at the 50-day line. Shares are building a cup with handle that displays a 27.03 entry. XP was a recent [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/xp-charles-schwab-of-brazil-flashes-buy-signal/)

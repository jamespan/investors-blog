The middle of August is supposed to be a sleepy time for equity traders. But Wednesday gave stock market participants plenty of news to digest. In the end, Wall Street bulls needed a well-deserved rest.




A [shocking 89% drop in fiscal second-quarter profits](https://www.investors.com/mstool/news/walmart-and-target-kick-off-big-earnings-week-for-retail/) for discount retailing giant **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), striving to clear inventories and boost margins in the second half of the year, cast a pall on the market open. [U.S. retail sales in July proved mixed](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). The headline number showed zero growth vs. June. Yet retail sales, excluding both vehicles and gasoline, did show a surprising 0.7% jump. The Econoday consensus view expected only a 0.3% lift.


"We hoped falling gasoline prices would lift retail spending in July, but this wasn't the case. Nevertheless, the data still points to a healthy start to the quarter," James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, wrote in an email sent to IBD. "The cash flow boost from lower gasoline prices will provide a major boost to spending in August, with stronger auto sales also set to lift growth."


Meanwhile, traders initially greeted the minutes from the Federal Reserve's late-July meeting on interest rates warmly. Stocks got a sugary boost amid a focus on discussion between governors about the [risk to the economy](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-down-amid-fed-minutes-manchester-united-stock-pops-after-elon-musk-claim-bitcoin-falls-coinbase-stock-tesla-stock/) from over-aggressive rate hikes. However, major indexes cooled off in the last 75 minutes of the session.


For sure, a nearly 1.3% drop by the Nasdaq composite in modestly higher volume doesn't quite fit the bill of an ideal pullback for those going long. Yet considering the size of the rebound since the June lows, for now, the modestly bullish complexion in the stock market remains.


Stock Market Today: Watching For Institutional Selling
------------------------------------------------------


The significant drop in heavier trade tacks on a [second day of moderate distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) for the Nasdaq. This signals intense professional selling. A confirmed uptrend can stay intact amid sparse amounts of distribution. On the other hand, if heavy declines in higher volume pile up over a short span, they can give the earlier signal that it's time to get defensive again.


As a recent example, consider the time frame of Nov. 22 to Dec. 13, 2021.


The Nasdaq suffered four meaningful [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) over that 15-trading-session period. Specifically, it got hit with losses of 1.3% on Nov. 22; 1.6% on Nov. 30; 1.9% on Dec. 3; and 1.4% on Dec. 13.


After the Dec. 3 sell-off, IBD downgraded the current outlook for equities to "Market in correction," just three days after taking the outlook down a notch to "Uptrend under pressure."


A Day 8 follow-through on Dec. 15, meanwhile, on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 briefly brought the green light back to actively hunt for good stocks and breakouts. That period did not last long. A significant and early distribution day on the S&P 500 caused IBD to lower the outlook back to uptrend under pressure on Dec. 17. Strong action in the Nasdaq on Dec. 23 pushed the outlook back into "Uptrend resumes." However, heavy selling on two of the first three trading days of 2022 helped usher the current bear market.

Don't Ignore This Sector
------------------------


Small caps in Wednesday's stock market fared worse than the tech-dominated Nasdaq. While the Russell 2000 caved 1.6%, the S&P 500 backtracked just 0.7%. Oil stocks helped the cause for the 500, blunting the large-cap index's decline. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 0.8%, ending a two-day losing streak.


XLE shows a healthy 8.3% gain for the quarter and has advanced 39% since Jan. 1. That year-to-date gain at one point grew as large as 68%.


"We continue to see a tight oil market and retain our positive price outlook," Mark Haefele, CIO at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note to clients. "Our $125/bbl Brent forecast through mid-2023 also supports our preference for energy stocks."


Haefele stressed that OPEC+ capacity remains limited and likely to face challenges caused by falling production in Russia. Haefele's team also thinks oil demand in China "is set to recover."


NYSE volume declined 10% vs. Tuesday, meaning no distribution day for the 500.


Midcap stocks occupied the middle ground, as SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) lost 1.3%.


Yet at 474.61, MDY has retained a beefy gain of nearly 19% since bottoming out at 400.05 on June 16.


Another interesting angle to Wednesday's action?

-----------------------------------



[A MarketSmith chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/ms-platform/) reveals that MDY closed just above its [long-term 200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


The 200-day line plots a stock or index's average closing price over the past 200 trading days, or roughly 10 months. And since January, MDY's 200-day moving average crested and then began to dip.


Notice how short-term bounces in late January, late March and in early April all got stopped dead in their tracks when this ETF tried to rise above this important technical level.


A look at the other key equity indexes hints at the fact that many institutional traders still harbor emotions of trepidation about the state of the economy. Others have been nursing large paper losses and may be looking to cut their losses.

Small Caps And Blue Chips
-------------------------



For instance, iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ran up sharply in the prior four weeks, gaining 15.7% in the process. But a daily chart of IWM shows the exchange-traded fund falling 1.7% and sinking back under the 200-day in accelerating turnover.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, easing 0.5% for the day, got support at its own falling 200-day moving average, at least for now. But the Nasdaq 100, off almost 1.3%, is still looking up at its 200-day. The S&P 500 on Tuesday hit an intraday high of 4325, just 1 point below its own 200-day line.


Breadth in the stock market has improved greatly. Wednesday's session, thus, proved exceptional. Falling stocks outmatched rising ones by more than a 3-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and 4-to-1 on the NYSE.


The probability of a third-straight 75-basis-point hike in the Fed Funds rate at the upcoming Sept. 21 FOMC meeting fell to 36.5% on Wednesday. A month ago, that probability stood at 49.2%. CME futures traders now see the chance of a half-point increase at 63.5%, up from 36.9% on July 15.



The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond rose 10 basis points to 2.89%, a three-week high.


Growth investors in the stock market should continue to monitor long-dated Treasuries closely. It's no coincidence that the sharp rise in the 10-year yield from January to June has accompanied a 25% slide in the 500 and a 33% shellacking in the Nasdaq over roughly the same time period.

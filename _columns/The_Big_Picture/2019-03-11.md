The stock market surged broadly Monday, making last week's pullback seem manageable and calming fears of a deeper pullback.




The work for Monday's big gains started late Friday, after the market shook off worries about a weak employment report and erased most of the day's losses. That upward momentum carried into Monday's session, when stocks continued rising into the close.


With a single day of outsized gains, the worst week for the stock market so far this year (the Nasdaq lost 2.5% last week) is already fading from memory.


Indexes broke a five-day losing streak emphatically, as the Nasdaq composite rallied 2%. The composite closed back above its 200-day moving average and above the 7500 price, which has been a pivotal level for months.

Boeing Hits Dow Jones
---------------------


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) had an outsized influence on the Dow Monday. The aerospace company's shares plunged after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 jetliner crashed Sunday, the second Max 8 to crash in less than five months.


Boeing pared losses to close down 5.3% but still accounted for more than 150 points off the Dow, which closed 200 points higher. Some [airline and related stocks fell in sympathy with Boeing](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-crash-boeing-stock-spirit-stock-southwest-stock/). Boeing was the only Dow component to close lower.


Volume in Boeing was more than eight times its average, and it single-handedly accounted for an increase in NYSE volume. Nasdaq volume fell. Advancing stocks led decliners by a 10-3 ratio on the Nasdaq and by nearly 4-to-1 on the NYSE.


While Monday's broad gains alleviated last week's market angst, there's still recently been a buildup of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) that bears watching. The S&P 500 has six distribution days in the past several weeks, and indexes still have not moved up convincingly above longer-term resistance levels. A vote Tuesday on Brexit could rattle global markets.


Two Factors Influencing Stock Market
------------------------------------


But there are a couple of trends that will help determine the market's direction. First, as long as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 stay above Friday's closing levels, investors can have reason to increase exposure to stocks.



Second, if the market is to be judged by its leading stocks, investors have reason to accumulate shares. [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 2.2%, with several stocks rising from pullbacks to their 10-week moving averages. **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) topped the 202.40 buy point of a three-weeks-tight pattern. **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) found support at the 10-week line.


Technology led the market, partly on news of a big buyout in the semiconductor industry. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) agreed to acquire **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) for [$6.9 billion in cash](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-acquire-mellanox-chip-manufacturers/), outbidding **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)). Mellanox soared nearly 8%; Nvidia rose 7%; Intel gained 1.7%.


Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) rose 2.1% thanks to strength in major Nasdaq stocks such as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). They climbed 2% to 3.5%. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) rose 1.5% after [Nomura raised the social media stock to buy from neutral](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-analyst-report-user-engagement/) and lifted the target price to 215 from 172.

Nasdaq, Russell 2000 Hit With Mild Losses, But These Sectors Strike A Bullish Note
===================================================================================

Major indexes revealed mixed action following the Presidents Day holiday weekend. However, Tuesday's trading may have also led to big moves within your portfolio, depending on which sectors you're invested heavily in.




If, for instance, you've been long in blazing-hot areas such as solar or the machinery automation and materials handling sector, the session may have stung a bit. Early data showed these two IBD industry groups falling more than 4% for the day.


That contrasts sharply with mild losses of 0.3% for the Nasdaq and less than 0.1% for the S&P 500.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF had more to give back. Like its above counterparts, the ETF started out with moderate gains but turned lower, ending the day down 0.6%.


![MP021621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP021621-193x300.jpg)However, that adds little tarnish to a year-to-date advance of 15.2% through Tuesday's trading.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rubbed out the Jan. 27 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to recent gains that pushed the large-cap benchmark more than 5% above that session's closing price. And the S&P 500 came within six points of blotting out another distribution day, a 0.7% drop on Jan. 15 to 3768.25.


NYSE volume rose on Tuesday vs. Friday's session. But the S&P 500's tiny decline did not signal intense institutional selling.


So, despite the negative reversal, the 500 trimmed back its [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) on the Market Pulse to a mild level. Don't forget, too, that the wild stampede of trading in wallstreetbets favorite **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) triggered a technical [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on Jan. 22.


The Nasdaq on Tuesday scored its second distribution day over the past 25 sessions. Fortunately for the bulls, the professional selling appeared mild. At 14,047.50, the tech-driven index still holds a solid cushion above the useful [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


This Nasdaq Winner Catches Its Breath
-------------------------------------


**ExOne** ([XONE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XONE)), a 3D printing machine maker, slumped 9.2% in more than double its 50-day average turnover. That drop certainly impacted IBD's Machinery-Materials Handling industry group's fortunes. See the total daily performance for all 197 industries at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


ExOne, still a small cap after a breathtaking advance since mid-January, still harbors a 189% profit since the stock broke out of a four-month consolidation pattern with a 16.99 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in vigorous turnover. It still trades 28% above the 21-day line.



Banking and financial payments stocks enjoyed a rosy session. As panelists on [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) commented, another big sell-off in long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds sent yields in these securities flying. [As seen in MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/), the Cboe 10-year Treasury note's yield hit 1.3%, matching levels last seen on Feb. 27, 2020.


The ever-improving rise in the Treasury bond yield curve bodes well for lenders. Borrow cheap. Lend at a higher rate. Rinse and repeat.


Don't Ignore Banks And Industrial Plays
---------------------------------------


**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), an earnings turnaround play, reflects this penchant to cycle money back into money center banks.



The very deep cup base, distorted by the coronavirus-induced bear market, features a large handle now. Add 10 cents to the Jan. 14 high of 34.37, and you get a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) that's within arm's length of the cup's left-side peak of 35.72.


Handles that form when the stock is within 15% of the base's high tend to lead to better breakouts. Such stocks have already done the sweaty work of clearing [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/). Bank of America is not in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) hold two of the blue chip average's 30 spots. Their solid gains, combined with a nifty 3.4% gain by **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), helped the Dow's cause.


Amid severe winter storms pummeling the U.S., oil and gas stocks advanced. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), also highlighted in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), rose 2.2% to 202.38 in higher turnover. The stock's [rebound off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) is impressive.


Still Bullish, But Expect Volatility To Rise
--------------------------------------------


Gene Goldman, chief investment officer of the financial advisory giant Cetera, tells IBD that he's encouraged by accelerating numbers of Covid-19 vaccines getting in Americans' arms, a sharp drop in hospitalizations and fiscal and monetary stimulus measures that have reached nearly a third of the annual gross domestic product.


"Plus you have razor thin margins in favor of Democrats in the Senate. This means there's less chance of taxes and tighter government regulation," Goldman said in a phone chat. "Joe Manchin of West Virginia has been pushing back on stimulus, and Trump carried the state by 20 points. I tell advisors to watch him (Manchin)."


But the Wall Street veteran also notes that once we enter the second half of 2021, when the economy is expected to strengthen, be alert for increased market volatility. Why? For starters, he's concerned about valuations. The S&P 500 now trades at 22 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, way above the 20-year average of 15.8 times.


"The valuations are pricing in absolute perfection," Goldman said. "We think economic surprises start to slow down (in the back half of 2021)."


The median price of single family homes surged 15% in Q4. The New York Empire State survey on manufacturing accelerated sharply in February, hitting 12.1 and smashing the Econoday forecast of 5.7. In January, the index was a dismal 3.5.


"You've got bubbles everywhere," Goldman said.

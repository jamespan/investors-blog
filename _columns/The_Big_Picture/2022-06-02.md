  Stock Market Rallies Into The Close, But Will There Be Enough Breakouts?

After a two-day pause, the stock market resumed its uptrend with meaty gains Thursday and it's looking more like the May lows will hold.




The Nasdaq stood out with a 2.7% surge — its third rally of more than 2% in the past five sessions. The S&P 500 added 1.8%, and that's its fourth gain of more than 1.5% since the May 20 low.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.3%. Small caps also put in a workman effort, as the Russell 2000 climbed 2.3% to its highest level in nearly a month.


All indexes closed at session highs, and all are finding support at their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Those lines are starting to flatten out after sloping lower since April.


Stocks Resilient Despite Microsoft Warning
------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP060222-250x300.jpg)The stock market could have cowered after **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) [cut its current-quarter revenue and earnings forecasts](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-falls-after-software-giant-lowers-forecast/), citing unfavorable currency exchange. Yet, indexes bounced off opening losses and continued rising into the close.


The Nasdaq now has an 11.6% cushion from the May 20 low, and the S&P 500 has built a 9.6% padding. While that gives the stock market some breathing room, investors need to remain vigilant.


The damage to the market — particularly its growth sector — has been so profound, it could take many more weeks of reconstruction to know if we're truly in a prolonged uptrend. Remember, the follow-through of March 16 resulted in a nine-day advance before the S&P 500 topped and stared another leg down. Other follow-throughs this year also failed.


A number of companies in retail and other sectors have warned of margin pressures due to rising costs. Just Wednesday, **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors to brace themselves for an economic "hurricane."


S&P 500 Still Seeking Signal
----------------------------


Advancing stocks Thursday outnumbered decliners by about a 3-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and NYSE. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE. That's where Thursday's rally came up a bit short.


Had the NYSE volume increased, the S&P 500 would have marked a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). Such a rally confirmation has eluded the index so far. But the Nasdaq's follow-through of May 26 was enough to change IBD's market outlook to "confirmed uptrend."


The follow-through should give investors confidence to increase exposure to stocks. This is best done with institutional-quality stocks topping proper buy points and follow-on buy areas.


Big movers since the follow-through mostly have been beaten-up stocks, some bouncing from six- or seven-month lows. **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)), one of Thursday's biggest gainers with a 11% gain, is still more than 65% off its November peak. Okta soared another 16% in after-hours trading on strong earnings. **Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)), up 24% on the day, also is bouncing off a deep decline.


If we're to judge the quality of a new market uptrend by the quality of new breakouts, the results are mixed.

Breakout So Far Mixed
---------------------


IBD MarketSmith's list of breakouts over the past few weeks shows that nearly half of the 26 stocks are below their buy points. There are few sell signals so far, but **Livent** ([LTHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTHM)) fell more than 8% below its buy point, [triggering a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


You'd have to be a sharpshooter to land on a winner like **Sociedad Quimica y Minera** ([SQM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQM)), which jumped as much as 27% from its 90.97 buy point, or **SM Energy** ([SM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SM)), up more than 20% from its breakout.


**Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)), an [IBD 50 Stocks to Watch last week](https://www.investors.com/research/solar-stock-enphase-shines-despite-sector-weakness/), was one of the latest breakouts, as the solar energy company topped a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) buy point of 193.


If you're not satisfied with the choices of breakouts in leading stocks, you can gain exposure to the new uptrend by buying index ETFs. [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) last Friday chose to increase its exposure with ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ([SSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSO)), a leveraged ETF that gives performance corresponding to twice the daily return of the S&P 500.

Semiconductor stocks bounced back in the stock market today, helping lift the Nasdaq composite to a gain of 1.3% by the close. But on a day that saw the Nasdaq outperform by a wide margin, breadth was slightly negative again.




The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) rallied 1.6%. But that came in lower volume, after three sharp declines occurred in heavy turnover. The ETF was helped by a gain of nearly 7% for [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Nvidia is the highest-weighted component of the fund at 24.5%. But after eight straight weekly gains for Nvidia, the AI bellwether looks like it's ready to form a new base. Three straight heavy-volume declines for the stock, followed up by Tuesday's lower-volume bounce, is not what the bulls want to see. Price action like this can often presage more weakness.


Nvidia was a top gainer in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), along with chip designer **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), which jumped 6.3%. A 164 buy point is still in play for Arm.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 closed higher by 0.4%, But the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 small-cap index lagged with losses of 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. The Dow Jones industrials snapped a five-session win streak, but the blue-chip index continues to hold above all of its moving averages. The Russell 2000 is still on a downtrend, trading just below its 50-day line.

Volume was lower on the NYSE and Nasdaq, with decliners beating advancers on the NYSE by nearly 2-to-1.


Cruise line operators did the heavy lifting in the S&P 500, helped by a strong [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/carnival-cruise-q2-earnings/) and breakout from **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)). Shares jumped nearly 9% and closed just above a 17.68 buy point and above a handle entry at 17.07. **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) rallied 5%, but it's the laggard in the group with a Relative Strength Rating of 25. **Royal Caribbean Cruises** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) is the leader in the group, but it's extended from a short cup-base breakout in March and from support at the 10-week line.

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was among a group of stocks that rose at least 0.4% in the Dow Jones index. The online retailer near the top of a shallow cup base with a 191.70 buy point. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) also outperformed in the blue-chip index. After a bullish breakout above the 200 level on June 11, Apple has pulled back in orderly fashion to its 10-day moving average.


Dow Jones stock **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) also bucked the trend, rising 0.4%. But a breakout attempt over a 322.60 buy point faded.


What To Do Now
--------------


In the accompanying Market Pulse graphic, the invested percentage currently stands at 80%-100%. But with top-rated growth stocks coming under increasing selling pressure in the stock market, leaning toward the 80% side makes sense at this point.


While it's OK to play some defense by taking some gains in your winners, the major stock indexes continue to show strength, with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 holding near their [10-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/). That means it's still OK to target top stocks showing relative strength, especially those that have pulled back to support levels like the 21-day line or 50-day line.


There's still a large crop of extended stocks out there, which means actionable setups are in shorter supply. If you're underinvested, continue to target leading stocks in leading industry groups and avoid stocks that are too far extended past proper entries.


Growth Stocks To Watch
----------------------


After shedding 4.7% in the prior three sessions, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) bounced back 1.6% in the stock market today.


Outside of Arm and Nvidia in the IBD 50, **Alnylam Pharmaceuticals** ([ALNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALNY)) also outperformed, rising nearly 8% in strong volume. Shares surged Monday after the company said its experimental drug vutrisiran helped reduce the number of deaths and cardiovascular events in a study of patients with a rare heart disease.


Premium sandal maker **Birkenstock** ([BIRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIRK)) slumped 6.5% early after the company filed to sell up to 14 million shares. But the stock recovered off lows and closed near its 21-day line. It's back near the top of the 5% buy zone from a 55 buy point.



In the security software group, **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) is still worth watching despite being a bit extended from a 358.84 buy point. A low-volume pullback to the 21-day exponential moving average, currently around 365, would put the cybersecurity stock back in the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).


IBD's chip-equipment group was one of the day's best performers, rising 2.3%. Inside the group, **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) is still acting well after a June 12 breakout from a flat base. It's back near the top of the 5% buy zone from a 1,007.39 entry.


Finally, **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **Rivian** ([RIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIVN)) were notable gainers in Tuesday's after-hours session. FedEx jumped 15% after reporting [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/fedex-earnings-ups-deal-rxo/). EV maker Rivian, meanwhile, soared more than 45% on news that Volkswagen is investing up to $5 billion in Rivian.

Midcap stocks paced gains as the major indexes posted mixed results Friday. Yet amid more depressing news on the Ukraine invasion, sky-high energy prices and another rise in the cost of money, the confirmed uptrend is remarkably alive and kicking, if mildly.




The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund rallied 0.7% on Friday to come within a whisper's distance away from taking back its flattened [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). That exceeded a 0.1% gain by the Russell 2000. The S&P 500 rose 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. But the Nasdaq edged down less than 0.2%.


Volume rose on both main exchanges, but the Nasdaq's decline was too miserly to call the session a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP032522-300x262.jpg)So, one month into Putin's War, and even after three straight weeks of soaring U.S. interest rates, why is the stock market eager to rebound?


The market always discounts today's news. It has a knack of giving investors a view into the economy six to 12 months from now.


Also encouraging? Following the prior week's powerful advance that encapsulated follow-through days by both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, the market refused to surrender those gains.


Still, it pays to observe the action one day at a time. Confirm the market's strength with the action of your own holdings.


Beyond Midcap Stocks: 5 Tests For This New Uptrend
--------------------------------------------------


1. In general, how do the major indexes receive negative news? The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note spiked 34 basis points to 2.49% for the week. Meaning: We're likely going to see the fed funds rate approaching that level by year's end. The CME Fed Watch tool highlights a nearly 80% probability this rate on overnight loans to major banks will hit the 2.5%-2.75% target level. And yet the NYSE composite rose 1.1% for the week and closed above its 40-week line for the first time since the week ended Jan. 14.
2. How are the current [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) faring? Top stocks, small cap or large cap, often test their buy points soon after the breakout. This doesn't mean they should be sold right away. **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)) stands out. Focus on Wednesday's action. Big drop! Yet AOSL did not trigger a sell rule. Shares ran 12.8% higher in heavy volume for the week.
3. Are more stocks rising than falling in big volume? [MarketSmith's homepage](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) showed 172 stocks up in big volume and 132 down in heavy turnover. That's positive. The ratio also favored winners over losers on Tuesday and Thursday.
4. Which sectors are gaining strength? Headed into Friday's session, the [top 10 IBD sectors in the stock tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-mar-24-2022/) still showed a heavy cyclical favor. They include Agriculture, Mining, Metals, Aerospace, Insurance, Transport, Utility and Computer.
5. Are the key indexes plowing through notable resistance levels? Besides the NYSE composite, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) lifted 3% above its 10-week moving average. But the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) and iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) still have their work cut out for them.

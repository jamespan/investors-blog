The stock market reversed sharply and closed mostly lower after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell served up mixed messages following the central bank's latest meeting on interest rates.




Indexes had rallied ahead of the latest Fed Open Market Committee statement. But as Powell's tone grew increasingly hawkish during his post-powwow press conference in the middle of afternoon on the East Coast, stocks saw solid gains melt away.


The Nasdaq closed the day with a nominal gain but was basically flat. The tech-heavy index remains off lows for the week but remains marooned below its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/).


The S&P 500 saw an attempt to retake its own 200-day line falter. The index closed below the key benchmark as it ended the day down 0.3%.

A post-earnings bounce by **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) had helped buoy the blue-chip index before the bears pounced late. Small caps suffered the most, with the Russell 2000 giving up 1.4%.


Growth stocks did well in comparison, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) falling 0.1%. Nevertheless, it remains miles below its 200-day moving average due to challenging market conditions for growth plays.


Stock Market Today: Fed Chair Spooks Investors
----------------------------------------------


Initially the market rallied after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) [issued a policy statement that signaled an upcoming hike in the fed funds rate](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-signals-march-rate-hike-as-asset-purchases-end-stock-market-rallies/). The U.S. central bank said it will end winding down asset purchases before its mid-March meeting. A first interest-rate hike is also likely to occur that month. This was in line with Wall Street expectations.


But Powell spooked the stock market by saying inflation is actually getting worse as wage hikes and supply-chain issues continue to take a toll.


He said inflation and employment are prodding central bankers to "move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies" put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic. He also said there is plenty of room to raise rates.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya noted Powell was careful not to make any strong commitments on the course of rate increases or on how the Fed will shrink its holdings.


"The more Powell talked during the Q&A session, the more hawkish he sounded," he said. "Equities pared gains after Powell didn't rule out raising rates at every meeting and that they could move sooner, and perhaps faster on the balance sheet than they did last time."


The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ended up 9 basis points at 1.87%. The yield on the two-year note rose 13 basis points.


Key Indicator Sees Bull/Bear Spread Narrow
------------------------------------------


[The latest Bulls vs. Bears weekly survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) saw bullish sentiment fall even as bearish sentiment rose.


Bulls fell to 34.9% from 39.8% last week. In contrast, bears rose from 25% to 26.7%.


This psychological gauge is useful as a secondary market indicator. That is, bearishness is approaching levels that have historically shown the market is approaching a bottom. In bear market declines of 20% or more, the bears often outnumber the bulls. IBD's graph showed this exactly happening during the February-March 2020 coronavirus market crash.


But while trading rallies are possible from here, this indicator alone does not suggest it is time yet for broad general buying.


These Industry Groups Shine
---------------------------


It is important that investors keep a close eye on which industry groups are performing well on any given day.



Fabless semiconductor plays and auto stocks fared best. Chipmakers also did well. [Leaderboard play](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is one of the stars of the fabless chip industry. The megacap tech closed well off highs for the day but still gained 2%.


In contrast, internet networking stocks, discount and variety retailers and home-furnishings chains fared worst in the stock market. Warren Buffett stock **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is in the latter group, dropping about 5% Wednesday.

From a broader perspective, the S&P 500 sectors closed mostly down. Technology and financials managed to squeeze out gains, while materials, industrials and real estate lagged most.

What To Do Now In The Current Stock Market
------------------------------------------


With the stock market still in the grip of a significant correction, staying heavily in cash is wise. Underlining this point: The [IBD Mutual Fund Index](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DailyGMI012522.pdf) shows that performance by active fund managers so far in January is very poor.


But this is an opportunity to stay engaged and build up a strong watchlist of potential new leaders before the stock market gets back into forward gear. You can see which stocks entered [IBD watchlists today by clicking here](https://www.investors.com/research/blackstone-stock-celanese-hope-bancorp-among-12-new-stocks-on-ibd-watchlists/).


Investors should be looking out for stocks that have pulled back in orderly fashion while showing impressive relative strength. Avoid stocks that are more than 50% off their highs. The smaller the declines lately, the more opportunity for [individual stocks with CAN SLIM traits](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) to stage a [stunning breakout to new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

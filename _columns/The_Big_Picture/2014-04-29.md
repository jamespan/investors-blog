Nasdaq Leads Market Advance As Volume Declines
===============================================

The major indexes rose moderately as the market kept searching for a clear direction.

  

The Nasdaq climbed 0.7% to lead the main indexes. That's something that hasn't happened much lately now that the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average have taken the market's lead.

  

The S&P 500 and Dow added 0.5% Tuesday. Volume was lower.

  

Monday's lows are significant at the moment because if they can hold up, the major indexes will have broken the trend of lower lows that started in March.

  

But the Nasdaq is still making lower highs. Its 50-day moving average has started to bend downward ever so slightly. Other signs are concerning. For example, despite the Nasdaq's decent gain Tuesday, fewer than 150 stocks separated the winners from the losers. Breadth was much better on the NYSE, where advancers led decliners by a 3-2 ratio.

  

Many of the Nasdaq's largest components are wounded. **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is 12% off its high, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) 19%, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) 26%, **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) 18% and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) 13%.

  

If it weren't for its well-performing personal technology titans — **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) — the Nasdaq would be in worse shape.

  

Nevertheless, the 4000 level has been a floor for the Nasdaq since December, and Monday's bounce showed it is still providing support. The index fell to 4014 when it started trimming losses.

  

The S&P 500 is faring better, trading close to a new high.

  

Strength in energy, utilities and transportation stocks have buoyed the index. Bigger stocks have performed better: Small-cap growth funds are lagging big-cap growth funds, as the table on IBD's mutual fund section (today on Page A8) shows.

  

But leading growth stocks don't look quite ready to rally.

  

Nearly half the IBD 50 are below the 50-day moving average. About half also are forming bases, but most seem to just now be forming the lows of their patterns.

  

There's been little success with breakouts, as might be expected in a market in correction.

  

**Shire** ([SHGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHGP)) broke out of a base Monday but fell as much as 5.5% below the buy point Tuesday in heavy trading.**Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD))is doing better, rising from a 70.97 buy point, and **Old Dominion Freight Lines** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) is up 2.5% from Thursday's breakout.

  

On Tuesday, **Lorillard** ([LO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LO)) broke out. There's been strength in defensive stocks, and the company was discussed in Tuesday's Income Investor column. Also, CNBC reported the industry could see consolidation, citing rumors that **Reynolds American** ([RAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAI)) is interested in buying Lorillard.

  

The IBD 50 rallied 1.3%. Any time this proxy of leading growth stocks outperforms so easily, it can be taken as a good sign.

  

Always be ready with a watch list because the market could quickly be back in a confirmed uptrend.

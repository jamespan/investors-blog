Stock Market Recovery Continues Amid Encouraging Data; These Key Tests Lie Ahead
=================================================================================

The stock market roared to cap its fourth straight up week Friday. Indexes punched their way higher again, with encouraging inflation data emboldening the bulls.




Wall Street has been showing signs for a while now that it believes the economy may be turning a corner. The past week, improving breadth and better-than-feared consumer and producer price index data saw more traders snap up riskier stocks.


But while sentiment is improving, investors need to remain on their guard. In fact, a period of consolidation to digest the four-week rally could be a positive before stocks push higher again. The key is to use the daily action of the major indexes and the current stock market leaders as your principal guide.


Stock Market Indexes Climb Again
--------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite was the strongest out of the major indexes, closing at session highs as it popped 2.1% Friday. It is now up 5.3% for the month and has narrowed its losses for the year to under 18%.

It is now nearing a crucial test as it sits just 1.1% below its downward-sloping [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was also encouraging, with all closing in the green. Consumer discretionary and technology, crucial areas for growth stock investors, made the best gains.


Blue chips were also rising, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 1.3%. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) continued to perform well following earnings as it popped 3.3%, while **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was also strong with a 2.1% gain.


Small caps also impressed, with the Russell 2000 gaining 2.1%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) posted a more moderate gain of 1.3%.


Retail Earnings, Fed Minutes Next Big Hurdles
---------------------------------------------


A slew of big retail earnings are due in the coming week, with the likes of **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) all on deck.


Stock market investors will be watching those reports closely for more information about the health of the U.S. consumer.


In addition, the latest Fed minutes are set to be released on Wednesday. While no Federal Open Market Committee meeting will take place in August, the document will give further insights into how central bankers expect to use their tools to control inflation.


Sentiment is rising that the Fed may take a less hawkish approach to rates. San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly spoke out to say it too early to "declare victory" on inflation, but did signal support for smaller rate hikes.

Chip Stocks Among Industry Group Winners
----------------------------------------


It is always key to keep track of the leading stock market industry groups. On Friday, chip equipment makers, auto manufacturers and mining stocks were among the best areas. The dairy products group was strongest.


The key chip manufacturing group finished just outside the top 10 for the day but now sits just a hair below the key 40-week moving average.


Only a few industry groups gave up ground for the day, with oil & gas royalty trusts and mail order retailers the worst performers.

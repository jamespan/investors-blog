  Stocks Trim Gains But Close Higher As Key Level Holds For Now; This Is Market's Latest Bull Theme

The stock market went awry Monday amid a second straight session of dubious action. Yet for now, the market's uptrend remained intact.




The Nasdaq was up nearly 2% in the first 90 minutes of trading Monday, but faded and was briefly lower at midday. It closed only 0.4% higher.


Other indexes also languished. The S&P 500 trimmed a 1.5% early increase to 0.3% at the closing bell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saved only a fraction of the day's gains, up less than 0.1%.


If there was a positive element to Monday's trading, the three indexes held above their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). They've become a support level since the May 26 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), and investors should watch index action around those lines.


Indexes made a series of bullish-looking closes high in their daily price ranges before and after the follow-through. That bullish sentiment helped the stock market stick its cleats into the late-May rebound, leaving a working uptrend in place.

A tentative conclusion is that the fast rebound needed a pause. With only one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) so far in the major indexes, investors can still afford some exposure to stocks.


Stock Market Today: Indexes Close Near Session Lows
---------------------------------------------------


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to also climb in the NYSE. While you can argue the indexes' stalling form indicated institutional-scale selling, the day's action did not fit the mold of true institutional selling.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 8 basis points to 3.037%, putting the benchmark yield back above 3% for the first time in more than three weeks.


When the yield topped 3% in early May, it helped cut short a rebound in the S&P 500.


Many of the stock opportunities are coming in select groups or thematic trades.


On Monday, for example, solar energy stocks heated up after the Biden administration said it [plans to pause some tariffs on solar imports](https://www.investors.com/news/solar-stocks-rally-as-biden-gives-solar-a-boost-with-tariff-freeze/) for a two-year period. IBD's solar energy industry group jumped 5% and was the best performing out of 197 industry groups.



**JinkoSolar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) broke out of a deep cup base, and closed above the 66.47 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The buy range goes to 69.79. Volume was heavy and the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) hit new highs.


**Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) gapped up and is now extended from the 53.70 buy point of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


Shipping Stocks Rebounding
--------------------------


Shipping stocks are showing new life, with the group now up to No. 10. **Genco Shipping & Trading** ([GNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNK)) is in the buy zone from a 26.10 buy point in a narrow consolidation. Others in the group are forming the right side of bases.



**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) gapped down but trimmed its loss to about 2% in afternoon trading. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) CEO Elon Musk [threatened Monday to end his $44 billion planned acquisition](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-falls-musk-threatens-to-quit-acquisition/) of Twitter. Musk accused the social media company of failing to comply with his request for data on the number of users and fake accounts on the social media platform.


The IBD 50 rose 0.7%, outperforming the major indexes. Credit the IBD 50's stable of cyclical, energy and materials stocks for most of that.


Later this week, the stock market faces some [critical economic reports](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). On Thursday, the weekly jobless claims report could indicate if the pace of hiring is cooling, as some major companies have warned. On Friday, the U.S. consumer price index is due out. The consensus forecast in Econoday is a 0.7% increase from the previous month and an 8.2% increase from a year earlier.

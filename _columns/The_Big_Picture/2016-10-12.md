Stocks yawned amid clear evidence of a growing rift in views on interest rates among leaders of the most powerful financial institution in the U.S. The market on Wednesday likely disappointed the bulls as much as the bears.


Meanwhile, the continued rise in the yield of the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond hinted strongly at growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will take the final meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14 as an opportunity to raise the cost of money for only the second time in two years.


The 10-year yield edged up to nearly 1.78%, according to Tradeweb — good for a 30% climb since its early-July low near 1.37%.


The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by a selling spree in the wireless-infrastructure and data-security sectors, fell 0.1% and traded in a much narrower band than Tuesday's big slide. The Nasdaq 100 was off less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 inched barely 0.1% higher.


![mp101216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP101216-203x300.png)Volume fell on both main exchanges, making it clear that equity trading desks across the country are waiting for the latest batch of quarterly earnings and sales reports to come in. The next three weeks see a gush of reports. Friday kicks off a string of reports from Wall Street banks, including **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and scandal-hit **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)).


The Nasdaq finished below its 50-day moving average for a second straight session and one day after the IBD current outlook for the market switched from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure."


In such a state, the uptrend remains in place, but leading stocks are generally more vulnerable to sharp pullbacks. It's also more difficult to make money going long.


At the same time, the outlook does not mean every investor should run for the hills.


Some leaders are clearly triggering sell signals; the latest one came in the form of a 6.3% decline in **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)), the global expert in wireless internet gear for wide geographic regions. That drop sent the stock sliding below its 50-day moving average for the first time since its breakout past 41.31. That pattern was perched on top of a monster base that stretches all the way back to its all-time peak of 56.85 set in March 2014.


Ubiquiti, No. 4 in the IBD 50, did not report any significant news. Instead, it appeared to fall in sympathy with a 20% plunge in wireless gear giant **Ericsson** ([ERIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERIC)), which has reported falling sales in both 2014 and 2015. On Wednesday, the Swedish firm reported a 14% drop in revenue and a big cut in gross margins. The stock is now 64% below its 2011 high.


Stocks didn't move much after the minutes from the Fed's Sept. 20-21 meeting revealed that three members of the Fed argued that it's already past time to normalize rates. Kansas City Federal Reserve CEO Esther George felt that "the Committee's recent policy choices had incorporated too much discretion" and that a delay in hiking interest rates would present a risk in "eroding the credibility of its policy communications."


Loretta Mester of the Cleveland Fed pushed for a gradual increase in rates, while Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren fretted that acting too late would force the bank to engage in future money-tightening measures that "could shorten, rather than lengthen, the duration of the economic expansion."


What's an investor to do? You could argue that one minute extra spent reading the tea leaves of Fedspeak means one minute less in searching for the next **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **L Brands** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)), Dell, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) or **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)). The ultimate job of the growth stock picker is to find those companies that can deliver outstanding growth, whether the fed funds rate hovers near 0.5% now or 2.5% years from now.


This means it's crucial to find companies with outstanding earnings growth, big sales, fantastic new products, superb management, solid price and volume action on the chart, and evidence of long-term institutional accumulation.


Certainly, some new IPOs have been rocked with heavy selling. Wind power play **TPI Composites** ([TPIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPIC)), following a brisk rally after its July 22 market debut at 11 a share, has plunged 22% over the past two sessions to 17.50 and clipped its newly born 50-day line for the first time.


However, other new IPO leaders are hanging tough.


Some millennials and Gen X'ers may never need a car again so long as Uber and Lyft are around. But they still need to eat. **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), a top 10 play within the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/), has helped expand the "on-demand economy" with its service to allow smartphone users to order food at restaurants for delivery or pickup. The Chicago-based software firm is trying to rebound off the 10-week moving average for the first time since its breakaway gap from a long bottoming base July 28.

The stock market tried to make a case Monday that Friday's sell-off was an anomaly, but was it a convincing one? The short answer is no despite some strong action in individual growth names.


Premarket futures pointed toward a sharply lower open Monday, but that all changed by the close as major averages erased early losses and ended with solid gains in lower volume.


The Nasdaq composite jumped back above its 50-day moving average Monday, rising 1.7%, helped by strength in biotech stocks. The Nasdaq's price action was compelling, indeed, but volume came in lower than Friday's level.


The S&P 500 and Dow rose 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. Both indexes are still below their 50-day lines but not by much. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both exchanges by about 5 to 2.


Monday's performance notwithstanding, the market uptrend remains under pressure. Friday's weak action in the major averages can't just be swept under the rug. An elevated distribution-day count for the S&P 500 is not the most conducive of environments to make money in stocks. It's still a volatile market that could go either way. Exposure to growth names should be limited.

The IBD 50 outpaced the broad market, rising 1.9%. China-based **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) was the strongest gainer in the index of leading growth stocks. After slumping nearly 4% Friday in lukewarm volume, shares rocketed to an all-time high Monday, rising nearly 8% in strong trade. But NetEase's price action was the exception, not the rule, because most growth stocks, just like the major averages, rallied in volume that was lower than Friday's.


For example, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) fell nearly 3% Friday in volume 35% above average, but rallied only 1% Monday in lower volume. It's still acting well, but there wasn't much conviction behind the buying Monday.


Other IBD 50 names did well Monday, including **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **Monolithic Power** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). All four delivered solid gains and found support at their 50-day lines.


Medical-sector stocks and miners outperformed Monday


**Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) enjoyed a bullish session, rising 3% in strong volume. It's extended after clearing a double-bottom base with a 160.85 buy point, but it's also getting support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since the breakout, which puts the stock in a buy range.


Dow component **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) reversed higher as it traded tightly above its 50-day moving average. It was featured in an **[Income Investor](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/ahead-of-dividend-wall-street-likes-growth-prospects-at-merck/)** column last week.


Peruvian precious metals firm **Buenaventura** ([BVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BVN)) showed supporting action at its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 4% but volume fell from Friday's level.


U.S. stocks refused to follow the lead of overseas markets, which fell sharply overnight. Germany's DAX gave up 1.3%, while London's FTSE 100 and Paris CAC 40 lost 1.1% each. Last week, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi left interest rates unchanged, as expected, but investors got rattled after Draghi acknowledged that policymakers did not discuss extending the current bond-buying program beyond March.

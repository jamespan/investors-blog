Stocks Add To Record Highs; New Breakouts Productive So Far
============================================================

The stock market rose Tuesday, stretching an advance that already has left the main indexes at record highs.


The Nasdaq climbed 0.3% and the S&P 500 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4% and closed above 19,000 for the first time. All three indexes closed near session highs and added to Monday's record-breaking closes.


![mp112216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP112216.png)Volume rose from Monday's totals, but trading was below average. The week of Thanksgiving is not the time to look for heavy trading, with trading desks in semi-vacation mode.


Volume has trended lower since the Nov. 9 market surge sparked a rebound. Such trends can be interpreted as a vacuum of institutional buying that could undermine an uptrend. But this volume pattern is just too short to draw any conclusions.


The Russell 2000 also is at record highs, and its advance has been more dramatic than the other three indexes as small caps spearhead the postelection rally. The Russell is up more than 15% since the Nov. 3 low. That's far better than the Nasdaq's 7% leap from the Nov. 4 low or the S&P's nearly 6% vault.


While small caps have carried the November rally, the elephants of the Dow also have contributed. The industrials have risen more than 6% from the Nov. 4 low, with **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and the financial components among the best this month.


The IBD 50 rose 0.8% Tuesday. Among leading stocks, not only have there been plenty of breakouts, but there's also been follow-up among many of those new opportunities. In other words, dozens of stocks have kept rising after breaking out from [buy points](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787). That's a significant change in character for a market that for much of this year has been frustrated by sputtering breakouts.


Examples of good follow-up gains can be found in many sectors, but primarily in small and midcap stocks.


In finance, **MB Financial** ([MBFI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBFI)) and **Evercore Partners** ([EVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVR)) are well-extended from buy areas. In technology, it's **Synchronoss** ([SNCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNCR)), **Airgain** ([AIRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIRG)), **KLA-Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)). In transportation, examples include **Oshkosh** ([OSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSK)) and **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)). On the consumer side, **Children's Place** ([PLCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLCE)) and **SodaStream** ([SODA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SODA)) have roared ahead.


But nowhere is follow-up action more evident than in regional banks. Many stocks in that industry are already up more than 20% from buy points — the type of gains that justify taking profits.


Metals and mining led the market Tuesday. Steel stocks in particular were strong, rising 6% as a group. **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) jumped more than 4% and is extended from a Nov. 9 breakout past 57.18.


Retail was another sector that rose broadly. Discount chains surged 5% after **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) vaulted 8% on its earnings report and optimism about the holiday shopping season. Apparel, jewelry, consumer electronics and department stores were other retail groups that led the market.


Existing-home sales in October rose to the highest level since February 2007. But there was limp reaction in housing stocks. The IBD homebuilders industry group rose barely 0.2%.

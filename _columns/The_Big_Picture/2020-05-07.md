Stock Market Rally Continues, As Nasdaq Turns Positive For 2020; Roku Dives Late On Earnings
=============================================================================================

The stock market ended the session with solid gains, even after some afternoon selling hit the major stock indexes. The Nasdaq composite turned positive for 2020, completing a remarkable recovery after the coronavirus stock market crash.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied 1.4%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.15% and 0.9%, respectively. All three major stock indexes closed off their highs, but there was no late-day slide as in the previous two sessions. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.6% rise.


Leading growth stocks outperformed the major indexes: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) jumped 1.6% amid strength in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) idea **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), which surged 10% on its addition to the S&P 500 index. Volume was higher on NYSE and Nasdaq vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Uptrend Continues
------------------------------


With the current stock market uptrend more than five weeks long (IBD [upgraded the outlook to confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) on April 2), investors continue to see a sharp rally featuring strong breakouts past [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Bullishly, the Nasdaq continues to lead the current stock market rally with tech giants **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) adding to their recent breakouts' gains.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MP050720-227x300.jpg)Meanwhile, there is only one day of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq (April 28) and on the S&P 500 (April 30). The Nasdaq's distribution day is close to falling off due to the recent price action. If the index moves up 5% from the closing price of the distribution day, then it is considered no longer relevant to the current action. For the Nasdaq, that price target is 9038.11.


The Nasdaq turned positive for 2020, completing a remarkable recovery that few investors saw coming. At the close on March 23, the Nasdaq had declined 23.5% year to date.


After Thursday's 1.4% gain, the Nasdaq is just 9% off its all-time high. At the March 23 low, the Nasdaq had declined as much as 33% from its all-time high.


Amid the solid uptrend, a number of high-profile growth stocks continue to break out, particularly on earnings releases. On Thursday, new [IBD Leaderboard stocks](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) staged powerful moves on earnings. These types of bullish moves could be easing investor fears about the potential economic impact of the coronavirus shutdowns.


On Friday, the Labor Department will release its highly-anticipated jobs report, with more detail on the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.


Breakout Stocks To Watch: Dropbox, Trade Desk
---------------------------------------------



Top stocks near buy points in the current stock market rally include [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) and **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)). Both breakout stocks reported earnings after the close Thursday.


Dropbox [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past a 21.34 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) Thursday, advancing more than 7.5% in heavy volume, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) tops out at 22.41.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Dropbox stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-dropbox-inc-cl-a-dbx.aspx) has a 96 out of a highest-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the top echelon of growth stocks.


Late Thursday, Dropbox beat the Street's Q1 earnings and sales estimates. Shares rose almost 3% to 22.50 after the close.


Trade Desk [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past a 323.88 buy point in a deep cup base. At its lows, Trade Desk corrected as much as 58% from its all-time highs, deeper than normal. In most cases, a cup with handle shows a decline of no more than 33% to 35%. But a deep base can be acceptable during a bear market, such as the coronavirus stock market crash.


Trade Desk slid about 3% to 313 after the close. The advertising services firm reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings results.

Earnings Movers: Inphi, Roku
----------------------------



Meanwhile, earnings season continues to be a driving force behind big stock moves. After the stock market close, tech leaders **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) and **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) reported their earnings results.


Inphi beat top- and bottom-line estimates late Thursday. Shares rose about 1% after the close. The chip leader ended Thursday about 17% above a [double bottom's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) 84.57 buy point. Shares recently triggered the [20%-25% profit-taking sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/), so investors could have taken at least partial profits off the table ahead of the report. The stock, though, hasn't made any serious sell signals.


Roku reported [mixed results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q1-2020-roku-stock/) late Thursday. The company met earnings targets and beat revenue estimates. But shares dove nearly 7% to about 128 in the after-hours session. The streaming video platform broke out Thursday above a [deep cup-with-handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) 135.57 buy point. But the stock's relative strength line remains far from its old highs, a potential flaw.

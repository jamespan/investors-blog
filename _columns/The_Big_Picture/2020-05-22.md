Stock Market Shrugs Off Rising U.S.-China Tensions; Alphabet, Tesla Approach New Buy Points
============================================================================================

The stock market ended a mostly quiet day near session highs, as coronavirus vaccine optimism offset rising U.S.-China tensions. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied 0.4%, handily outperforming the other major stock indexes.




The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed losses to less than 0.1%. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.6%. Leading growth stocks sharply outperformed; [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied more than 1% to recover the entirety of Thursday's decline. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Thursday's session.


Stock Market Rebound From Thursday's Reversal
---------------------------------------------


After the Nasdaq's downward reversal Thursday, it would have been quite normal for the stock market to continue lower Friday. And selling did resume Friday morning, but tech stocks quickly recovered, closing with solid gains. With still only one day of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq (on May 12), the market uptrend remains in a bullish mindset. The S&P 500 shows only two distribution days.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MP052219-249x300.jpg)On the downside, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) dove nearly 6% Friday despite [strong quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/alibaba-earnings-q4-2020/). The top China stock triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) from the 216.20 entry in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). Alibaba is one of the few failed breakouts during the current uptrend. Meanwhile, **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) toppled 5.1% and 7.35%, respectively.


Netflix fell sharply for a second straight day with a 1.6% retreat, extending a losing streak to five sessions, a stark divergence relative to the week's stock market gains. Visually, you can use the stock's faltering [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) to see the stock's underperformance. Shares are nearing the 7%-8% loss sell-rule trigger from an add-on entry at 449.62.


Rising U.S.-China tensions present what could a potential headwind to the current stock market rally. On Friday, China announced a new national security law aimed at imposing more control over Hong Kong. The move was widely seen as a challenge against the U.S. Midday Friday, the U.S. fired back. The U.S. Commerce Department said it will impose new restrictions on access to U.S. technology on China's Ministry of Public Security's Institute of Forensic Science and eight Chinese companies.


Earlier this week, the [U.S. Senate passed a bill](https://www.investors.com/news/alibaba-stock-falls-senate-bill-risks-us-listings-chinese-stocks/) that could eventually put at risk the U.S. listings of companies based in China.


The recent actions come less than a month after President Donald Trump said at a White House event — on April 30 — that he could use tariffs to punish China over the coronavirus outbreak.

Breakout Stocks To Watch: Alphabet, Tesla
-----------------------------------------


Top stocks near buy points in the current stock market rally include FANG stock **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and electric-auto maker **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).


[Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/google-stock-claws-back-as-antitrust-e-commerce-battles-loom/), Alphabet, is trading just below a 1,415.63 buy point in a cup with handle — according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Alphabet stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-alphabet-inc-cl-a-googl.aspx) has a 97 out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


Tesla is toying with an aggressive entry around the 833 price level, using a [downward-sloping trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) from the top of the handle on a daily chart. However, the conventional buy point is at 869.92 when the chart is interpreted as a cup with handle.


Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line is right at new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/), signifying sharp outperformance vs. the general market. A previous breakout above a 775.05 buy point in a cup with handle failed when CEO Elon Musk tweeted the stock price was "too high."

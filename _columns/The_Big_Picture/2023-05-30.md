The stock market couldn't hold early gains Tuesday as Wall Street returned from the long holiday weekend. News of a debt-ceiling deal fueled positive sentiment early, but the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 closed near session lows and suffered a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/), adding a distribution day to both indexes.




The debt ceiling agreement suspends the borrowing limit for two years, while curbing government spending during that time. But some Republicans in the House and Senate said they would oppose the deal. The House vote is Wednesday.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite soared above the 13,000 level, rising 1.4% intraday. But the gain faded to 0.3% by the close. The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) also closed near its lows after a strong start. Declining stocks on the Nasdaq outnumbered advancers by about 6-to-5. Volume rose, so the stalling session resulted in a [distribution day.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) That's seven for the S&P 500, which is a concern.


Some bullish gainers in recent days continued their rapid ascents, including [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) and **C3.ai** ([AI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AI)). **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) also rallied but reversed lower.


No doubt it's tempting to buy the strongest performing stocks, but the four stocks just mentioned are far extended from proper entries. And the crop of extended stocks keeps growing by the day, which raises the risk profile.


A name like **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) might look like it's still in the early stages of breaking out of a nine-week consolidation. But keep in mind the stock was up 18% last week alone. After four straight daily gains, ANET stock could be ready to take a breather. Buying on a pullback makes more sense at this point.

Meanwhile, some stocks that tried to break out to the upside didn't look very good by the close. A good example is **Life Time Group Holdings** ([LTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTH)), which tried to break over a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) but failed miserably. **On Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) reversed lower after trying to clear a 14-week consolidation.


The S&P 500 edged higher but also closed near its low for the session in higher volume, resulting in a stalling session. During the session, the index hit its highest level since Aug. 19.


The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) was one of the worst performing S&P sectors, down 1%. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $69.46 a barrel, down 4.4%, as traders awaited the start of Sunday's OPEC meeting.


Steel and coal stocks also underperformed.


Interest Rates
--------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) lagged with losses of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.


The 10-year Treasury yield backed off highs after a strong move in recent days. The yield was trading around 3.69% around 5 p.m. ET, down 13 basis points, ahead of Friday's jobs report. Once again, the Federal Reserve will be looking for softness in the labor market to help in the fight to bring inflation down.

Economists see nonfarm payrolls rising 180,000 in May, with the unemployment rate ticking higher to 3.5%.


The economy created 250,000 jobs in April, much more than expected, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 3.4%. The noteworthy part of April's jobs report was that job growth in February and March was revised sharply lower, good news for a Fed that wants to see the labor market cool down.


As it stands now, federal funds futures traders think there's a 62% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise the federal funds by another 25 basis points at the June meeting. That would raise the fed funds rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), database software firm **Confluent** ([CFLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFLT)) gapped above last week's highs in strong volume.


From an entry at 29.82, Confluent is near the top of the 5% buy zone, although the current market environment has been friendlier to early entry points as opposed to stocks breaking out of well-formed bases into new high ground. Base breakouts generally need repeated bouts of institutional buying to fuel sustained moves. Some breakouts are working, but many others are not.



**New Relic**'s ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)) breakout looked great on May 17, but the stock extended its losing streak to seven sessions Tuesday. With losses from the 80.98 buy point exceeding 13%, the breakout has failed.


It's another busy week of earnings in the software sector, highlighted by Dow Jones stock **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), which reports Wednesday after the close. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) is near highs after CRM stock cleared resistance at 200 a few weeks ago. Adjusted profit is expected to rise 64% to $1.61 a share. Look for revenue to be up 10% to $8.17 billion.


Salesforce joined Leaderboard on May 10 at 205.02. The model portfolio is 62% invested at this point, right in line with IBD's targeted invested percentage of 40% to 60%.


Salesforce was featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/salesforce-stock-ramps-higher-earnings-3-security-software-stocks-to-watch/) story, which also highlighted upcoming reports from security software stocks like **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)).

Inside the IBD 50
-----------------


The stock market remains on a confirmed uptrend, but new buys are getting harder to find. Don't force the issue by buying second- and third-tier stocks in a group. It's OK to be patient and let the setups come to you.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) and **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)) are two setups to watch. But after several up weeks in a row, it would be good to see MBLY and ASAN add handles to their current patterns. A handle is where the last remaining sellers get shaken out of a stock. Asana [reports quarterly results Thursday](https://www.investors.com/research/growth-stock-asana-approaches-buy-point-ahead-of-earnings-ai-tools-are-tailwind/).


IBD 50 firm **Global-E Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) is close to reclaiming a 34.92 buy point. **Fluence Energy** ([FLNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLNC)), one of the few bright spots in the oil and gas sector, closed off highs after topping a 24.87 handle entry.

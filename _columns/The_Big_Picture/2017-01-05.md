Small caps again led the stock market Thursday, but this time they were leading the way down.


The small-cap S&P 600 sawed off 1.4%, its biggest percentage loss of the current market uptrend. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 lost 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. The Nasdaq outperformed with a 0.2% gain. Except for the S&P 600, the indexes closed near session highs after paring losses or reversing higher, which is considered positive price behavior.


Volume was down on the Nasdaq but up on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq's stalling day on Nov. 29 was deducted because it is too aged to count any longer.


![mp010517](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP010517-193x300.png)Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the hardest hit sector was retail. Department stores, apparel and shoes, jewelry, consumer electronics, home furnishings, discount and variety â€” it didn't matter: All went down following poor outlooks from **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) and **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)).


One exception within the retail sector was internet retailers.


**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), a Latin America internet retailer, popped 3.3% in above-average volume. The stock recently retook its 50-day line as it works on the right side of a base.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rose 3% in brisk volume. Amazon closed above its 50-day moving average line for the first time since Oct. 27.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) gapped up 4% in strong volume. The Hong Kong-based company reclaimed its 50-day line for the first time since late October.


Traditionally, bulls like to see retail (a guide of consumer health) accompany a market rally, but that hasn't happened broadly speaking. Even restaurants are struggling. But if the three big names above in the online retailing space continue to recover, they could provide some opportunities.


If MercadoLibre and Alibaba can break out of their base, they would be only second-stage patterns. Amazon also is working on a second-stage base, putting aside the abnormal sell-off in the August 2015 flash crash.


Individual investors will have to weigh for themselves how they want to account for the flash crash. Keep in mind though, that the reset rule is designed for normal action, i.e., it should reflect what funds were doing on more than just one day.


Another big name with potential is **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). The stock has formed a cup-with-handle base. The first-stage base shows net accumulation, and the handle has soft volume. Both are desirable traits. The potential buy point is 118.12.

In some respects, Thursday's action had the characteristics of profit-taking among the leaders.


Banks stocks ran into trouble Thursday. PowerShares KBW Bank ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)), an exchange-traded fund, dropped 1.5%. The ETF broke out in October, but didn't find much traction until after the presidential election. From the Election Day close, KBW rose 25% to a Dec. 9 high. Since then, it has been working on a shallow consolidation.


Breakout Thursday included **Antero Midstream Partners** ([AM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AM)) and chipmaker and late October initial public offering **Quantenna Communications** ([QTNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QTNA)). **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) rose nearly 2% after topping a 129.39 buy point on Wednesday.


**Coming up Friday:** The Bureau of Labor Statistics will report nonfarm payroll data for December before the market's open. The Street expects 175,000 jobs added. The range of estimates runs from 151,000 to 210,000.


A half-hour after the market's open, the Department of Commerce will report factory orders for November. The consensus view is for a 2.5% decline. Estimates range from -3.6% to -1.9%.

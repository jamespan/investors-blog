The Dow Jones and small-cap stocks led a stock market rally Monday as major stock indexes started off the week on solid ground.




But it wasn't the greatest of closes for the blue-chip index. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average early in the session but ended below the line. The Dow added 0.9%, but closed in the lower half of its intraday range. The index gapped up at the open, and taking that into account, the close was in the upper half.


The S&P 500 picked up 0.8% and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.7%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index performed in line with the Dow, up 0.9%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Transportation stocks performed well, helped in part by strong earnings from **J.B. Hunt Transport** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)). The trucking firm reclaimed its 50-day moving average with conviction, rising 6% to 119.75. It's working on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 126.59 entry.

No Distribution Since Follow-Through Day
----------------------------------------


A feather in the market's cap is that indexes have not seen a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) since the April 10 [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) day. That's a good sign, but it's still a headline-driven market where a good economic headline one day can be a met by a daunting geopolitical one the next.


Headed into Monday, the question was whether or not the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq could punch through their respective 50-day moving average lines.


The Dow rose above its 50-day line for a short while Monday but ended below it. If the Dow and S&P 500 can get above their 50-day lines, a breakout over a descending trend line for both indexes comes into play.


The Dow's trend line can be drawn by connecting its Jan. 26 high of 26,616 with its Feb. 27 high of 25,800. The Dow is starting to edge above that line. A trend line for the S&P 500 can be found by connecting its recent highs of 2,872 and 2,801.


Dow Jones Led By UnitedHealth
-----------------------------


Shares of **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) had a good day ahead of the company's earnings report Tuesday before the open. The health insurer jumped above its 50-day moving average. Shares rose 2.7%.


**Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) also outperformed in the Dow Jones industrials, helped by news its experimental lung cancer drug was stronger than a competing drug from **Bristol-Myers Squibb** ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)). Shares of Merck jumped 2.6, but it's 200-day moving average around just over 59 is a potential resistance level to watch.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) outperformed again after a breakout from a base with a 26.29 buy point. Shares rose 2% to 28.73. The 5% buy zone went up to 27.60.


**TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) also outperformed with a 1.6% gain. The online broker is only 3% off its high as it works on a flat base with a 63.11 entry.


For the first time in a long time, the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com) delivered several base breakouts, but the common bond among them was lukewarm volume.


Security software leader **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) poked above a 123.97 flat-base entry in light volume. A [key industry conference](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/proofpoint-rises-security-stocks-rally-as-rsa-kicks-off/) got underway in San Francisco Monday. Analysts speculated that more deals could be upcoming in the cybersecurity space.


In the energy space, **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) and **PBF Energy** ([PBF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBF)) also cleared bases.


Pioneer broke out over a 190.05 buy point in average turnover. Meanwhile, after a recent cup-with-handle breakout over a 34.47 buy point (see daily chart), PBF cleared an alternate entry Monday of 37.11, 10 cents above the high of a cup-shaped base (see weekly chart). Volume was below average.

Stock Market Rises Again, But Are Bulls Getting Tired? What Indicators Say
===========================================================================

The stock market extended its rebound, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 making new highs and their fifth consecutive higher close. But Wednesday's smaller gains showed the rebound is moderating.




After finding support around the 50-day moving average last Thursday, the Nasdaq composite rose 1.2%, 1.5% and 0.5%. On Wednesday, the index edged up less than 0.2%, despite strength in semiconductors and cybersecurity.


The S&P 500 also can be seen slowing its advance, even as it makes record highs. The S&P rose 0.2% Wednesday and now tests the 4500 level for the first time.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1%. Small caps outperformed a bit, with the Russell 2000 up 0.4%. The IBD 50 rose 0.6%, outperforming the main indexes.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP082521-226x300.jpg)The stock market had some reasons to climb. A massive budget and infrastructure spending bill grew closer to final approval. There was positive news on Covid vaccines from **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) and the **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE))-**BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) [vaccine team](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-falls-after-seeking-full-fda-approval-for-covid-vaccine-boosters/).


Explosive gains for **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) on strong earnings showed confidence in the U.S. consumer. Its rally spilled over to peer stocks **Hibbett Sports** ([HIBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIBB)) and **Academy Sports & Outdoors** ([ASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASO)), both of which are trying to [break out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


All three stocks got air play on [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=gnvb%7Cgnvb%7Cevgr%7C2021%7Cna%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C450929&src=AKCAGE).


Stock Market Dip Works Again
----------------------------


On a technical level, the stock market indexes have cleansed themselves of heavy distribution. On Aug. 6, the S&P 500 had seven [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) and the Nasdaq five. Those numbers thinned out to three and two, respectively. A stock market can flourish under these conditions.


Buying the dip has been an effective strategy in this year's stock market. Basically, buying the S&P 500 at each pullback to the 50-day moving average worked out well each time.


At the same time, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq haven't gotten very far above their moving averages. Thus, investors need to be careful that the market isn't already topping. Following this year's pattern, the S&P 500 has topped after rising as little as 3% above its 50-day average. Wednesday, the index closed 3% above that average.


There's a little more evidence of a tired market. The [Accumulation/Distribution Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of the [Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at D-](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DailyGMI082421.pdf), and the Nasdaq advance-decline line is lagging.


With the stock market unable to sustain its rallies, making money on breakouts has been harder. The list of recent breakouts in [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) shows most are still in their 5% buy zones and a few are below them. Few are outright winners.


Buying With Alternate Entries
-----------------------------


Investors can compensate by using alternative buy points that lie deeper in bases. For many, this means going out of your comfort zone. Instead of buying at clearly defined entries, you [use trend lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) or resistance areas to spot early opportunities. These are more subjective, and can be just as risky as regular buy points. You can find examples of these in [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), a daily webcast, and on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared lower on the NYSE.Â  Together with the stock market's mild gains, it's possible that investors are getting cautious ahead of the gathering of central bank chiefs this week. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at the event Friday, and the market is sensitive to any signs on scaling back stimulus.


Last week's minutes from the July Fed meeting indicated the Fed has decided to slow its bond purchases, and it is only a matter of when to start tapering.


No question, the annual event normally held in Jackson Hole, Wy., (and on the [Kansas City Fed's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KansasCityFed) this year) is sure to draw heavy attention on Wall Street.


Watch For A Fed Surprise
------------------------


"Notable economic policy shifts have occurred at the event in the past, including last year when Powell announced that the Fed would operate under a new monetary policy framework called Flexible Average Inflation Targeting (FAIT), which seeks to avoid premature interest rate hikes," Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist for LPL Financial, said in a report.


"We will have to see if this year's symposium offers any monetary policy surprises as well. Fed watchers will be looking for any additional hints on when monetary accommodation will start to be scaled back."


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 5 basis points to 1.34%, the largest jump since Aug. 6. That sent banking and financial stocks to some of the day's best gains. SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) and SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) rose about 1% each.

  Stocks Reverse Down; Investors Are Still Nervous About This Factor

In this column exactly a week ago, IBD pointed out how important it is to watch [how the major indexes close](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-leads-stocks-higher-the-market-outlook-has-changed-again/), not simply how they open.




 On Valentine's Day, the major indexes closed with lovely gains, registering a [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) on day 4 of a new rally attempt. And this Wednesday? Final-hour selling hooked the major indexes to their [first session of pronounced institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


Investors saw equities lose their edge just as the U.S. Treasury market showed more signs of selling pressure.


As bond prices fell, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond resumed its ascent, moving to as high as 2.95%. That pushed the yield ever closer to the January 2014 intermediate peak of 3.04%.


In 2017, the 10-year yield hit as low as 2.05%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MPdistr022118-221x300.png)For most of the session, the Nasdaq composite looked pretty good. At one point, the tech-centered index got as high as 7338, up 1.4% for the day and easily wiping out the small declines of the prior two sessions. However, stocks lost their edge almost 30 minutes after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of their January meeting on interest rate policy. Selling picked up speed in the final hour of the session and handed the Nasdaq composite a loss of slightly more than 0.2%.


Volume was mostly quiet during the first five hours of trading, then picked up. A mild increase in turnover showed that institutions were eager to take some profits off the table.


The Nasdaq was not the only index to post a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). The S&P 500 went from a gain of nearly 1.2% to a loss of just over 0.5%. NYSE volume grew. Plus, the large-cap index slipped a tad further beneath its 50-day moving average.


The Russell 2000 also lost most of its solid intraday gains, but still ended up 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 gained 0.2%.


A new market uptrend can weather a distribution day or two occasionally. These sell-offs help keep the longs in the market humble. Plus, the major indexes are still holding to decent-sized gains after a bullish reversal on Feb. 9 sparked a new rally attempt following the rapid slide that began earlier in the month.


The divergence in market technicals on Wednesday was notable too. On the Nasdaq, winners edged out losers by a 16-13 ratio, according to preliminary data. In a healthy bull market, stocks tend to rally broadly. No doubt, strength in semiconductor, software, internet, e-commerce, finance, consumer and some commodity issues have given the markets strong gains in January and over the past year and a half.


Judging by the discussions during the Fed meeting, it appeared that top policymakers of the U.S. central bank are not planning to ditch former Fed chief Janet Yellen's intention to increase the cost of money slowly. According to the minutes, board members "judged that [a gradual approach to raising the target range](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-minutes-policy-meeting/) would sustain the economic expansion and balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment."


A quarter-point hike in the Fed funds rate, or what the Fed charges Wall Street and large commercial banks on overnight infusions of cash, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% is virtually in the bag when the Fed meets on March 21 with Jerome Powell at the helm.


In general, higher interest rates are a bearish factor for equities.


The higher cost of money means companies may become less willing to acquire their rivals, which from a bird's eye view serves to shrink the overall supply of stocks on the market. Industries that borrow heavily to build new infrastructure or maintain existing facilities get stung by higher expenses. The Dow utility average, one of the worst performers so far in 2018, slid more than 1.2% lower.


However, research by John Lynch, chief investment strategist at **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)), shows that when the 10-year Treasury yield is below 5%, the two-year correlations between the S&P 500 and interest rates have been positive.


"With the 10-year yield not having eclipsed 3% during this latest bond market sell-off, we think we have a ways to go before the level of interest rates impairs economic activity or the stock market," Lynch wrote in a recent note to clients.


While there is widespread sentiment on Wall Street that the Fed will hike interest rates by a quarter point three times this year, a significant number of futures traders believe it will be four rate hikes. According to the CME Group, there's a nearly 30% chance that the fed funds rate will be at 2.25%-2.5% by the time the Fed holds its final meeting of the year on Dec. 19.


Investor sentiment on equities continues to cool off. This is bullish for stock investors. The Investors Intelligence weekly survey of market pundits showed bullishness sank for a second week in a row and fell below 50%. At 48.5%, it's now at the lowest level since mid-September.



Some former biotech leaders continue to slump, even as IBD's biomedical and biotech group continues to rank within the [top 10 among IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-feb-20-2018/) in terms of six-month relative performance (No. 2 after Tuesday's action).


 **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) dropped nearly 2% to 317.51, posting its lowest close in months. The former biotech group leader and expert in eye disease treatments was highlighted in The Short Side after it flashed a secondary short sale entry point near 390. The gain from that short entry point is now around 23%. Good time to cover.


In other words, it's still a stock picker's market.

A similar theme played out in the stock market Monday as major averages turned in another session of constructive price action.


But it was also another day when leadership came from lagging groups as steel, oil and coal stocks outperformed.


Blue chips were in favor as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4%. The Nasdaq swooned 0.9% in the afternoon but recovered nicely, ending with a loss of just 0.2%. The S&P 500 added 0.1%. Volume fell from Friday’s levels.


The Nasdaq didn’t get any help from heavyweights like **Netflix** ([NFLX,](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX%2C)) **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). All four lagged with losses of 2% or more. Netflix tumbled 6% on negative comments from ITG Research.


![MP_030816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP_030816-177x300.jpg)Small caps stole the show, with the Russell 2000 up 1.1%. The IBD 50 lagged, falling 0.5%. Since the Nasdaq’s follow-through on Feb. 17, the Nasdaq is up 3.8% compared to a 2.8% gain for the IBD 50. With more money flowing into beaten-down areas of the market, growth stocks remain out of favor.


They're not entirely out of favor, though. **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) outperformed in the IBD 50, rising 6% in mostly average volume. The stock has recovered nicely after gapping down Feb. 26 on earnings. It’s only 10% off its high as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base. The company designs light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for flat panel displays.


Breadth was curiously strong on the NYSE as winners topped losers by 2-1. The ratio was slightly better on the Nasdaq.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, April-delivery crude oil settled at $37.90 a barrel, up $1.98, or 5.5%. Oil is now about 40% off its 2016 low.


Growth stocks are looking better, but the market isn’t exactly teeming with successful breakouts. And many that are working are from less-liquid names with questionable fundamentals.


**Superior Industries** ([SUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUP)) offers a good example. Shares jumped 7% Monday after blasting out of a base last week. But recent sales declines, and flat- to single-digit sales in the past two quarters, are nothing to get excited about.


Still, breakouts from **Domino’s** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **Macom** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) and **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)) look fine. Other stocks like **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) are setting up in decent bases.


In the utility space, under-the-radar name **Black Hills** ([BKH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKH)) rose nearly 2%. It completed a three-weeks-tight pattern last week.

Bears reigned over Tuesday's weak session. Small caps and large caps fell in lockstep. And turnover climbed in tandem with rising anxiety over the outcome of new talks expected at the end of this week between the U.S. and China on trade.




While the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 all lost 1.6% to 1.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 1.2%. The blue-chip index saw smaller drops among some of its consumer and retail components.


[On Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), retailing plays such as high-end furniture chain **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) fell less. And salvaged-car auctioneer **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) rallied 0.5% for its third gain in four sessions.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) tripped 1.9% lower.

CLOSE




The Dow Jones transports slid nearly 1.9% even as crude oil futures fell nearly 0.5%. Even electricity and gas providers slumped. The Dow Jones utility average flopped 0.9% — another clear sign that angst over the economic slowdown, which would curtail demand for energy, is rising.


Volume rose on both exchanges.


Beyond Dow Jones: Distribution Days Mounting
--------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP_7x6_100819-276x300.jpg)While a Sept. 3 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) fell off the count for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq due to time, both indexes on Tuesday added a fresh batch of intense professional selling. Therefore, the Market Pulse table shows no change in its elevated distribution-day count.


Since IBD's market outlook got cut to "uptrend under pressure" on Sept. 24, institutional investors have shown no change in their cautious stance. Indeed, the current conditions have favored those growth-oriented portfolios that have plenty of cash to insulate against sharp daily drops.


In the past eight sessions alone, including Tuesday's trading, the S&P 500 has chalked up an additional four [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). And unlike in prior moments of this secular bull run, these drops have not merely been pinpricks.


From Sept. 3 to Sept. 24, the [four distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the S&P 500 showed an average drop of about 0.6%. Not terrible.


But after the switch to "uptrend under pressure," the S&P 500's average decline in higher NYSE volume for its next four distribution days (-0.5% on Sept. 27, -1.2% on Oct. 1, -1.8% on Oct. 2 and -1.6% on Tuesday) jumped to nearly 1.3%.


This trend holds true for the Nasdaq.


The average distribution day since Sept. 27 — down 1.4% — slightly exceeds the S&P 500's 1.3% decline.


When The Fed And The White House Talk ...
-----------------------------------------


Wall Street opened lower after NFIB reported that its small-business optimism index fell in September to 101.8, slightly missing the September [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 102. Producer prices fell 0.3%, another worrying sign.


The NFIB survey has fallen steadily since the index's peak of 108.8 in August 2018, and a series of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods since last year have hampered small businesses.


Ahead of the 2007 market peak and a 58% plunge by the S&P 500 from its then 2007 peak of 1576 to its March 2009 low of 666, NFIB went from a near-term peak of 100.7 in October 2006 to 88.5 by July 2008.


In the afternoon Tuesday, stocks tried to erase their morning losses on news that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled during a talk in Denver that he favors an environment of continued low interest rates. One way to do that: letting the U.S. central bank become a big buyer of short-term Treasury bonds.


Indeed, yields on three-month T-bills plunged 3 basis points to 1.72%, down 10 basis points since the start of October.


Meanwhile, the deputy chief investment officer at Baird recently noted that demographics and technology may also keep interest rates low, which could help stocks.


"As the baby boomers reach retirement, they continue to have a profound effect on both the economy, because they consume less, thereby dampening growth, and on the financial markets, because they save more, thereby driving down yields," Warren Pierson said at an institutional conference for Baird advisors. "And technology advances, especially in robotics and artificial intelligence, also are keeping a lid on consumer goods inflation and wage pressures."


But on Tuesday, the White House threw cold water on the rebound as news wires reported a consideration to bar U.S. travel on certain Chinese officials linked to alleged human-rights violations of Uighur Muslim citizens living in China.


State Of The Nasdaq Today
-------------------------


The Nasdaq, near 7823, now trades 6% below its high, above its 200-day moving average, and locked in an 11-week trading range of 7662 to 8339 — a 9% swing from low to high.


Market internals, meanwhile, show few bullish tints. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has sunk for more than three weeks since mid-September. On Tuesday, losing issues beat winners by more than a 3-1 margin on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


New highs are still thinning. Keep track of the daily count and leading sectors in this regard by going to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


In Need Of Strong Leading Stocks
--------------------------------


So, what has been doing well?


Homebuilding stocks remain leaders. The group went into Tuesday's trading ranked [No. 3 among 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-07-2019/) for six-month relative price performance. (Read more about their action in this [Stock Market Today article](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-falls-592-points-in-2-days-this-industry-group-thumbs-nose-at-china-trade-war/).)


Looking at the top 25 groups, tech has virtually vanished; semiconductor equipment is the only one standing in the chip sector. Food, utility, energy, telecom and insurance dominate the top 25 rankings.



A small posse of high-octane stocks are still fighting the good fight; that is, they've somehow managed to keep an uptrend intact. **L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)), **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), new IPO and Chinese online education pioneer **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)), and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) are testing support at their 50-day moving averages or a [breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) is now beginning to live below its 10-week line. Watch for a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


That seems to be what **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and a fistful of enterprise software firms are doing right now.

Stock indexes closed narrowly mixed Monday, as the day's sector currents helped decide the outcome.


The Nasdaq inched up 0.1% largely thanks to strength in biotechs. The industry group rose more than 2% as news of **Pfizer**'s ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) $14 billion acquisition of **Medivation** ([MDVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDVN)) **[reignited speculation of more buyouts](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-medivation-deal-reignites-biotech-buyout-speculation/)** in health care.


Medivation, which makes a prostate cancer drug, soared nearly 20%; Pfizer eased 0.4%. **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)), which had been courting Medivation, fell less than 1%.


While the biotech rally aided the Nasdaq, weakness in the energy sector and mining stocks hurt the S&P 500, which fell 0.1%.


![MP082216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP082216-181x300.jpg)U.S. crude oil fell 3% to $47.05 a barrel. Morgan Stanley said a **[production freeze among major oil producers](https://www.investors.com/news/four-reasons-why-an-opec-production-freeze-is-highly-unlikely/)** was "highly unlikely." Nine of the 14 worst-performing industry groups Monday were in oil and gas.


In an odd bit of behavior, the indexes made several sudden moves of short duration and magnitude that nonetheless clearly showed up on intraday charts.


Volume fell. That's not unusual in the waning days of summer. Advancing stocks led decliners by 6 to 5 on the Nasdaq and the balance was practically even on the NYSE.


With mixed signals in the indexes, it's hard to read the market's direction. The number of distribution days piled up the past few weeks (five on each index) is not enough to conclude that a correction is imminent.


Yet, the Nasdaq's long winning streak of eight consecutive up weeks is unusual, and that alone suggests that a pullback should be expected. Each week's rise has gotten smaller. The rally began with a 3.3% burst in the week ended July 1, and gains have been in a diminishing trend since then: 1.5%, 1.4%, 1.2%, 1.1%, 0.2% and 0.1% in the past six weeks.


The last time the Nasdaq had such a prolonged advance was in March through April of 2010. That streak ended with a decline in the composite of nearly 19%.


That's no reason to jump off the deep end, of course. Long winning streaks don't always result in market corrections or bear markets. But investors should be guarded at this stage of the uptrend. Shedding unproductive holdings is one option; cutting losses short is always important.


In the short term, some signals are positive. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have closed near session highs in the past four sessions. Market breadth continues to improve.


Mining stocks were broadly lower amid falling commodity prices.


The IBD 50 fell 0.1%, with much of the weakness centered on consumer stocks such as Chinese e-commerce company **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)), retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and meal-delivery service **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)).

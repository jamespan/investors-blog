  Stock Market Remains Quiet, But These Events Could Quickly End The Calm

The stock market continued an unusually quiet trend Monday, even as it prepares for more inflation reports.




For a week now, indexes have traded with a muffled tone. The Nasdaq hasn't moved more than 0.3% in either direction. Other than Wednesday's 0.5% gain, the S&P 500 has averaged less than a 0.2% price change.


On Monday, the Nasdaq added 0.3% and the S&P 500 was down a fraction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% and snapped an eight-session win streak — its longest since December.


The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), commonly known as the VIX, fell to 12.55 Friday, reflecting a rapid cooling of investor fear since the index rose to 21.36 on April 19. The so-called fear gauge bounced Monday to 13.59.


A calm market is not necessarily a bad sign. It reflects investor confidence. As the old Wall Street refrain goes, never short a dull market. Moreover, a pause seems quite appropriate if the stock market is gearing up to make an assault on its March highs.


With its direction uncertain, investors will probably need to wait for this week's economic reports and earnings from major retailers to get additional signals.


Small caps have been more volatile, and the Russell 2000 pared a gain of about 1% to just 0.1%. The IBD 50 index, however, lagged with a 0.7% decline. About 30 of the 50 stocks closed lower.


Stock Market Leadership
-----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP051324.jpg)One positive about the stock market is that it's rising with broad participation this month. From the Magnificent Seven (up 4.4%) to the S&P 100 (up 4.1%), equal-weight S&P 500 (up 3%) and small caps (up 4.5%), the market has left few sectors behind.


Judging by the most recent breakouts in the MarketSurge 250, health care, financial and technology — mainly chips and software for the latter — are the sectors with most interest. A few energy and building stocks also have broken out to new highs.


**Onto Innovation** ([ONTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONTO)) has rallied 15% from its 193.55 buy point. IBD 50 stock **Twist Bioscience** ([TWST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWST)) jumped 12% Monday and is 10% above a 43.21 buy point.


Despite good market breadth, many new opportunities haven't made much progress. Of more than 60 breakouts in the [MarketSurge 250 index](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) the past few weeks, most are still stuck near their buy points. On the plus side, few sell signals have appeared.


Tuesday morning, the stock market gets the [April producer price index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), a prologue to the consumer price index on Wednesday. The numbers will help recalibrate rate expectations for the rest of 2024. Also Tuesday morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at the Foreign Bankers' Association in Amsterdam.


This comes after multiple Fed officials continue to tone down expectations for interest-rate cuts. While inflation has come down considerably from its mid-2022 peak, the last several months of data indicate it will take longer to get to the Fed's 2% target. Remember, the stock market started rallying in November on expectations of multiple rate cuts and a soft landing.


Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said Monday that the slowing progress against inflation is "a source of concern." A resilient job market means the [Fed can afford to delay rate cuts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-jefferson-says-slowing-progress-on-inflation-is-a-source-of-concern-1d3a5b83?mod=home-page) for longer, he added.


The Market And Rate Pauses
--------------------------


The Fed's pause on rate moves now exceeds 280 days, making it the second-longest pause in modern market history, says LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder. It trails only the 2006-07 pause that lasted 446 days. On average, Fed pauses last 146 days.


History says a prolonged rate pause is eventually good for the stock market.


In 10 pause periods over the past 50 years, the S&P 500 has only gained an average of 6% during an average of 160 days. But in the last six pauses, which have run longer than the average, the S&P 500's average gain has been about 13%. During the current pause, the S&P was up 12.4% as of May 1.


"Bottom line: Long pauses are typically good for stocks, and the gains achieved since the Fed's last hike in July 2023 are consistent with recent history," Buchbinder wrote in a note to clients. "It's when the Fed is forced to cut because of economic weakness that stocks tend to sell off — not in the environment we're in today."


In terms of sectors, financials have had the best average performance during Fed pauses. The sector is one of the best performers during the current pause, up more than 16%. Energy has been the second-best performer on average over the last five pauses.

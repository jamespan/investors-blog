In the first sign that the stock market can overcome trade-war fatigue, the stock market Friday dashed ahead at the open and never looked back.




The Nasdaq jumped 1.5%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 added 0.8%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges. Thursday made for a tough comparison because of the Morgan Stanley Capital International rebalancing.


The catalyst Friday was nonfarm payrolls in May. The figure rolled in at 223,000, which was 17% above the 190,000 expected. Even better, the total was 40% above April's revised figure.

Under trade-war threats, good earnings provide no traction to stocks. The market is too worried about a trade war to consider anything as mundane as earnings and revenue.


But Friday the market started acting more like its old self. The payroll figure was stunningly good, and that let stocks rally.


Nasdaq Pierces Resistance
-------------------------


Five minutes into Friday's session, the Nasdaq pierced old resistance at 7500 and easily held above it.


True to the Trump version of PTSD, some market watchers braced for a sell-off at the close. A normal rally was just too good to be true. But the market finished strong into the close, completing the day's bullish tone.


Can The Market Follow Up?
-------------------------


The question now is whether the market can add more gains in the days ahead.


Other news added to Friday's optimistic tilt. Trump announced that the June 12 summit with North Korea was back on the calendar, at least for now.



Breakouts Friday included surgical robotics maker **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), which [won FDA approval for a new surgical robot](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intuitive-surgical-surgical-robot/), and virtualization software provider **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)), which [beat profit expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vmware-earnings-guidance-technology-cloud/).


Among the FANG stocks, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) had the best week, up 4.9% and 4.7% respectively.

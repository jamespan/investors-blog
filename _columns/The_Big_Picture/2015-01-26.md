Stocks overcame early weakness to finish higher Monday, adding to last week's positive action.

  

The Nasdaq rose 0.3% after bouncing back from an 0.5% loss. Monday marked the tech-heavy index's sixth straight gain — the longest winning streak since late November. But when it broke the streak, the Nasdaq went on a 5.5% pullback.

  

The S&P 500 also rebounded from a 0.5% loss to rise 0.3%. The benchmark index defended its 50-day moving average, which it had regained Thursday.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a fractional gain. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1% gain. Small caps had lagged last week.

  

The IBD 50 climbed 0.8%.

  

Volume ended mixed Monday. Nasdaq trade rose from Friday's pace. NYSE volume fell for a second straight session. Breadth was strong, with winners beating losers by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE and nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

  

The stock market was volatile early on news that Greece's anti-austerity Syriza party won national elections, which raised concerns for the eurozone. So the upside reversal was bullish.

  

Another good thing was that more stocks staged breakouts.

  

**Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) blew past an 80.88 buy point in a flat base in heavy trade. The biotech is expected to turn a profit of 21 cents a share this year — its first profit after losing money for several years.

  

**Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) rose for a fourth straight session, clearing a 90.54 buy point from a cup-with-handle base in fast trade. But it closed below that entry.

  

They followed Friday's breakouts from **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)).

  

While earnings reports started to pick up last week, a flood of them will be announced this week.

  

Homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) reported better-than-expected results early Monday, sending shares up nearly 6%. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) fell 3% after the close despite better-than-expected results. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) are some big ones reporting quarterly earnings Tuesday. A two-day Fed meeting also starts Tuesday.

  

A blizzard is expected to hit the East Coast with up to three feet of snow. Thousands of flights have already been canceled. Despite this, airline stocks continued to show strength. The airline industry group, which ranked No. 2 in Monday's IBD, climbed about 1% for the day.

Stock Market Shakes Off Hawkish Fed Talk To End Higher; These Stocks Flex Muscles
==================================================================================

The stock market managed to shake off yet more hawkish Fed talk to end the day higher on Friday. Energy stocks look to be cooling as recession fears mount but for now it could be just a head fake.




The Nasdaq, which has lagged badly this year, ended Friday virtually flat. For the week it was down 1.6% but crucially held above [the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). This was key after the previous week's powerful gain. The index remains down about 30% in 2022, however.


The S&P 500 fared better, turning in a gain of 0.5% Friday. This means it slid just 0.7% for the week, more of a breather than a dip. It remains below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) but is well-positioned to launch another push toward the benchmark in the coming days.


Blue chip stocks outperformed, relatively speaking. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a creditable gain of 0.6% for the day and was flat for the week. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) were the top performers here.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index also clambered 0.6% higher, while the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dipped 0.6%. It was hampered by an abundance of falling energy holdings within the portfolio.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP111822--287x300.jpg)Volume was down on the Nasdaq and appeared to also fall on the NYSE, despite options expirations. That's perhaps a reflection of slowing activity ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Breadth was not ideal, but advancers still slightly outnumbered decliners on both main exchanges.


Stock Market Flexes Muscles Despite Fed Talk
--------------------------------------------


If the current stock market uptrend is going to lead to meaningful gains, it has to show resilience in a headline-driven environment.


This time the market was able to shrug off negative Fed commentary after Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins declined to rule out a fifth consecutive 75-basis-point increase in rates at the next Fed meeting in December.


It came a day after hawkish comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and some of his colleagues knocked the wind out of the indexes' sails.


But investors should certainly not be betting on the central bank ditching its hawkish script anytime soon amid stubborn inflation.

Energy Stocks Slip As These Groups Shine
----------------------------------------


Industry group performance is a key barometer of the broader stock market action.


Shoemakers, computer networking companies, gas utilities and telecom infrastructure stocks all impressed. Fiber-optic plays were strongest of all, though, with **Clearfield** ([CLFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLFD)) a clear leader after it surged nearly 27% in mammoth volume on strong earnings.


Home-furnishings stocks, mail-order plays and shipping companies lagged. Of more note to energy bulls was the fact that oil and gas explorers and coal stocks were among the worst performers. IBD Sector Leader **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) was a notable laggard, falling 3.4% in above-average volume. It has fallen below its latest buy point.

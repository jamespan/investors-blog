Stocks Stumble As Indexes Add Distribution
===========================================

The stock market skidded Tuesday, disrupting the rebound that began last week.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both lost 0.9% as a tide of sellers swept over the exchanges in the final hour.

  

Tuesday was the end of the quarter, a time when many fund managers make last-minute portfolio adjustments to make their quarterly reports look as favorable as possible.

  

That may explain why the indexes were so choppy. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 seesawed all day, closing near session lows.

  

Volume rose across the board; a burst of trading capped the proceedings.

  

The sum of higher volume and index losses created a distribution day. That made it eight for the main indexes in the past few weeks â€” clearly a bearish level.

  

Yet the market's profile isn't exactly in tatters.

  

Breadth wasn't as bearish as the indexes' results might suggest: Decliners topped advancers by 7 to 5 on the NYSE and by 8 to 5 on the Nasdaq.

  

Most leading stocks held up, and there's still little by way of sell signals.

  

The IBD 50 slid 1.1% Tuesday as some medicals and chips lost more. But for the first quarter, the IBD 50 rallied more than 11%, easily outperforming the S&P 500's rise of less than 1%.

  

The market continues a trend of moderate pullbacks and advances, and it seemed to be starting a new leg up.

  

Those undulations have been narrowing. The September-October correction took the S&P 500 down nearly 10%. Each of the following declines was smaller: 5.1%, 4.1% and 3.8%.

  

The late-March decline was 3.3%.

  

That seems to reflect a market that is changing its mind faster and faster.

  

One of the factors contributing to that trend is the fate of interest rates, which are expected to rise sometime this year.

  

Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said the Fed funds rate should be raised in June; his comments helped to unsettle the market early Tuesday.

  

The put-call volume ratio rose above 1.0, indicating elevated fear. That's a contrarian indicator that's worked about as well as any other. Its peak readings have coincided with index lows several times going back to at least last summer.

  

Still, the numerous distribution days cloud the outlook and cannot be dismissed.

  

Investors should have a fair amount of cash in their portfolios by now. Margin trading is especially dangerous in uncertain times like now. It may be necessary to cut losses shorter than normal, at maybe 4% or 5%.

  

A few high-rated stocks have broken out the past couple of weeks. But at this stage of the market uptrend, the best leaders are well into their advances. So don't expect many more winners to emerge. Some buying opportunities will arise from pullbacks to the 50-day moving average or other secondary entries.

  

With the close of the first quarter, the market trains its sights on earnings season. This one has the potential for trouble.

  

Standard & Poor's estimates the S&P 500's earnings per share will drop 3%, although that's skewed by a huge drop expected in the energy sector.

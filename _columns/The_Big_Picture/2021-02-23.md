title: Stocks Rebound From Deep Losses As Indexes Pass Tests Of Key Levels

Stocks worked off some hefty losses Tuesday, cushioning a market pullback that still left some leading stocks woozy.




Indexes closed in decent shape after the Nasdaq composite plunged nearly 4% in early trading. The Nasdaq — feeling the brunt of a sell-off in technology shares — closed 0.5% lower. That's an impressive rebound, especially at the chart levels where it happened.


On Monday, the composite lost support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) became its next safety net, and the composite found support there Tuesday. The Nasdaq dipped below the line but was back above it less than one hour from the opening bell.


No doubt, this was a significant drop. It was the first time the index violated the 50-day average since Nov. 3, just before the Nasdaq made a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


![MP022321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP022321-229x300.jpg)More importantly, the Nasdaq's loss in higher volume gave the index a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The amount of institutional-sized declines in the past several weeks, however, remains tolerable.


The S&P 500 shadowed the Nasdaq's positive behavior in the afternoon. The index found support just above its 50-day average. It closed 0.1% higher after erasing losses. In another good step for the S&P 500, its Jan. 15 distribution day is now too far back in time to have any relevance. That leaves the S&P 500 with three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), same as the Nasdaq.


While the market's bounce came at key chart levels, there was news driving the rebound. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed a commitment to near-zero interest rates, easing some investor angst.


Powell, [testifying before the Senate Banking Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210223a.htm), also downplayed inflation worries. While consumer prices partially rebounded last year, Powell said some of the sectors that were hit hard in the pandemic still are seeing prices "particularly soft."


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1% and has held above its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) during the market downdraft. A mix of better-performing financials and industrial components helped the Dow. On Tuesday, **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) were among the Dow leaders.


So, the main stock market indexes appear to be getting through this bump. But now what?


The short-term market signals are encouraging. The [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) at one point Tuesday spiked more than 20% above the 10-day moving average, which can confirm a positive reversal in the market.


Some Stock Market Leaders Make Sell Signals
-------------------------------------------


Many of the market's leaders picked themselves up from the morning debris. Still, some could not avoid sell signals.



On [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) pared most losses but remained below the 50-day moving average. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) fell more than 7% from its [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) before recovering some. **Chipotle Mexican Gril**l ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) made a [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/).


That's where there is still considerable risk for investors. Growth and technology stocks are vulnerable to profit-taking, and investors must still be on guard for any that suddenly sour.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 2%. While the ETF underperformed the stock market, it made a bullish bounce off its own 50-day moving average. It plummeted 7% at that low. After such a rebound, the expectation is that upward momentum will carry over, at least in the short term.


Small caps lagged, as the Russell 2000 closed 0.9% lower. Yet, the index also came back from a much larger early drop.


In the new highs list, regional banks continue to make a strong presence. Rising yields are a worry for the stock market, but they are fueling a broad advance in the banking industry. That's especially true for smaller banks, which depend more on net interest margin than larger banks. The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond showed a yield of 1.37%, unchanged vs. Monday.

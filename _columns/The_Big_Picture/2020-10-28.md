The stock market faced a harsh round of selling Wednesday, one day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below the low of its Sept. 30 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/). That, in and of itself, was another bad sign for a stock market that has seen an increasing amount of them lately. Selling really picked up the pace late in the session.




Fears of increasing lockdowns in the U.S. and Europe as a result of surging coronavirus cases weighed on sentiment. Late Wednesday, France said restaurants and bars will close, but schools will remain open. Earlier in the day, Germany announced the closing of restaurants and bars.


A soft revenue outlook from **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and an earnings and sales miss from **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) didn't help matters.


Of course, increasing lockdowns could curb economic growth in the U.S. and abroad, which fueled a sell-off in the iShares Transportation Average ETF ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)). It gapped below the 50-day moving average, falling 4.3%. Transportation-related groups were among the hardest hit in IBD's database, including [the airline group, which plunged more than 5%](https://www.investors.com/news/airline-stocks-coronavirus-surge-raises-prospect-of-more-lockdowns/).

IBD's solar group jumped about 5%, helped by bullish earnings moves by **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) and **Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)), as well as solid up sessions for **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) and **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)), which reports earnings next week.


Stock Market Action
-------------------


The Nasdaq composite made a stand at its 50-day moving average Tuesday, but it gapped below the key support level Wednesday, falling 3.7%. Volume surged from Tuesday, resulting in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). The Nasdaq's distribution-day count is still relatively light at three, but all three showed heavy institutional selling.


The Nasdaq did manage to hold above the 11,000 level, a round number that could provide some much needed support. A break below 11,000 could bring the Nasdaq down to its next possible support level, the Sept. 21 low of 10,519.


The S&P failed to make a stand at its 50-day line Tuesday and also gapped down Wednesday. The index fell 3.5% and could be poised for a test of its Sept. 24 low of 3209.45. Volume also rose sharply on the NYSE, giving the S&P 500 its fifth distribution day.


The Dow Jones industrials slumped 3.4% and took out the Sept. 24 low. The blue-chip index looks poised for a test of its 200-day moving average.


Declining stocks swamped advancers on the NYSE by more than 9-to-1. Nasdaq losers topped winners by just over 6-to-1.


IBD moved the market outlook to "uptrend under pressure" Monday. That was a signal for growth investors to start raising some cash, either by taking some profits in big winners, or cutting positions that aren't working. It's not easy to find actionable charts at this point, so listen to the market's message. Stay defensive until better patterns emerge.


Bullish Sentiment Rises
-----------------------


The latest Investors Intelligence survey of stock market newsletter writers showed the bulls rising to 60.6% from 59.2% the prior week. That's a significant percentage based on historical precedent. The bulls were at 61.5% in late August just ahead of a 13% correction for the Nasdaq. Meanwhile, the number of advisors predicting a correction fell to 19.2%. The last time it was below 20% was in September 2018, just ahead of a sharp decline.


The survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops. While excessive optimism has been seen at market tops in the past, excessive fear has been seen near market bottoms.


The Cboe Volatility Index, a popular fear gauge in the stock market also known as the VIX, gapped up and surged past its Sept. 4 high, jumping more than 20%.


The put/call volume ratio, another fear gauge, rose to 0.90, its highest level since late June, when it hit 0.91. But it's not at a level indicating excessive fear. An excessively fearful reading would be at least 1.15. The ratio rises when investors are buying more bearish puts than bullish calls. It's another contrarian indicator.


Chewy Bucks The Trend
---------------------


Bright spots were few and far between, but **Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)) was one. It rose 6% to 72.01 and closed near its high for the day. The move was good for a breakout from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 70.82 buy point. Shares were strong after the company launched a nationwide telehealth service for pets. Chewy was Wednesday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/chewy-stock-ibd-stock-day-new-vet-service-pet-care-chwy/)Â featured stock.



But bases for [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks like **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) don't look so good anymore, with all three stocks below their 50-day moving averages.


And a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) is still intact for **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), which continues to trade near the 21-day exponential moving average.


**Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) held up better than the broad market Wednesday ahead of next week's earnings report. The stock fell 1.5% but traded inside Tuesday's price range, good for an inside day.


In early after-hours trading, earnings winners included Leaderboard stock **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)).

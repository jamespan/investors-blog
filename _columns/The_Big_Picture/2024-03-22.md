  Stock Market Digs In To Book Strong Weekly Gains; Inflation Data Looms In Easter Week

The stock market ended a strong week in tentative fashion Friday. Now, the Fed's favorite inflation reading is a key data point to watch in the shortened Easter week ahead.




Of the major indexes, the Nasdaq composite fared best Friday as it managed to squeeze out a nominal gain of 0.2%, notching a record close in the process. It booked a weekly gain of 2.9%, which allowed it to spring away from its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Up more than 2% in March, the tech-heavy composite heads into the final week of the month holding a gain of more than 9% for the year.


The S&P 500 fell 0.1%, not enough to take the shine off its 2.3% weekly lift. The benchmark index is back on the right path after falling for the previous two weeks and is now up nearly 10% in 2024. Declines were heavier on the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund, though. It fell 0.6% Friday and also lags on a year-to-date basis.


Decliners outnumbered advancers by around 2-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq exchange. Volume was lower on both, though, following recent strong action.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared worst out of the major indexes Friday as it tumbled 0.8%. It was weighed down by a tough session for **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), which plunged 6.7% after it issued a soft outlook amid slowing China sales. Blue chips are up less than 5% this year.


Small caps were given the harshest spanking by the bears, as the Russell 2000 fell 1.3%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) came off lows by the close but still finished the session down 0.7%.


Stock Market Holiday And Inflation Data Next
--------------------------------------------


Stocks took a breather at the end of a week that saw a furious rally following the Federal Reserve decision to hold steady on interest rates.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP032224_new.jpg)The coming week looks more sedate, especially given the fact the stock market will be closed for Good Friday. This means there will be a delayed reaction to the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures reading, which drops during the market holiday. Core PCE, the Fed's favorite gauge of inflation, is expected to rise 2.8% year-over-year.


Also on the agenda is a slew of Fedspeak in coming days. Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook is speaking on Monday, while Gov. Christopher Waller appears Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will take part in a moderated discussion at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy Conference on Friday.


There are also a few [notable earnings reports set to drop](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-dividend-aristocrat-cintas-investment-bank-jefferies/) in the shortened trading week. These include cruise line giant **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)), enterprise software play **Braze** ([BRZE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRZE)) and investment bank **Jefferies** ([JEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JEF)).


These Industry Groups Fare Best
-------------------------------


A majority of the [S&P 500 sectors closed lower Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Communication services and technology had the strongest sessions while financials and real estate struggled the most.


Once again, investors were able to get a better picture of the action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by examining the relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's industry groups.



Specialty alloy steel plays, consumer electronics producers, office supply retailers and fabless chip stocks all had good sessions. The airfreight industry group also stood out, gapping up following a strong earnings report from **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)). The parcel play ended just below a buy zone after briefly clearing a 285.53 entry in high volume. It booked a 7.4% gain for the day.


In contrast, TV stocks, toymakers and foreign telecom services firms all lagged. Additionally, **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) was one of the worst losers as shoemakers and footwear retailers struggled. Lululemon tumbled nearly 16%, undercutting both its 50-day and [200-day lines in the process](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/), after serving up underwhelming guidance.

While Big Tech earnings, elections, the jobs report and the next Fed meeting remain on investors' minds, the Nasdaq climbed to a record high Tuesday. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) soared in after-hours trading after topping both sales and earnings estimates. But **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rival **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) fell after AMD's earnings report.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged other major indexes, falling 0.4%. But the Nasdaq closed at a record high, gaining 0.8% on Tuesday. The S&P 500 edged up 0.2% in the stock market today.


Advancers found themselves outmatched on both major exchanges. Losers topped winners by more than a 2-1 ratio on the NYSE, while decliners edged out decliners on the Nasdaq.




After a day of outperformance, small caps pulled back but remained above the [21-day exponential moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.3%, a minor loss compared with Monday's 1.6% rally.


Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq, noticeably more on the latter. Nasdaq volume ranked among the 11 highest days this year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


McDonald's, F5 Among Earnings Movers
------------------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102924-239x300.jpg)Earnings season is gathering steam, and the stock market saw several earnings movers on Tuesday. Dow leader **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) struggled to get past the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) after the company reported modest growth in sales and earnings in a mixed Q3 report. The impact of the E. coli breakout last week will be more evident in its next quarterly report.


**Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)), a staple on [IBD Long Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), surged after the release of [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cdns-stock-cadence-design-systems-q3-2024-earnings/). In database plays, **Commvault Systems** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) soared as it [beat views and raised its outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/commvault-stock-cvlt-stock-earnings-q3-2024/). **F5** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) lifted the internet network group, which was a top gainer among industry groups on Tuesday.


After the close Tuesday, [Alphabet jumped about 5%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-google-earnings-ad-search-growth-q32024/) after the Google parent reported third-quarter sales rose 15% to $88.3 billion while earnings of $2.12 per share climbed 36%. Analysts polled by FactSet had targeted $1.84 in earnings per share on sales of $86.4 billion.


But Advanced Micro Devices fell in extended trading after third-quarter results were released. Sales came in above views of $6.7 billion at $6.8 billion, while earnings of 92 cents per share matched estimates. But [the company's forecast disappointed](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-advanced-micro-devices-q3-2024-earnings/).


Homebuilding stocks were among Tuesday's worst performing, finishing among the 10 lowest industry groups in IBD's 197 rankings.


**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) reported a decline in sales and earnings, sending the stock tumbling below its long-term 200-day moving average before closing above it. Other [homebuilders triggered sell signals](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/dr-horton-stock-homebuilding-stocks/) as well, as buyers wait for lower mortgage rates in 2025.


**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) sold off after its outlook for the final quarter of the year disappointed and weighed on the apparel and shoes group in the stock market today. The stock gapped below its 200-day line.

Rising Yields Test Stock Market
-------------------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield was essentially flat Tuesday, at 4.27%.


Yields remained near recent highs amid a bond sell-off and pressured the more rate-sensitive segments of the stock market, including small caps. At the same time, gold continued to rise after sentiment among consumers surprised to the upside. On Tuesday, the Conference Board's October survey of consumer sentiment showed a reading of 108.7, beating estimates of 99.1.


But yields could be approaching a tipping point for stocks. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, finds the 4.3% level in the 10-year yield a "[line in the sand for equities."](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-year-treasury-yield-crosses-line-in-the-sand-thatbegins-tospell-trouble-for-stocks-00eb8521) A foray above that "seems to be pretty problematic for equity markets to absorb."


On the flip side, job openings for September did not meet expectations, falling to 7.44 million and to pre-pandemic lows last seen in September 2021.


Job additions in September blew past estimates earlier this month when the Labor Department announced on Oct. 4 that the economy added 254,000 jobs — nearly double what economists had expected.


But that is being factored in as a one-off event, and traders are seeing a 25-basis-point cut during the Fed's meeting on Nov. 7. With nonfarm payroll data for October due on Friday, Econoday's estimates are for 125,000 jobs added.

Stock Market Cools Off, Yet These Leaders Still Thrive
=======================================================

Stocks caught their breath Wednesday, but the tiny index declines and bullish action among market leaders showed that broad underlying strength remains.

  

The Nasdaq's 0.98-point decline — well less than 0.1% — perhaps frustrated or disappointed those who were expecting a deeper pullback.

  

It's clear that February has rewarded investors who respected the market's shift back into a confirmed uptrend on Feb. 10.

  

Since then, the distribution day count has thinned to just one on the Nasdaq and two on the S&P 500. More stocks continue to notch new highs. And most important for the CAN SLIM investor, breakouts are gaining positive momentum.

  

The IBD Leaderboard has grown from five names on the Leaders list on Jan. 7 to 11 today.

  

Other key indexes saw little change. The S&P 500 was off less than 0.1%. The Russell 2000 edged less than 1 point higher. Volume rose on both major exchanges, but no distribution days were added due to the tiny declines.

  

The Dow utility average got hammered again, down 1.6%.

  

That sell-off may reflect moves by big funds to buy more dynamic issues in the stock market. Utilities are not getting any threat from a rise in interest rates. The U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yield remains low. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and the central bank are in no hurry to tighten the money supply.

  

The IBD 50 rose less than 0.1%.

  

It's normal to expect the market to pull back more.

  

But if an investor refuses to buy breakouts on the theory that such stocks will pull back to lower prices, he or she could wind up missing every leader that leaves the station.

  

Sometimes, though, a leader will pull back within buy range, offering a second chance to build a position. Take **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)). The Indian lending giant ran up eight days in a row from Jan. 15 — a few sessions after the Nasdaq's Jan. 8 follow-through — and bolted past a 54.84 flat-base buy point. The stock dropped back to as low as 55.72, within the proper 5% buy range.

  

But that second chance is gone now. HDFC closed Wednesday at 60.36, up 10% from the correct entry.

  

Fellow IBD 50 members **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)), **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) and **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) are also now extended after clearing buy points in January.

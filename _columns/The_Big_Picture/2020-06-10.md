Still largely a tech stock picker's market? Wall Street seems to think so.




The Nasdaq composite reaffirmed its place in modern U.S. history as the equity index to beat. With a fourth straight gain, this time a 0.7% advance, the market cap-weighted index closed above the psychologically critical 10,000 level for the first time.


The composite rose for the eighth day in the past nine. The Nasdaq 100 rallied 1.2% and also hit new highs.


[Fourteen stocks on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) rallied 1% or more. All but three of these stocks reside on the Nasdaq.


In contrast, the S&P 500 showed butterfingers with its modest gains after the [Federal Reserve issued fresh forecasts for the U.S. economy](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-sees-no-interest-rate-hike-before-2023-dow-jones/). A 0.5% gain after the U.S. central bank issued its statement at 2 p.m. ET by the large-cap index melted into a 0.5% loss by Wednesday's close.


Still, the trading range from low to high for the S&P 500 — or 1.3% — hardly could be called extreme. NYSE volume rose vs. the prior day, which marked a second [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500. But this does not mean institutions have suddenly become frantic sellers.

The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund fell 2.7%. That marked its worst single-day drop since a 3.3% sell-off on May 13. The ETF crossed back below its slow-moving, long-term 200-day moving average. SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) retreated 2.5%.


The Market In 2020: More Divergence Ahead?
------------------------------------------


The Federal Reserve issued a median forecast that the U.S. economy will contract 6.5% this year, but then rebound as much as 5% in 2021 and add another 3.5% in 2022. Conventional wisdom states that in a severe recession, smaller companies have it tougher due to limited resources vs. the 800-pound gorillas in the industry.


The Nasdaq doesn't really give you color about how energy, transportation, metals, construction and other economically sensitive companies are really doing.


"The FOMC hit bull's-eye today in terms of delivering exactly what the market was expecting, no more, no less," Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, told IBD in an email. "The key message of lower (interest rates) for longer was reiterated by the dot plot (which) suggests interest rates are locked near the zero bound through the forecast period to 2022."


Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance, expressed concern that "the economy may run hot, while the Fed remains concerned about deflation. If that's the case, we could continue to see speculation and other bubbles begin to form in the short run."


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond plunged 9 basis points to 0.77%, its biggest single-day drop in months.


Inside The Nasdaq
-----------------


Beyond the computer, database and internet fields, retailing, biotech, ethical drug and telecom-cum-broadband service companies also hold considerable influence over the Nasdaq. Companies such as **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)), **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) all trade on the Nasdaq. They all rank within the top 25 in market cap.



Starbucks, which announced a bigger-than-expected net loss for the June quarter, illustrated why buying a stock as it crosses the 200-day moving average is not the IBD strategy. Shares gapped 4% lower in heavy turnover and now lie 20% beneath a 52-week peak.


Even the year of Covid-19 has offered this lesson for growth stock traders: Breakouts work.

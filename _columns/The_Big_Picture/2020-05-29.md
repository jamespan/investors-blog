Why The S&P 500 Took Over Market Leadership
============================================

The stock market climbed for a second straight week, though it didn't feel that way so much for growth-stock investors.




Growth stocks were lackluster, while cyclical sectors such as utilities, industrials, real estate, transportation, materials and financials outperformed for the week. Higher-growth sectors including technology, health care, consumer discretionary and communications services rose more modestly.


The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 2% last week, while iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) jumped 4.4%. On Friday, though, the growth ETF rose 1.5% and the value fund eased 0.1%.


Last week's divergence explained another stock market trend: the S&P 500's sudden taking of the market leadership from the Nasdaq composite.

In a week of sector rotation, some Nasdaq-heavy industry groups slumped, including biotechs, generic drugs, software, internet and fabless semiconductors.


Growth Stocks: IBD 50 Slowing
-----------------------------


Index performance aside, the stock market continues to behave well. Indexes have hardly broken stride from their spring rally, and leading stocks are doing their share. Growth was back in favor Friday: The IBD 50 added 2.7% and rose 1.8% for the week.


That's good news for the growth-heavy index, which had made little progress for three weeks.


Part of the IBD 50's problem is a group of about eight real estate investment trusts that have yet to get above their April highs. Semiconductor and other techs have a mixed performance over the past several weeks. But most of the dozen or so software stocks continue to perform admirably.


In a milestone of sorts, the S&P 500 held above the 3000 level and above the 200-day average. In fact, the S&P 500 found support at the 200-day line Friday.


China-U.S. Row Influences Market
--------------------------------


On Friday, the stock market seemed to be all about China and the U.S. Indexes sank near session lows after President Donald Trump blasted China over trade, Hong Kong and coronavirus, and [took steps to lift Hong Kong's favored trade status](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/trump-taking-action-to-eliminate-special-treatment-for-hong-kong.html). But even before Trump's remarks were completed, indexes started to rebounded and rallied into the close. There was [no indication the U.S. would pull out of the phase one trade accord](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html) reached with China early this year.


Earlier Friday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell discussed the coronavirus crisis, but stocks had little reaction. Powell said the Fed still has room to expand its balance sheet. He conceded the [Fed "crossed a lot of red lines that had not been crossed before"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-29/powell-says-fed-crossed-red-lines-because-virus-demanded-action) in response to the pandemic, and Powell defended those.


The Nasdaq closed 1.3% higher Friday, the S&P 500 up 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%. Small caps got left behind, with the Russell 2000 down 0.5%. Before trailing off Thursday and Friday, the Russell 2000 had climbed to the highest level since March 6.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE.

Stocks careened lower Thursday, finding no comfort in favorable economic data.


The Nasdaq dumped 3.1%, its biggest one-day loss since Nov. 9, 2011. The S&P 500 lost 2.1%. The IBD 50 skidded 4.1%.


Volume rose across the board, pointing to institutional selling.


Every stock in the IBD 50 and Big Cap 20 fell.


In the past five sessions, the indexes have fallen in rising volume three times and rose in lower volume twice. Down days in aggressive volume combined with up days in meek volume are the textbook definition of a weak market.


The bulls began Thursday with just two cards in their hand. By the end of the day, they had lost both. The S&P 500 had been holding above its 50-day moving average but that ended. And until Thursday, the recent lows in the indexes had not been undercut.


With the lows undercut, an attempted rally is dead.


Somewhere the bears are laughing. But whether this is the beginning of something truly long and ugly is not yet clear.


What is clear is that you don't want much, if any, exposure to this market.


For IBD-style investors, who most likely are predominantly or totally in cash at this point, a correction can be positive. If you missed or mishandled winners in recent months, you'll eventually get a fresh shot at doing it right.


If you're down for the year, you get could a chance to repair your portfolio in the next uptrend.


As the market flushes out more weak holders, the stage is being set for a new uptrend. A longer correction isn't to be feared: It could give top stocks more time to sketch bullish patterns.


Psychologically, this can be a satisfying time. Staying in cash is like sitting on the beach watching the waves: no worries, just build that watch list.


What would it take to revive the uptrend? The market offered a partial answer Thursday: It will take much better news than the good news it got Thursday.


First-time jobless claims came in at 300,000 — below the Street's consensus estimate and below the entire range of estimates.


Preliminary U.S. chain-store sales in March grew 3.6% on a year-ago basis, up from 2.2% in February, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. The March percentage was especially impressive because of a tough comparison: Last year, Easter was in March. Analysts say, if that factor were stripped out, the increase would've been a percentage point higher.


But the market decided that both bits of good news were irrelevant.


A few stocks showed strong action Thursday, but they were not growth stocks. Gas utility **Atmos Energy** ([ATO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATO)), **Colgate Palmolive** ([CL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CL)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) — all dividend stocks that can act as defensive plays — either broke out, hit a new high or cleared a consolidation within a larger base.

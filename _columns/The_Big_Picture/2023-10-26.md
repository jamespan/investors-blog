The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 250 points Thursday, as the stock market correction worsened. Amazon stock jumped after the company's earnings results late. Friday morning, the market gets more inflation data with the release of the PCE index.




After the close, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) erased a 3.5% gain in extended trading. The e-commerce giant [topped Q3 earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/news/amazon-stock-amzn-q3-earnings-2023/) estimates. AMZN stock closed just above its 200-day line.


Friday's personal income and outlays data for September, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, will show how the Fed's primary inflation rate, the core PCE price index, finished the quarter. After three tame months through August, economists are expecting an accelerated 0.3% rise.

On Thursday, indexes closed near their session lows, finishing sharply in the red.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 0.8%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off 1.8% to break below its 200-day line. The small-cap Russell 2000 inched higher.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange rose from Wednesday's session.


In the Dow Jones Industrial Average, software giant **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) tumbled 3.8%, erasing the entirety of Wednesday's earnings-fueled gains. MSFT stock is building a cup base with a 366.78 buy point, and attempted to clear an early entry at 340.86.


On the upside, Dow Jones leader **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) jumped 4.9% Thursday after the [company's Q3 earnings.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-stock-q3-2023-earnings/)


Top growth stocks followed the market trend lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF lost 1.9%, hitting a new 52-week low. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) advanced 3.9% after the [company's earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/servicenow-earnings-now-stock-q32023/). Shares are trying to retake their 50-day line.


Elsewhere in the IBD 50, many leading stocks are breaking below their 50- and 200-day lines, including **Allison Transmission** ([ALSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALSN)), **Clearwater Analytics** ([CWAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CWAN)), Meta Platforms, **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Vertiv** ([VRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRT)).


What To Do Now: Stay On The Sidelines
-------------------------------------


During a market correction, the potential risk is high enough that sitting on the sidelines is preferable to buying. Keep in mind that leading stocks usually correct 1.5 to 2.5 times the general market. That can make a big negative impact in your portfolio. You can gain a lot of market outperformance by keeping exposure low in bad markets and avoiding huge drawdowns.


In the meantime, look for new stock market leadership to emerge over the coming weeks if the Dow Jones and other indexes can start to bottom out. Watch for stocks holding up better than the broader market.


One way to do this is by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Keep an eye on stock charts in which the line is trending upward, which means the stock is outperforming the S&P.


The RS line is in all IBD charts and [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). In addition, the [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/) includes a list of top-rated stocks with lines at new highs. MarketSmith also has the ["RS Blue Line Dot" list](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/), which screens for RS lines at new highs.


A [MarketSmith list](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) to find stocks during market downturns is "Near Pivot." It shows stocks nearing buy points in bases.

Dow Jones Leader Headlines Market Leaders To Watch
--------------------------------------------------



Some stocks are forming bases, and even trying to break out, and should be followed closely.


[HealthEquity](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/healthequity-ibd-stock-of-the-day-thrives-with-feds-higher-for-longer-rates/) is etching a handle onto a giant cup base, showing a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 76.62, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. Shares are currently battling for support around their 50-day line.


[International Seaways](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/international-seaways-stock-rides-30-gain-near-buy-point/) is rapidly nearing a cup-with-handle's 48.40 entry, closing within striking distance of the buy trigger.


Tradeweb broke out of a flat base's 87.53 buy point after the company's Q3 earnings. Keep in mind the market correction should keep you from buying breakout stocks. But Tradeweb is showing unusual strength in a weak environment.


[Dow Jones health insurer](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/unh-stock-forms-handle-as-dow-jones-giant-unitedhealth-climbs-toward-all-time-highs/) UnitedHealth is adding a handle to a giant consolidation, offering a 546.78 buy point. UnitedHealth is a member of the IBD [Long-Term Leaders list.](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/)

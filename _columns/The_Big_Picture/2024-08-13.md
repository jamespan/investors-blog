The stock market surged Tuesday following benevolent inflation data and encouraging comments from a top Fed official. This triggered a bullish market shift ahead of Wednesday's consumer price index reading.




Stocks are really gaining traction after last week's wild action. The Nasdaq rose 2.4% Tuesday and is now up 2.6% for the week so far. It has been rallying well since getting support at the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). The tech-heavy composite is now back above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) after making the best four-day run since November 2022.


The Nasdaq's next task will to be to reclaim the 50-day movingÂ  average, which is 367 points ahead.


The S&P 500, meanwhile, turned in a significant gain of 1.7%, which it also holds for the week. The index is now within comfortable striking distance of the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and has pared its loss for the month to just 1.6%.


Advancers were on top of decliners by more than a 4-1 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 13-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet. Volume was higher, adding conviction to the day's moves.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes on the stock market today, but it still rallied 408 points, or 1%. This was enough to propel it back above its 50-day line. Beaten-down chip giant **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and sportswear stock **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) were the top performers here. But the largest contributor to the Dow was **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), which added nearly 59 of the Dow's points.


Small caps also popped, with the Russell 2000 jumping 1.6%. It will now look to move convincingly clear of its 50-day line. Growth stocks were not quite so impressive, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rising 0.4%. The midcap S&P 400 rose 1.3%.


Stock Market Outlook Improves
-----------------------------


Tuesday's action qualified as a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Since the latter index corrected as much as 13% from its peak, it seems a more significant event.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP081324-229x300.jpg)Because of the bullish market action, IBD is lifting the recommended market exposure to the 20%-40% range. We will now look for continued bullish behavior, such as gains in strong volume and breakouts among top stocks, before considering a larger exposure level.


The S&P 500 faces a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average, and clearing that level would be another factor in deciding on a proper exposure level.


Remember, many follow-through days fail, so raise exposure in a measured fashion. Look for top-performing stocks clearing proper buy points in high volume. Oddly, there were few breakouts Tuesday.


Inflation Data, Fed's Bostic Boost Stocks; CPI Next
---------------------------------------------------


Stocks were given an early boost due to a lighter-than-expected producer price index. The headline PPI rose 2.2% year over year in July, below economist expectations for 2.6%. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% on the year-ago period, also below views.


Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic also stepped up to the plate to cheer investors with sunny comments at today's Conference of African American Financial Professionals.


He said he was encouraged by recent inflation figures and reiterated his stance that it's likely he'll be ready to cut rates by the end of the year.


"I'm hopeful that in the next several months, we'll be at a place where we have an economy that's pretty much fully normalized," Bostic added.


The stage has been set for further gains if tomorrow's consumer price index also comes in tame. Headline CPI is expected to rise 3% year over year while core CPI is seen popping 3.2%.

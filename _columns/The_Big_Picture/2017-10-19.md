Bears grabbed control of the stock market early Thursday but loosened their grip by the end of the session.


The Nasdaq fell 0.3%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 shed 0.2%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were barely above their break-even lines.




At the day's low, the Nasdaq was down 1%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. The Nasdaq suffered [distribution](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), showing signs of institutional selling for the second day in a row.


Utilities provided one of the better hiding places Thursday as the Dow Jones utility average advanced 1.1%.


Within the utilities sector, **Consolidated Edison** ([ED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ED)) rose 1.3%. The stock is 2% above its 50-day line and 1% off its high. [Con Ed is up 15% year to date](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/this-utility-has-a-no-retreat-attitude-on-dividends/), roughly in line with the S&P 500.


Another utility showing good action is **Southern Co**. The stock has risen in 15 of the past 16 sessions. Southern gained 7% in that run.


The utility sector, though, is not a leader. The sector is in the middle of the pack among 33 sectors.


Three Standout Items
--------------------


If an investor changes to a wider lens, three things stand out.


First, the stock market hasn't logged a sharp pullback since the February 2016 low, when the Nasdaq corrected about 18%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP101917.png)So far this year, the pullbacks have been more nuisance than genuine pain. The biggest pullbacks have been around 4%.


The bears are having trouble spreading their doom-and-gloom convictions in this climate.


Second, the market has yet to develop the exuberance associated with major market tops. Amateurs are not yet convinced that they can quit their day jobs and live off the stock market. Starbucks baristas are not bragging about their stock gains.


Third, the leadership of the rally remains intact despite the rough action Thursday. Going into Thursday's session, the top three sectors — electronics, chips and builders — have held those positions in that exact order since Oct. 4.


So far this week, the electronics sector has shown pockets of strength. **Zebra Technologies** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)), **Littelfuse** ([LFUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LFUS)) and **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)) are each up about 2% this week.


Chips have a handful of stocks posting gains of 1% to 2% for the week. **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) leads the sector with an almost 6% gain over the four sessions.


The housing sector's homebuilders also have a handful of winners. **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) scored the biggest gain, up more than 6% so far this week. It surged nearly 8% Thursday following its earnings report.


Also in the building sector, cement stocks are doing well this week: **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) is up 3%.


Breakouts
---------


Breakouts on Thursday included wealth manager **Blackstone Group** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)), publishing software provider **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), Northeast bank **Webster Financial** ([WBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBS)), leisure-sector play **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) and insurer **Travelers Cos**. The breakouts came under difficult market conditions Thursday, which is a sign of strength.


Stocks near a buy point include **Texas Capital Bancshares** ([TCBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCBI)) and railroad operator **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)).


Economic Data
-------------


In economic news, first-time jobless claims rolled in at 222,000, below the consensus estimate of 240,000 and below the lowest estimate in the range.


The Philadelphia Fed's outlook survey, a gauge of manufacturing, hit 27.9 in October, above the consensus target of 20.2 and above the highest estimate in the range.

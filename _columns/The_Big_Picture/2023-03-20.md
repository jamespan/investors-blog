After Swiss Bank Rescue, Stock Market Looks To Fed; Why This Index Is Leaving Others In The Dust
=================================================================================================

The stock market bounced Monday, a day sandwiched between the rescue of a major Swiss bank and a Federal Reserve meeting that could alter rate policy.




The major indexes closed near session highs, relieved to have a day without disastrous headlines.


The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.4% in an unusual day of underperformance. The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, closing slightly back above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.2%, its best day since Jan. 6.


The IBD 50 index was a bit of a laggard, up just 0.5%.


Volume fell, as was expected following Friday's quadruple witching session.


The Nasdaq has been leading major stock market indexes higher this year, and that divergence has become more pronounced since the banking crisis started on March 9. The Nasdaq is up 3% since then and more than 6% from the March 13 low. The S&P 500 is up less than 1% and about 3.8%. The Dow is nearly flat in the past seven sessions.


One reason for the divergence is pretty clear: The Nasdaq has only 4% exposure to financials, compared with 13% for the S&P 500. Financials are the Dow's largest sector, a 20% weighting.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP032023-300x278.jpg)The Russell 2000, which has hardly bounced, has more than 15% exposure to the sector. That includes many regional banks feared to be short on liquidity.


Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq stocks, seems to be in a different market altogether. The index is in a well-behaved six week consolidation and nearing the Feb. 2 high. It rose only 0.2% Monday.


No doubt, much of the stock market's current strength is in technology shares. Technology Select Sector SPDR leads all S&P sector ETFs with a year-to-date gain of more than 15%. Communications Services, made up largely of internet companies, is the second best sector, up nearly 15%.


Bank Mess Benefits Tech Stocks
------------------------------


At the bottom you find the Financial and Energy sector ETFs, down 9% and 12% for 2023 so far.


"The banking turmoil has been a boon for the tech stocks," Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, wrote in a report. The sharp fall in rate hike expectations drove more than $500 billion in market value to **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) last week.


Bitcoin, which has a correlation with tech stocks, gained 45% since the March 10 dip, Ozkardeskaya added. "More importantly, it showed that it could act as a hedge to a global bank stress."


Tech's outperformance is showing up in some leading stocks at an unlikely time.



Microsoft broke out of a flat base Friday, but fell below the 276.86 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) Monday. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) broke out last week from another [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) and remains near the 197.26 entry. Apple is testing resistance around 157.


Normally, you see leading stocks make such bullish moves when the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, not in a correction.


Index divergences eventually resolve themselves, in one direction or another. With the stock market in correction, investors should give bears the benefit of the doubt and keep exposure light or at zero.


But conditions are ripe for a shift. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain in rally attempts, and a bullish [follow-through signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) could occur any day now.


European Stock Market Rises; Fed Is Next
----------------------------------------


The U.S. stock market opened higher after regulators in Europe brokered a buyout of foundering **Credit Suisse** ([CS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CS)). **UBS** ([UBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBS)) [agreed to acquire its rival](https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-next-for-ubs-after-its-whirlwind-rescue-of-credit-suisse-f09b1445) in a deal valued at more than $3 billion, helping to calm nerves about the banking sector.


European bourses rose. The Paris CAC 40 rose 1.3%, the London FTSE 100 added 0.9% and the German DAX climbed 1.1%. The STOXX Europe 600 Index  rallied 1%.


The Federal Reserve gathers for its next rate decision Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank met little resistance hiking interest rates thanks to a strong job market. But this time, [the banking crisis complicates the Fed's job,](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-hike-odds-grow-as-bank-crisis-fears-ebb-sp-500-rises/) forcing the central bank to weigh the risk that financial stress will hurt the economy.


In the last two weeks, the 10-year Treasury yield tumbled nearly 50 basis points as traders priced in less-aggressive tightening. But at the same time, the [Fed's balance sheet swelled](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm) as more banks sought liquidity. That reversed one of the tools the Fed is using to cool inflation.


On Monday, the 10-year yield rose 8 basis points to nearly 3.48%.


The odds of a quarter-point rate increase were 74%, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The rest expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged. Whatever the result, this week's Fed decision could set the tone for the stock market.

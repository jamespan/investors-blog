It was another dull session for the stock market Tuesday as the two-day Fed meeting got underway, while President Trump issued a stern warning to North Korea in a major speech in front of the U.N. General Assembly.




The Dow Jones industrial average stretched its winning streak to eight sessions, rising 0.2%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite inched up 0.1%, and small caps lagged slightly, with the Russell 2000 down less than 0.1%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose slightly on the NYSE.


Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility index is back near the 10 level, prompting renewed chatter of market complacency. Known as the VIX, the index highlights intense fear in the market when readings are high and lack of fear when readings are low. The age-old market adage applies here: Investors are hopeful when they should be fearful and fearful when they should be hopeful.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MP091917.png)Market complacency doesn't mean a pullback is right around the corner, but complacent readings in the VIX have been seen in the past ahead of soft patches for the market or more pronounced pullbacks.


Since hitting a high of 6,449 on Sept. 1, the Nasdaq hasn't moved much. Volume was heavy Friday when options expired, but the Nasdaq could only manage a 0.3% gain. It wasn't technically stalling action, because the index closed in the upper half of its intraday range, but it was still a lot of volume without much price progress.


Meanwhile, the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 isn't as daunting as it once was, with four on the S&P 500 and three on the Nasdaq. That's a positive for the bull camp. Of the S&P 500's four distribution days, only two had the feel of heavy institutional selling: one on Aug. 17 (-1.5%) and the other on Sept. 5 (-0.8%)


Bulls also like the fact that the Nasdaq's advance-decline has swung nicely higher ever since the Nasdaq gapped above its 50-day moving average Aug. 22.


Breakdowns in leading stocks have been few and far between, which also gives credibility to the bull argument, but breakouts overall have been a mixed bag,Â  with many missing a key ingredient: volume.


**Melco Resorts & Entertainment** ([MLCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLCO)) cleared a cup-with-handle base Tuesday, rising 3% to 23.78 but volume was mostly average. Nomura Instinet upgraded shares to buy from neutral and raised its price target to 29 from 20, citing a brighter outlook for gaming revenue in Macau.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) served up plenty of winners Tuesday as 12 names on the list rose 1% or more. Overall, the index rose 0.5%. **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) soared to another new high, rising 9%, but it's well-extended after a breakout from a base in July.


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) followed through after a recent breakout from a double-bottom base with a 127.88 buy point. [Positive comments](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/universal-display-looking-bright-after-goldman-sachs-report/) from Goldman Sachs were the catalyst.


**LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) is looking better these days as it works on the right side of a shallow, cup-shaped base. It's only 6% off its high.



The bottom line is that it makes sense to have some exposure to stocks but not aggressive exposure. Let your winners run, but be on the lookout for new highs in light volume, and also be quick to act if a new buy doesn't go as planned.


The Fed's latest decision on interest rates comes Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET with press conference scheduled for 2:30. An interest rate hike is not expected, but the Fed is widely expected to formalize the start of the unwinding of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.


Similar to the Dow, the 10-year Treasury yield has an eight-session winning streak of its own. It added one more basis point Tuesday to 2.24%.


The recent rally in the 10-year yield has sparked a fresh round of buying in financials. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) gained ground for the sixth time in eight sessions. It's still in buy range from a 69.96 flat-base entry after a low-volume breakout Monday. **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC))and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) are approaching buy points.

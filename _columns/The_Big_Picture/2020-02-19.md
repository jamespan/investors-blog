Stock Market Powers Higher, Led By Chip Stocks; Fed Tone Still Dovish
======================================================================

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit new highs Wednesday, something both indexes have been doing a lot of lately.


Semiconductor stocks rallied again in the stock market today, helped by a bullish earnings move by **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)).


Besides Analog Devices, several other chip stocks led the Nasdaq 100, including [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)).




The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 0.9%. The S&P 500 picked up 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.4%. The Russell 2000 added 0.5% as the small-cap index eyes the 1700 level again.


It was another accumulation day for the Nasdaq as volume rose 10% from Wednesday. NYSE volume fell slightly, according to preliminary data.


The Nasdaq could pull back 5% from here to its 10-week moving average, currently near 9305, and its uptrend would still be intact.


Two more [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) fell off the count Wednesday. The S&P 500's Jan. 31 distribution day was erased due to a 5% intraday gain for the index from that day's closing price since then. The Nasdaq's Jan. 24 distribution day dropped off for the same reason.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP021920-216x300.jpg)That leaves one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) for the Nasdaq — a stalling session on Feb. 11. Of the S&P 500's four distribution days, only one (Jan. 27) was indicative of meaningful institutional selling.


So it's not a market under meaningful distribution, but it is a market where institutional-quality growth stocks continue to strut their stuff.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), just look at the weekly charts for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia. For all five stocks, decisive breaks of the 10-week moving average would be sell signals, but buyers have the upper hand for now.


Alibaba is an alternate buy zone as it finds support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/).

Still, excessive speculation in stocks with no earnings and limited sales is a yellow flag, and that's been happening in **Virgin Galactic** ([SPCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPCE)) lately. After rising more than 50% last week, [the stock is up an additional 30% this week](https://www.investors.com/research/investing-action-plan/virgin-galactic-like-spacex-space-tourism-hypersonic-travel/).


Coronavirus Update
------------------


The coronavirus outbreak still dominates the daily headlines, but the U.S. stock market — at least for now — isn't expecting a material impact to economic growth in the U.S. China GDP growth will likely take a hit, although the Chinese government has been taking steps to stimulate the economy to combat the outbreak.


China's National Health Commission on Wednesday reported an additional 1,749 cases of the virus, but that was the lowest since late January. The number of confirmed cases now stands at more than 75,000, with more than 2,000 deaths. Of those deaths, only six were outside China.


The stock market shrugged off a hotter-than-expected reading on U.S. wholesale prices before the open. Overall, the producer price index rose 0.5% in January. That was well above expectations for an increase of 0.1%. Core prices, which exclude food and energy costs, rose by the same amount vs. the prior month and gushed above the consensus estimate of 0.1%.


In related news, the minutes from last month's [Federal Reserve meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-minutes-february-2020-policy-appropriate-amid-risks/) revealed a still-dovish Fed. As a result of the coronavirus outbreak, another quarter-point interest rate cut by the Fed before the end of the year is back on the table.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------



[Homebuilders](http://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/) rallied again after January housing starts and building permits came in much better than expected. Homebuilders remain a nice pocket of leadership in the stock market, but group leaders like **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) are well-extended past proper [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Wednesday's session served up plenty of strong movers, including two Brazil stocks. **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) surged 6%, while **XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)) gained 4%.


StoneCo has cleared a series of buy points during its recent uptrend, but it could be on the verge of clearing a long consolidation that started in April. XP is back near highs, but it still needs time to form a new base.

After topping a 93.42 handle buy point Tuesday, **Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)) soared past an alternate entry of 99.29 Wednesday, rising 13% to 106.65. Earnings are due Feb. 26 after the close.



**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) showed similar action Wednesday, clearing an alternate entry of 83.30. The stock has moved nicely past a 71.10 entry point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). The San Francisco-based payment tech giant also reports earnings on Feb. 26. Square got discussed in [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).


After several weeks of sideways movement, **Garmin** ([GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)) finally bounced off its 10-week line with conviction. Shares jumped nearly 7%.


**HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) was another earnings mover, up more than 10%. After a breakout over a 77.04 early buy point, HealthEquity is still in the early stages of breaking out of a long consolidation.

Insurer **Palomar** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)) reversed impressively higher after paying a visit to its 50-day moving average. Shares added nearly 2% to 57.62.


After surging nearly 7% Tuesday, **Pan American Silver** ([PAAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAAS)) added about 3% Wednesday. It closed just above a 24.12 [flat-base buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).

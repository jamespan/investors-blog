The stock market rallied into the close Monday, showing it's not done rising — not even after three straight weeks of sharp gains and a historic rebound from the coronavirus bear market. But a cloud is forming over some leading stocks.




In a milestone, the S&P 500 added 1.2% and is now positive for the year. Still, the index is about 5% from erasing the steep losses from the coronavirus bear market.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7%. Dow component **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) extended a strong rally with a 12% gain Monday, which helped the Dow outperform other major indexes. [Aviation stocks are rebounding swiftly](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-airline-stocks-big-mismatch-emerges-in-their-plans/) as more travelers venture into airplanes. Boeing's rally helped the Dow Jones transports rise 1.8%.


The Nasdaq composite rose 1.1%, notching a record high. Impressively, the composite is up more than 10% for the year. The market's [rebound is the strongest in history](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/jobs-report-boosts-record-rally-nasdaq-near-new-high/), as one analyst noted.


But the S&P 500 and small caps are catching up to the Nasdaq. The Russell 2000 rose 2% Monday, having conquered its 200-day moving average after dwelling more than three months below it.

With the stock market still flooring the gas pedal, there's motivation and reason for investors to continue with a heavy exposure to stocks. Yet, a curious trend is developing among the largest leading stocks that suggests some caution is needed. Specifically, quite a few top stocks are rising while their [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) are trending lower.


Stocks of market leaders such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) — all of which are in the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) — are trending higher or near highs but their [RS lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) are falling over the short term, mostly in the past two to three weeks.


Bearish Divergence For These Stock Market Leaders
-------------------------------------------------


That's a bearish divergence, although not necessarily reason for alarm. These titans are not making sell signals. More accurately, [the relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) seem to confirm some sector rotation that's been occurring in the stock market for a couple of weeks. Cyclical S&P sectors such as energy, utilities and transportation now show much steeper climbs than other sector charts.


Still, a dose of caution is smart given the stupendous market gains. After all, these FAANGs and other megacaps did much of the work lifting the market out of its coronavirus depths. Semiconductor leaders **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) also show lagging RS lines and deserve a watchful eye. Among these three firms, Nvidia's RS line looks the healthiest.


Monday's gains showed investors are still celebrating Friday's stunning jobs report. The [May jobs report showed an increase in jobs](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/jobs-report-boosts-record-rally-nasdaq-near-new-high/) and a decrease in the unemployment rate that took everyone by surprise.


But maybe it was too good to be true. Coronavirus lockdowns made it hard to get an accurate reading, and the Labor Dept. noted the true unemployment rate is probably much higher than the 13.3% reported.


As economist Joel Naroff explained, the unemployment survey classified workers who were furloughed in the same way as those on vacation, on jury duty or taking care of a relative. That resulted in a major undercount of those unemployed. "The impact was massive and it miscalculation was made not just in May but in April as well," Naroff said in a report Monday. The unemployment rate was probably above 16% in May.


Is Market Pessimism Falling Too Quickly?
----------------------------------------


To be sure, the stock market is aware of the calculation issue. After all, it was disclosed in the May report. Investors nonetheless are in full-optimism mode. Sentiment indicators show as much. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) Monday fell below 0.5 and is entering a level considered too frothy.

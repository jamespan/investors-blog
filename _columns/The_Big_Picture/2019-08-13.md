  Stock Market Bulls Get Their Third Major Buy Signal This Year, And Here's Why

The stock market got a jolt — and this time, it was a jolt higher — after the Trump administration opened the door to further negotiations with China on trade. Volume rose, a strong hint that institutions rapidly deployed cash back into U.S. equities.




The Nasdaq composite led the way, rising more than 1.9% and finishing near its session high of 8065. At 8016, it closed just points shy of its rising 50-day moving average. With volume rising sharply vs. the prior session, the tech-centric index delivered a [new follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on the sixth day of its new rally attempt.


[A follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), based on long-term IBD research, offers the timeliest signal for investors that a new tradable rally is in the works. The follow-through concept is not foolproof. Some do turn out to be head fakes. But every major stock market bottom featured a follow-through, [even all the way back in 1903](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-follow-through-day-sparked-a-market-bottom-one-century-ago/). With this signal, investors can start raising exposure to stocks.


The new rally caps the third significant correction in U.S. stock prices since a more-than-23% pounding in the Nasdaq that took place in October to December.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP081319-274x300.jpg)That correction ended with a Day 7 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) by the S&P 500 on Jan. 4, as noted in [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/) on the very same day. That session saw the large-cap benchmark throttle 3.4% higher in heavier volume vs. the prior session.


The 500 went on to gain nearly 17% in four months.


On Tuesday, the large-cap S&P 500 gained 1.5% and marked a follow-through of its own. Keep in mind that only one key index needs to follow through in order for IBD's current outlook to change. The Russell 2000 advanced 1.1%, and the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) tacked on 1.4%.


Tech, Software, Retail Groups Win Big
-------------------------------------


Chip, semiconductor equipment, security software, telecom consumer products, data storage, variety retail and toy stocks surged 2% or higher. (See the daily changes of 197 industry groups at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


At 34.38, the IBD 50 ETF is still outperforming most major averages with a 24.4% gain year-to-date. (*Go to the General Market Indicators PDF link at the bottom of this column to see year-to-date performance and large daily charts of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.*)


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line had been falling steeply the past two weeks. That's bearish. But advancing stocks clearly held the upper hand. [On MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/), 272 stocks rose in heavy volume, while only 87 fell in above-average trade.


On Aug. 1, President Donald Trump threatened a 10% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese goods that included consumer electronics products and apparel. That same day, the S&P 500 notched a sixth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) over a 25-session period. Leading stocks crumpled like a pro boxer getting hit with a stiff uppercut. The current outlook for stocks got cut to "uptrend under pressure."


Two trading sessions later, another barrage of professional selling pummeled stocks. So on Aug. 5, IBD downgraded the outlook again, this time to "market in correction."


What's Different This Time
--------------------------


All in all, an 8% slide in less than two weeks is big enough to justify the change in the outlook. Yet after the sharp decline in stock prices, for now, this latest decline has proved to be a lot milder.


Take the slide in May. The Nasdaq gave way to an intermediate-level correction by falling almost 11% from its then-record peak of 8176. This pullback took more than four weeks to unfold. Eventually, the Nasdaq staged a [Day 4 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on June 7, propping the market back into "confirmed uptrend" status.


In the meantime, fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen. Global economic growth forecasts have been slashed. The U.S.-China trade war showed no signs of abating. Thus, on July 31 the Federal Reserve cut the cost of money for the first time since December 2008 as part of an insurance policy against a total U.S. economic slowdown.


Keep Watching Interest Rates
----------------------------


Many bond traders believe the Fed is not done.


The CME FedWatch tool shows a 99.6% chance that the U.S. central bank will slash the fed funds rate to a 1.75%-2% target range at the next meeting on interest rates on Sept. 17-18.



Institutions took profits after a fast run-up in long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds.


The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose 3 basis points to 1.68%. But that's still 22 basis points below 1.90% seen on Aug. 1 and 2.66% at the start of the year.


"This latest move shows that Trump is clearly aware of the impact of a trade war on the markets, and that could point to a resolution on trade before the 2020 election," Peter Cramer, senior portfolio manager focused on fixed income at SLC Management, wrote in comments shared with IBD.


Keep An Eye On China News
-------------------------


"A handshake deal between Trump and Xi on trade, possibly combined with a concrete plan on infrastructure spending, could spring the markets to new highs, just as the president's economics-focused platform is in full view," Cramer added.


Others expressed surprise at how quickly stocks bounced back, one day after a meltdown in Argentine equities stemming from a big primary election loss for current President Mauricio Macri.


Ken Berman, strategist at Gorilla Trades, notes that investors will keep a close eye on upcoming data from China on retail sales and industrial production. "Emerging markets were relatively stable today, with only minimal contagion, and thanks to easing trade tensions the (Chinese) yuan even appreciated, getting close to the key 7 level against the dollar," Berman wrote in a note sent to IBD.


Argentina's equities benchmark, the Merval, rebounded nearly 10% on Tuesday after cratering nearly 39% the prior session following the weekend elections.


Top Sectors In The Stock Market Today
-------------------------------------


The fall in interest rates has likely led to a nice boost in the Building sector, as seen in IBD's [stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-aug-13-2019/). It's now ranked No. 5 for mid- and long-term performance.


Aerospace has dethroned Software, but the latter still ranks No. 3 and is still showing long-term staying power. This makes sense. There has been absolutely no change in the trend of digitizing the economy.


See [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), and you'll spot two aerospace companies that have found a spot on the [Leaders Near A Buy Point](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and [Leaders](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders) lists.


Business Services ranked No. 4 headed into Tuesday's trading and remain at that high ranking. Look at the [research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-aug-12-2019/), and it's impressive to see no fewer than 17 stocks in that sector that debuted on the market within the past 15 years and show an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/) and [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 80 or higher.

Internet content and social media companies are rising again — even those with actual earnings.


Will These Big Caps Beat The Market Even More?

Brazil's **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), No. 2 in the IBD 50 headed into Tuesday's session, reaffirms strength in companies that support commerce.

Stock Market Fades Ahead Of Fed Decision, But Trading Leaves Some Positive Breadcrumbs
=======================================================================================

On the eve of a Fed decision and perhaps new guidance on interest rates, the stock market was predictably cautious Tuesday.




Indexes closed lower after erasing early gains. The Nasdaq composite, which jumped 1.5% at the open, closed 0.9% lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed less than 0.3%. The Dow closed right at its 200-day moving average.


Small caps outperformed, as the Russell 2000 climbed 0.2% despite paring gains.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE. That suggests institutional investors moderated their selling. And, even with the Nasdaq's bad day, advancing stocks topped decliners by 9-7.


Stock Market Uptrend Holding Up So Far
--------------------------------------


From a broader perspective, the stock market has done little to damage its current uptrend. Confirmed with the [Oct. 21 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-roars-back-to-life-amid-new-fed-hopes-these-stocks-shine-brightest/), the major indexes have kept [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) limited.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP110122-192x300.jpg)The S&P 500 is holding above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The Dow — fresh off its best month since January 1976 — is outperforming and is nearly 6% above its 50-day average. It also beat other indexes to the 200-day line.


But indexes are not acting in unison. The Nasdaq is meeting resistance at the 10-week moving average. Part of the Nasdaq's problem is the poor performance of widely-held components such as **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). Those stocks also are in the S&P 500 index, but with smaller weightings.


The S&P technology sector has been riding the middle of the sector performance pack since the October low, up about 9%. Energy, finance and industrials are leading in that time.


The Dow also has a better "B" Accumulation/Distribution Rating, compared with a "[C+" for the S&P 500 and "D" for Nasdaq](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DailyGMI_103122.pdf).


Leaders Outperform Stock Market
-------------------------------


There was good action among leading issues, despite the stock market's drop. The IBD 50 index rose 0.2% and is up seven of the past eight days.


The index is still stacked with energy stocks, which helped it outperform the broad stock market Tuesday. Health care leaders helped, too. **Harmony Biosciences** ([HRMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRMY)) soared 14% in big volume on [strong Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-why-ibd-50-harmony-flew-to-the-high-end-of-its-buy-zone/) and a bullish forecast.



Heart device maker **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) (which [rocketed 50%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-j-agrees-to-buy-medical-device-maker-abiomed-11667301144?mod=hp_lead_pos6) on **Johnson & Johnson**'s ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) buyout), **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) and **Hologic** ([HOLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOLX)) were among the S&P 500 leaders, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Wednesday afternoon's announcement on interest rates and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference will have the stock market's full attention. The indexes have bounced in recent weeks on hopes that, after this week's expected 75-basis-point hike, the Fed will tone down its tightening strategy.


But similar hopes earlier this year faded abruptly. Thus, the stock market faces a key test Wednesday.


Labor Market Tight As Manufacturing Is Mixed
--------------------------------------------


Heading into the policy meeting, the latest economic data indicated a tight labor market. Job openings rose in September to 10.717 million, above economists' expectations.


"That means there were roughly 1.9 job openings for every unemployed worker, a rise in a metric closely watched by the Federal Reserve," said Indeed Hiring Lab head of economic research Nick Bunker. "Chair Jay Powell and his colleagues are likely frustrated by this stubborn metric and continued strength could increase their comfort in hiking interest rates."


Manufacturing data out Tuesday morning showed U.S. factory activity is still growing but at the slowest pace since the Covid crisis, says BMO Capital Markets economist Jennifer Lee. The ISM manufacturing index eased to 50.2 in October. There were some bright spots. Supplier delivery delays fell to the lowest since March 2009.


The Purchasing Managers Index fell to 50.4 in October from 52.0 in September.


U.S. manufacturers signaled only a slight improvement in operating conditions, S&P Global said. There was a renewed decline in new orders. Weaker client demand and subdued expectations for the year ahead led to one of the slowest upticks in employment in over two years.


U.S. crude oil for December delivery gained 2.1% to $88.37 per barrel, which is the main reason the Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) led other sector ETFs with a 1.3% increase.


Stock market fear is falling ahead of the Fed meeting. The Cboe S&P 500 Volatility Index, or VIX, is now below its 200-day moving average. Such complacency could come back to bite the market.

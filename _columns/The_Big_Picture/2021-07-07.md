Stock Market Takes Fed Minutes In Stride; PayPal, Lululemon Give Buy Signals
=============================================================================

The stock market didn't react much to the release of the minutes from the June 15-16 Federal Reserve meeting. But money flowed into bonds again Wednesday, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 5 basis points to 1.32%.




All in all, it was another orderly performance for the stock market as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 scored record closing highs.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 led the way, up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq rose less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq's tiny gain and close in the bottom half of the day's price range in higher volume resulted in a mild [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) for the index. The June 16 and June 18 [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq fell off the count because the index rallied 5% from the closing price on both those days. Preliminary data showed lower volume on the NYSE.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) halved a 1.8% morning loss to 0.9% but closed just below its 50-day moving average.


Solid performances for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) helped lift the Nasdaq 100 to a gain of nearly 0.2%. Lululemon is still in buy range from a 371.10 [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) buy point.


After clearing an entry at 277.96, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock PayPal formed a cup-with-handle base (best seen in its daily chart) and cleared a handle entry Wednesday.



Breadth was weak on the Nasdaq, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers by 2-to-1. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by 3-to-2.


Stock Market And The Fed
------------------------


Since an interest rate hike probably won't come until next year, the focus now is when the Fed will start to wind down its monthly asset purchases.


"Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee's goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals," the minutes said.


The stock market didn't like it when the 10-year yield jumped to 1.76% in late March. Now, the stock market is worried about plunging yields and what that means about the economic recovery. For now, the bond market is saying it's not worried about persistent inflation. Instead, it's worrying about an economic recovery that may not be as robust as expected.


Steel Stocks Rally
------------------


![MP070721_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP070721_2-261x300.jpg)Money flowed into the steel producers group after the group plunged 4.5% Tuesday. **Ternium** ([TX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TX)) extended its winning streak to 10 sessions and also topped a 39.70 buy point. But Ternium is the lone wolf in the group as many other former group leaders are below their 50-day lines.


**Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) is also holding support at its 50-day line. Three pullbacks after the stock gapped out of an 11-week consolidation in late March give the chart the appearance of an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/) pattern. But the pattern tends to work the best when a stock shows strength during choppy markets with a downside bias â€” not when indexes are hitting new highs.


Coal stocks also outperformed. **Consol Energy** ([CEIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEIX)) is holding gains nicely after a breakout from a cup base May 6.

Bullish Sentiment Rises
-----------------------


Meanwhile, bullish sentiment among stock market newsletter writers rose to 60.8% from 59.6%. Readings above 60% are considering excessively bullish and have been seen near market tops in the past. Bullish sentiment topped 60% in the first three weeks of April just ahead of an 8.5% decline for the Nasdaq composite.


No doubt it's becoming a more challenging environment for growth investors. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 2%, extending its losing streak to five sessions.


**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) continue to perform well in the IBD 50. But the index of leading growth stocks lagged Wednesday, hurt by big percentage declines for **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)), **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) and **GrowGeneration** ([GRWG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRWG)).

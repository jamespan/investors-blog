  Stocks Gain But Close Off Session Highs; What The Nasdaq Could Do From Here

Major indexes advanced again on Wednesday, with a [surprisingly mild report on wholesale inflation](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) in the U.S. providing the early pop. But the Nasdaq and most other key indexes saw early gains melt substantially. A rebound in long-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields may have put a semi-wet blanket on the rally.




Looking at the daily charts of the main stock market benchmarks, an experienced IBD-style chart reader could have concluded that the action had a [stalling-day-like feel](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/). However, volume slipped on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the prior session. So, selling pressure was hardly unusual. And the confirmed uptrend, triggered by the [follow-through day on Nov. 1](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-marks-this-bullish-shift-after-fed-chief-powells-decision-to-leave-rates-unchanged/) by the tech and retail-rich Nasdaq composite, nonetheless remains fully intact.


At one point, the Nasdaq's gain reached 0.7% before the advance began eroding at 11:35 a.m. ET. The premier index for growth stocks closed with a gain of less than 0.1%. Ditto for the Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic stock exchange.


The S&P 500 fared slightly better, up 0.2%. And the laggard Dow Jones Industrial Average? It was even better. Its 0.5% rise threw a small spotlight on some former leaders from decades past.


In The Nasdaq And The Dow Jones
-------------------------------


Dow Jones industrials component **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) smacked the bears again with a 3% lift to 40.61 and above the two-month base's high of 40.07. Volume rose 23% above its 50-day average.



Notice on a daily chart how Intel's pattern contained the [elements of a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). But when INTC surpassed a middle peak of 37.22, the base came just days shy of completing over seven weeks. That's the typical length of a good double bottom. Nevertheless, the stock etched the 37.22 middle peak in the upper half of its base, a good sign. Also, tight action between 38 and 39 Nov. 3-13 resembled a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/).


Elsewhere, as many as eight companies on the 30-stock Dow industrials rallied 2 points or more. They ranged from **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), both of which sport the best [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) within the bunch at 85 each, to athleisure apparel and shoe powerhouse **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) (39 RS Rating).

Watch These Indexes Too
-----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP111523-213x300.jpg)Outside the blue chips, the Dow Jones transportation average rose 0.7%, still a pretty nice showing even though it rose as much as 2.1% intraday. At 14,961, the Dow transports closed above the 200-day line for the first time since Oct. 17.


The Russell 2000 suffered quite a noticeable reversal on Wednesday. Up as much as 1.8% intraday, the small-cap gauge saw gains wither to less than 0.2% by day's end.


As the [daily chart on MarketSmith shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), the Russell briefly pricked the falling [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/), a critical long-term technical level of resistance and support.


Robert Maltbie, president and founder of the small-cap stock research firm Singular Research, sees continued gains for this sphere of the market. Reasons? First, third-quarter earnings on aggregate came in stronger than expected.


According to Maltbie, Russell 2000 firms beat the Q3 earnings consensus estimate by 4.9%. Second, valuations still look attractive. Maltbie notes that during the bear market of 2008-2009, the price-to-trailing 12-month sales ratio for the Russell 2000 fell to 0.7. That's well below the long-range price-to-sales ratio of 0.9 for the S&P 500. How about today? For the Russell, that ratio is extraordinarily low at 0.4.


Likely, the Nasdaq's P-S ratio is even higher than what's seen in the S&P 500.


"The totality (in value) of the small caps is still less than that of Apple or Amazon," Maltbie told IBD.


He also thinks equities in general show "all the elements" of further upside progress. "The momentum is coming back," Maltbie added.


Bonds Prices Cool, Pushing Up Yields
------------------------------------


A rebound in the 10-year Treasury note to 4.53%, up 9 basis points, may have spurred some profit-taking in stocks. But as noted earlier, turnover fell 5% to 7% vs. the prior session on the Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively. In other words, Wednesday's session did not reflect any major change in investor behavior.


In addition, the market internals appeared to stay on an improving path.


Amid mixed action by the Magnificent Seven megacaps, advancing stocks on the Nasdaq actually outmatched decliners by a 4-3 margin. On the NYSE, gainers led losers by more than 400 issues (roughly 1,700 vs 1,302, according to early data on Thinkorswim).


Watch for the latest data on the number of stocks making new highs and new lows. On Tuesday, the statistics proved bullish.Â As seen on the [New High List](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-nov-14-2023/), 132 issues on the Nasdaq hit new 52-week or all-time highs while only 38 posted new lows. On the NYSE the ratio was 117 vs. 14. (See the daily update at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Also, Tuesday's new highs list showed Software dominating all other sectors with 28 stocks marking new highs. Building followed with 19 new highs. Business Services ranked third with 15.

Disciplined Buying Still Matters
--------------------------------


Bullish data aside, it still pays to be disciplined with any new buys. When it makes sense, employ a well drawn trendline.


Also, many stocks have gone up so fast that they may recall a familiar phrase that IBD founder William O'Neil liked to share with colleagues and readers: straight up from the bottom, or "SUFB."


When a stock rockets 10%, 15%, 20% or more in just a few days or weeks off the bottom of the base, it often needs time to digest those gains. Irish airline **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)) may serve as a good illustration.


Also, it's still earnings season. Making new buys right before quarterly reports carries extra risk. Nasdaq-listed **Global-E Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) serves as a fresh example.



The Israel-based specialist in direct-to-consumer cross-border e-commerce software plunged 27% in the heaviest single session of volume so far this year.


The company reported a much smaller Q3 net loss (20 cents a share vs. a 41-cent loss a year earlier). But revenue growth decelerated to 27%, down from year-over-year increases of 79%, 69%, 54% and 53% in the prior four periods. GLBE stock was still forming a base before the earnings news.

Beyond Nasdaq: Bulls Vs. Bears
------------------------------



Could the Nasdaq pull back after its terrific advance since early November? Of course. The stock market has been choppy for months. Recent forays above 14,000 by the Nasdaq have not lasted so long.


Watch to see how the composite index handles a potential [overhead supply of willing sellers](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) in the 14,149 to 14,446 zone.


Even though Congress has avoided another temporary federal shutdown, geopolitical events could upset financial markets. Yet for now, Wall Street appears to have applauded meetings between U.S. and Chinese leaders in a bid to ease tensions.


Beyond the Nasdaq, don't overlook the fact that SPDR S&P China ([GXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GXC)) on Wednesday delivered a healthy third straight gain. The ETF rose 1.5% to a two-month high. Watch for potential resistance at the 200-day moving average. GXC remains in a stubborn downtrend.



The Investors Intelligence survey showed a mild bump up in optimism. The ratio of bullish newsletter editors rose to 50.7% vs. 49.3% last week as bearishness edged lower to 23.2% vs. 23.9%.


But we're nowhere near a level of extreme giddiness. That is, tons of money on the sidelines, marinating in money market funds, could eventually find their way back into equities.


The Cboe Volatility index eased 0.3% to 14.18, still above this year's low of 12.73 seen in late June.

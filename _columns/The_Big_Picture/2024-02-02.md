Stock market bulls swatted the bears aside Friday as the stock market rallied into the close despite a hot jobs report. Now a busy week of Fedspeak and some key earnings reports loom.




The Nasdaq composite rallied furiously, popping 1.7%. This propelled it to a weekly gain of 1.1%. Recent ebullient action is underlined by the fact it is now up in 13 out of the past 14 weeks. The tech-heavy index sits clear of all its [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) and is up more than 4% so far this year.


The S&P 500 surged 1.1%, hitting an all-time high in the process. It booked a gain of 1.4% for the week and now stands comfortably above its short-term and major moving averages. The benchmark index is up about 4% thus far in 2024.


One noteworthy aspect of Friday's action was breadth. Despite the gains, decliners outnumbered advancers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 1.5 to 1 on the Nasdaq. This is not ideal.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes on the stock market today, but still gained 0.4%. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which opened firmly lower on earnings, ended the day with a 0.5% loss after getting support at the [200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-200-day-moving-average/). Oil major **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) was the top performing Dow Jones stock.


Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 closing the session down 0.6%. By contrast, growth stocks outperformed, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund soaring 2%.


Due to recent strong stock market action Investor's Business Daily is once again [raising its recommended market exposure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) to the 80% to 100% level. But be careful. With many stocks currently extended from buy points it is crucial to increase exposure in a sensible, measured fashion. Be aware that both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq look extended at these levels.


Stock Market Shrugs Off Jobs Report
-----------------------------------


Stocks initially opened mixed Friday after an unexpectedly strong jobs report. The U.S. economy added 353,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department. That was well above economists expectations for an additional 170,000 jobs.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP020224-259x300.jpg)This spurred a spike in yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield jumping 16 basis points to 4.02% and the 2-year Treasury yield soaring 18 basis points to 4.37%. The [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) now rates the likelihood of rates holding steady at the March Fed meeting at about 80%, though the likelihood of a drop of at least 25 basis points in May sits at around 72%.


The coming week sees a flurry of Fedspeak, which could shed some light on interest rates. Noteworthy names making appearances include Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic on Monday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester on Tuesday and Boston Fed President Susan Collins on Wednesday. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan rounds off the week with a speech on Friday.


[Earnings season continues apace](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-sellers-hit-palantir-stock-growth-concerns/) in the coming week. Noteworthy names reporting include [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG))) and **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)).

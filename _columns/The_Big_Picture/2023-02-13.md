  Indexes Climb More Than 1% As Nasdaq Leads; Inflation Report Next For Stock Market

Fear of inflation? Not for the U.S. stock market. Investors were back in a buying mood Monday, sending the major indexes up more than 1%.




Indexes closed near session highs. The S&P 500 climbed 1.1% as a late bounce Friday extended into Monday's trading.


The Nasdaq led the stock market with a 1.5% gain.


It seems the Nasdaq knows no moderation. Of 17 up days so far this year, 11 have been moves of 1% or more. Seven of 12 down days also saw moves of at least 1%. In total, the composite is off to a 13.6% gain in 2023, far outpacing other major indexes.


Much of the Nasdaq's success is because of tech stocks. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) is up 14.8% year to date, one of the best-performing S&P sectors. With more techs rising in good volume Monday (see the Market Pulse table), the sector is one to watch for opportunities.


Dow Closes Back Above 34,000
----------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.1% as well, closing back above 34,000. It has found a friend in the 50-day moving average, holding above that level since the end of January.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MP021323-234x300.jpg)The Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain in downward price channels, but both managed to hold above their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Generally light volume in the seven-day pullback suggests this is nothing worse than institutional investors adjusting their postures.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Small caps lagged last week with a 3.4% decline in the Russell 2000. But Monday, they bounced back along with the rest of the market. The Russell index rose 1.2% and is finding support at the 21-day exponential moving average.


The stock market faces earnings reports, geopolitical rifts, the debt ceiling and other risks. But the biggest game in town is inflation, and the risk of higher borrowing costs.


Stock Market Watching CPI Report
--------------------------------


The latest inflation signpost arrives Tuesday before the stock market opens, with the January consumer price index.


Economists are [forecasting an increase of 0.5%](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559226&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) from the previous month, and a 6.2% rise on an annual basis. Core prices, which exclude food and fuel costs, are expected to climb 0.3% from December and 5.5% on a 12-month basis.


On the eve of the CPI report, some market analysts cautioned investors about a possible letdown.


Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, noted that a surprise rebound in used-car prices and strengthening commodity prices due to the Chinese reopening may have fanned U.S. prices more than what polls indicate.


"So, investors are holding their breath before they see how the recent developments impacted the U.S. inflation, and how the U.S. inflation will impact the Fed expectations and the market sentiment," Ozkardeskaya said in a note.


Although a minority, about 9% of traders are pricing in a 50-basis-point hike at the next Fed meeting.


"Remember, a single CPI print could change the expectation from 50 to 25 (basis points) for the last FOMC meeting," the analyst added. "And there is no guarantee that the opposite won't happen this time."


Putting another damper on the rate outlook, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said in a speech Monday she sees [a need to keep raising interest rates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-michelle-bowman-stresses-need-for-more-rate-increases-ddb29be2?mod=economy_lead_pos2), and then hold rates at a high level until inflation is tamed.


Benchmark Yield Climbs
----------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to 3.72%. The yield bounced from support at the 200-day moving average more than a week ago. It is now trading above a trend line that touched yield highs from the Oct. 21 peak.



Few stocks topped buy points Monday, but biotech **Immunocore** ([IMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMCR)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in heavy volume.


The IBD 50 index rose 1.5%.


**Toast** ([TOST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOST)) and **Vista Energy** ([VIST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIST)) regained buy points. China e-commerce play **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) rose from support at their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).

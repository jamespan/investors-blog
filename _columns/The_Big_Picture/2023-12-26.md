The stock market kicked off a shortened week of trading with more gains Tuesday. With only three trading days left in 2023, the confirmed uptrend is still showing plenty of strength. But actionable stocks have become the exception, not the rule, in recent weeks after a bullish run for the stock market since early November.




Small caps outperformed again. After six straight weekly gains, the Russell 2000 rose another 1.2% and hit its highest level since April 2022.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite closed with gains Tuesday ranging from 0.4% to 0.5%. All three indexes have risen for eight straight weeks, and the S&P 500 is closing in quickly on its January 2022 all-time high of 4,818.


Dow Jones stock **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) jumped 5.2% to another 52-week high. The chip giant received a $3.2 billion grant from Israel for a new $25 billion chip plant in that country.


Besides Intel, several other chip stocks outperformed in the S&P 500, with names like **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) up at least 2% to 3%.


Inside the Nasdaq 100, **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)) was one of the best gainers, up 2.7%.


Winners beat losers on the Nasdaq by just over 2-to-1. The ratio was nearly 3-to-1 positive on the NYSE. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE from Friday's totals.


Another reason the confirmed uptrend has worked so well is a limited number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or higher-volume declines for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The only higher-volume decline in the count at this point was when both indexes fell 1.5% in higher volume on Dec. 20. A few mild higher-volume declines were wiped off the count due to the 5% rule: That's when an index rallies at least 5% from a prior distribution day, making it no longer relevant.


Breakout Watch
--------------


Stocks breaking out of bases remained in short supply, but school bus maker **Blue Bird** ([BLBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLBD)) shot out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 26.96 entry.

In the oil and gas sector, **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) cleared a 12-week consolidation with a 73.55 buy point. The company provides offshore support vessels as well as marine support services to the oil and gas industry. Group peer **Kodiak Gas Services** ([KGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KGS)), a small-cap stock, soared out of a cup base with a 19.79 entry.


In the oil machinery and equipment group, **Weatherford** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)) cleared a shallow cup base with a 100.93 entry. Volume was light, however.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled at $75.57 a barrel, up 2.7% and near a three-week high.


What To Do Now
--------------


Keep in mind that the leaders in the current stock market rally started coming out of bases in early November. That's when the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 confirmed new uptrends with [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/).

While stocks breaking out of bases can materially outperform in the early stages of a new uptrend, breakouts from bases can struggle after an extended run for the market.


According to data from Barchart.com, about 90% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 50-day moving average, with around 75% above their 200-day lines. Combine this with the fact that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are starting to look overbought again, and you have a stock market where the risk level is elevated due to a large number of extended stocks.


Now is not the time to put your foot on the accelerator when it comes to new buys â€” even if you are underinvested.


If you plan to add exposure, it's perfectly fine to keep a watchlist of stocks building bases. Just be aware that there might not be enough buying power around to fuel a meaningful breakout.


But it's also a good idea to keep a watchlist of stock market leaders that broke out weeks ago that continue to show relative strength. These are the true stock market leaders that could have more left and may develop secondary buy areas.


Stock Market Ideas
------------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is a good example. It was one of the first stocks out of the gate of the latest market uptrend when shares popped 9.5% the week of Nov. 3. Like a lot of other leaders at this point, NOW has flashed a series of tight weekly closes that could ultimately usher in a new entry. Or, if the stock market starts to pull back, NOW could come down and test its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) (see the weekly chart). A pullback and bounce off the support level would give a follow-on buy zone.



New issue **Birkenstock** ([BIRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIRK)) is another stock worth watching. After a breakout from an IPO base last month, the premium footwear maker could be ready to form a new base or make a first test of its 10-week line.


In the financial sector, **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) soared nearly 15% during the week ended Nov. 3. Like NOW, it's been showing strength and support by trading tightly and holding near highs.


Leading footwear stock **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) is another good name for the watchlist because DECK formed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) with a 723.42 buy point.

Stocks Hit Record Highs As Nasdaq Cleans Up Its Chart Swiftly
==============================================================

Fresh from an outstanding month of November, the stock market began December in excellent shape, with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 making record highs. In fact, the Nasdaq just got rid of a stain on its chart.




Stock market indexes gapped up at the opening bell on positive news, including a possible coronavirus stimulus package and more progress on Covid-19 vaccines. **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and partner **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)), and **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) applied for European Union approval for their coronavirus vaccines. Moderna on Monday took its vaccine to the FDA for emergency approval.


But stocks started to drop around 2:45 p.m. ET, about the time news wires reported that Senate Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell rejected a bipartisan stimulus plan](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/coronavirus-stimulus-update-senators-to-unveil-relief-bill.html). Investors have been looking for fiscal aid to support the economy's rebound. So far, additional funding has been elusive.


Still, the major indexes closed fairly close to session highs and all-time highs. The Nasdaq ended with a 1.3% increase, the S&P 500 up 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.6% higher.


![MP120120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP120120-202x300.jpg)Volume fell, which took something away from the day's record gains. To be fair, Monday's volume would have been tough to beat because it was unusually heavy. Still, Tuesday's volume was above average. In sum, there was no sign the stock market's new highs dissuaded institutional investors from buying.


Nasdaq Erases Distribution Days
-------------------------------


The Nasdaq's rally Tuesday also was impressive because it wiped out all three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) the index had notched over the past few weeks. At its session peak, the composite climbed more than 5% above the closing price of the Nov. 9, 12 and 18 distribution days. That leaves the Nasdaq with zero distribution, and sitting pretty at record highs.


While the number of higher-volume declines had been modest, it only helps that the Nasdaq now has a clean sheet.


The S&P 500 is still within 5% of its three distribution days. The index will need to climb above 3700 to start erasing those — not that they're necessarily a worry.


Monday's distribution day on the S&P 500 seemed overstated. The index fell 0.5% and worked off earlier losses. The higher volume can't be dismissed. Even after taking into account the natural increase from Friday's half session, trading Monday was well above average, the highest since the Sept. 18 "witching" day of options and futures expirations.


Stock Market Heavies Contribute
-------------------------------


Indexes did get some help from their largest stocks. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rose 3.1% as it cleared a trend line drawn over the past several weeks. This is an aggressive entry into the technology leader. The stock was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard). **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) jumped 3.5%, its best day since Nov. 4, and is drawing closer to the 297.48 buy point of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


The stock market's advance was broad. Advancing stocks led decliners by 7-3 on the NYSE and by nearly 7-5 on the Nasdaq. The Russell 2000 small-cap index rose 0.9%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index added 1.7% and was a key factor in the Nasdaq's outperformance. An industry report forecast that [a chip-sales rebound will extend into 2021](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-industry-bounces-back-from-cyclical-downturn/).


A few areas of weakness were important mainly because they were in hot areas of the market.


Several coronavirus stocks sold off. Moderna shares reversed badly lower. **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) sold off 15%. The company late Monday [beat profit and sales expectations and gave a positive outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zoom-stock-zoom-earnings-zm-q3-2020/). But it wasn't enough to satisfy investors who had grown accustomed to superlative results from the work- and learn-at-home stock.


Electric-vehicle stocks also were down broadly. **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) reversed lower in heavy volume. **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) tumbled 10.2%.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.8% Tuesday.


For November, the Nasdaq and Dow rallied 11.8%, the S&P 500 10.8%. It was the best month for the U.S. stock market since April, when indexes came off the coronavirus bear market lows.

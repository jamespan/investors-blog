Stocks on Wednesday scooped more gains following the recent powerful sell-off. But volume fell. Leading stocks had a decent day. Some ventured to break out. Among the fearless, **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), new IPO **Fitbit** ([FIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIT)) (IPO base buy point of 40.55), **HFF Inc.** ([HF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HF)) (see today's [Sector Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/070115-759904-hff-tries-to-rebound-from-sell-off.htm) story), and **Santander Consumer USA** ([SC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SC)) (a member of Leaderboard since May 12) all triggered new entry points from bases or rebounds off the 50-day moving average.

  

The IBD 50 rallied 0.7%.

  

Yet overall, the market's action was disappointing.

  

The S&P 500 also rose 0.7%, which is impressive when you consider that nearly every oil and gas stock lost ground amid a harsh drop in crude oil futures.

  

As IBD's table of [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/pdf/IBD197_070215.pdf) shows on Page B2 (see the entire table at Investors.com, under the "Research" tab), most of the 10 worst declining groups were oil or energy related.

  

Financials and insurers helped offset the energy sector meltdown. The strength among financials isn't new. IBD's new high list (today on B1) has shown banks, S&Ls and finance sectors contributing heavily in recent weeks. Investors are positioning for a slow rise in short-term interest rates, which benefit banks that depend a lot on net interest income.

  

The Nasdaq composite lagged. The index rallied 0.5% and finished in the lower half of the day's range. At one point, the Nasdaq's gain reached 1%. But the 50-day moving average perhaps acted as a level of upside resistance. (See the chart on Page B2.)

  

If this continues, it would confirm the market's current weakness following a rush of distribution days that began in late May.

  

On Friday, the Market Pulse outlook switched to "Uptrend under pressure" following a sixth day of notable institutional selling on the Nasdaq. The count has since decreased to five.

  

Solid U.S. economic data on Wednesday may have inspired some buying. Yet uncertainty over Greece seems to be capping investors' enthusiasm. Those concerns have not yet translated into outright fear in some indicators.

  

The CBOE Volatility index dove again Wednesday following Friday's sharp climb. At 16.11, it's well below the spike to 31 seen in October 2014. That month was significant; the indexes corrected more than 10%, and a strong follow-through emerged on Oct. 21.

  

Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence survey shows bullish newsletter writers are still at elevated levels. (See graphs on B11.)

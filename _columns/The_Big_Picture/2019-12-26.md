The stock market hit more record highs Thursday after strong winter holiday sales boosted the indexes at the stock market open. The Nasdaq composite led the major indexes, closing at the highs with a 0.8% gain. The Nasdaq topped the 9000 price level for the first time and extended a win streak to 11 sessions.




The S&P 500 rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.4%, or 105 points. All three major indexes hit all-time highs. Volume was much higher across both exchanges relative to Tuesday's turnover due to Tuesday's shortened trading session ahead of the Christmas holiday.


Stock Market Rally Hits More Highs
----------------------------------


Since Dec. 4, the Nasdaq composite has risen an impressive 14 out of 16 sessions and is on an 11-day win streak. The Nasdaq is up over 35% year to date, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials follow up with gains of 29% and 22.5%, respectively. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit more record highs Thursday, while the Dow industrials are just off their own highs.


Bullishly, one of the [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq fell off the overall count, bringing the count to two. The Dec. 2 distribution day dropped off Thursday because the index rose more than 5% from that day's 8567.99 closing price. The S&P 500 still has three distribution days.

Shopify — already up as much 195% year to date heading into Thursday — is looking to add to those illustrious gains.

Meanwhile, Universal Display [broke out](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oled-stock-breaks-out-post-christmas-rally/) above a 208.11 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 6.6% rise.

The bigger the concerns about the future economy, the harder the best stocks tend to fall. That pretty much summed up Thursday's action.




The Nasdaq composite, holding the biggest gains so far in 2018, naturally had the most to lose. The tech, retail and consumer spending-centered composite lost 0.9% to take its biggest hit since a 1.7% walloping on April 24.


The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, also gave up 0.9%. So did the S&P SmallCap 600, another leading benchmark for U.S. equities so far this year.



The S&P 500 fell 0.6% as strength in supermarket, discount retail, department store chain and restaurant stocks helped cushion the blow a bit. Solar and electric power utility shares also gained ground. The Dow Jones utility average, a sector laggard so far in 2018, rose 0.3%.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF slipped 1.5%. Despite the big drop, the exchange-traded fund shows an 11% year-to-date gain. That follows a 34% run-up in 2017.


Volume edged slightly higher on the Nasdaq and fell slightly on the NYSE. No matter how small the volume increase, it's truly significant when the market gets battered like it did on Thursday. The [distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count, as seen in the Market Pulse, remains at an elevated level.


This doesn't mean the six-year bull run since a 20% correction in 2011 is necessarily over. But when institutional selling intensifies, the savvy individual investor knows not to fight the trend.

With the summer officially starting, beachgoers have to think about having enough sunscreen and bringing plenty of books to read. But Wall Street traders are fretting over a rising stack of issues.


On top of lingering worries over how China and the U.S. will resolve their spat on import tariffs, fund managers also are paying attention to what OPEC will do about their production targets during a meeting in Vienna on Friday and Saturday. Meanwhile, a surprise decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that would empower states in generating more sales taxes for goods sold online shook up many of the U.S.-based retail internet firms.


After the equities market close on Wall Street, WTI crude oil futures edged higher. But even at $65.96 a barrel, oil is still nearly down 9% from its year-to-date peak of $72.24 a barrel, set on May 21.


No wonder, then, that the Cboe Volatility Index, a fear gauge among options players, spiked 14% to 14.65. That marked a nearly three-week high.

Within the top 20 as of Wednesday's close, as many as eight of them herald from the software sector. And if you look at the best growth stocks in this sector, you really didn't find a ton of selling.



**Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), a [Sector Leader stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), fell 1%. Its strong uptrend remains fully intact. On Oct. 19 last year, Adobe broke out of a well-formed flat base at 157.99.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), [No. 15 in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), and [Leaderboard play](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) are acting fine. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) dropped 2.5% to 109.83 in above-average turnover, yet still finished the day above the 50-day moving average. The HR and payroll-management expert continues to craft a new cup-shaped base.


Paycom recently got featured in IBD's newest daily feature, [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


In the semiconductor space, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) is having a tougher time lately. The stock gapped down on Monday and sharply cut its 50-day moving average. Thursday, shares tried to retake the key level but then quickly turned lower.

On Thursday, the semiconductor and CPU giant said CEO Brian Krzanich is stepping down after an investigation found an improper relationship with a staff employee.

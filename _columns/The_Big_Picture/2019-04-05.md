Small Caps, Tech Stocks Lead Upside: Is Nasdaq Ready To Break Out Again?
=========================================================================

A better than expected March jobs report fueled another day of outperformance for the Nasdaq composite Friday. The Russell 2000 small-cap index showed bullish technical action, and China stocks saw more buying demand as the Shanghai composite notched a weekly gain of 5%.




**NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) stock was a nice gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up nearly 4%, while [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) rallied 3%. NetEase rose for the seventh straight session after a breakout from a base with a 258.82 early entry point. It's now [extended past the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). Autohome is also extended after a breakout over a 96.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The Russell 2000 jumped 1% and reclaimed its 200-day moving average. The index has been lagging, but Friday's strong gain means a breakout over 1600 could be in the cards.


The Nasdaq composite picked up 0.6% and the S&P 500 gained 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose slightly from Thursday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP04051919.jpg)The Dow Jones lagged Friday, up nearly 0.2%, hurt by weakness in **Dow** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)). Shares dropped 4% to 57.24 after JP Morgan initiated coverage with an underweight rating and a 49 price target. Dow Jones component **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) held up relatively well despite a Wells Fargo downgrade, but shares still fell 0.6%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index hit another new high, up 0.8%.


The Nasdaq marked a weekly gain of 2.7%. It's only 2% from its all-time high of 8133 set in late August. That means an upside breakout could be in the cards. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones are in similar positions.


Healthy Jobs Report
-------------------


The economy created 196,000 jobs in March, above the consensus estimate for 170,000. The unemployment rate was unchanged from February at 3.8%, while job gains in January and February were revised slightly higher. After the [jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/march-jobs-report-lifts-economic-outlook-dow-jones/) was released, President Donald Trump called for more bond buying from the Federal Reserve, known as quantitative easing, to keep a lid on rates.


What To Do Now
--------------


If you're holding some nice winners, it's perfectly fine to take some money off the table, especially if the [gain from the buy point hit at least 20%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/). For example, **Euronet Worldwide**'s ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) gain from the 122.03 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) recently hit 20%. [Taking partial or full profit](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) is a reasonable strategy.


With the market still in a confirmed uptrend, it makes sense looking for new buys, but pickings have been slim lately. That's not surprising since the stock market has been running higher for a while now. In some cases, looking for alternate entries in true market leaders might make more sense than targeting fresh base breakouts.


Leading software stocks didn't stage much of a rebound after Thursday's shellacking. After slumping 2.7% Thursday, the enterprise software group could only muster a gain of 0.3% Friday.

Stocks suffered more institutional selling Tuesday, reaching a risk level at which stepping away from stocks makes sense.


The market remained sensitive to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Indexes slid sharply in early afternoon trading on news that Russian troops were gathering near the Ukraine border.


The Nasdaq fell 0.7% and the S&P 500 1% as volume increased on the main exchanges. For the composite, it was the sixth distribution day in recent weeks and the seventh for the S&P 500.


That's a dangerous number of higher-volume losses for any market, and a fairly clear sign funds are souring on stocks. Indeed, the market struggles that began in July should now be considered a market correction.


As the Market Pulse on this page had noted the past several weeks, the indexes were under pressure. What was uncertain action has deteriorated into just a bad market.


On a practical level, the new outlook means individual investors should further cut their exposure to stocks.


Take profits where prudent, especially if those gains are 20% or more. Avoid buying stocks or adding shares at follow-on entries. Be choosy on which stocks you decide to hold. Ideally they should be top-notch leaders in which you have a substantial profit cushion.


Buying on margin should be eliminated altogether. Respect the 7%-8% sell rule, and consider cutting losses at 3% to 5%.


Investors certainly can debate the merits of abstaining from stocks because of some hopeful signs.


For example, the Nasdaq 100 is finding support at the 50-day moving average. The Dow is close to touching its 200-day moving average, where the average bottomed in October and February.


The put-call volume ratio has spiked to levels that have coincided with market lows this year.


The economy continues to mend, albeit irregularly, and Q2 S&P 500 earnings have improved over the previous periods.


But while the engine may be fine, there's a shortage of fuel.


The important takeaway is that distribution is sponging up the bulls, and growth investors aren't making much money if at all in this market. Take away the price gaps on earnings surprises, and top-rated stocks haven't rallied much. A good sign is that most of those gap-ups have held firm.


The IBD 50 fell 0.7%. Its members' patterns weren't changed. Of course, for some of them, the patterns were already bearish.


Two of the most recent breakouts are having difficulties.


**Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) fell back below the 1292.76 buy point of Monday's breakout, shedding about 1% in above-average volume. **YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) closed slightly below its 78.83 entry.

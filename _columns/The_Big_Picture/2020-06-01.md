What did Monday's session tell investors? Perhaps this: Cyclical stocks and noncyclical ones can get along and rally together, after all.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq's nearly 0.7% advance is quite impressive considering the negative headlines brewing in the U.S.-China relationship and amid the protests and uncontrolled looting gripping America's biggest cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. Monday's gain followed gains of 3.4% and 1.8% by the Nasdaq composite in the prior two weeks.


But the NYSE composite and the Russell 2000 both did a touch better on Monday, each rising 0.8%.


Why Did The NYSE Composite Beat The Nasdaq Today?
-------------------------------------------------


The NYSE is a bastion of bank, transportation, energy, apparel and commodity companies. No wonder, then, that the NYSE composite shined a little more brightly, as many of the 197 IBD industry groups that rallied sharply on Monday came from these and related sectors. (See the entire price-weighted performance of these 197 industries at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Make no mistake, the Nasdaq is still the top dog in a battle among indexes to reclaim their February highs.


At 9552, the composite index is almost a 3% gain away from eclipsing its 9838 peak.


Meanwhile, the large-cap S&P 500 edged up 0.4%. Yet the S&P 500 also sprinted 3% or more in each of the past two weeks.


Volume tracked lower on both main exchanges.


Signs of severe distribution, or intense profit-taking by institutional investors, remain almost nonexistent.


Look at popular semiconductor-related ETFs such as VanEck Vector Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)), and you'll see that this sector pretty much sat out the day's advance. But the overall picture for this important tech sector remains bullish. A few leaders in the chip space have a spot in [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). Plus, **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and perhaps IBD 50 name **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) are etching a [handle to their current chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/).


Applied Materials got double-feature-like treatment on Monday, showcased in both [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/dow-jones-stock-apple-alphabet-break-out-new-buy-points-stock-market-rally/) and [IBD 50 Growth Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/).


Beyond The Nasdaq
-----------------


Let's consider three reasons why the market trend remains bullish, even after Monday marked the start of a ninth full week of trading following the [April 2 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) by the S&P 500. (Please read the [April 2 Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) for more detail on this pivotal market session.)



One, breakouts are working. **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) blasted higher last week on a solid Q1 report that included a 40% jump in earnings per share and a 40% rise in sales to $110.5 million. From a 73.70 handle entry on May 7, the midcap growth stock has now rallied nearly 50%.


Two, the breadth of this advance continues to expand. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is still nowhere near its Jan. 16 peak, but the slope of this line has been positive for at least 10 weeks. More Nasdaq-listed companies are participating in this rally.


(See the NYSE advance-decline line within the daily chart of the S&P 500 on the General Market Indicators page. Access it either via [Market Trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) at Investors.com or via the link that's placed at the end of this column.)


Three, more small caps are showing strength too. This serves as a sign that Wall Street is bullish about the economy. Historically, small caps tend to get smacked harder when the market sees a serious recession on the horizon.


 **Zynex** ([ZYXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZYXI)) is holding up well after clearing a 15.37 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a seven-week [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


Earnings Reports Still Trickle In
---------------------------------



**Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) surged past 200 for the first time Monday, ahead of its highly anticipated Q1 results after the close Tuesday. Some participants on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) asked if Monday's action offered a chance to buy. With the use of charts, one can conclude that the stay-at-home and telework beneficiary has gotten sharply extended since it cleared a deep cup pattern at 107.44. Zoom has also already made a few tests of the 10-week moving average, [a follow-on entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained more than 1% to fatten its gain from a March low of 24.03 to 35%. It now stands just beneath the long-term 200-day moving average and 12% below a 52-week peak of 37.12.

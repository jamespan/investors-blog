Stocks stumbled again Friday, ending low in the day's range.


The Nasdaq carved off 1.3%, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.9%. The IBD 50 lost 1.5%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but edged up on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq is approaching its 200-day moving average, a sign of just how fast the market has crumbled.


With the market in correction and still trying to find a bottom, individual investors should leave the bargain hunting to others. Wait for a confirmed uptrend before risking capital.


The pullback so far has taken the Nasdaq down roughly 9% but the S&P 500 just 4%. Yet this drawdown has already marked itself as different from recent pullbacks in at least three ways.


No. 1: The S&P 500 began outperforming the Nasdaq in early March and hasn't given up the baton since. The last time the S&P 500 topped the Nasdaq was 2011, a dud year when the S&P 500 was flat vs. a 2% drop in the Nasdaq.


No. 2: Last year, pullbacks in the Nasdaq found support either at the 50-day or the 100-day lines. This time the Nasdaq has cut through both.


No. 3: The Nasdaq hasn't put together so many down weeks and low weekly closes since October and November 2012, when the pullback reached 12%.


Yet if the current pullback continues, it could be good news for IBD-style investors. A longer correction has benefits, as stocks find time to form bases and sometimes reset base counts. New leadership has more time to reveal its face.


What will lead the next rally?


If it turns out to be cyclicals, that would be less than ideal. "Rallies in cyclical stocks may tend to be more short-lived and prone to falter at the first hint of recession or an earnings slowdown," IBD Chairman and founder William J. O'Neil points out in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


Ideally, young stocks would grab the lead. IPOs that debuted in the past several years could provide more upside potential in a strong uptrend. Stocks such as **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) might have strong runs left. Less prominent names, such as **GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)), **Zulily** ([ZU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZU)) and **The Container Store** ([TCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCS)), are possibilities, though the latter two have significant chart repairs to do.


On Friday, fast-casual restaurant **Zoe's Kitchen** ([ZOES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZOES)) debuted with a strong gain on the NYSE. Zoe's five-year revenue growth rate is a stunning 55%, easily the highest among more than 50 stocks in the restaurant industry group. Although Zoe's Kitchen has yet to turn an annual profit, the company expects to become profitable in 2015. (See story on Page A1.)


For the week, the IBD 50 fell 3.5%, the Nasdaq 3.1% and the S&P 500 2.6%.


On Friday, the put-call volume ratio hit 1.15, which is high but not yet at a level that typically corresponds to market bottoms.

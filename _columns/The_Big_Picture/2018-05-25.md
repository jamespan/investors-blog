U.S. stock indexes posted gains for the week, but the overall tenor of the market was hesitant.




The Nasdaq gained 0.1% Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each fell 0.2%.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index advanced 0.9%, leading the pack.


The Dow Jones utility average rose 0.6%, outperforming the major indexes for a sixth consecutive session.


Volume fell on both major exchanges, no surprise as some traders got an early start on the three-day weekend.Â ![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MP05251818-256x300.jpg)The market is closed Monday for Memorial Day.


Technicals Improve
------------------


Technicals improved a bit Friday as the April 20 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) fell off the S&P 500. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions.


Price action was sluggish most of the week, with no index able to keep pace with utilities or chips.


For the week, the Nasdaq rose 1.1%. The S&P 500 inched up 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.15%. But the Dow Jones utility average and the Sox chip index advanced 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and the FANG stocks tried to help the indexes but ended up helping mostly themselves.


Apple gained 1.2% for the week; **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), 1.2%; **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), 2.3%; **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), 8.4%; and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), 1.4%.


Troubles Abound
---------------


Troubles grew throughout the week. China trade talks, President Trump's signing of a partial rollback in the Dodd-Frank law, the on-and-off North Korea summit and Trump's threat of auto-related tariffs kept headline writers busy.


Bank stocks slumped during the week, unable to get any traction from the Dodd-Frank rollback. Even the smaller banks that the law is expected to help saw only modest gains.


A Break For Big Banks
---------------------


Other bank-related proposals, which have received less attention, loom in the coming week.


The Federal Reserve is expected to vote to ease the Volcker Rule, which restricts major banks from making certain kinds of trades. Big banks, such as **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), are likely to benefit.


Oil dropped 4% to $67.57, giving a boost to airlines stocks but dragging the energy sector.


Coming Up
---------


Before Wednesday's open, the Commerce Department will release the second reading on first-quarter GDP. The first take pegged growth at 2.3%.

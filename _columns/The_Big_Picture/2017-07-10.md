Market bulls were happy about a day of outperformance for the Nasdaq composite Monday but not so happy about the breadth or the volume, which disappointed on both counts.




The Nasdaq composite gained 0.4%, but breadth was weak, with decliners outnumbering advancers by 3-to-2; the S&P 500 added 0.1% while the Dow edged lower by less than 0.1%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.5%, but the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) did well, rising 0.8%, as nearly 20 names in the index of leading growth stocks rose 1% or more.


Nasdaq volume fell slightly. NYSE volume rose a bit.


Mining, oil and gas, steel and semiconductor stocks outperformed. Biotechs lagged.


Retail stocks were also a sore spot on a flurry of headlines, including a **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) downgrade, a 6% drop in shares of **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) and a 21% plunge in shares of **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) after merger talks that started in May were abandoned.


Still, it was a decent day for the bulls as several growth names outperformed.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP071017-176x300.png)Inside the IBD 50, price action in a couple of China-based names showed they're not quite ready to give up the leadership baton yet. **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) jumped nearly 5% to 129.55 as it works on a flat base. The caveat here is that it's a late-stage base after a big run already.


**New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) looks better as it gets support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout from a base in mid-March. Shares rose 3.5%.


Elsewhere, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) briefly cleared a 55.24 buy point but faded as volume ended about average. Shares closed at 54.94, up 1.8%.


When it comes to overall market health, it's certainly not hard to find yellow flags. An elevated distribution-day count for the Nasdaq, suspect breadth, and selling in some high-quality growth stocks are reasons enough to be defensive.


But as market leaders like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) struggle below the 50-day moving average, other names like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) continue to hang in there amid mild signs of institutional selling.


And don't forget about **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which is holding comfortably above the 50-day moving average after a bullish breakout in May. Shares popped nearly 5% Monday after Jefferies raised Nvidia's price target to 180 from 140.


The 10-year Treasury yield eased 1 basis point to 2.37% ahead of Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and Thursday. The Fed has been forecasting one more rate hike before the end of the year and three more in 2018.


Second-quarter earnings season could be next catalyst for the market as slew of financial firms report Friday, including **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) as well as lesser-known names like **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) and **PNC Financial** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)). A daily chart for PNC shows a shallow cup-with-handle base with a 128.35 but point.


When it comes to overall market health, the distribution-day count currently stands at seven for the Nasdaq composite and five for the S&P 500. Distribution days, or higher-volume declines in the indexes, are a good way to monitor institutional selling.


Of the Nasdaq's seven distribution days, three showed percentage declines of 1.4% or more; in other words, they were fairly obvious signs of institutional selling.


For the S&P 500, however, signs of institutional selling are less obvious. Out of the S&P 500's five distribution days, four showed percentage declines ranging from 0.7% to 0.9%. The other was tame with a loss of just 0.3%.


The bottom line is that unequivocal breakdowns in market leaders have been few and far between. That's reason enough for the bulls to look at the market with a glass-half-full perspective, while still acknowledging elevated risk. It doesn't make sense to have aggressive exposure to stocks at this point, but some exposure is still warranted as the major stock indexes continue to hold near highs.

Stocks Reverse Higher, Brush Aside Crisis Headlines

The stock indexes made bullish reversals Tuesday in a message to investors that they won't let an international crisis get in the way of their uptrend.


Stocks opened lower on news that Turkey had shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian border. The incident flared up what was already a tense situation in the region.


But Wall Street this month has shown an amazing ability to brush aside crisis headlines. In fact, the indexes ended a short-term slide after the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris.


The Nasdaq, off as much as 1%, closed fractionally higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.1%.


Small caps helped solidify the day's performance as the Russell 2000 climbed 0.7%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


Even if Tuesday's Turkey-Russia row didn't rattle stock prices much, it did seem to spur more trading. In a week best known for listless holiday volume, it made a noticeable change.


The incident did spark some flight-to-safety moves in global markets, and European equities did not recover.


Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 fell 1.4%. The London FTSE shed 0.5%.


Debt markets around the world climbed as demand rose for fixed-income assets. Gold prices advanced.


Crude oil jumped more than 2%. The commodity is sensitive to any potential disruption of the crucial supply routes in the Middle East.


Drilling and related oil stocks were among the day's best. Solar, some retail and metals also were productive.


The Oct. 20 distribution day on the Nasdaq was deleted because it is now too far back to matter any longer.


It still leaves an uncomfortable number of distribution days, with half a dozen on the S&P 500 and five on the Nasdaq. But the market's resilience and the progress of most leading stocks are keeping growth investors out of trouble.


The indexes' charts do reveal a potential problem, though.


Many investors who bought around the summer peaks in July and August suffered losses when the market started tumbling. Now, with the indexes recouping most of their ground, investors find themselves with the good fortune of making up losses. That's a powerful incentive to sell at the first chance of breaking even, and collectively that urge creates a potential wave of relieved sellers.


Chart readers call that phenomenon overhead supply, and it's something to watch.


The IBD 50 fell 0.3%, although the day's results basically shaped a normal bell curve.


The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index rose 5.5% in September from the year-earlier period, above forecasts. Most homebuilder stocks finished higher, with three of every four stocks in the group up.


Consumer confidence fell, while Q3 GDP was revised higher. But the geopolitical events of the day overshadowed those reports.


Travel stocks suffered after the State Department on Monday issued a worldwide travel alert due to "increased terrorist threats."


Airline, ticketing and lodging industry groups were among the day's weakest.

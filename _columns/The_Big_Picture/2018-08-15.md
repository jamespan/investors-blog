Nasdaq Paces Sell-Off; Stock Market Health Weighs On This Factor More Than China, Turkey
=========================================================================================

The Nasdaq and small-cap indexes led a broad decline on Wall Street on Wednesday. Sellers showed more anxiousness to bag profits and raise cash. Still, the technical picture remained positive enough for the IBD outlook to remain at "confirmed uptrend."




And ultimately, leading stocks are still showing decent action. In a market that shows hesitant behavior, watch the market leaders closely, via the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). In fact, this is the ultimate indicator for investors on when they should adjust market exposure.


The tech-weighted Nasdaq composite and the Nasdaq 100 both dropped 1.2%. That marked the composite's third single-day decline of 1% or more within the past three weeks. Yet on the positive side, the leading index for growth stocks cut an early loss of as much as 1.7%.


The Nasdaq also showed a decent bounce off the 50-day moving average, which has been rising since early June.


The S&P 500 slumped nearly 0.8%, an improvement from a loss of 1.3% earlier in the session. The small-cap S&P 600 did worse, losing 1.2%. The Russell 2000 slipped 1.3%.


Volume grew substantially on the Nasdaq and NYSE. This means the S&P 500 logged its fourth day of distribution, or intense professional selling, within the past 25 trading days.

The past few years of market action have shown that the indexes can suffer as many as six, seven, even eight distribution days, yet still refuse to give in to a serious decline. Why? Keep in mind that small distribution days within the count can be trivial.


The Technical Picture
---------------------


Like the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 is maintaining positive technical action in relation to its 50-day moving average. The large-cap benchmark held above the medium-term support level throughout Wednesday trading. There also appears to be some willingness among institutions to support the S&P 500 near the 2800 level.


Not too long ago, the S&P 500 had quite a tough time eclipsing that round number after the late January sell-off that produced the first 10%-plus correction in more than a year.


A rally among dividend-rich utilities underscored the defensive color of trading. The Dow Jones utility average rallied 0.9%, its biggest gain in nearly two weeks.


At 732, the Dow utilities are now up 1.2% for the year. At one point, the index was off as much as 10.4%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond has fallen to 2.85%. At the start of August, it was at 3%.


Fear Drivers
------------


Headlines on slowing economic growth on multiple fronts in China, the world's No. 2 economy, and Turkey's decision to impose stiffer tariffs on U.S. imports, including cars and alcohol, spurred an opening sell-off. Myron Brilliant, executive VP and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, criticized the recent tariffs by both the U.S. and Turkey. "We urge both governments to address their differences through dialogue rather than the unilateral applications, sanctions, and boycotts," Brilliant said.


Yet a mostly bullish [U.S. retail sales report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) seemed to help buffer the slide, even though **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) paced a harsh drop within the department store industry group.


Meanwhile, a strong Empire State manufacturing survey reading of 25.6 in July sailed well over the Econoday forecast of 20.0. In June, the index was 22.6. The data added more confirmation that U.S. economic growth is accelerating after a so-so increase of 2.3% in Q1. In Q2, GDP rose at an annualized rate of 4.1%.



Macy's triggered the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) on Wednesday, falling more than 7% below a 41.43 buy point following a breakout from a [new flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).


And Macy's offers perhaps the biggest lesson for stock investors right now. What is that lesson?


If you're buying new stocks on breakouts, be ready to sell if they do not behave as you would expect. Be aggressive with your losers by cutting them more quickly. If you know the stock isn't acting right, you don't have to wait for a 7%-8% loss to cut it loose.


In a vigorous, healthy market, leaders soar to new highs. Or they march steadily to new highs and sculpt fantastic long-term uptrends. Certainly we've seen such action in the likes of digital ads platform **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), payments technology innovator **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), megacap tech leader **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), and [Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)).



But if you see the double-digit gains among the stocks in your portfolio shrink fast, consider taking profits more quickly and don't wish for a 20%-25% gain from the breakout. Choppy markets can last a long time, and they require traders to adjust their profit and loss targets.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF, a good barometer of leading stocks, dropped 1.7%, falling much more than the S&P 500. At 35.63, the ETF is starting to live beneath the 10-week moving average and now stands 5% below an all-time peak of 37.66.

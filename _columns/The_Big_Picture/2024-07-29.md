The [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) lost initial gains, but the pullback wasn't necessarily bearish. Monday's action perhaps signaled that equity traders preferred to take a cautious stance ahead of some economic reports and earnings results from some of the largest companies on the planet.


One piece of [economic news to watch](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)? The July nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday before the open. Stock market observers will also pay attention to the ADP private-sector jobs survey on Wednesday and weekly jobless claims on Thursday. The jobless claims data has been quietly rising, worrying some economists that the probability of a recession is also rising.


The yield on the U.S. Treasury benchmark 10-year note cooled, down 2 basis points to 4.17%, according to Cboe data.


[And on the earnings front](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), the slate is extremely heavy again this week. It includes the likes of **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) on Tuesday and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) on Wednesday. Both megacap techs report quarterly results after the closing bell.


Also be on the lookout for other stock market leaders such as **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) in the AI and PC semiconductor realm (Tuesday), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) in the wireless chip space (Wednesday), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) (Wednesday), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) (Thursday) and **Sarepta Therapeutics** ([SRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRPT)) (Friday).


Sarepta entered the [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) on June 24.

Stock Market Today
------------------


A drop in crude oil futures, one barometer of economic activity, may have punctured the early rise in the stock market. On the Nymex, light sweet crude oil futures sank 1.6% to $75.90 a barrel. Oil is now up only 6.4% year to date. Back on April 14, crude got as high as $87.67, up almost 23% since Jan. 1.


Back to the stock market, the Nasdaq composite closed less than 0.1% higher. That's disappointing on two fronts. One, the tech-weighted index had rallied as much as 1% early on Monday. Two, even the intraday gain paled vs. a sharp two-week loss of 5.7%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP07292024-221x300.jpg)The weekly chart of the Nasdaq shows just how muted Monday's rally was, no matter what time of the session. The index, for now, remains beneath its still-rising 10-week moving average.


On July 24, [IBD lowered the suggested level of investment in stocks](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-sp500-dow-jones-alphabet-ge-stock/) to a 40%-60% range vs. 60%-80%. That range got reduced from 80%-100% five trading days earlier, on July 17.


The S&P 500 reflected a mixed day as well. At 5463, it inched up 4 points, less than 0.1% higher. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average didn't move much. Yet at 40,573, down only 49 points on Monday, it closed above 40,000 for the 10th session in July.


The Russell 2000, a huge winner last week with its 3.5% lift, dropped 1.1% on Monday.


Looking at the daily action of 197 IBD industries, a mishmash of high-growth, cyclical and defensive groups fared poorly, an interesting development.


Among the 15 industries that dropped 2% or more, department stores and dairy products led the way, both down 4%. Solar, database software, oil drilling, Southwest banks, alcoholic beverages, coal, and oil and gas field services had a bad day. (See the entire 197 at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Stock market internals weakened, but overall the confirmed market uptrend remains intact.


According to early data, falling stocks on the New York Stock Exchange outmatched rising ones by a nearly 3-2 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers by close to 2-to-1. Volume edged lower on both the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Friday.

The X Factor?
-------------


With the possibility that the stock market could lose further momentum, IBD readers have certainly benefited from acting more cautiously lately. Breakouts have also proved somewhat mixed lately. This is another reason to be very selective with new investments.


On the bright side, long-term care firms have gushed with gains. **Ensign** ([ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)) (a [half-size position on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint)), **Pennant Group** ([PNTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNTG)) and **Sabra Healthcare** ([SBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBRA)) have outperformed the stock market lately and posted nice moves after clearing breakout points.


But it's a different story for names like **Hamilton Insurance** ([HG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HG)), which has dipped below a [V-shaped, weird-looking cup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/) with a 17.77 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Yet Hamilton remains above its IPO pricing of $15 a share.


New IPO **Bowhead Specialty** ([BOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOW)), another insurance-sector play, has traded wildly since it moved past an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) with a 27.49 buy point. Yet it hasn't triggered the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) for now.


**Loews** ([L](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=L)) reversed badly Monday, sinking 1.5% to 78.86 in above-average turnover. For now, though, the property and casualty insurer and operator of oil rigs is above a 77.99 [early buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in its amorphous base.


**MicroStrategy** ([MSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR)), which got some airplay during [Friday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), also reversed lower. The owner of a huge treasury of bitcoin briefly rallied past 1,800, then dove 3.5% and hit a session low of 1,671.27. In recent days, MicroStrategy formed a faulty four-session handle that included a big shakeout on Thursday.

Beyond The Stock Market: The Fed And Rates
------------------------------------------


The Federal Reserve begins a new two-day meeting on interest rates Tuesday. The CME FedWatch shows a slim 4% possibility that the bank will cut the overnight lending rate to large banks from its current range of 5.25%-5.5%. However, at the next meeting on Sept. 18, FedWatch shows a 100% chance the Fed will trim the cost of money by at least a quarter point.


Cindy Beaulieu, chief investment officer for North America at Conning, which has $160 billion in assets under management, says her team still believes the Fed will limit any monetary easing this year to one or two cuts of 25 basis points, possibly after the November elections.


"Overall, the growth picture looks decent. I wouldn't say it's going gangbusters," Beaulieu, who has been in the asset management industry for three decades, told IBD. "Inflation has moved more consistently toward the Fed's 2% target. But it will get harder for inflation to continue to make such consistent progress toward the U.S. central bank's target. Why? Primarily because the prices of nonhousing-related services continue to rise faster than other components of the vast, complex U.S. economy.


"The consumer is still consuming. Unlike four years ago (when Covid 19 caused many dislocations across industries), currently inflation is being driven by the demand side of the economy," Beaulieu added.


She's also encouraged by the strength of the financial sector in the stock market so far.


It's been more than a year since Silicon Valley Bank operator SVB Bancorp and Signature Bank of New York imploded by holding a huge load of Treasury bonds and other debt securities. Those lost a tremendous amount of market value as the Fed took the fed funds rate from 0%-0.25% to 5.25%-5.5% from March 2022 to July 2023. Lately, interest rates across the yield curve have remained fairly stable, making it easier for lenders to adjust their portfolios.


A few regional and community banks with overexposure to the struggling office real estate market could still go bankrupt, Beaulieu warned. But it would be unlikely to have such ripple effects as the stock market felt back in the first half of 2023. And with the prospects for the slope of the Treasury yield curve to regain some steepness, banks may be able to borrow more at lower rates and lend at higher rates, generating fatter net interest margins.

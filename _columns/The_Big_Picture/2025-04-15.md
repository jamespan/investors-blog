Major stock market indexes closed mixed Tuesday after the Nasdaq composite got turned away at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Monday. Despite Tuesday's quiet session, several leading growth stocks outperformed, including **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which reports [earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/netflix-stock-booming-subscriber-growth-q1-results/) Thursday after the close.


Meanwhile, new issue **ServiceTitan** ([TTAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTAN)) soared out of an early-stage [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 106.99 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).


The Nasdaq closed with a loss of less than 0.1% in lower volume, with advancing stocks beating decliners by a small margin. That's a curious divergence. Plus, after soaring 7.3% last week, the index is up a healthy 0.6% so far this week as growth investors keep an eye out for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-how-to-invest-using-follow-through-days/). Seven days into the rally attempt, the Nasdaq still has not shown a higher-volume decline.




Netflix shares rallied nearly 5%. Volume grew 61% above its 50-day average. The streaming giant jumped above its 50-day line in higher volume as it shapes a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) with a 998.70 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Stock Market Today: ServiceTitan Jumps
--------------------------------------


Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed ServiceTitan surged nearly 10% in heavy turnover and closed well past the 5% buy zone from the 106.99 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/). The company provides software to contractors to help them manage their businesses. ServiceTitan isn't profitable yet, but top-line growth has ranged from 24% to 29% over the past four quarters.



ServiceTitan went public in December at 71 a share and closed at 101 on its first day of trading. TTAN reached a high of 105 on its Nasdaq debut. But with shares up nearly 19% last week and an additional 14% this week, waiting for a low-volume pullback closer to the entry is a better strategy than chasing the stock at current levels.


After rising 0.8% on an intraday basis, the S&P 500 reversed slightly lower for a loss of 0.2%. Volume was very light on the NYSE and breadth was slightly positive.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to its 21-day line before turning lower by 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 small-cap index edged up 0.1%.

10-Year Yield Drops
-------------------


Investors bought bonds again, sending the 10-year Treasury lower for the second straight day. After falling nearly 13 basis points Monday, the 10-year yield fell an additional three basis points on Tuesday to 4.32%. The weakness comes after last week's bond rout that saw the 10-year yield spike just over 50 basis points.


Futures traders over at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) expect three or four rate cuts between now and the end of the year, although the odds for the first rate cut at the May meeting have fallen off quite a bit.


It was a quiet day of economic data Tuesday as the Empire State Manufacturing index for April came in a little better than expected at -8.1. But the index marked its third month this year in contraction territory.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MP041525-300x281.jpg)A big economic report looms large Wednesday with the release of the March retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Sales are expected to rise 1.4% vs. February's reading of 0.2%.


With the stock market still in a correction, it remains a challenging environment for new buys. But several top-rated growth stocks are setting up in bases and not far from buy points.


**Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) rallied 4% and could try to break out of a downtrend soon, but it'll need to get above its 50-day line and a 621.20 entry to do it.

**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) rallied for the fifth time in six sessions. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) is in new high ground even though the South American internet giant is more than 10% off its high. The stock closed less than 4% below a 2,202 [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/getting-the-dub-recognizing-the-double-bottom-base-pattern/) entry.



Among India-based banks, **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) followed through after Friday's breakout from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/). Technically, the stock is still in the 5% buy zone from a 67.12 entry, but HDB is now 11% above its 50-day line. Meanwhile, **Icici Bank** ([IBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBN)) touched a 31.99 cup-with-handle buy point in lukewarm volume and closed just off highs.


Leaderboard Does Some Nibbling
------------------------------


[IBD's Leaderboard increased market exposure](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) modestly on Monday. **ADMA Biologics** ([ADMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADMA)) joined the [Leaders list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as a half-size position when it cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 20.70 buy point. We increased ADMA to a three-quarters-size position Tuesday after the stock followed through with conviction, rising 5.9% to 22.15, a five-month closing high, in strong volume.


ADMA sports a stellar 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-chipmaker-tsm-stock-ibd-composite-rating/) on a scale of 1 to 99.


The midcap growth stock got some airtime on [Tuesday's "IBD Live" show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A).


New Software Leader Rises Again
-------------------------------


**Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) [joined Leaderboard Tuesday](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as a quarter-size position when the stock moved above Monday's high and approached a 98.17 entry. We increased the position later in the session when Palantir crossed the buy point. The combined moves raised our invested percentage to just over 15%.


Both stocks helped fuel a 1.1% gain for the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), and the exchange traded fund closed above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) for the first time in nearly three weeks.

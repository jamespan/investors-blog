Bad open, good finish. Such action by the major indexes is typically the norm for a stock market in a healthy uptrend.




Still, Wednesday's action painted a bullish tint for a market that is officially in correction mode.


The Nasdaq composite performed the biggest heroics of the day as it turned a 1.9% morning slide into a 1.4% advance. The leading index for growth companies nearly closed at session highs and returned back above the 7000 level.

The S&P 500 posted a similar reversal, going from a 1.6% early sell-off and a third poke below the 200-day moving average in as many days to a 1.2% gain. The S&P SmallCap 600 matched that advance. But on a year-to-date basis, the 600 (up 0.6%) continues to hold a small edge over the 500 (down 1.1%).


While that might not seem like such a difference, it's worth keeping an eye on the relative performance of these two benchmarks. While the S&P 500 clearly dominated its small-cap sibling in 2017 (up 19.4% that year vs. up 11.7% for the 600), things could wind up very differently this year.


Like the S&P SmallCap 600, the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly enough to return to the black in 2018, up 2%. The Nasdaq 100 is up nearly 2.6% since Jan. 1.


Volume dipped mildly on both exchanges.


In February, the market sold off on fears that the Federal Reserve would grow hawkish on inflation and be more aggressive in raising short-term interest rates. Given the recent action in U.S. Treasuries, such fear has cooled. The major indexes resumed their rallies and hit new highs.


But March and April have seen the equity markets around the globe dominated by concern over how far President Trump and the Chinese government will go in taxing each others' imports. Wednesday's severe opening drop reflected institutional investors' distaste for measures that could hamper the flow of goods across borders.


Judging by the action in certain blue chips, the trade war risk appears to still hurt large multinational corporations a lot more than smaller companies that see a smaller share of their revenues coming from overseas.


Early Wednesday, China announced it would slap a 25% levy on roughly $50 billion in imported goods including soybeans, cars, chemicals and planes. It was a natural tit-for-tat response to President Trump's proposal Tuesday to expand tariffs on a wider array of Chinese products coming into the U.S.


"We don't expect a trade war," analysts at Yardeni Research wrote in a note to clients. "Global trade remains at a record high. We believe that countries have become too interdependent to resort to widespread prohibitive protective barriers."


U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross seemed to echo that sentiment in his comments, indicating during an interview on CNBC that the U.S. is ready to discuss trade issues with Chinese officials.


With the market going to "Uptrend under pressure" on March 19 and then getting downgraded to "correction" on March 27, it's likely no surprise to veteran IBD readers to see scads of promising growth companies surrender all of their recent post-breakout gains.


New IPOs are not immune to the overall trend as well.



Take **SendGrid** ([SEND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEND)), the Colorado-based developer of a cloud-based digital communication platform for businesses. The stock gave back all of a 16% run-up past a 27.52 cup-without-handle entry last week. On Wednesday, SendGrid suffered its fifth loss in six sessions, gapping down more than 7% to 24.66. Volume surged 136% above its 50-day average.


While it's still way too early to conclude that a new tradeable rally is underway, the market is seeing some silver linings in the proverbial cloud hanging over stocks, often in the form of contrarian indicators.


One, optimism is fading. While the [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) slipped to 20.35 on Wednesday, the VIX is still up 85% since Jan. 1. [Bullishness among newsletter editors](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) surveyed by Investors Intelligence dipped to 47.6%, the lowest since mid-September.



Two, many of the top names in dynamic growth sectors, including software, internet, leisure and building, showed positive reversals. Thanks in part to [strong quarterly earnings results](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/lennar-reports-fiscal-first-quarter-earnings/) from **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), the homebuilding group was one of the day's best, up 4.9%.


The group hosts at least eight companies that boast a 3-year EPS growth rate of 25% or higher, including **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) (a member of the IBD 50), **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) and **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)).

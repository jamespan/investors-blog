In a day of diverging action among indexes, one conclusion could be drawn: The stock market's five-month uptrend remains on course, but watch out for potholes.




Sellers came into the market in the final 45 minutes of the session Monday. That was enough to send the Nasdaq composite down 0.4%, snapping a five-day win streak.


The S&P 500 lost 0.3%. Still, the S&P and Nasdaq remain in upward price channels and above their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The line has offered both indexes a floor since the uptrend began.


The S&P is up 9.4% year to date, on pace for its best first-quarter performance since 2019. Whenever it rises at least 8% in Q1, the S&P 500 averages a gain of 9.7% for the rest of the year, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Going back to 1950, it also finishes the year higher 94% of the time.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% also. Three sessions after it cleared 39,282, the Dow is right back to that level.


But small caps edged higher, as the Russell 2000 index closed 0.1% higher. That, however, was a sliver of the 0.8% gain it had in early trading. The small-cap benchmark met resistance at the 2,100 level this month, which has been characterized by volatility.


Retail was weak Monday, with seven of the day's 17 worst-performing industry groups coming from that sector. The IBD 50 Index eased 0.1%.


Stock Market Under Distribution
-------------------------------


The major indexes are enjoying their best period since the post-Covid bull run, up 21% to 30% from their Oct. 27 lows. Yet, the mere fact that indexes have been climbing without a break for five months is reason to be guarded. To wit, IBD continues to recommend 60%-80% exposure to stocks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP032524_2.jpg)One concern is the number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) over the past few weeks. The Nasdaq has piled up an uncomfortably high seven days of higher-volume selling. Monday marked the most recent, as Nasdaq volume climbed 7% from Friday's totals.


Technology shares have carried much of the market's weight since November, and software and semiconductors are slowing down from their rallies.


IShares Expanded Tech-Software ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)), a proxy for the software sector, fell a modest 0.4% Monday. The exchange traded fund is forming a flat base and holding barely above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Of concern, however, is the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/), which has been making a series of lower lows and lower highs while the base takes shape.


The PHLX Semiconductor Index ([SOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOX)) gapped up Thursday, but has backtracked since then. As noted in the March 11 Big Picture, a bearish reversal on March 8 may have marked a top for the index.


Tech Sector Index Keeps Rising
------------------------------


But the broader Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) is holding up just fine, on track for a sixth consecutive monthly gain. Its relative strength line, though, is drifting a bit lower.


Five months from the market's bottom, stock market investors have banked hefty gains. The problem for growth investors is that there hasn't been new leadership to extend the uptrend.


The [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/) index is running dry on breakouts. Other than **Gap** ([GPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPS)) and **Turtle Beach** ([HEAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEAR)), every breakout in the past three weeks is less than 5% above the buy point. **BBB Foods** ([TBBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBBB)), which is 6% above its 22.54 buy point, gave back most of its early gains on Monday.


**Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), **Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)) and **Nuveen Churchill Direct** ([NCDL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCDL)) are below their entries.


Stock Market In Short Holiday Week
----------------------------------


This week is unusual for the stock market for several reasons. First, stock exchanges are closed for the Good Friday holiday. Thursday is the last trading day of the week and of the first quarter of 2024. This is a time when fund managers like to add top-performing stocks to look smart on their quarterly portfolio profiles.


And the biggest economic headline will come out Friday, when stock trading will be shut down. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis releases the February personal income and consumption report, which includes the personal consumption expenditures index. That's the inflation number most trusted by the Federal Reserve.


Later that day, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at the San Francisco Fed's Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy Conference. Any stock market reaction to his remarks will have to wait until next Monday.

Sellers dictated the action in the stock market Tuesday as earnings sell-offs for **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)), **UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)), **Tenable** ([TENB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TENB)) and **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)), along with another big drop in the 10-year Treasury yield, weighed on sentiment.




Security software stocks fell broadly after Tenable reported earnings and guided full-year billings and revenue below expectations. The weak guidance fueled fears that there could be more bad news to come in the group, and the technology sector in general. The security software group fell nearly 5%.


After a sluggish breakout over a 192.94 buy point, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) gapped below its 50-day moving average, falling nearly 5% in higher volume. **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) also dropped nearly 5% and closed just above the 50-day line.


The Nasdaq composite swooned 2% and is very close to a test of the 5o-day line. Volume fell on the Nasdaq, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers by about 7-to-2.


Miraculously, the Nasdaq avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). But that was cold comfort to stock market bulls as several top-rated growth stocks sold off hard.


Semiconductor stocks took heat as names like **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)), **Allegro MicroSystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)), **Axcelis Technologies** ([ACLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACLS)) and **Lattice Semiconductor** ([LSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSCC)) fell sharply. RMBS fell sharply below its 50-day line ahead of Monday's earnings report. Lattice also reports on Monday.


The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) fell another 3.2% after closing below its 50-day line Friday for the first time since Jan. 5.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 recorded its second distribution day since the March 29 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/), falling 1.6% in higher volume.

The weak action was enough to prompt a change in IBD's outlook to "uptrend under pressure" with a lowered recommended exposure percentage of 20% to 40% from 40% to 60%.


If you've still got some nice gainers, consider taking partial or full profits. Now is the time to be playing defense, not offense.


First Republic Bank was by far the worst performer in the S&P 500, down 49%, after the company reported Q1 results and said deposits tumbled 41% in Q1 to $104.5 billion. The bank announced plans to reduce its head count by 20% to 25%. **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)), **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)), **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) and **Zions Bancorp** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)) also lagged badly in the S&P 500 with losses ranging from 4.5% to over 9%.


Losers swamped winners on the NYSE by just over 5-to-1. After trying to reclaim its 50-day line, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) fell 1.7% and is now testing its 200-day line.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped down to its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), falling 1%. But the selling in financial stocks fueled a sharp decline for the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), which slumped 2.5%.


Money flowed into bonds, sending the 10-year sharply lower. The yield was trading around 3.40% just after 4:30 p.m. ET, down 11 basis points, as worries about the health of the economy took center stage again.


Earnings And Economic Data
--------------------------


Nasdaq 100 futures got a lift in extended trading, helped by bullish earnings moves by **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) also report this week, and another key piece of inflation data looms large on Friday.


The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, found inside the Personal Income and Spending report, will be released Friday.


Year-over-year, the PCE price index is expected to come in at 4.2%, down from 5% in February. Core PCE, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to dip slightly to 4.5% from 4.6%. But that's still more than double the Fed's preferred target of 2%.

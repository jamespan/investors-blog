Stock Market Extends Losses; Energy Stocks Lead, But Technology Shares Rocked Again
====================================================================================

The bull market continued for oil and gas stocks Monday, but many other areas of the stock market looked downright awful.




Eight of the day's 10 worst-performing industry groups in the stock market hailed from the software sector, each with losses of at least 3%. Top-rated shipping stocks like **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)) and **ZIM Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) suffered double-digit percentage declines.


The 10-year yield hit a high of nearly 1.51% but backed off highs by the close, rising nearly 2 basis points to around 1.48%.


Nasdaq Nears Key Test At 200-Day Line
-------------------------------------


Top-performing growth stocks were under pressure again, fueling a 2.1% decline for the Nasdaq composite. The index undercut Friday's low, killing the nascent rally attempt. So did the S&P 500, which fell 1.3%.

The Nasdaq is close to its 200-day moving average, which basically corresponds to the 14,000 level. It's about 2% above the long-term support level, along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell 0.9%. The S&P 500 closed nearly 4% above its 200-day line.


It wasn't an overly fearful market, though. The Cboe Volatility Index rose 8.5%, but it closed in the bottom half of the day's range and is still below last week's high.


Stock market breadth was weak, with declining stocks on the Nasdaq outnumbering advancers by nearly 3-to-1. Losers beat winners on the NYSE by just over 3-to-1.


Nasdaq volume dipped, while preliminary data showed higher volume on the NYSE.


Oil And Gas Stocks Lead
-----------------------


Oil and gas stocks outperformed in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), but leading oil and gas producers like **Range Resources** ([RRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RRC)), **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) and **Magnolia Oil & Gas** ([MGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGY)) are too extended to consider buying.


**Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) and **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) might look like they're in buy range, but both stocks have rallied sharply off lows in recent weeks without much consolidation. Both stocks could use a breather.


**PDC Energy** ([PDCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDCE)), meanwhile, has pulled back into buy range. But big sellers were in the stock last week, calling its chart into question.


U.S. crude oil futures settled at $77.62 a barrel, up 2.3%, to a seven-year high. [OPEC+ stuck with a gradual supply hike](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-ahead-of-opec-meeting-boost-production-us-pressure/) even as soaring demand for natural gas boosts crude demand. In July, OPEC+ agreed to boost output by 400,000 barrels a day through at least April.


After slumping 8.7% last week in heavy volume, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 2.8% Monday. The ETF fell to its 200-day moving average Friday, where it found support. But shares slid back to the line Monday.


IBD 50 Stocks Pressured
-----------------------


[Twenty names in the IBD 50 index](https://www.investors.com/research/catalent-stock-oneok-10-others-enter-ibd-50-after-rough-day-for-the-hot-list/) of leading growth stocks fell 3% or more. Trading was volatile again in **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), which slumped 13%. The former Leaderboard stock is still holding above its 10-week moving average.


Investment advisor **Evercore** ([EVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVR)) was a bright spot in the IBD 50, up 1.4%. The stock is near its August high of 142.42 and could be poised to break out of a downtrend.


With IBD growth screens not yielding much in the way of actionable stocks, the best course of action for now is to get out of the market's way. Raise some cash and wait for new leadership to emerge.


It's not hard adopting a defense posture. What's harder is having the discipline to stay on the sidelines. The temptation is to put money to work in stocks holding up well, but a weak market usually brings everything down with it. Favor cash until the selling runs its course. Swim with the market tide, not against it.


Cash is a viable position during market downdrafts. Sure, you can look for short setups, but they're still in short supply.


The best stocks to short are those in downtrends with low [Relative Strength Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/). After a break of the 10-week line, many stocks will try to move back above the support level. Watch for stocks that keep getting turned away at their 10-week lines. Repeated resistance often comes ahead of further price declines.


If shorting stocks isn't your game, continue to round out your watchlist with stocks showing relative strength.


Recent IPOs **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)), **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) and **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)) still have the potential to be stock market leaders. All three finally look like they're ready to build new bases after lengthy uptrends.

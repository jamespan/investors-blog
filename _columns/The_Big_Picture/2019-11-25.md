The week of Thanksgiving is not supposed to start this way.




Stock market indexes rallied to record highs, and multibillion-dollar deals made a splash. That's a far cry from the slow, quiet trading that typically characterizes the short holiday week.


But then, most Thanksgiving weeks aren't under the cloud of a trade war. So weekend news that China will raise penalties for violations of intellectual-property rights cheered Wall Street. Such protections have been a sticking point in U.S.-China trade talks, and this step represents a potential breakthrough.


A series of acquisitions also brightened the mood in the stock market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP-112519-225x300.jpg)IBD's jewelry industry group led with a nearly 6% increase after **LVMH Moet Hennessy** ([LVMUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVMUY)) [agreed to acquire](https://www.investors.com/news/lvmh-tiffany-luxury-takeover-jewelry/) **Tiffany & Co.** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)) for $16 billion. Tiffany shares gapped up to a 15-month high in heavy volume. LVHM U.S.-traded stock rose 2.3%.


**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) said it will acquire **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) in a [$26 billion all-stock deal](https://www.investors.com/news/td-ameritrade-stock-pops-charles-schwab-confirms-acquistion/), confirming last week's reports of the acquisition. Schwab stock rose 2.3% and had already gapped up more than 7% Thursday, when the reports first surfaced. TD Ameritrade jumped 7.6% Monday.


**EBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) agreed to [sell its StubHub ticketing business to Viagogo Entertainment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ebay-stock-jumps-sell-stubhub-four-billion-cash/) for $4.05 billion in cash. EBay shares rose 2.1%.


The positive news flow sent the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 to all-time highs. The composite added 1.3% and the S&P 500 tacked on 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%, falling just short of a new high.


Small Caps Shine In Stock Market
--------------------------------


But it was small caps that made the most significant move. The Russell 2000 jumped 2.1% and cleared resistance around 1600 that persisted for more than a year.


The breakout means the small-cap index has a chance to catch up to the major stock market indexes. The Nasdaq is up more than 30% this year and the S&P 500 25%. With Monday's surge, the Russell 2000 is now tied with the Dow Jones Industrial Average for year-to-date gains at 20.3%.


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 1.3% despite a couple of volatile stocks. Wild-trading **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) rebounded nearly 15%, which helped offset a 17.2% plunge in **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)). The mining company sold off after it [agreed to acquire rival Detour Gold](https://www.investors.com/news/kirkland-lake-gold-buys-detour-gold-rival/) in an an all-stock deal valued at $3.68 billion.



Chip equipment and other semiconductor industry groups rose more than 2%, partly on the China news. The software sector's comeback kept going strong. Business analytics provider **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) broke out of an undefined pattern in heavy volume. Splunk started rallying Friday after [third-quarter results and the company's outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/splunk-earnings-revenue-top-estimates-splunk-stock/) beat expectations.


Stock Market Leaders: Biotechs, Retail, Financials
--------------------------------------------------


The stock market rally in biotechs also continued. **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) broke out past an 89.40 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in more than double its average volume. The company said that development data for two drugs will be presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting next month.


The iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) rose 2.5% and broke out past a 116.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The biotech ETF has surged more than 23% since bottoming on Oct. 2.


Indexes paused last week after streaking higher for several weeks. Monday's broad gains — advancers beat decliners by 10-to-3 on the Nasdaq and by about 11-to-04 on the NYSE — bode well for the short term.


With techs and biotechs mounting rallies, the Nasdaq has an edge. But retail is getting a bounce, health care in general is rallying, and financials (see Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF))) are steaming higher.

The stock market rallied sharply Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a fresh high in 2023, seemingly unbothered by Wednesday's [hawkish Federal Reserve comments](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-shock-two-more-rate-hikes-seen-sp-500-falls/).




As the stock market uptrend continues to flourish, a number of leading stocks are already extended from prior entries. But [IBD Leaderboard watchlist](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) and **Hyatt Hotels** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) are in or near buy points in today's stock market.


Ahead of Thursday's market open, there was a deluge of economic data.


Initial jobless claims rose to 262,000 vs. the 248,000 expected for the week ended June 10, which matched the prior week's revised number.


The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index fell to 13.7 in June vs. the 14.5 consensus estimate. The reading shows continued slowdowns in areas including employment, working hours, new and unfilled orders, shipments and inventories. June marks the 10th straight month of contraction.


June's Empire State Manufacturing Index came in at 6.6 vs. a -15.1 consensus estimate. The surprise number shows positive sentiment by the roughly 200 manufacturing executives surveyed on their six-month economic outlook.


May retail sales rose 0.3% vs. the 0.1% drop economists had forecast. Sales excluding vehicles rose 0.1%, as expected. Excluding vehicles and gas, sales increased 0.4% vs. a 0.2% forecast. Consumers put their dollars into car dealerships and hardware stores and also groceries, furniture and electronics.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP061523-259x300.jpg)Jabil** ([JBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBL)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) were key earnings movers Thursday. Software giant **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) delivered results after Thursday's close.


Jabil advanced 5% after the [company's fiscal-Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jabil-stock-rises-as-contract-manufacturer-tops-views/), nearing the 20%-25% profit area from an 89.10 buy point. Kroger slid almost 3% after sales missed estimates.


[Lennar reported](https://www.investors.com/news/lennar-stock-rides-28-percent-gain-ahead-of-earnings-fed-decision/) better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter profits and sales late Wednesday, delivering better than 1,000 more homes than was predicted as a tightening U.S. housing market shows strong demand for new construction. Lennar stock advanced 4.4% Thursday.


Adobe shares climbed 5% in extended trade. The company reported better-than-expected fiscal-Q2 earnings and sales.


Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Hits New High
-------------------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%, or 428 points, hitting a new 2023 high. Inside the Dow 30, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) advanced 3.2%, hitting an all-time high.


The S&P 500 climbed 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite followed up with a nearly 1.2% gain. Both extended win streaks to six sessions and reached new 2023 highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 moved up 0.8%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE from the prior session. The Nasdaq's [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) dwindled to one amid its sharp gains in recent sessions. The S&P's count also fell to one, underscoring the bullish tone in the stock market uptrend.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.3% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) surged 5.1% Thursday, rallying further above a 37.58 cup-base buy point.


With the Nasdaq at new 2023 highs, IBD's recommended market exposure sits at 60%-80%. The composite still looks extended, with the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) closing more than 11% above the 50-day moving average. That's above the 6% to 7% threshold that has flagged pullbacks for the Nasdaq 100 in the past.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Chipotle, Dexcom, Hyatt
------------------------------------------------------



On April 26, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watchlist stock Chipotle surged after strong results, ending far out of the buy zone from a 1,724.71 cup-base buy point. And in mid-May, Chipotle shares reached the 20%-25% profit level.


Now, shares are trading tightly, [creating another entry](https://www.investors.com/research/google-stock-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-chipotle-delta-air-lines-united-airlines/) at 2,139.88. Meanwhile, the stock is also pulling back to its 10-week line. A decisive rebound from that level would also create a buying opportunity.


Dexcom moved further into buy range past a flat base's 126.44 buy point, with a 3.1% advance Thursday. The 5% buy area goes up 132.76. Since 1999, [Dexcom has been developing](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/dexcom-stock-shines-pokes-at-buy-zone-with-spotlight-on-super-bowl-chip-stocks-and-nick-jonas/) innovative diabetes products.


[Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/hyatt-hotels-ibd-stock-of-the-day-sets-up-on-travel-recovery/), Hyatt Hotels, continues to build a cup with handle with a 122 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares finished Thursday about 7% away from their entry, after the session's sharp decline.


Cruise lines and airlines are running higher as travel demand recovers and consumers get ready for summer vacations. **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)) broke out past a cup base's 12.62 entry last week, while **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) [broke out](https://www.investors.com/research/google-stock-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-chipotle-delta-air-lines-united-airlines/) to new highs Tuesday. **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) is near a new buy point, while [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock and Dow Jones aerospace giant **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) is trying to break out past a flat base's 221.33 entry.

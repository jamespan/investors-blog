The stock market made a muffled rebound on Wednesday. It came a day after Middle East tensions cranked higher following Iran's barrage of 180 missiles at Israel, an attack that led to little damage. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged a response.




None of the major equity indexes waged a gain of 0.1% or more. The Nasdaq composite rose almost 15 points, or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 inched up 0.79 point. Small caps dipped ever so slightly; the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund edged down 0.30 point. Finally, the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average rose all of 39 points, even though at least seven of its 30 components rose 1 point or more.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq exchange, inched about 0.1% ahead. Yet the index reversed nicely after falling nearly 0.7% in early trading. The rebound followed a 1.4% shellacking on Tuesday.


A [MarketSurge daily chart](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) shows the Nasdaq 100 — as well as its tracking ETF, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) — finding support at the rising 21-day exponential moving average. QQQ retook its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Sept. 11.


The tiny moves by the stock market benchmarks telegraphed a wait-and-see mode for equity trading desks. And it's easy to understand why.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP100224-250x300.jpg)For starters, a [U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for September](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) arrives early Friday. Wednesday's ADP private-sector jobs data did not produce much reaction in the stock market. Yet for some observers, the data created more uncertainty.


Watch Friday's Payrolls
-----------------------


Peter Berezin, chief strategist at BCA Research, pointed out that the September figures — 143,000 net growth vs. an Econoday forecast of 121,500 — "bode well for the economy," in a note sent to clients. "And if they are confirmed by Friday's jobs report, I will probably ratchet down my 12-month recession probability (currently 70%)."


Yet Berezin also highlighted that ADP payrolls fell 260,000 on a seasonally unadjusted basis, "the worst showing for any September since the series began in 2010." Why was this a head-scratcher for Berezin? He added the average change in September from 2010 to 2019 was a much milder 38,000 in net private-sector jobs lost.

Interestingly, investor sentiment has soured in some quarters even though the major averages have mostly posted solid gains in the past several months.


For instance, the bullish ratio in the weekly Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers has rebounded to 55.4% in the latest week, up from a year-to-date low of 43.5% in mid-September. However, the current level is still slightly below the 56.9% reading seen in the start of the year. And as of Wednesday, the Nasdaq has gained 19.4% year to date. The S&P 500 has rallied 19.7%, while the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) index has marched ahead 12.8%.


Demure Stock Market Trading
---------------------------


Volume fell mildly on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange vs. Tuesday.


What actually moved more actively on Wednesday?


The Dow Jones transportation average fell 0.8% following the second day of thousands of members of the International Longshoremen union walking out on the job at dozens of U.S. ports. The union is campaigning for a big wage hike as well as limits by management to add automation that could cut operating costs.


The Dow Jones transports have made virtually no progress since hitting a multiyear high of 16,717 back in July of 2023.


Going back to the broader stock market, breadth was slightly negative, offering a touch of divergence with the microscopic gains seen in the indexes.


Early data showed 1,985 stocks advancing on the Nasdaq, while 2,164 issues declined. On the NYSE, losers beat winners by roughly 200 stocks.


Food Stock Thumped
------------------


Nonetheless, investors decided to load up on tech stocks and select banking names. Looking at the daily action of [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), fiber-optic telecom, chip equipment, fabless semiconductors and computer hardware led the upside. These groups — as well as semiconductor manufacturing, foreign banks, security software and heavy construction — all advanced 1% or more.


In contrast, investors jettisoned some defensive stocks.


Packaged-food titan **Conagra** ([CAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAG)) dived 8% on an earnings warning from management. Shares gapped down and almost closed beneath the 200-day moving average.


Conagra, which lost all gains from a breakout point at 30.66 in a very shallow [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/), shows declining earnings and sales for four quarters in a row. It holds a stale [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 57 on a scale of 1 to 99.

The dull moves overall in U.S. stocks lately haven't stopped traders from rushing back into Chinese equities.


China ETFs have had a very toasty October ever since the government announced a series of interest-rate cuts late last month to boost homeownership and consumer activity.


**PDD** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), which has had huge success in China with its app-based e-commerce websites as well as the Temu shopping app outside China, rallied nearly 5% in heavy turnover. At the session high of 155, PDD also crossed an early [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 152.22 within its unusual-looking base that features a 29% plunge on Aug. 26 following second-quarter results.


Needless to say, the base does not fit the mold of an [outstanding double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/).


Beyond The Stock Market: India And China
----------------------------------------


Wilbur Ross, former U.S. Commerce Secretary in the Trump administration and author of a new autobiography, "Risks And Returns: Creating Success In Business and Life," notes that China faces very difficult odds in maintaining a solid pace of economic growth.


The veteran financier believes China stands to lose in a future in which the world steps further away from the globalization of trade. In the past, companies capitalized on lower manufacturing costs in building and assembling products across different countries.


But companies have found this outsourcing strategy also carries the risk of building excessive inventories as well as  a failure to maintain a high degree of quality. In recent years, "reshoring" and "near-shoring" have become serious buzzwords in the business and economic spheres.


"We're clearly moving away from an era of free trade and globalization," Ross told IBD in a phone interview. Ross, who had numerous dealings with Chinese government officials, calculates China has gained a net $10 trillion in combined international trade surpluses and net foreign direct investment into the country since its admission into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. As both of these economic inputs decrease for China, "it's going to be a problem."

Demographics Gloom, Less Consumer Boom
--------------------------------------


Ross adds that China's negative population trends, caused by a now-scuttled one-child family policy, combined with a very high savings rate, limit the potential for the Middle Kingdom to achieve the government's stated goal of growing GDP by 5% annually. A less-developed pension and health care system in China both force Chinese middle-class workers to limit their consumption.


In contrast, Ross sees big potential in India. The country suffers from a heavy-handed bureaucracy. Labor rules that are much stricter for enterprises with 100 or more employees vs. smaller operations hamper the competitiveness of Indian companies, according to Ross. India also needs to do more to build out its infrastructure to allow further growth. But Ross believes newly reelected Prime Minister Mahendra Modi is "clearly making moves that are constructive for India" to make Indian enterprises more competitive in the global arena. "India has a shot at not only maintaining economic growth of 7% but to even top that rate."


"China has done a very good job with developing its high-speed trains and electrical power infrastructure. India has a quite a bit of catching up to do," Ross added. Yet he sees two phases that could evolve in the rivalry between the two economic powers.


First, India does a lot more to develop its infrastructure to support a growing economy. Second, India becomes a direct threat to China in exports. India's highly skilled technology workers, business management expertise and lower wages overall all pose as competitive advantages.

India Stocks Today
------------------


The iShares MSCI India ETF ([INDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INDA)) has cooled off in recent days. But at 58.01, the exchange traded fund keeps a solid gain of 18.9% year to date.


The ETF traded at 25.40 at the start of October 2012. A total gain of 128% sounds nice, but the compounded annual growth rate of 7.1% is surely less glamorous.


**HDFC** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)), the largest Indian lender on the U.S. exchanges, sank 0.1% for a fifth straight drop. HDFC had been building a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) since it peaked at 67.16 on July 2. But the stock fell short of a true breakout to 52-week highs.


**MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)), a big winner since its August 2023 breakout, is down 6.5% so far in September.


Going back to China, the iShares Large Cap China ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) gapped up 6% to 35.19. Volume vaulted 364% above the fund's 50-day average. Its year-to-date gain has improved to nearly 47%.


Yet since October 2012, the fund has climbed a trifling 2.6%.

title: Stock Market Dives After Fed Serves Up This Inflation Shock; These Groups Show Mettle

The stock market took a sharp dive after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting on interest-rate policy showed a more hawkish approach amid rising inflation. Strength was hard to come by, with tech stocks in particular being punished. However, the steel producers provided a rare silver lining on a day of pain.




The Nasdaq composite had already been enduring a day of struggle before the news hit markets. It closed at session lows, down 3.3%. It was the worst day for the Nasdaq since the tech-weighted index tanked 3.5% on Feb. 25, 2021.


One meager crumb of comfort was the fact that volume on the Nasdaq edged nearly 2% lower vs. the prior session. Nevertheless, the index crashed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The broad pressure saw the market outlook shift to "uptrend under pressure."


At this point, making new buys in any stocks warrants extra caution. Cutting losses in leading stocks that are suddenly showing unusual weakness is also smart portfolio management.

A [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) was added to this large-cap index due to higher NYSE volume, preliminary data showed.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also saw its short two-day winning streak come to an end after it closed down 1.1%.


Action among the S&P 500 [sectors underlined the broad losses.](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) Real estate, a defensive area, and technology, a haven for growth investors, were the worst performing areas.


A key gauge to watch for now is the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility). The VIX rose 18% Wednesday as the market absorbed the shock. (You can also view [the VIX on MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) by using the symbol 0VIX (that's a zero).


Bears Maul Growth Stocks
------------------------


Growth stocks were particularly hard hit, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund falling 4.7% in accelerating turnover.


The IBD 50 index was a sea of red amid the bearish action. **Smart Global** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)) suffered most with a drop of 15.4% in mammoth volume.



**Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)) was also crushed. It dropped 10.7% in heavy trade.


Small caps offered no refuge, with the Russell 2000 plunging 3.3%.


Fed Minutes Hit Stock Market
----------------------------


The Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes, released at 2 p.m. ET, offered the major catalyst for indexes to fall. They showed a possible rate increase in March and earlier timetable for the central bank shrinking its $8.76 trillion bond portfolio.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya told IBD the Fed was "a lot more hawkish" than he expected. He said it showed the central bank is "very nervous over high inflation," leading to earlier rate hikes and a more aggressive pace of balance-sheet contraction.


"The Minutes surprised on two fronts," he said. "The Fed will move forward with faster rate hikes despite a longer labor market recovery and they showed a lot of their cards on how they will initiate the balance sheet runoff."


The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield rose by just over three basis points to 1.7%. The yield on the two-year note rose 6 basis points to 0.83%.

Tech Stocks Hit Hard Amid Broad Losses
--------------------------------------


While stocks were broadly lower, tech stocks in particular were given a pasting.



High-multiple growth names such as **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) were hit hard. The Warren Buffett stock ended the day down 5.9%.


EV giant **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) surrendered 5.4%. **Rivian Automotive** ([RIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIVN)) fared even worse, falling more than 11%. Shares in the EV new issue came within 3 cents of matching its all-time closing low.


In addition, established tech giants were also battered lower. Leaderboard plays **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) dropped 3% to 4% each. **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) also fell, dipping 1.9% and 2.7% respectively.


With high multiple growth stocks suffering, now could be a time for value plays to shine in the stock market.


Steel Shows Mettle In Stock Market
----------------------------------


It is important to keep abreast of the best performing industry groups on a given day.



On Wednesday, steel producers, media periodical companies and metal product distributors were the stars of the day.


Underlining the strength in steel, **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) was added to the [Leaderboard list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) of top growth firms in the stock market earlier in the day. It was added as it surged above a cup with handle buy point of 122.16.


NUE closed the day up 4.8% in high volume, though at session highs it actually managed to become extended above the 5% buy zone.


On the flip side, solar energy, consumer electronics retailer and education and media computer software stocks were the worst hit. Fabless chip stocks were also battered.

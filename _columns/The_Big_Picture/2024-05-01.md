The stock market finished mixed on Wednesday. Small caps made a small push higher after the Federal Reserve decided to unwind the debt securities on its balance sheet at a slower pace. But overall stocks' late-hour drop disappointed.




At around 3:05 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite romped more than 1.7% higher to as high as 15,926. This juicy gain came after the U.S. central bank decided to leave short-term interest rates unchanged.


Virtually no one expected the Fed to cut the fed funds rate lower than its current range of 5.25%-5.5%. Even before the two-day policy meeting started, the prospects of an initial reduction in the cost of money had already become slim for every single future meeting through September.


Surprises By The Central Bank
-----------------------------


In its statement, the Fed announced that it would [trim the runoff of maturing U.S. Treasury securities](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-may-jerome-powell-qt-rate-cuts/) from $60 billion each month to $25 billion. Sure, the bank's holdings of U.S. government debt remain high. But it's certainly come down from $8.96 trillion seen in March 2022. (According to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, that amount has fallen to $7.4 trillion.) The Fed kept the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at $35 billion per month.


This news encouraged bond investors. The yield on the key 10-year Treasury bond dropped nine basis points to 4.59%, undercutting the 4.6% level for the first time since April 23. At the start of the second quarter, the 10-year note offered a yield of 4.20%.


"In recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the committee's 2% inflation objective," the Fed's committee on interest rate policy stated in its news release. That served as a strong hint that monetary leaders want to see more evidence that inflation is in fact still trending lower before setting short-term rates lower.


However, during the nearly 40-minute news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell talked down any concerns of stagflation. He stressed that a move to possibly pivot back to a period of raising rates again to get inflation down to the bank's desired 2% level is highly unlikely.


"Inflation surprises have dampened only some of Powell's spirit," Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, told IBD via email. "The Fed cannot pretend that recent inflation surprises are simply blips in the data run. Yet Powell retains some confidence that inflation will decline from here, albeit lessened over recent months, suggesting that it's a fairly high bar for rate hikes."


Still, midafternoon gains vaporized quickly.


Stock Market Today
------------------



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP050124--206x300.jpg)In the final hour of trade, the Nasdaq composite backtracked to a modest loss of 0.3%. The S&P 500, which closed lower by the same amount, had let a 1.2% gain slip right through its fingers.


The Nasdaq 100, representing the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, fell 0.7%.


Notice how Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), the Nasdaq 100 tracker, finished a 13th session in a row beneath the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


That's the longest time spent below the 50-day line since a 17-day period from Sept. 15 to Oct. nine last year, when QQQ was in the midst of a second wave down in a correction that started in mid-July.


A healthy stock market shows major indexes trading above their 50-day moving averages, not below. Hence, it's sensible to keep exposure on the much lighter side.


The Nasdaq composite also closed Wednesday with its 13th straight session below a flattened-out 50-day line. Meanwhile, a 0.2% gain by the Dow Jones Industrial Average hardly evoked an image of investors going bullish in the stock market. Finishing at 37,903, the 30-stock Dow notched its 17th day in a row under its own 50-day line.


The Russell 2000 edged up 0.3%. Yet it had an intraday gain of as much as 2.2%. Wednesday's best performing index? Surely, the Dow Jones utility average is a candidate, rising 1.2% to 903.59. It marked the highest close since Jan. 8. However, its gains in 2024 remain muted, up just 2.5%. In contrast, at 5018.39, the S&P 500 holds a 5.2% advance year to date.


This Asset Class Slumped Big Time
---------------------------------


Less attention got paid, it seemed, to the sharp pullback in energy assets.


Crude oil futures got whacked. The near-term expiring crude oil contract sank 3.4% to $79.13 a barrel.


Oil is on the verge of its third drop in four weeks. "Black gold" has now fallen 9.7% from an early April peak of $87.67. Elsewhere, natural gas futures got drilled for a 3% loss to $1.93 per million BTUs. And gasoline futures slumped 11.6 cents, or 4.3%, to $2.57 per gallon.


Related stocks have likely proved a disappointment for readers who are bullish in related stocks. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) sank at least 1% for a second straight session. At 159.63, it's fallen mildly below a 163.87 buy point in a nearly seven-month [saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/).


Winners In Today's Stock Market
-------------------------------


Some stocks did very well.


**Carpenter Technology** ([CRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRS)) bolted into the 20%-25% profit zone during morning action, then accelerated its advance. At the session high of 100, the specialty metals supplier has now achieved a 35% gain since breaking out of a long base at 74.06.


Not only is Carpenter a stock market leader, but so is its industry group. Steel and specialty alloys ranks 20th among 197 industries for six-month performance, according to [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).



**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) launched 21% higher in the heaviest turnover in two months. Shares rose to 40.48, just shy of the left-side peak of a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Notice on a daily chart how the social media site for DIY projects and arts and crafts made a stunning reversal off its 200-day line last week. The company reported a 150% boost in Q1 profit to 20 cents a share as revenue accelerated 23% to $740 million.


In the past three quarters, Pinterest's top line rose 6%, 11% and 12%.


However, **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) continued to weaken after posting a sell signal for recent buyers. Shares fell 2% in heavy trading. The credit and debit card payments processor slid below its 50-day line on April 11 and has failed to recover.

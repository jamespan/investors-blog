Stocks Erase All Of Early Gains, End With Small Losses
=======================================================

Stocks started on a strong note Thursday but erased gains and ended in the red.

  

The Nasdaq trimmed 0.2%, while the S&P 500 fell less than 0.2%. The IBD 50 skidded 0.8%.

  

Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq.

  

The action wasn't particularly alarming, but the indexes haven't accomplished much in recent sessions. The S&P 500 is finding resistance at the 2000 area, while the Nasdaq also is having trouble making price progress. Thursday was the second straight day of negative reversals in the indexes.

  

For individual investors, the situation is challenging.

  

Although the market is in a confirmed uptrend, easy money isn't part of the mix. Most breakouts have had trouble gaining traction after the initial surge.

  

Some of the more aggressive issues — such as new issues **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) — are trading erratically.

  

Other stocks cross buy points and then reverse to close under the entry.

  

Exceptions can be found. **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) has marched steadily upward since early July. **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) has been advancing since bouncing off its 50-day moving average in mid-July.

  

Other stocks, such as **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), have gapped up and moved sideways since.

  

Unless you caught a gap up or snared Tesla or Gilead early, you're probably forced to keep your stocks on a short leash.

  

That means, for example, cashing in significant winners that threaten to cycle into losers.

  

For example, **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is now only 6% above a 76.20 buy point after being up 24%.

  

The breakout was a gap up, which made an entry at 76.20 impossible. For those who bought the gap up, the position is probably negative or close to it by now.

  

Economic news was generally helpful Thursday, but bulls couldn't do much with it.

  

The big news came from Europe. The European Central Bank cut interest rates and announced a stimulus program set for an October start.

  

Meanwhile, the Purchasing Managers Index and the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing indexes were stronger than expected. First-time jobless claims were a bit worse than estimates.

  

On Friday, August payrolls data and the unemployment rate will be released before the open.

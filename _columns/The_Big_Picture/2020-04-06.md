  Stocks Surge As Indexes Make Multiple Positive Signals; Market Still Short On One Ingredient

With a confident move Monday, the stock market's new uptrend now finds itself on better footing. But one ingredient for the new market uptrend is still scarce: stocks reaching [buy areas](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




The Nasdaq composite leapt 7.3% in higher volume, a combination that served to confirm the composite's 11-day-old rally. That's a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) for the Nasdaq, and comes on the heels of another one in the S&P 500 last week. A higher-volume rally on Thursday in the S&P 500 changed IBD's market outlook to "confirmed uptrend."


Monday's rally, in fact, can be termed a second follow-through for the S&P 500. With the Nasdaq now making its own bottoming signal, the market stands on a thicker layer of ice.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose above their late-March highs, another good indication. Both closed at or above their 21-day exponential moving averages, and both also cleared last week's highs, when downward reversals spoiled a rebound. The next important milestone? Look for indexes to make lows above their 21-day exponential averages. (Those averages can be customized to arithmetic or exponential with IBD's [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).)

It's best to make only test purchases and sell immediately if there is a sell signal — such as [cutting losses at 8% or less](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Only a few top-rated stocks are rising to new highs and two of them — **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) and **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) — ran into trouble. DocuSign surged on Monday, but last week's breakout failed. Zoom erased nearly all of a 53.5% surge from its 107.44 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Credit Suisse downgraded Zoom as [security questions plague the videoconferencing product](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zoom-video-stock-falls-school-ban-microsoft-teams/). The stock, however, is bouncing off its 50-day moving average.


**Vertex** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) broke out Monday past the 249.95 entry of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), and became one of the few institutional-quality stocks in a buy area.


With breakouts in short supply so far, index investing is an option. For example, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) was added to [IBD Swing Trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) Monday, and ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ([UPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPRO)) re-entered [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


Keep check the IBD 50, [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) and other IBD screens for ideas. On Spotlight, **Houlihan Lokey** ([HLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLI)), **Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) are shaping interesting charts.


Indexes are charting their way out of the bear market, but the charts that matter most right now are the one plotting the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/). The [U.S. death toll from Covid-19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-10-000-11586166530?mod=hp_lead_pos2) topped 10,000 Monday.


Positive Signs Add Up For Stock Market
--------------------------------------


But there were some positive signs, which helped Wall Street rally. The rate of new U.S. cases appears to be stabilizing. A [University of Washington model](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/with-hospitals-stressed-u-s-enters-peak-death-week-in-coronavirus-crisis-idUSKBN21O1NL?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29) now estimates U.S. deaths at 81,766 by Aug. 4, a reduction of about 12,000 from the projection made last weekend.


The S&P 500 rallied 7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 7.7%. Indexes closed almost at session highs. Volume rose on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


Gains were broad Monday, with every S&P sector participating. Advancing stocks led decliners by nearly a 10-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by better than 5-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Small caps had an even better day after the Russell 2000 soared 8.2%. The index topped the March 24 high but remains 33% below its all-time high. Although it acted like a follow-through that day, the follow-through is a market signal reserved for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index vaulted 10.4%, one of the best sector performances. Even utilities got into the act, with Utilities Select Sector SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) leaping 7.7%.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 5.8%. Eight stocks, mainly in software and semiconductors, climbed 10% or more.

Blue chips got dinged, while the broader market took a step back in Tuesday's regular session. **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) (down 7%) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) (down almost 6%) helped send the Dow Jones industrials slumping 1%, breaking below the 18,000 level and its 50-day moving average. Both names are among the highest-priced stocks in the price-weighted index. Moves in the higher-priced issues will have a bigger impact on the index.

  

Early Tuesday, United Technologies reported Q2 sales that missed views and lowered its full-year outlook. Big Blue posted disappointing revenue late Monday.

  

Another Dow stock, **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) also delivered disappointing top-line results. But it's one of the lower-priced issues in the Dow.

  

The broader S&P 500 lost 0.4%. That wiped out gains from the past two sessions and then some.

  

The Nasdaq edged down 0.2% after hitting a new high Monday. It basically erased Monday's move. The Nasdaq 100, which excludes financials, slipped 0.1% to end an eight-session run.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.4% for its third straight loss.

  

Volume ended mixed Tuesday. Trade fell for a second day on Nasdaq, but rose on NYSE. Tuesday's loss of more than 0.2% in higher volume gave the S&P 500 a distribution day, which signals heavy selling by professionals. But the June 15 distribution day on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell off due to time.

  

Distribution days can come off the count once 25 trading days have passed. They can also drop off if an index rises 6% from the close of the distribution day.

  

Losers beat winners by about 3-to-2 on the NYSE and more than 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq. New 52-week lows outpaced new highs, which is not a good sign (see B2). Granted, the market finished lower Tuesday. But in a healthy market, the number of new highs should outnumber new lows.

  

On a brighter note, few leading stocks sold off in heavy volume. **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)), **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)), **AMC Networks** ([AMCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMCX)) and **Spirit AeroSystems** ([SPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPR)) were the ones that fell 2% or more in above-average trade. The IBD 50 lost 0.2%.

  

On the upside, **Total System Services** ([TSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSS)), No. 35 in Monday's IBD 50, added 1% for its ninth straight gain. The stock found support at its 50-day line earlier this month.

  

In the absence of economic reports, corporate earnings were the main focus Tuesday. While many companies posted quarterly results before the open, a number of big caps also released results after the close.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) posted quarterly results above views, but gave disappointing guidance for the current quarter. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) served up sales that missed expectations.

  

Wearable camera maker **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)), software giant **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and Internet search firm **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) also delivered quarterly results after the close.

  

Most of these names were lower in extended trading, which may make for a weak start Wednesday.

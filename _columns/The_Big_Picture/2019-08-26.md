  Stocks Bounce On Latest Trade War Headlines; Resistance, Volatility Mar Progress

Indexes rebounded moderately from Friday's rout, raising the possibility that the stock market may come back from yet another plunge in the volatile month of August.




The Nasdaq rose 1.3%, making up about a third of Friday's 3% plunge. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.1%. Small caps kept pace with the major indexes, as the Russell 2000 picked up 1.1% as well.


While Friday's sell-off dwarfed Monday's gains in magnitude of price change, a gain is still a gain. And the market has shown a tendency this month to recover quickly from jarring hits like the one Friday.


After sell-offs of 3.5% and 3% Aug. 5 and Aug. 14, the Nasdaq took only a few days to erase most or all the losses. If the market is coming back for a third time, it's off to a good start. Indexes closed Monday at session highs thanks to a flurry of buying in the final 10 minutes of trading.

So, despite fast changes of direction, the market is technically holding up. However, the market does look burdened in some regards.


Indexes still are below their 50-day moving averages, where resistance emerged in August. The Nasdaq advance-decline line is at a late-January low. In July, the line started to ease even as the Nasdaq was still climbing.


August so far is the most volatile month of 2019. The average price spread of the Nasdaq this month is 1.6%. That's vastly more volatile than the average 1.1% in the first seven months of the year.


Volatility is indicative of uncertainty, and that's the market's bane. Wall Street remains sensitive to headlines, particularly those on the U.S.-China trade war. A rapid escalation of the conflict caused severe losses in the stock market Friday.


On Monday, investors focused on President Donald Trump's comments that [China called for renewed trade talks](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-china-trade-deal-hope-expires-sept-1-dow-jones/). Questions arose on whether Chinese officials actually called Trump, but the needle moved in the direction of improvement — at least for a day.


Stock Market Watches Tariff Dispute
-----------------------------------


Tariffs of 15% on some Chinese imports are set to take effect Sept. 1, so some movement is possible this week. The president also backed away from the combative rhetoric he displayed Friday.


Volume tends to drop off in summer months, but the Nasdaq already posted above-average volume in 11 of 19 sessions this month. Volume fell Monday from a heavy pace on Friday.


The put-call volume ratio closed at 1.2 Friday. That's an elevated level of skepticism among investors, but one that often marks stock market lows. Certainly, this is not a super-reliable indicator: The put-call ratio hit similar signals twice already in August, but those turned out to be only short-term lows.


The IBD 50 rose 1.4%, besting the major indexes. Of 50 stocks, 19 rose more than the Nasdaq. Yet, there were few [stocks up in above-average volume](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=up).


**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) climbed past the 95.69 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in heavy volume. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) [agreed to buy Otezla](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-dips-deal-buy-celgene-drug-otezla/), a psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treatment, from Celgene. The deal is valued at $13.4 billion. Amgen rose more than 3%.

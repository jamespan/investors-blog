Stocks rebounded mildly Tuesday in lighter trade. The market's defensiveness, meanwhile, grew more evident as a few blue-chip firms with histories going back as far as 130 years showed some rare stock muscle.

  

The Nasdaq composite edged less than 0.2% higher. That's a fraction of the 1% and 1.2% drops it suffered the prior two sessions.

  

While only the 1% decline on Friday qualified as a distribution day, it's clear that the propensity among institutional money managers to sell is stronger than to buy.

  

The last time the Nasdaq posted two consecutive 1%-plus declines in higher or above-average turnover came on Jan. 24-27. Two days later, on Jan. 29, the Market Pulse outlook switched to "Market in correction." The index later tested its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 24, 2013.

  

Today, the leading index remains just 3% below its recent peak of 4371.71. But a heavy load of distribution days and severe drops seen among leading stocks in the biotech, ethical drug, Internet and business software sectors justify the Market Pulse's current outlook of "Uptrend under pressure."

  

The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, recouping almost all of Monday's 0.5% decline.

  

Leading the upside was a motley collection of defensive and cyclical stocks. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, Food-Miscellaneous Preparation, Mining-Metal Ores, Transport-Airline, Paper & Paper Products and Retail-Drug Stores were among those that rallied 1.5% or more for the day.

  

Tuesday's real market star? The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.6%, triple the Nasdaq's gain. As seen on the daily chart on this page, the bastion of large- and mega-cap names is still lagging the Nasdaq in year-to-date performance, and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is still wretched. Yet four of the Dow components shined Tuesday, hinting at a desire among investors to park some cash in some giants with decent dividends and steady cash flow.

  

The average gain Tuesday by **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) (read more in today's International Leaders column on Page B14), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) (started in 1911), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) (started in 1887; breakout past 95.48 to a new high), **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) (1984) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) (1891) was 2.8%.

  

Big Blue is still a severely wounded stock after dropping 20% from a 52-week high of 215.90. Yet trading in Big Blue jumped 106% above its 50-day average Tuesday.

  

Those who seek true outperformance among companies with market caps north of $15 billion can view the Big Cap 20 in Tuesday's IBD on Page A11.

  

The IBD 50 fell 0.6%. The list of premier growth stocks is clearly taking a break. As the Inside the IBD 50 column on Page B3 notes, few names are beating the general market lately.

  Meme Stocks Dominate Action, Midcaps Cool; Are These Growth Stocks The New Leaders?

Wednesday turned out to be a session of at least three Ms.




Gains by the major indexes? Mild. The one area that stood out? Midcaps, which fell moderately. And finally, practically the entire investing world has now heard of the term "meme stocks." Just look at Wednesday's gains by **[AMC Entertainment](https://www.investors.com/research/amc-entertainment-stock-buy-now/)** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)), **[GameStop](https://www.investors.com/research/gamestop-gme-stock-buy-now/)** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)) and other stocks [heavily sold short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-short-interest/).


Yet while stock pickers could revel in the elevated volatility in select stocks, index investors may have gotten sleepy during Wednesday's session.


Beyond The Meme Stocks
----------------------


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF all lassoed gains of barely 0.1%. The day's trading range was so narrow that their daily charts make you want to squint. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) squandered a fractional opening gain to finish the day down nearly 0.6%.


![MP060221](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP060221-225x300.jpg)Volume rose on both exchanges. Yet keep in mind that AMC alone accounted for at least 236 million shares of the day's increase of 806 million shares on the NYSE.


The decline by midcaps hardly changed the general market picture.


At 4208, the S&P 500 has made zero progress for at least three weeks. Clearly, equity trading desks are not buying stocks with abandon. They're watching and waiting. Congress and the White House still seek a compromise on infrastructure spending and the next federal budget.


Recent economic data point to a solid manufacturing picture. But will inflation pick up even more?


Plus, one has to consider that the S&P 500 has rallied more than 93% from its March 2020 coronavirus crash lows. Digestion of that massive gain could take longer.


Fortunately for the stock bulls, interest rates have remained steady. Cboe data showed the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield falling 2 basis points to 1.59%.


Also on the positive side, the Nasdaq saw its [running count of distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) shrink to three. The mild decline of 0.3% in higher volume on April 27 expired because 25 sessions have passed. That leaves the tech-enriched index with a manageable level of distribution, or bouts of pronounced institutional profit-taking. It could take a while, however, for the May 4, May 10 and May 18 [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to be shown the door.



Given how the market has been rising lately with the velocity of a sloth, IBD readers may find it ironic how AMC gained more than 126% in a single session. Yet under the market's hood, stocks in the energy and consumer sectors also enjoyed strong buying.

New Stock Market Leaders Keep Emerging
--------------------------------------


The day's top performer, department stores, rallied more than 10% on a price-weighted basis. A [MarketSmith chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) shows the industry group now holds a 29% gain since April 1. That tramples over a 5.9% gain by the S&P 500 over the same time frame.



Amid a 1.5% rise by U.S. crude oil futures to over $68 a barrel, drilling, field services and refining stocks strengthened.


Oil and gas explorer **Magnolia Oil & Gas** ([MGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGY)) followed through on its breakout. A 6.5% gainer Tuesday, the small cap rose another 4.6%. At the day's high of 14.50, Houston-based Magnolia Oil stood 7.8% above its new entry point at 13.45.


The firm's sales grew 14% in the first quarter to $207.7 million, ending a six-quarter slump. Earnings have heated up the past three quarters, totaling 59 cents a share over that nine-month period vs. a cumulative net loss of a penny from Q3 2019 to Q1 of 2020.


Commodity plays showed mixed fortunes on Wednesday. The U.S. Copper Index Fund ([CPER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPER)) slid nearly 1.5% and has tripped nearly 2% for the week. The latest breakout attempt out of an amorphous base at 83.25 by **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) fell flat. But **Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) has held up nicely. **Olympic Steel** ([ZEUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEUS)) sliced below a 36.88 entry in a [rare ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/).


Other breakouts outside the metals plays are holding up.


Nasdaq-listed data storage software expert **Commvault** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) is dancing on the outer edges of its [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) following a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) at 72.43. **Yum China** ([YUMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUMC)), highlighted in the "Recent Breakouts" screen in [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), rallied for a seventh straight session and for the 13th time in 14 trading days. The restaurant chain's move past a 64.74 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is also making progress.

Imagine you had no access to cellphone, radio, TV or any friends or family members who watch the news. Then you fired up a daily chart of the Nasdaq to see what it did Wednesday.




You might have felt disappointed to see the Nasdaq composite index surrender a decent gain — as much as 0.7% at one point — and end with a 0.6% loss in heavier turnover vs. the prior session. The price-and-volume action notched a [new distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the premier index of growth stocks.


Now, suppose you just found out that supporters of President Donald Trump had stormed the Capitol building, forcing members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence to evacuate. They also delayed the official approval of President-elect Joe Biden's election victory, and committed acts of violence.


Amid the chaos that forced the Virginia governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, one could have expected the market to sell off a lot harder than what the Nasdaq did.

![MP010621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP010621-156x300.jpg)Instead, Wednesday marked a pivotal session for serious observers hunting for new investing opportunities.


Hundreds of miles north of Washington, D.C., a throng of issues in construction, banking, commodities and other cyclical sectors took over the action on Wall Street.


The Mighty Mites Are Back
-------------------------


A crowd of small banks broke out of [early-stage bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) and helped the Russell 2000 lead the market's upside yet again. **Southside Bancshares** ([SBSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBSI)) (clearing a 32.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a [massive cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/)), **HomeStreet** ([HMST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HMST)) (35.62 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)) and **Community Bank System** ([CBU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBU)) (67.44) are just three examples.


Keep in mind that many regional lenders mostly show very thin liquidity. It's smart portfolio management to avoid making positions that exceed 3% of a stock's average daily dollar volume.


Even after Wednesday's 10.7% catapult higher to 37.46 in volume that surged 161% above the stock's 50-day average, HomeStreet heads into Thursday's session with an average daily dollar turnover of only $4.5 million.


Meanwhile, [in IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), the new highs list details specific stocks that made 52-week or all-time highs.


Among bigger financial firms, **Truist** ([TFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TFC)), **UBS** ([UBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBS)) and **Jefferies** ([JEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JEF)) also showed good breakouts.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund gapped up at the open and finished 4.1% higher for the day. At 204.59, the ETF is still adding to a historic 30.9% gain in the fourth quarter of 2020.


Midcap stocks almost matched the Russell 2000 ETF's powerful move. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) roasted any lingering market bears, rising almost 4%. The S&P 500 gained 0.6% and notched an all-time high of 3783.


NYSE volume rose sharply.


Beyond Nasdaq
-------------


Big gains by banking and industrial members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average helped boost the blue chip index up 1.4%. A [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/) on Nov. 4 remains in force.


This means stock pickers should buy [solid breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) by stocks that have formed [excellent bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-stock-charts-roku-bullish-element-symmetry/).


Please see a weekly chart of the SPDR Dow Jones ETF ([DIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIA)), and you'll spot a [bullish rebound off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/add-trading-playbook-rebound-10-week-line/) in play.


The S&P 500 saw its Nov. 30 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) expire due to time. Meanwhile, the Dec. 18 distribution deserves an asterisk next to it, since that day saw turnover get a big boost from expiration of stock futures and options as well as equity index futures and options. The sell-off on Monday stands as the most notable distribution day, no doubt.


The Art Of Spotting Turnarounds
-------------------------------


A surprise victory by the Democrats of two Georgia seats in the U.S. Senate helped the stampede into those sectors that have been whacked by the coronavirus. [On Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), panelists discussed new breakouts within industries such as oil and gas and agricultural chemicals.


If you've made a habit of buying only stocks whose IBD [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) shows an 80 or higher, then you'll likely see few or no stocks that have the chance to become big turnaround winners.



**Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) is a good example. The specialty chemicals behemoth sported a beautiful breakout in the week ended Nov. 6. Shares rallied more than 20% that week and skated past a 101.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a [six-week consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). Albemarle has since rocketed 73%.


Thanks in large part to its big swing higher, the stock's [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) has sharply improved. But at 89, it still falls a bit short of the typical 90, 95 or 99 rating seen among the typical CAN SLIM leader at the start of a big run.


[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-albemarle-corp-alb.aspx), Albemarle's industry group ranks nicely at B+ on a scale of A to E.


Albemarle's profits sank 29% in the third quarter vs. a year ago to $1.09 a share on a 15% dip in sales to $747 million. For now, the Street sees only a 5% rebound in EPS to $4.11 in 2021.


Hold Or Sell
------------


In the meantime, investors in glittering growth stocks that frequent lists such as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) can adopt strict sell rules consistently in order preserve profits and raise cash for new buys.



If you haven't held a new leader for very long, [refuse to completely forfeit a gain](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/) that reaches 10% to 15% and then suddenly gets squeezed. Has the profit hit 18%, 20%, 25%? Consider [nailing down at least partial profits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-growth-stocks-sell-rule-magic-small-cap-leader/).


It's also wise to see how your latest buys act during retreats to the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). After breaking out forcefully, true leading names often test this support level, catch their breath, then resume their climbs. Within the IBD 50 and other key lists, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Cadence Design** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) stand out in this way.


All of the above growth stocks posted market-beating gains following breakouts last year.


Other Markets Are Moving
------------------------


Crude oil has roared back to life following news that OPEC and Russia have agreed to cut production at least through the end of March. The United States Oil Fund ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)) is up 3.3% for the week and aiming for a ninth up week in the past 10.


West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures banged past the $51 level on Wednesday, now up 5.5% since Jan. 1.


The [IBD industry group rankings](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jan-05-2021/) headed into Wednesday's trading have definitely chronicled a changing of the guard. Three of the top 15 industry groups belong to the oil and gas sector. Only three weeks ago, the 11th-ranked drillers ranked 109th in terms of six-month relative price performance.


The sell-off in long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds sent yields to the highest levels since March.


Yield Breaching 1%
------------------


The benchmark 10-year bond saw its yield soar to as high as 1.05%. That's still well below the 1.88% level seen at the beginning of 2020. But yields have now doubled from the August lows.


The steepening of the yield curve is a boon for lenders that depend on the margin between what they pay to borrow money from the Federal Reserve and what they charge for a variety of loans, be it mortgages, commercial real estate, business or auto loans.


The 3-month T-bill ended Wednesday flat at 0.09%.


Meanwhile, bullishness among market pundits polled each week by Investors Intelligence faded to a still-elevated 60.2% from 62.4% the prior week. The ratio of newsletter writers and editors forecasting a bear market edged up to a pale 17.5% from 16.8%.

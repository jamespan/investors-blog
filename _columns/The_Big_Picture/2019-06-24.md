Indexes Ease, And Why The Market May Pause Longer
==================================================

The stock market slumbered Monday, closing modestly lower. But a few key parts of the market saw considerable selling.




For one, small caps lagged noticeably. The Russell 2000 was off 1.3%, falling back below its 50-day moving average. The Invesco S&P Smallcap Energy Portfolio ([PSCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCE)) was down more than 2%, but weakness in small caps was broad.


Leading stocks also lagged. The IBD 50 fell 0.9%, a lot more than the major indexes. After rising past its April highs last week, the index of top-rated stocks is right back below the April peak.


Ten of the 50 stocks fell more than 2%. A few IBD 50 stocks saw uncharacteristic declines. For example, **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) slid 3.5%, its largest decline since May 29. **LPL Financial Holdings** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)) fell below its 50-day moving average and closed below its 79.44 buy point.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP062419-247x300.jpg)Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) also closed below its 50-day line. It was the gym operator's first close below that key level since Dec. 24, when the stock began its ascent.


Transportation was another sector down sharply. The Dow Transports were off 1.5%. Airfreight, transportation equipment, trucking and shipping were industry groups down 2% or more. **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) fell 2.7% on news that [it will offer two-day air shipping](https://www.investors.com/news/fedex-stock-falls-express-price-cuts-ups-amazon/) for the same price as ground in a bid to attract **UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) customers. UPS fell 2.4%.


The soft performance of leading stocks comes as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell modestly for a second straight day. The Nasdaq lost 0.3% and the S&P 500 0.2% Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a fraction, avoiding a second-straight loss by less than nine points.


Volume fell, which was no surprise after Friday's options-expiration session. Declining stocks led advancers by an 8-to-5 ratio on the NYSE and by 11 to 5 on the Nasdaq.


A Normal Stock Market Pause?
----------------------------


In context, it may be normal for the market to pause right now. Indexes made a sharp three-week advance and some consolidation is almost necessary. An important factor is that indexes are not giving back much at all from that three-week rally.


The Nasdaq is holding above 8000 level. The S&P 500 is still near last week's record high.


Content with its June gains, the stock market may wait now for the G-20 meeting later this week. President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to meet on stalled trade talks. Tariffs are the [single largest factor in the stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-next-six-months-2019/).


A problem for growth investors is that most breakouts since the June 7 [follow through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) are sputtering. Scanning through the list of recent breakouts on [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/), most stocks are making little or no progress from buy points.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) fell below its 354.72 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) [launched a beauty store](https://www.investors.com/news/ulta-beauty-stock-falls-buy-point-amazon-beauty-store/) for licensed professionals. **Rapid7** ([RPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RPD)) fell below its 57.10 buy point two days after breaking out.


There are a few productive breakouts. **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)), for example, is up about 14% from its breakout June 10. **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)) has climbed nearly 10% from its 32.31 buy point.


Larger gains are much more common in the leading stocks that broke out earlier in the year. That's when many of the software, payment and consumer stocks that are among the year's best so far started their runs.

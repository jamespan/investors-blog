Nasdaq, S&P 500 Show Stalling Action In Another Sleepy Session
===============================================================

Hello summer doldrums.


It was another quiet session for stocks Tuesday but also one with a couple of noteworthy developments. The Nasdaq composite marked an all-time closing high, rising 0.2% in higher volume. But it also showed stalling action, closing in the bottom half of its intraday range. The stalling action increased the Nasdaq's distribution-day count to four.


Stalling action generally occurs when an index closes in the bottom half of its intraday range as it makes a meager gain in higher volume. It's another form of distribution, or institutional selling.


The S&P 500 hit an all-time high intraday but ended with a gain of less than 0.1%. The benchmark index also showed stalling action, but its July 5 distribution day fell off the count due to time so the count stayed the same, at four.


![MP080916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP080916.jpg)The Dow Jones industrial average picked up less than 0.1%. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) added nearly 0.7%, outperforming the broad market and the Russell 2000, which rose 0.1%.


Big gainers in the IBD 50 on Tuesday included **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) and China-based **Yirendai** ([YRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YRD)), which soared 17% and 15%, respectively. Strong earnings lifted shares of Inphi. Results from Yirendai were due Tuesday after the close.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor index outperformed, rising 0.8%. **Tower Semiconductor** ([TSEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSEM)) is doing a good job holding gains after soaring nearly 13% last week on earnings.


Earnings reports got most of the attention Tuesday. **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) closed strongly, rising nearly 7%. Before the open the emerging leader in the homebuilding group reported another strong quarter, with earnings up 45% from a year ago to 96 cents a share. Sales rose 40% to $222.7 million. The stock has recovered nicely after slumping nearly 5% last week on news that July home closings fell 1.7% from a year ago.


Despite a fair share of extended stocks out there, the market is still offering up some interesting setups.



New issue **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) poked above a 44.90 buy point of an IPO base but ended just below it. Shares rose 1% to 43.01 after hitting an intraday high of 45.69. Late Monday, the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss and also issued bullish guidance. Goldman Sachs brought the enterprise software name public in June at 15. Twilio isn't profitable yet, but shows big sales growth in recent quarters.


Another new issue, **Line** ([LN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LN)), is setting up in an IPO base with a 44.59 entry. Shares of the Japan-based messaging service gapped up and rose 5% to 42.14.


Brexit fears have taken a back seat to earnings reports, which have generally have been good, but it's not that the Brexit has completely disappeared from the headlines.


The pound lost ground again Tuesday, falling below $1.30 at one point, as the market bets that more stimulus is on the way after the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union.


Second-quarter earnings season is nearly over, but no doubt the market will have plenty more headlines to ponder in coming weeks. As always, pay attention to price and volume in leading growth stocks. If signs of institutional selling become more pronounced, don't be afraid to protect gains in your portfolio and keep losses small. For now, with the market in a confirmed uptrend, go with the flow and don't be afraid to put money to work in high-quality names still in buy range with solid fundamentals and healthy charts.

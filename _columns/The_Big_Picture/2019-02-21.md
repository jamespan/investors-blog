  Stocks Trim Day's Losses But Stay In The Red

Stock indexes limped to the finish line Thursday, as bad economic data hurt the market and reports of progress on trade talks with China did little to help.




The Nasdaq sagged 0.4% after a run-up to flat fell short. The Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the small-cap Russell 2000 also lost 0.4%.


Volume downshifted to lower than the previous session's total on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The U.S.-China trade reports were based on anonymous sources, which can be true, false or just a test of reactions. China reportedly offered to buy an additional $30 billion in U.S. agriculture products.


Too Good To Be True?
--------------------


Some market watchers scoffed at the $30 billion figure, saying it was unrealistic. In 2017, for example, U.S. farm exports to China were $19.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MP_2x1_022119-274x300.jpg)Even if the additional $30 billion were true, that still leaves a lot unresolved differences for negotiators, including forced technology transfers, intellectual property rights, currency issues and barriers to trade.


The stock market might be betting at this juncture that the most realistic outcome is President Donald Trump extending the truce on tariffs. Whether kicking the can down the road would be enough to satisfy Wall Street for more than a few sessions isn't clear.

Investors Give Stocks More Love On Valentine's; Yellen Spurs Financials
========================================================================

Wall Street continued its romance with stocks Tuesday, as the indexes kissed new highs on Valentine's Day.


The Nasdaq composite added 0.3%, the S&P 500 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average nearly 0.5%.  The Dow benefited from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which closed at an all-time high on positive buzz about new screen technology on its next iPhone model.


![mp021417](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP021417.png)Indexes opened weaker but made a bullish reversal and closed near session highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.3%. The Dow utilities, which had just hit the highest level since Nov. 1, slid 0.6%. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


While the market's embrace of equities remains firm, the romance could be headed for a cooling off.


The Nasdaq, the leading index of 2017 so far, has climbed above an upper channel line that spans the composite's highs since November. Each time the index touched that upward-slanting line, the Nasdaq pulled back. A few momentum indicators also show the Nasdaq is due for at least a mild decline.


But buyers don't seem ready for a breakup. That is, while some profit-taking is possible, a market correction does not look at all likely.


The number of distribution days (five on the Nasdaq and three on the S&P 500) is tolerable. Finance, telecom and technology sectors are leading the market and providing growth investors with plenty of opportunities to profit. Relatively few high-rated stocks are in much trouble.


The market seems optimistic about President Trump's spending and tax plans, though details remain a mystery. **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) — which figures to sell tons of concrete, asphalt and other materials in an infrastructure boom — [sounded upbeat about those plans](https://www.investors.com/news/martin-marietta-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-earnings/). The stock fell after Marietta missed Q4 profit and net sales expectations.


On Tuesday, a good mix of banks, fiber optic, medical and retail stocks led the market.


You can't say enough about banks and the broad leadership in that sector. Eleven of the IBD 50 stocks are banks and nine more are S&Ls, insurers or other financials. The IBD 50 rose less than 0.2%.


**Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) and **Wintrust Financial Group** ([WTFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WTFC)) rose past buy points, though Wintrust had soft volume. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) topped the 247.87 buy point of a flat base. Those charts, plus others that broke out the past few days, were new evidence that the bank trade is reinflating itself after a normal period of consolidation.


Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen reinforced the notion that a few more rate hikes are likely this year, and said the unwinding of bond purchases (which itself would act as a form of monetary loosening) will be done only after more rate hikes.


Testifying at the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen warned that waiting too long to raise rates "would be unwise," potentially requiring the Fed to raise rates too rapidly. Although Yellen sounded more hawkish than usual, the major indexes started climbing after the release of her remarks at 10 a.m. ET. Higher rates figure to result in better margins for banks.


Some defensive groups did appear at the top of the market, but **Service Corp. International's** ([SCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCI)) surge on earnings pushed up the funeral services group.


Meanwhile, **Molson Coors Brewing** ([TAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAP)) jumped 3.4% even though it missed profit and sales views, but still was the main reason why alcoholic beverages were one of the day's best groups.

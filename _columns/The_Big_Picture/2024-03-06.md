From small caps to large caps, from the tech sector to industries outside it, the stock market lifted all of these areas on Wednesday. But the path was tortuous, to say the least.




The Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.6%, a hair above the S&P 500's 0.5% advance but less than the Russell 2000's 0.7% forward march. But at various points, the Nasdaq's gain shrank to as small as 0.2% and expanded to as large as 1.2%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.2% higher. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and edged up on the NYSE.


After losing more than 2% over a two-day slide, the Nasdaq's piecemeal gain is still welcome. Arguably the most important stock market index for growth investors, the Nasdaq avoided a [third straight distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/).


Avoiding A Selling Cluster
--------------------------


A bullish stock market can deflect the occasional bullet of pronounced institutional selling. But prior to Wednesday's rebound, a mini cluster of distribution appeared to be forming in the stock market. That's not a welcome sight for the longs.


Important to note, too, is the fact that the Nasdaq's drop of almost 1.7% on Tuesday was a sign of meaningful profit-taking by institutional investors. The Nasdaq's declines on Feb. 28 and on Monday were milder, at 0.55% or less.


Don't forget this: Prior to the decision by IBD to downgrade the current outlook for stocks to "market in correction" on Oct. 20, the Nasdaq had suffered no fewer than nine distribution days — not a misprint, nine — from Sept. 12 to Oct. 19 in which each decline was 1% or more in heavier trading vs. the prior day.


Stock Market Today
------------------



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP030624--199x300.jpg)Returning to Wednesday's action, most people dislike it when the stock market expands and contracts like an musical accordion. However, the day's music was mostly pleasing to investors' ears amid a cacophony of conflicting news.


One of the day's biggest headlines? Let's check out **New York Community Bancorp** ([NYCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NYCB)), whose chart in recent days resembles a plane in a death spiral. NYCB shares were halted after they plunged to a new multidecade low of 1.70. But when trading resumed, New York Community rebounded vigorously, ending the day up 7% to 3.46.


The reason for the violent rebound? A consortium of private equity funds agreed to [inject $1 billion in equity into the beleaguered regional bank](https://www.investors.com/news/nycbs-stock-mnuchin-bank-failure/). NYCB would also get new members to its board, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary and ex-Goldman Sachs banking executive Steven Mnuchin.


Meanwhile, the banking sector saw mixed results. While superregionals fell for the most part, some regional lenders ended the day flat or reversed higher.


How did the rest of the stock market respond?


Bullish Stock Market Stats
--------------------------


[MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) — the rebranded MarketSmith research tool, now with new features — highlighted a bullish tilt of breadth in this way: At least 399 stocks in the MarketSurge database rose on Wednesday in above-average turnover. Just 179 issues declined in heavy trading.


In terms of just price moves, advancers exceeded decliners by a healthy 5-3 margin on the Nasdaq and by 5 to 2 on the NYSE.


The stock market initially rallied amid comments by Jerome Powell hinting that he and fellow leaders of the U.S. central bank are cautiously optimistic that inflation is returning to a more balanced state.



"We want to see a little bit more data so that we can become confident," Powell told the House Financial Services Committee during the first day of Congressional testimony, as quoted by Dow Jones Newswires. "We're not looking for better inflation readings than we've had. We're just looking for more of them."


What's The Message From Gold?
-----------------------------


Gold has caught fire in recent days. On Wednesday, futures hit a new all-time high and at one point surpassed $2,156 an ounce. While some argue that a small dip in the value of the U.S. dollar can drive purchases of gold, the more important message may lie in the prospects for higher inflation.


When consumer and producer-level prices begin to run at a higher rate than a reasonable return for bonds, investors avoid this scenario of a negative return after factoring in inflation. Go back to the late 1970s, and that's exactly what gold was messaging investors as it eclipsed $300 per ounce for the first time.


Both the stock market and fixed income securities became highly unattractive. Why? Inflation was raging. It took a violent rise in interest rates, instituted by then-Fed Chief Paul Volcker, for the U.S. to break the back of inflation.


That's certainly not the message of the stock market today. At least for now.

Stock Market Ends Three-Day Win Streak, As Key Events Start To Converge
========================================================================

Stock market investors found few places to hide Thursday, as more than nine industry groups fell for every two that rose. The market ended a three-day win streak.




The Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 1% and 1.2%, respectively. Blue chips as gauged in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and large caps in the S&P 500 fell 0.5% each.


Volume was heavier on both major exchanges vs. the previous session's pace.


The action slapped both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 with a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), a sign of institutional selling.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP072519-241x300.jpg)With the distribution-day count at four on the Nasdaq and S&P 500, the stock market could be nearing a critical point. News is converging. Earnings from major companies will continue to roll out in the coming days. On Tuesday, the U.S. and China will restart talks on trade. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will huddle Tuesday and Wednesday.


Stock Market: Bracing For News?
-------------------------------


What comes out of those meetings could have a strong effect on the stock market.


So Thursday's sell-off might have involved a defensive strategy: Lock in some gains before news takes the opportunity away.


By now, investors have seen hopes for a trade agreement dashed several times. Skepticism has become the default stance.


Lackluster Leadership
---------------------


On Thursday, the day's leadership had a lackluster quality.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, homebuilders and meat products scored gains. Big losers for the day included automakers, metal handling and oil.


News both domestic and international saddled hopes and worries on the stock market.


Financial Data
--------------


On the homefront, durable goods orders smashed the pessimists. Orders rose 2%, easily beating the consensus view for 0.5%. Core capital goods, a gauge for business investment, rolled in at 1.9%, trouncing views for 0.2%.


But the Kansas City Federal Reserve's manufacturing index came in at minus 1, the first hint of contraction in almost three years.


The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates at least a quarter point on July 31. But two Fed voting members, Esther George and Eric Rosengren, suggested recently that a rate cut is not necessary.


European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said the risk of a recession in the Eurozone was low, but Europe is getting "worse and worse." He said an economic rebound in Q3 was "less likely now."


The Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.6% on Draghi's comments. A statement from the ECB hinted at a rate cut for the eurozone.


China and the U.S. will begin talks in Shanghai on Tuesday. The market will watch carefully for signs of compromise. Neither China's Xi Jinping nor President Donald Trump has shown a willingness to back off.


Stock Market Breakouts Include An IPO
-------------------------------------


Breakouts Thursday included mostly stocks with mediocre ratings. But China-based online educator **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)), an initial public offering, leaped 7% in fast trade. The small-cap stock is expected to earn 18 cents a share this year and 52 cents a share in 2020.


GSX debuted on the NYSE in early June and then sketched a seven-week consolidation. More than 1.8 million shares were traded on the breakout, which sent the stock past a 12.77 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


On Friday before the stock market opens, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the first reading on second-quarter GDP. The Street's consensus figure is 1.9%. The range of estimates runs from 1.6% to 2.2%.



After Thursday's close, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) [reported results for fiscal Q3 ended in June](https://www.investors.com/news/starbucks-earnings-q319-due-starbucks-stock/). The cafe retailer beat views on earnings by 8% and revenue by about 2%. Global same-store sales rose 6% vs. 4% expected. Starbucks' stock price gained 5.6% in after-hours trade.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) also rose after the close on earnings reports. But **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) fell after [earnings missed expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-earnings-second-quarter-stock/).

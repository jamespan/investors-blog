Tech stocks led a mixed showing on Wall Street Tuesday as earnings reports and M&A activity dominated the headlines.

  

A 0.5% early gain for the S&P 500 turned into 0.2% loss by the close. The Dow also reversed lower, falling 0.5%, weighed down by sluggish results at **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)). The Nasdaq traded in a tight range all day, ending with a 0.4% gain. Volume rose slightly from Monday's levels across the board.

  

The IBD 50 outperformed, rising 0.6%.

  

In M&A news, **Mylan** ([MYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYL)) jumped 8% after **Teva** ([TEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEVA)) offered about $40 billion, valuing Mylan at $82 a share. Earlier this month, Mylan made an unsolicited bid for generic drugmaker **Perrigo** ([PRGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRGO)) for $29 billion. Some say the offer was made to fend off a Teva bid.

  

Market breadth has been improving lately, but Tuesday gave a mixed picture. Advancing stocks had a slight edge over decliners on the NYSE, but it was the opposite on the Nasdaq.

  

May crude oil lost $1.12, or 2%, to settle at $55.26 a barrel. The weakness spread into oil and gas-related groups. About half of the day's worst performing groups hailed from the oil and gas patch.

  

The stock market may have some challenges ahead of it from a fundamental standpoint, but it's hard to find anything wrong with its technical picture.

  

The Nasdaq has visited its 50-day moving average a few times in recent weeks and has found support each time. But distribution is still an issue for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, and it remains a headline-driven market in which conditions can worsen quickly. As always, stay nimble and don't get overly bullish or bearish.

  

The Nasdaq was buoyed by strength in security software stocks. IBD's security software group soared close to 3%, led by **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)). Earnings topped expectations, and the company delivered its biggest quarterly billings growth since its IPO in 2009. Shares jumped 10%.

  

Other big movers in the group were **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) and **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)). CyberArk gapped above a 63.08 cup-with-handle buy point.

  

While most of Wall Street remains fixated on the likelihood of weakness in blue-chip earnings due to a strong U.S. dollar, growth investors know they'll see a steady flow of upside surprises as well.

  

**Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)) surged out of a year-long consolidation after reporting solid earnings before the open. The New York-based bank has an outstanding track record of earnings and sales growth. Over the past four quarters, earnings growth has averaged 23%. Sales growth has averaged 21%.

  

**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) topped expectations after the close. Earnings jumped 72% from a year ago to 91 cents a share. Sales rose 28% to $539 million. The results easily topped the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate of 72 cents and sales of $524.45 million.

  

**Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) added nearly 3% ahead of its earnings report Wednesday after the close. It closed just above a 90.59 buy point. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) also reports Wednesday after the close.

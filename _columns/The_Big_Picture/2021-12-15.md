title: Stock Market Rallies After Fed Policy Decision; Time To Get Back In?

Stocks reversed sharply higher Wednesday after the Fed made its policy announcement, as bulls rushed in and took control of the market.




After starting underwater, key indexes reversed sharply higher around 2 p.m. ET, shortly after the Fed said it will [halt pandemic-driven asset purchases](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-stock-market-ready-for-faster-taper-but-not-this/) sooner than expected.


The central bank now plans to decrease purchases by $30 billion per month, leading to a likely halt in March. Prior plans targeted a June wrap-up with a gradual tapering of asset purchases by $15 billion a month.


That sets the stage for three interest-rate hikes in 2022, to help counter persistently high inflation. A majority of policymakers expect three more rate hikes in 2023, which would boost the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate to a range of 1.5%-1.75% vs. the current 0%-0.25% range.


The Fed's change in sentiment fueled the Nasdaq composite to a 2.2% gain from a 1.2% loss as the tech-heavy index surged back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The S&P 500 rallied 1.6% and is now less than 1% away from a new high, though it has hit resistance near the 4,700 level before.

The big gains in heavy volume yielded a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on a rally attempt that began Dec. 6. That means the market is back in a confirmed uptrend — which gives investors the green light to invest in leading stocks at proper buy points. As with any follow-through, it's best to start increasing exposure slowly.


Tech Stocks Lead Stock Market
-----------------------------


Tech stocks reversed higher after the Fed announcement. Technology led the S&P sectors with a nearly 3% gain, though defensive sectors such as health care and utilities also outperformed. Energy, down 0.4%, was the sole declining S&P sector.


Growth stocks rallied, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) reversed from a 2% loss to a 2.4% gain.


Chip stocks led the IBD 50, as **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) surged about 8% each to rebound off their 10-week lines. That sets up a chance for investors to buy or add shares.


**Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)), which reversed to a 6% gain, is back in the 20%-25% profit-taking zone from a 43.10 cup-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


The chip stock rally fueled gains of about 3% each in iShares Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) and VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)).


Growth Stock Breakouts
----------------------


**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as shares cleared the 134.24 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/), according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The stock remains in a buy range that goes up to 140.95. The cloud networking company, featured in Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/anet-stock-the-ibd-stock-of-the-day-nears-new-entry-point/), is also in the IBD 50.


In health care, **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) was a big winner, soaring more than 10% to break out past a 271.21 buy point of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/).



The pharma giant [raised its full-year guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-stock-pops-on-boosted-outlook-covid-sales/), following a recent deal with the U.S. government for its Covid antibody treatment. Eli Lilly now expects $28 billion to $28.3 billion in sales, above analyst forecasts for $27.6 billion.


Health care stocks on the Dow Jones index also scored gains as **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) rose more than 2% each.


**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) led the Dow Jones industrials, jumping nearly 4% to break out past a 58.73 [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) entry. The Dow itself found support and rebounded off its 50-day line.


Bad Day For Roblox
------------------


Even though the market is back in a confirmed uptrend, investors need to stay cautious. Adhere to your buy and sell rules. There has been a lot of volatility lately, especially among growth stocks.


For instance, **Roblox** ([RBLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBLX)) gapped down and sank 9% in heavy volume. The stock erased a 36% gain and then some from a 103.97 buy point to trigger the round-trip sell signal. A [breach of its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) also tripped a sell signal.


**Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) is testing its 50-day line again, after a five-day losing streak. It had already given up a double-digit gain from a 648.82 buy point.

Bears won the skirmish at the 50-day moving average Friday, but financials and banks largely escaped the brunt of the damage.




The Nasdaq severed 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average cut 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. Small caps did a little better with the Russell 2000 trimming 0.6%.


Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq.


Higher volume on the NYSE slapped the S&P 500 with a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). Distribution involves a price loss in a major index in rising volume. Such action is a sign of institutional selling. Lower volume on the Nasdaq protected the tech-heavy index from distribution.


Price and volume action was much like Thursday's except the Nasdaq and S&P 500 swapped roles on who would escape and who would suffer distribution.


Overall, the limited distribution suggested that funds are not heading for the exits en masse.

Selling is selling, but if it's profit taking the selling won't last long.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP042018-227x300.jpg)Bulls are hoping that's the case, but Friday the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow all sliced below their 50-day lines.


Only the Russell 2000 remains above its 50-day line.


Financials, Banks Outperform
----------------------------


Meanwhile, for a second straight day, financials and banks showed relative strength.



On Thursday, the PowerShares KBW Bank ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)) exchange-traded fund jumped 2.2% while the major indexes fell.


On Friday, KBW inched up 0.25%, while the major indexes took another nasty fall.


Rising interest rates are one factor boosting the banks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is near a four-year high, [causing some concern on Wall Street](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/treasury-yield-inflation-fed-rate-hike-worry-stock-market/).


Breakouts Friday included credit reporting agency **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)), which gapped up 10% and **First Financial Bancorp** ([FFBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFBC)), up 5%. Both beat profit estimates and TransUnion announced the acquisition of a U.K.-based firm.


What's Ahead?
-------------


The coming week will be busy with data and earnings reports.


On Thursday, the durable goods report for March will be released. The prior reading was 3.1%. The first take on Q1 GDP growth will be released Friday. The third reading for Q4 came in at 2.9%.


Earnings reports Monday will include **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)).


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) will report Tuesday. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) report Wednesday. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) are on deck for Thursday. **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) report Friday.

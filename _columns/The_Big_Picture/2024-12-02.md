Stock market bears proved to remain in short supply Monday, with some key indexes refreshing their new-high marks to kick off the final month of trading in 2024.


The Nasdaq composite clearly led with a 1% lift to 19,403, ending not far from its session high of 19,436 and at an all-time closing high. At the close, the tech-enriched index finished 4.5% above its solidly rising 50-day moving average. So, from this technical measure, its gains do not seem overly stretched, based on IBD research of recent stock market trends.




Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq 100, which showcases the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rose 1.1%. That easily beat a gain of 0.2% by the S&P 500, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.3%. The blue chip gauge ended a streak of four straight days in which it marked new highs. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the S&P 500 marked a record daily close for the 54th session in 2024 so far.


The Russell 2000 continues to trade sideways, as it's done for days. On Monday, it gave up less than 1 point.


Volume jumped sharply vs. Friday's half-day session. More importantly, as the Market Pulse shows, [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) remains limited. That signals fund managers across Wall Street are mostly in accumulation mode.


According to a MarketSurge daily chart, Monday's volume on the Nasdaq was just a touch below its average over the past 50 sessions.


Equal-weighted versions of the Nasdaq 100 also performed well on Monday. Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) rose nearly 0.8% to 95.38. It posted an all-time high and has gained nearly 6% since the start of the fourth quarter.


The equal-weight ETF has risen 12.7% for the year, so it continues to lag iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)). The latter ETF is up 20.4% since Jan. 1.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP120224-238x300.jpg)Breadth was negative on the NYSE, yet only mildly so.


Early data showed a 4-to-3 margin in favor of falling stocks vs. gainers. However, on the Nasdaq, breadth in fact improved as the day wore on. By day's end, winners nipped losers by 98 stocks, according to early data on Thinkorswim.


See the final statistics on the General Market Indicators page, found as a link at the bottom of every Big Picture column, or on the [Stock Market Today landing page](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).


Plus, the [homepage of MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) showed 313 stocks up in volume vs. 227 down.


[Looking at the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), however, this list of elite growth stocks does provide ample evidence that leadership in the stock market today is not purely the domain of the large or megacap firms.


Take **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)), which got some air play on [Monday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?_gl=1*4yt5h2*_gcl_au*MTQzMjEwMTg0OS4xNzMxMjU3MzY0*_ga*MTczODcyMjkxOS4xNzMyODA5Njk4*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczMzE3Mjc0OS4xNS4xLjE3MzMxNzY0MzAuNjAuMC4w&id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A). With a market value of $8.4 billion, Dutch Bros is a midcap growth stock. And the Oregon-based coffee and energy drink chain has acted superbly since its earnings-sparked boost on Nov. 7.



On that day, Dutch Bros took out a 43.49 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a four-month [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Since then, the stock hasn't looked back. Earnings grew 14% in the third quarter to 16 cents a share on a 28% top-line jump to $338 million.


What's even more impressive? Check out the company's earnings outlook.


Wall Street has upgraded its annual profit estimates to 45 cents a share this year, up 49% vs. 30 cents in 2023, and up another 20% to 54 cents in 2025.


Also In The IBD 50
------------------


Fintech company **SoFi Technologies** ([SOFI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOFI)), [ranked No. 29 in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), has also achieved mouthwatering returns in the short term.



After SoFi built a long, deep first-stage base from the beginning of the year through September, patient investors got rewarded if they bought the now-large-cap stock on a [trendline breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trendlines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) near 8.50 during the week ended Oct. 11, or even as SoFi busted past the deep pattern's left-side high of 10.49. The decline in the base, 43%, is certainly deeper than normal. In a typical bullish cup pattern, the correction usually does not exceed 30% or so.


From the 10.49 buy point, SoFi (now with a market value of $17.3 billion, 1.08 billion shares outstanding) has rocketed as much as 58%. IBD readers should not chase the stock. Instead, watch for a new base or tight weekly price action to emerge.


SoFi's earnings trajectory looks very bullish now.


Four years ago in 2020, the San Francisco-based firm lost $2.56 a share. Yet solid sales growth has helped cut that red ink. Last year, SoFi lost only 6 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet currently expect earnings of 12 cents a share this year and 28 cents in 2025.


Mutual funds owning a piece of SoFi have grown from 355 at the end of 2023 to 383 during the third quarter of this year. No wonder SoFi now holds a redoubtable 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) on a scale of 1 to 99. [According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-sofi-technologies-sofi.aspx), SoFi ranks third overall in IBD's Finance-Consumer Loans industry group.

Did Santa Claus Come Early?
---------------------------


Generally, the stock market has acted bullishly since Nov. 6, when IBD upgraded the outlook with a suggested exposure level of 80%-100% in stocks from 60%-80%. On Nov. 6, the Nasdaq roared nearly 3% higher upon the results of the U.S. elections, and volume increased.


The big gain in heavier turnover was akin to what [IBD founder Bill O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/william-oneil-legendary-investor-and-founder-of-investors-business-daily-dies-at-90/) liked to call elephants jumping into the bathtub, making a big splash. The metaphor? Think of it as a stock market awash with heavy institutional buying. The Nov. 6 session could also be framed as a subsequent [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


In a bull market, generally the rising tide lifts all boats. However, the degree in which each boat rises varies totally.



Google search engine parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) had a good Monday, up 1.5% to 171.49. The Nasdaq megacap tech rose off its slowly rising 50-day moving average. The [Magnificent Seven member](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) is one of the dullards within this bunch, holding a 63 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/). Only **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), with a 49 RS score, fares worse on a 12-month basis.


Alphabet needs more time and gains to set up a [new, strong breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


As the history of Wall Street and the U.S. economy has shown, investors need to be mindful of regulatory risk.


On Nov. 28, Canada's antitrust watchdog, the Competition Bureau, alleged that Alphabet acted unlawfully in building market share in the online ads market. The bureau seeks to "put a decisive end to Google's structural dominance and anticompetitive practice," The Wall Street Journal reported. The report followed a sell-off that took place in Alphabet shares on Nov. 21 following news that the U.S. Department of Justice wants Google to divest its Chrome browser, citing its monopoly position in online search.


"At the end of the day, Morningstar does not think Chrome will be required to be divested. Even if we get to that point, we're still a number of years away from that even potentially occurring," Dave Sekera, U.S. market strategist at **Morningstar** ([MORN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MORN)), wrote in weekly comments sent to IBD.


Other Financial Markets
-----------------------


Gold futures for December delivery dropped 0.8% to $2,634.90 an ounce on the Comex, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Still, the year has been shiny for the precious metal, with Comex gold futures up 27.8% year to date.


Crude oil futures in the West Texas Intermediate light sweet market edged up 0.2% to $68.15 a barrel ahead of an OPEC+ meeting slated for Thursday.


The yield on the key U.S. 10-year government bond rose mildly, up nearly two basis points to almost 4.2%.

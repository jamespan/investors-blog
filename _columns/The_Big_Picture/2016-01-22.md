Stocks rollicked ahead Friday, but volume once again stepped down.


The Nasdaq surged 2.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 2% and 1.3%, respectively.


The IBD 50 gained 2.6%.


Volume fell across the board.


Few leaders did anything dazzling, but generally their action was upbeat.


**![MP_012316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MP_012316.png)Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) popped 4% early but then retreated to a 2% gain. The company reported earnings late Thursday that beat the Street's consensus on the top and bottom lines.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), which also reported late Thursday, fell as much as 2.7% in the first 15 minutes of trade and then reversed to close up 0.2% for the day. The positive reversal was impressive, considering Starbucks reported a miss on revenue and weaker-than-expected guidance.


Tobacco company **Reynolds American**Â continued to show it can hold up in a tough market. The stock poked 1.3% higher, good enough to edge above its 50-day moving average.


While tobacco stocks are regarded as defensive, Reynolds is adding a bit more than that to its profile. The company grew earnings 6% to 7% in 2011-14. However, the Street expects 16% growth when Reynolds reports 2015 results sometime in February and 18% growth this year.


Although the market remains in a correction, the weekly action calmed down. A calming period was sorely needed.


Analysts have been sounding pessimistic notes as they debate the possibility of a recession.


Lost among the crepe hangers is a widely ignored but hopeful statistic.


M4 divisia, the broadest gauge of the money supply, came in at 4% for December. M4 divisia has averaged 4% growth over the past six months.


The last time something similar happened was the first half of 2013. Quarterly GDP growth was 1.9% and 1.1% in the first half but M4 had picked up to nearly 5%. GDP then accelerated to 3% and 3.8% in the second half of 2013.


Q4 GDP will be reported Friday, although it may be too early for the M4 factor to kick in.


Economic news was mostly good Friday. The PMI Manufacturing Index for January and existing home sales for December both topped the highest estimate in the range of economists' forecasts. Leading indicators for December were slightly weaker than expected.


For the week, the Nasdaq rose 2.3%; the IBD 50, 2.1%; and the S&P 500, 1.4%.

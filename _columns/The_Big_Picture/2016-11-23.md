U.S. stock indexes shrugged off a half-dozen economic reports and the minutes from the Fed meeting, as the market turned in nonchalant results Wednesday.


The Nasdaq lost 0.1%, while the S&P 500 tacked on 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average, which has led the two major indexes in recent weeks, rose 0.3%. Small caps, though, have been the true leaders, up 13% since Election Day. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.6% on Wednesday for its 14th consecutive gain.


Volume fell across the board, not too surprising for several reasons: the upcoming Thanksgiving Day holiday; the looming half-session Friday; and the release Tuesday of the second reading on third-quarter GDP.

The second take has been higher than the first take in four of the past six instances. Tuesday's report will be the last look at GDP before the Fed makes its decision on interest rates Dec. 13-14.


Top-rated stocks showed strength Wednesday.


Medical software provider **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) hurtled 11% as it cleared a 42.68 buy point on strong quarterly results. Volume was more than 350% above average.


Chipmaker **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) followed up on a Nov. 16 breakout. On Wednesday, the stock popped 5% in twice its usual volume. The stock is now too extended to buy. The chip sector is No. 3 among 33 sectors.


Investment bank **Evercore Partners** ([EVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVR)) added almost 1% in brisk volume, padding the gain from a Nov. 9 breakout.


**Sterling Bancorp** ([STL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STL)) rose 2%, padding a gain from the savings and loan's Nov. 7 breakout. Volume was about 65% above average Wednesday.


Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's minutes revealed a Fed that is ready to raise interest rates, presumably in December, though the reasoning left something to be desired. At the November meeting, some participants "argued that to preserve credibility" rates should be raised. In a few words, the current Fed confessed its insecure obsession with its own image, a concern that would've been unthinkable in the reigns of Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker.


On Nov. 10, Greenspan weighed in against the Dodd-Frank law, which Greenspan called a "disastrous mistake." Former chair Ben Bernanke and current chief Janet Yellen have defended Dodd-Frank. The 2010 law has saddled the banks with regulations that some economists say are responsible for the weakness of the economic recovery.


President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal Dodd-Frank, a promise that's at least partly behind the rally in the bank stocks. The Powershares KBW Bank ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)) ETF is up 15% since the Election Day close.


In economic news, durable goods orders, the PMI manufacturing index and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge were all stronger than expected. But first-time jobless claims, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's price index, and the Commerce Department's report on new home sales were worse than expected.


The data on housing, though, barely moved the housing stocks. IBD's homebuilding industry group rose 0.2%, extending its win streak to 11 sessions in a row.


On Friday, the PMI Services Flash report will be released. The prior reading was 54.8.

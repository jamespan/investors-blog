When the stock market enters bear country, there's no way of knowing how long and how deep the gashing will go.




Individual investors received a reminder of that Friday. The Nasdaq rose almost 1% in the first hour of trade and then reversed into the red.


At the end of the day, the Nasdaq was down 3%; the S&P 500, 2.1%; and the Dow Jones industrial average, 1.8%. Small caps slid to a 2.2% loss in the S&P 600.


Volume rose sharply on both major exchanges. Friday was a quadruple witching day.

Unstable Gains
--------------


Take note that the day's intraday gains were a much smaller percentage than the day's losses. That's typical of bear markets.


Gains are unstable in bear markets. Few of the gains ever benefit the bulls for more than a few sessions or, in Friday's case, a few hours.


Cash is the wisest position in a bear market. Prudent investors will testify to another fringe benefit of cash. The wait for the next bull market is like a day at the beach, if the investor's exposure is zero or almost zero.


Stick With Sound Strategy
-------------------------


IBD-style investors don't dispute that value-oriented fund managers can outperform growth at times.


Value oriented **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) lost 4% for the week vs. 8% for the Nasdaq.


The danger arises when aggressive growth investors try to switch tactics in the middle of the game. Buying like an aggressive growth investor and holding like a value investor is a recipe for losing a lot of money.


Growth stocks will fall faster and deeper than conservative stocks, which is why the growth camp must cut losses quickly.


Fed's Sermon Turns Flat
-----------------------


On Friday, the Federal Reserve tried and failed to talk down the stock market's fears. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams, a voting member of the Fed, said in a CNBC interview, "I think we are hearing something important from markets."


At this point, though, investors would rather see a sermon from the Fed than listen to one.


Bullish Indicators
------------------


The put/call volume ratio zoomed to 1.48 Friday, far above the 1.15 level that indicates a near-term rebound.


Also, few stocks are above the 50-day line and the 200-day line. That can't go on forever.


Investors might want to watch next week's bulls vs. bears indicator. Bulls are at 39.3%. The reading is among the lowest since May 2016. Stocks rallied 16% from late June to late September 2016.

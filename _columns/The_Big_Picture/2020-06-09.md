What Will Techs, Leading Growth Stocks Do Now After Nasdaq 10,000?
===================================================================

Last week, cyclical stocks made a statement: The economy is coming back. On Tuesday, techs made a new statement: The Nasdaq is back at the helm.




Go to the mainstream news outlets, and you may have a tough time finding a big headline that screams, "Nasdaq Hits Historic Mark Of 10,000!" Yet in fact, the market cap-weighted composite index reached an all-time peak for a second straight session.


Nasdaq 10,000 has emerged amid a sober mood across America.


The world's No. 1 economy continues to deal with the worst pandemic in a century and the national issue of excessive use of force by law enforcement. America's economy has entered a recession. Savers are grumpy about near-zero returns in money-market accounts. And the [bulls vs. bears survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), which gets updated every Wednesday, is not showing levels of irrational exuberance.


The Nasdaq, up as much as 0.8% to a session high of 10,002.75, settled back to end with a 0.3% gain. The Nasdaq 100, representing the 100 largest nonfinancial firms on that all-electronic exchange, rallied 0.7%. In short, the Nasdaq smacked the performance of other key indexes, which included drops of 0.8% for the S&P 500, 1.9% for the Russell 2000, and 2% for the Dow Jones utility average.


The State Of Institutional Selling
----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP060920-208x300.jpg)The Dow Jones transportation average got whacked for a 2.3% loss.


Volume fell on both main exchanges.


This means the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) for the S&P 500, despite that index's moderately size decline Tuesday, remains at a very low level.


Solid gains in internet retail, movies, education software, internet content, consumer telecom products, fabless semiconductor and gaming software helped bolster the Nasdaq. Oil and gas, airline, concrete and aggregates, lodging, gas pipeline and travel booking shares got pounded.


Granted, these heavily beaten down stocks during the coronavirus shutdown have surged in recent weeks. They certainly looked ripe for profit-taking. (See the full daily rankings and price changes for the 197 industry groups at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Most of the [top 20 industry groups today](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-08-2020/) come from highly dynamic growth areas of Wall Street, where companies are continuing to push the envelope in innovation and change the way we work, live and play.


The market seems to be offering this statement for growth investors: [Don't forget about the N in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/new-product/).

Wednesday will mark [IBD Live's 150th episode](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).


Meanwhile, at least eight stocks on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) rallied 1% or more Tuesday.


The Nasdaq: Beyond 10,000, What Now?
------------------------------------


[Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) reiterated key levels to watch for the Nasdaq that would indicate a significant pullback is underway.


You can pinpoint these levels, including a break of a lower channel line at 9525, in the latest edition of [Weekend Stock Market Update](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-update-raging-bull-charges-higher/).


Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ETF sank 2.1%, ending a six-day surge. Yet midcaps have been doing a decent job of playing catch-up, lately. The MidCap 400, trading near 348, now stands just 7% beneath its 52-week peak.

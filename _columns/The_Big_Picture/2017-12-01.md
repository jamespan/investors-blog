U.S. stock indexes plunged late morning Friday on news potentially harmful to President Trump but then fought back and trimmed most of the day's losses.




 The Nasdaq closed off 0.4% after being down as much as 2%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trimmed their losses to 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.5%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, allowing the indexes to dodge [distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). Distribution requires rising volume.

The technical action in the market looked good. The slashing of the indexes' losses and closes high in the day's range were positive signs.


The sharp sell-off came on news that Michael Flynn, the former national security advisor, pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. Although President Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13 for reportedly lying to Vice President Pence, there are concerns that Flynn might implicate Trump in wrongdoing.


The market's initial panic gave way to calm buying.


Still, the news broke at an inopportune time. The U.S. Senate appeared poised to approve its version of the Republican tax-cut package, even after stalling the measure late Thursday.


At the market's close, the Senate still hadn't voted on the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republicans had enough votes to pass the tax-cut bill. That leaves the door open to market reaction in the coming week.


For the week, the stock indexes were mostly up. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.9%; the S&P 500, 1.5%; and the small-cap Russell 2000, 1.2%. The Nasdaq fell 0.6% for the week.


During the week, financial news was generally encouraging.



On Monday, new-home sales in October rolled in 10% higher than expected. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) exchange traded fund rose 2.6% for the week. The homebuilder ETF has risen in 13 of the past 14 weeks.


On Friday, construction spending for October jumped 1.4%, almost triple the 0.5% expected.


The second reading on Q3 GDP came in at 3.3% Wednesday, matching expectations.

The stock market rally continued Tuesday as Wall Street got more good news on the inflation front. Even better, several top-rated growth stocks closed with strong gains, although many closed off well off highs after reports of Russian missiles landing in Poland.




Good news on October producer prices added to last week's benign consumer price index. Wholesale prices rose 8% year over year, below September's 8.5% and under the 8.3% consensus. Core prices rose 6.7% year over year, also below September's 7.2% and under the 7.2% consensus.


The stock market has been rallying on hopes the Federal Reserve won't have to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as initially thought.


After four straight 75-basis-point hikes by the Fed, [futures traders](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) think there's an 85% chance of a 50-basis-point hike at the Dec. 13-14 meeting. Looking ahead to the February meeting, traders now favor a 25-basis-point hike. But the stock market will have plenty of economic data to ponder between now and then.


The stock market came under pressure in early afternoon trading after the Associated Press and Reuters reported that Russian missiles hit Poland, killing two people. Poland has called an emergency security meeting to discuss the attack on their homeland.


Reports also said Russia bombarded Ukraine with another wave of missile attacks soon after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed a peace plan at the G-20 Summit in Indonesia.

What To Do Now
--------------


The confirmed uptrend is showing signs of strength but the S&P 500 is closing in on potential resistance at the 200-day moving average. The index was turned away from the 200-day line in mid-August.


With the stock market tide flowing positive, it's a good time to increase exposure. But do it judiciously, as opposed to jumping back into the market all at once.


For example, if you were 30% invested, maybe you're 50% invested now. Or. if you were 50% invested, perhaps you increased your exposure to 70%-75%.


Just make sure you're getting positive feedback from new buys. Stocks are definitely acting better but there are a lot of extended rallies out there, so be careful not to chase and buy too high.


Several stocks that have broken out recently are doing a good job holding gains.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) continues to perform well after clearing a bottoming base on Nov. 4. **Halozyme Therapeutics** ([HALO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HALO)) and **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)) are also showing strength and support after recent breakouts.


On the flip side, lithium producers like **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) and **Livent** ([LTHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTHM)) lost altitude, falling 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively.


Chinese electric vehicle trade publication CnEVPost noted "a downward inflection point in lithium prices could come as early as the second half of 2023."

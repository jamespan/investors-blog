Stocks ended with modest gains Monday after starting off the session in choppy fashion. Leading stocks acted well.

  

The Nasdaq rose 0.4% to its highest close since March 28, 2000. It's been trading sideways for about a week, pausing after surging 13% off its Oct. 15 low.

  

Helped by the strength in transportation stocks, the S&P 500 climbed 0.3% to another record high. Transports are one sector that's seeing a large number of new highs. (See the list of new highs on Page B1.)

  

Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 finished near their session highs after struggling for direction early on.

  

Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 0.5%. The IBD 50 did even better with a 1.1% gain. That's its best performance so far this month.

  

Winners beat losers by about 9-to-7 on the NYSE and by more than 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq. Volume fell across the board from Friday's already light pace. Veterans Day is Tuesday, so investors can expect another quiet session in the stock market. The bond market will be closed Tuesday.

  

Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are in sharp uptrends. Distribution remains light. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each have just one bout of distribution since the Oct. 21 follow-through. And leading stocks continue to perform. These are positive factors going for the market.

  

On Monday, new issue **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) ramped to another new high. It's now 19% past a 99.80 buy point from an [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm). The stock is close to triggering a hold rule.

  

Stocks that rally 20% or more within three weeks of a breakout should be held for at least eight weeks, unless sell signals appear.

  

**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) bounced back from three lackluster days to score a new high. It closed 7% past a 231.51 buy point from a flat base.

  

**Vasco Data Security International** ([VDSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDSI)) and **Sierra Wireless** ([SWIR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWIR)) were also up in well above average volume on the session.

  

On the downside, **WhiteWave Foods** ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)) reversed lower after clearing a 38.22 buy point from a base. It slumped as much as 8% below the buy point, marking a sell signal.

  

While there have been few casualties among leaders, investors still need to recognize and act on sell signals when they occur.

  

Always cut losses at a maximum of 7% or 8%. Sell a stock before it wipes out a double-digit gain. You don't have to wait for a 7% or 8% loss in that case.

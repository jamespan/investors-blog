Is it small caps' turn to take a breather now?




Judging by how the Russell 2000 acted on Tuesday, one could certainly begin making this conclusion.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund slumped 2% for the day, easily its worst single-day drop in the second quarter so far. At one point, the small-cap ETF dropped as much as 2.9%.


A two-day combined decline of 3.3% hardly compares with the three-day, 6.6% drubbing this ETF took from March 22 to 24. However, the latest action marks the second time in roughly four weeks for the index to dwell, even briefly, underneath its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Volume in the ETF Tuesday came in 11% above average, also the highest in April so far.



The S&P 500 slipped 0.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite lost just slightly more than 0.9%. All three indexes currently trade above their 50-day moving averages.


Beyond Russell 2000: Sector Rotation Again?
-------------------------------------------


Volume proved mixed.


![MP042021](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP042021-209x300.jpg)


The Nasdaq showed lower turnover vs. Monday. This suggested mutual funds, banks, large investment advisors, state and local pensions, and insurers weren't that eager to dump stock.


On Tuesday, these investors also showed an inclination to accumulate stocks that carry the investment theme that the coronavirus will be with us for a long time. Just look at the bullish action seen lately by vaccine developer **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), whose Janssen unit successfully created the one-shot vaccine to shield against Covid-19's worst complications.


BioNTech has risen more than 20% in less than two weeks after clearing a 131.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a 39%-deep [consolidation base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). That triggers the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/). J&J, part of the Dow industrials, is crafting a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/).


"Re-opening plays," however, got torched. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) and **Allegiant Travel** ([ALGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGT)) all fell hard. Still, the Dow Jones transportation average gained nearly 0.7% on the back of merger mania within the railroad industry.


Boeing got front-and-center attention during [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A).


NYSE volume rose vs. the prior session. Thus, the S&P 500 got nicked with a [second distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) over the past 25 trading sessions.


At the current level of only two distribution days, large funds are perhaps not dumping shares en masse.


One Step Forward, Two Steps Back?
---------------------------------


However, what should concern active investors is how some new breakouts in recent weeks have turned out to be disappointing.



Homebuilder **Green Brick Partners** ([GRBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRBK)), down 11% for the week, offers a new example. Admittedly, the base that began forming in November is not your best example of a well-formed cup. It lacks symmetry. Shares spent considerable time beneath their 50-day line. Yet Green Brick stock showed plenty of solid gains in heavy volume in the final two weeks of March. The small cap powered past a pair of buy points, including 25.15. But the stock has done a complete round trip of its gains from the two breakout points.


For sure, buying stocks at highs, with the hope that they have the institutional demand to carry them to new highs, entails significant risk, even if the major averages continue to mark higher highs and higher lows. That's why the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) offers a sturdy safety net for the prudent growth stock investor.


When you feel that the market is too choppy to aim for [gains in the 20%-25% range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/), here's one small adjustment that could help: Aim to take profits at 10% to 15% from a breakout point. Cut losses at 3% to 5%. That way, you preserve a win-to-loss ratio of 3-to-1.


Two Assets Rising Now
---------------------


In the meantime, gold and long-term U.S. Treasury bonds have showed much better action since the start of April.


Does the rise in gold, which tacked on 0.5% to $1,779 an ounce on Tuesday, reflect higher expectations of inflation? Perhaps. The current 4% rebound since March 31 in SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) has come amid a stronger-than-expected rise in U.S. consumer prices. On April 13, the CPI index showed a 0.6% gain in March vs. February. That beat the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 0.5%. Core retail prices also beat expectations.


Meantime, some observers are pinning the rise in gold on near-term weakness in the U.S. dollar.


In addition, what's going on with U.S. Treasuries?


Cboe data shows the benchmark 10-year bond is now yielding 1.56%; on March 30, the yield was at 1.75%, hitting 13-month highs.


Is this short-covering? Foreign investors grabbing bonds with both fists?


"I think a better explanation as to why the bond market staged its late-week rally is how well the $271 billion in new Treasury supply was auctioned off," Louis Navellier, a veteran portfolio manager, wrote in a note to clients.


"The removal of yield-risk to the investing landscape means that the rally can sustain its extended and overbought condition for a while," Navellier added. "The market has bought into the Fed's rhetoric that any notion of tapering is not under consideration for some time, so interest rates will remain historically low relative to inflation."

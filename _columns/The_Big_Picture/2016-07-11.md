Stocks muscled higher on Monday, echoing investors' collective sigh of relief from last week's surprise June payrolls report.


A strong advance by small caps seemed to hint at growing confidence that America and the R word -- or recession -- should not be uttered in the same sentence.


So, will the summer continue to favor the market bulls?


It's always a bad idea to try to predict even the near-term future, especially when overseas events and other developments continue to have such a dramatic effect on U.S. equities. No one really knows how the quarterly earnings season, for instance, is going to shape up.


![MP071116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP071116-175x300.jpg)Yet for now, one cannot help but take note that the small-cap S&P 600, which tends to stand in the shadow of its taller, older brother -- the large-cap S&P 500 -- led Monday's gains with a 1.1% rally and its best close since June of 2015.


That gain overshadowed the S&P 500's 0.3% lift and a 0.4% advance by the Dow Jones industrial average. While a wide variety of industry groups led the market's upside, oil, food and nonalcoholic beverage stocks sat out with losses of 0.4% or more.


The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, touched 5000 for the first time this year; its 0.6% gain was enough to hand the tech-rich index its highest close in 2016 at 4988. Now the Nasdaq stands less than 5% below an all-time peak of 5231. Volume fell on the two major exchanges.


New investors may be loath to buy stocks when some measures show that U.S. equities are at new highs. The "buy low, sell high" mentality runs deep. Yet for now, the market is doing what it's supposed to do when it issues a key timing signal such as the one on [June 30](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-indexes-signal-uptrend-but-there-are-reasons-for-caution/). On that day, the Nasdaq rallied 1.3% in heavy turnover and followed through on a new advance. Such Day 3 follow-throughs are truly rare. Normally it takes at least four days of trading action for a major index to mark a follow-through, which offers astute investors the earliest possible signal that a major turn in the market may be at hand.


IBD's research of market tops and bottoms going back to the year 1900 shows that every major new advance by equities was confirmed by such a follow-through. The strong gain in heavier trade, occurring several days to weeks after an initial up-day, captures the action by large investors eager to accumulate shares.


Monday's action was no different. As the Market Pulse table shows, leading stocks in the internet, software, consumer and medical sectors attracted big volume as they each rose 1% or more. The "Leaders down in volume" section deserves equal attention as well; **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), a leader in the field of customer relationship management in Big Pharma, fell 1.2% in above-average trade, but the decline came only after three straight days of big gains in heavy volume. The stock is back in buy range from a secondary entry at 35.79.


Veeva represents small-cap leadership. With 134 million shares outstanding, the Pleasanton, Calif., firm has a market cap of just under $5 billion. But it's no mighty mite in terms of fundamentals. The Leaderboard member's earnings per share have ballooned from 3 cents a share in fiscal 2012 (ended in January that year) to 51 cents in fiscal 2016. Revenue expanded 570% from $61 million to $409 million over the same time frame.
When stocks of companies with market values in the $500 million to $5 billion range go up, so do the chances that an individual investor will land a stock with the capacity to break out, rush to new highs and post gains of 20% to 25% or more in a limited amount of time.


Four of the 11 long-idea stocks on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) are small-cap in size. The other seven range in value from $12 billion (mid cap) to $32 billion (big cap) and higher.


While Q2 earnings among S&P 500 firms are expected to fall 5.1%, analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence note that the second quarter will likely be the fourth quarter in a row of falling profits. The bust in oil prices since July 2014 has been a big drag on overall profits. But the silver lining is that come the third quarter, the market will see large-cap firms facing easier year-over-year comparisons.


"If the sequential improvement in growth holds up as earnings season unfolds, that would mean that Q1 was in fact the trough in the earnings recession," analyst Lindsey Bell wrote in a report Wednesday.


"This is now the fourth quarter in a row to show a decline in earnings growth, an occurrence that hasn't happened since 2009. We are finally starting to see the issues that have plagued the last three quarters subside -- namely, oil prices ascended to $50 a barrel (it was *only* 21% lower year-over-year on average during the quarter), and the U.S. dollar relinquished its strength (the US Dollar Index was 1.5% lower on average)."

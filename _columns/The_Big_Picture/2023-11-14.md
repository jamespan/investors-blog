The stock market powered higher Tuesday as Wall Street cheered another tame [inflation report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/tame-cpi-inflation-in-october-puts-sp-500-rally-back-in-gear/). Advancers swamped decliners on the NYSE by nearly 11-to-1. Winners beat losers on the Nasdaq by about 7-to-2.




On a year-over-year basis, [consumer prices were up 3.2% in October](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/tame-cpi-inflation-in-october-puts-sp-500-rally-back-in-gear/), below the 3.3% consensus. Core prices, which exclude food and energy costs, were up 4%, slightly better than the 4.1% estimate.


Inflation remains elevated, but the new data eliminated the chance of another interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve through the Jan. 31 meeting, according to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). Now, futures traders think there's a better-than-60% chance that the Fed could start cutting rates as early as May.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Small caps outperformed by a wide margin. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) gapped above its 50-day line, rising 5.5%. It was the largest one-day percentage gain for IWM since a 6.2% rise on Nov. 10, 2022. Note that the small-cap ETF is still below its 200-day moving average, a potential resistance level to watch.

The Nasdaq composite gapped above the 14,000 level, closing with a gain of 2.4%. After rising above its October high Friday, the index now has its sights set on its early-September high of 14,149.

The S&P 500 jumped 1.9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4%. It was a solid accumulation day for the indexes as volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose sharply from Monday.


Strong breadth was confirmed by the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), which jumped nearly 2.9%. Over on the Nasdaq, the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) rallied 2.9%, better than a gain of almost 2.2% for the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)).


The latest stock market uptrend started with follow-through days for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2, respectively. There's only been one distribution day for each index since then, making stock market bulls more confident that the year-end rally could have more legs. As always, monitor higher-volume declines in the indexes because a clustering of distribution days can cause problems for a nascent uptrend.


For now, leading growth stocks look just fine. For the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio, the invested percentage is now north of 90%. As a result of Tuesday's strong gains, IBD's recommended invested percentage goes up to 80% to 100% from 60% to 80%.


Money flowed into bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 19 basis points to 4.44%. That fueled a huge rally in homebuilders, with the group up more than 5% for the day. The homebuilding group was one of 27 groups in IBD's database that rallied 5% or more. The building, retail, and banking sectors were well represented.


Movers And Shakers
------------------


Inside the homebuilder group, **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) gapped up close to the top of a base, along with **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)), **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)). **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) gapped up to an all-time high and broke out past an 82.39 handle buy point.


Also in the building sector, **Comfort Systems** ([FIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIX)), a provider of heating, ventilation and air conditioning services to commercial customers, cleared a cup-with-handle base. There wasn't much of a shakeout as the handle formed, but FIX held support at the 10-day line. Note that Tuesday's breakout over a 191.27 entry came in unimpressive volume. But volume was heavy when FIX stormed above its 50-day line in late October.

Market leadership was strong outside of the building sector. In the financial sector, IBD's investment management group gapped above its 200-day line, rising 3.6%. Inside the group, **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)) gapped out of a nine-week consolidation, while group peer **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)) regained its 50-day line. After a support week two weeks ago, APO is only 6% off its high.



Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) soared more than 14% in strong turnover. But SMCI's weekly chart has a wide and loose look to it, characterized by erratic weekly price swings. Note that SMCI remains in a downtrend as well.


In the technology sector, **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) gapped up as the provider of a cloud-based platform for businesses forms a double-bottom base. It's just below a 67.60 entry. SHOP joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Tuesday as a half position (about a 6% weighting).

U.S. stock indexes sagged for an eighth straight day, but lower volume eased part of the pain.


The Nasdaq lost 0.9%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.4%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average shaved off 0.2%. The IBD 50 dropped 0.7%.


![mp110316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP110316.png)Volume declined on both major exchanges, allowing the indexes to dodge further [distribution](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). Distribution involves an index loss in rising volume and points to institutional selling. In the past eight sessions, five were distribution days. (The Sept. 29 distribution day was erased Thursday due to time.)


Given the cluster of distribution and the losing streak, bears ought to own this market. But if the indexes have suffered claw marks, few of the cuts are big enough to require stitches. The last time a loss reached well over 1% was Oct. 11, when the Market Pulse switched to uptrend under pressure.


However, the Nasdaq lost 0.9% in each of the past two days. Is the market poised for a sharp plunge or a vigorous rebound? The Nasdaq is approaching the 5,000 level. This was an area that the composite had trouble clearing in April and June — before breaking the resistance in July. So, a test of support at 5,000 would be natural. The S&P 500 is almost testing its 200-day line for support.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *With the S&P 500 in its worst losing streak in eight years, [Apple and Citigroup fell below buy points](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-q3-earnings-when-good-is-not-quite-good-enough/) on Thursday, with Microsoft and Bank of America just hanging on heading into Friday's big employment report.*

On Thursday, leaders were split between those feeling pressure and those putting the pressure on short sellers.


Data center gear maker **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) popped about 2% in heavy volume. The stock has been recovering from a decline that began in early 2015. The company reported Q3 results Oct. 26, beating the Street's consensus numbers on earnings and sales.


F5 is outperforming the market. The stock's relative strength line is at a 52-week high and rising sharply.


Meanwhile, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) owned some of the ugliest action of the day. The stock gapped down 6% in heavy volume despite quarterly results after Wednesday's close that beat on the top and bottom lines. The culprit was weak guidance on ad revenue growth.


Facebook was one of many leading stocks that have sold off following earnings reports. The heavy selling in the top stocks is a troubling aspect of the current market.


From a technical standpoint, three indicators are hinting at a short-term market bottom.


First, the put/call volume ratio closed at 1.23 Tuesday and 1.18 Thursday. Markets often are near a bottom when the secondary indicator reaches 1.15 or higher.


Second, the percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day line fell to 48% Thursday. The percentage was as high as 81% in early September.


Third, the balance between bullish and bearish advisors is looking more favorable for a possible bottom. Bulls are at 41.7% and bears 24.3%. While this isn't ideal, the 17.4 point difference hasn't been that small since June 29, when it hit 17.8. At that time, the market was just beginning a nice rally.


One factor that hasn't improved much is the low number of new highs. A healthy uptrend will deliver new highs in shovelfuls.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) reported quarterly results after the close. The coffee king delivered modest beats on the top and bottom lines. Shares rose less than 1% in after-hours trade. Starbucks has been slouching sideways since almost exactly a year ago. Like F5 Networks, Starbucks might be worth watching.


In economic news, Challenger, Gray & Christmas posted the lowest layoff number in five months. PMI Services, Q3 productivity and factory orders also topped estimates. On the negative side, first-time jobless claims missed views and were the highest in almost three months. Also, the ISM nonmanufacturing gauge was weaker than expected.


Coming up Friday: The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Employment Situation report for October. The Street expects nonfarm payrolls to rise by 178,000. Estimates range from 155,000 to 200,000. In September, the estimate fell short by almost 7%.

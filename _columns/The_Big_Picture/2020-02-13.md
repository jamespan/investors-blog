Stock Market Rally Sets More Record Highs
-----------------------------------------


The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 set record highs Thursday, again, before turning lower. The stock market snapped back from sharp losses at the open Thursday, displaying significant strength in the face of surprising bad news in the coronavirus outbreak. The number of new cases jumped after a few days of slowing spread.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP021320-237x300.jpg)The Nasdaq's Jan. 29 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), when the index stalled, fell off the count because the Nasdaq moved up 5% from that day's closing price. But the composite still has two distribution days because Tuesday's stalling day now gets added as distribution under our rules. The S&P 500 still has four distribution days.


Keep in mind that the Nasdaq is still stretched from potential support levels after a strong rally since Feb. 2. Including Thursday, there have been only two down days in February so far. The tech-heavy composite remains at the high end of an [upper channel line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rises-confidently-unitedhealth-nike-lead-dow-jones/), indicating a pullback would be quite natural.


Reactions to earnings results from top companies were mixed Thursday. Leaderboard member **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) [surged as much as 6%](https://www.investors.com/news/tempur-sealy-earnings-q4-2019-tempur-sealy-stock/) to a session high of 100.39 before closing with a slight loss. Elsewhere, Chinese leader **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) dropped more than 1.5% on its [earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-earnings-q3-2020-alibaba-stock/). Still, the e-commerce giant is above its 50-day line after finding support at that level earlier in the week.


Meanwhile, top stock of 2020 **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) reversed from a 4% loss to close with a nearly 5% advance. The stock sold off at the market open after the company [announced a $2 billion stock offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-drops-announcing-stock-offering/). This type of strength should give investors confidence in the current stock market rally. Shares of the electric-auto maker have surged as much as 168% past a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) 361.30 buy point.

Earnings To Watch: Datadog, Nvidia, Roku
----------------------------------------



Hot IPO stock **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) fell 3% ahead of the [company's earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/datadog-earnings-ddog-stock-news-q42019/) after the close Thursday. The software leader ended Thursday's sessions about 10% above a 44.19 entry in a cup base. After the close, the new issue dropped more than 5% to about 46 a share in extended trading despite topping Q4 analyst targets and reporting strong guidance.


Graphics chipmaker **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) reported [strong Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-earnings-q4-2020-nvda-stock/), sending shares up more than 6% in the after-hours session to about 288 a share. The company topped analyst earnings and sales estimates.


Nvidia has climbed as much as 45% from a cup with handle's 188.50 buy point. In late January, the stock rebounded from the 50-day moving average, offering investors an add-on entry in the chip leader. According to [IBD Stock Checkup,](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) Nvidia stock [has a strong 96](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-corp-nvda.aspx) out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The Composite Rating helps investors easily gauge the quality of a stock's technical and fundamental metrics.



Meanwhile, **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) reported [better-than-expected Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q4-2019-roku-stock/), sparking a 5% gain in late trade to about 146 a share. The company beat the Street's estimates and raised guidance in the current quarter.


Roku stock is shaping a new base with a 168.95 buy point, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares recently reclaimed their 50-day line in solid volume, a bullish start to the right side of the formation. Roku was a [top performer in 2019](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stocks-roku-stock-use-skyscrapers-volume-identify-breakout/), moving up as much as 137% from a deep cup with handle's 74.45 buy point.

title: Nasdaq, S&P 500 Commit This Faux Pas; Strength Continues In These Industry Sectors

The Nasdaq composite turned a promising early rebound into another disappointing session for stock market bulls. A gain of as much as 2% dissolved into a 0.3% loss.




As you can see on the daily chart, the tech-weighted index showed an [outside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-an-outside-day-in-stock-charts/). That is, the high and low of Tuesday's trading day exceeded the high and low watermarks of Monday's session. Such action pointed to uncertainty on Wall Street.


And during periods of relatively mild weakness in stocks, nothing makes traders more hesitant to load up on beaten-down shares than uncertainty.


One source of uncertainty for Nasdaq and NYSE stocks now? How managers at the country's biggest companies are handling ultra-key issues such as rising inflation and the cost of borrowing.


" 'Are you having any trouble passing on your costs?' The answers from corporate leaders reporting their first-quarter results will be the best evidence of how much the Ukraine War and China's Covid resurgence may threaten future growth," Christopher Smart, chief global strategist and head of the Barings Investment Institute, wrote in a recent note.


"For now, consumer sentiment is sagging amid rising gasoline prices and relentless headlines about inflation, but retail sales are strong and savings are high," Smart added. "At least some of these higher input prices will start showing up in narrower profit margins, but markets have moderated earnings expectations substantially."


Nasdaq Today: More Institutional Selling?
-----------------------------------------



A slight increase in volume on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session meant that the Nasdaq also chalked up a fourth day of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or heavy professional selling, over the past 25 sessions.


And in fact, these distribution days have actually taken place within a six-session span. Such clustering is generally a bearish sign.


Just look at the period of roughly three weeks from Nov. 22 (also a bad reversal and an outside day) to Dec. 14. IBD counted at least four distribution days, and they all showed significant declines each time â€” from a 1.3% drop on Nov. 22 to a 1.9% slide on Dec. 3.


Soon afterward, the current outlook darkened to "uptrend under pressure," meaning that all new buys in breakout stocks warranted extra caution.


Meanwhile on Tuesday, the S&P 500 also fell dramatically off its early-session highs, turning a 1.3% gain into a 0.3% loss. Volume was lower on the NYSE. A technical battle for support at the S&P 500's [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/), which has been rising the past week and a half, continues.


Small Caps: A Less-Than-Savory Gain
-----------------------------------


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond sank 5 basis points to 2.72%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average mirrored the S&P 500's action, also ending off 0.3%. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) diverged, but its 0.3% gain perhaps broke a five-day slide in the ugliest way possible. Not only did the small-cap gauge finish near its intraday lows, but the small-cap ETF also seemed to cower in its attempt to step up above its own [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Given the recent downgrade in IBD's outlook for growth stocks, the negative reversal likely surprised few regular readers of this column.


Only a limited number of market sectors are actually justifying the fact that technically Wall Street is still in a confirmed uptrend since March 16.


Most of the gains by the key equity indexes have vanished, with equity trading desks feasting on recent, short upward swings.


And these whipsawing ways have been repeated in many breakouts, especially among Nasdaq-listed companies outside the cyclical sectors.

Wilting Juniper
---------------


Take **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)). The expert in data networking gear started its breakout in fine form on March 25. Shares gained 2.4% and volume climbed 40% above its average over the prior 50 sessions.



Two days later, Juniper shares rose to as high as 37.73. At that price, the midcap growth stock still actually traded within the 5% buy zone from a 36.13 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Yet since March 30, Juniper has now fallen in nine of the past 10 sessions. Only in three of those down days did investors see turnover jump above average. Yet the damage has been done. The stock is close to triggering the [golden rule of investing](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) by the [CAN SLIM method](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). It also fell below its 50-day line.


Juniper did not possess the requisite, solid 20%-to-25% increases or more in earnings and sales in recent quarters ahead of the stock's breakout.


Meanwhile, other tech companies on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE with outstanding CAN SLIM fundamentals continue to digest their magnificent gains over the prior two years.


The long game still appears to be best played within the oil and gas, metals, agriculture and infrastructure fields. Dozens of stocks in these sectors got covered in detail during [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A).


Another Stock Market Leader Outside The Nasdaq
----------------------------------------------



While light sweet crude oil jumped past $100 a barrel on Tuesday, coal stocks continued to show luster. **Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)) has pulled back in normal fashion after a hot run past a 26.23 breakout from a 13-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) back on Jan. 3.


Shares look poised for a potential rebound off the 10-week moving average, a [key follow-on buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-why-the-10-week-line-offers-follow-on-buy-points/).

Nasdaq Leads Stock Market Rally On New Trump Stimulus Offer; 3 Top Stocks Form New Bases
=========================================================================================

The Nasdaq composite led the stock market higher Friday after President Donald Trump upped the White House's coronavirus stimulus offer. The tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 1.4%, handily beating the other major stock indexes.




The S&P 500 rallied 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 moved up nearly 0.6%.


Leading growth stocks also outperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) moved up 1.9%. In the IBD 50, **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) and **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) advanced 4.4% and 5.1%, respectively. Both are among many stocks running up the right sides of new base formations. Be on the lookout for [potential breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


The market appeared to climb on renewed hopes for a coronavirus relief package. Trump [raised a proposal to $1.8 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/trump-raises-coronavirus-stimulus-offer-to-1point8-trillion-sources-say.html), while Democrats sought more than $2 trillion.


Stock Market Rally Continues
----------------------------


![MP100920](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP100920-239x300.jpg)Marking a three-day win streak, the Nasdaq is methodically advancing after [the previous week's positive action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gives-bullish-signal/). Bullishly, the Nasdaq took the lead Friday, easily beating the other major stock indexes.


A report that **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) [plans to acquire](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/xilinx-stock-up-acquisition-talk-semiconductor-stocks-branch/) **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) helped chip stocks rally, and the technology sector in general led.


But Nasdaq volume was slightly lower from Thursday's turnover, depriving the composite of a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) day.


A follow-through would have provided extra confirmation of the current stock market uptrend. The Dow Jones industrials' follow-through on Sept. 30 caused IBD to switch its market outlook to "confirmed uptrend."


Institutional selling remains light, so the stock market is more likely to be resilient in the face of negative headlines.


Investors should still be building exposure amid a growing number of breakouts among top growth stocks. As more and more breakouts occur and gain traction, you should feel more confident in the health of the uptrend. However, if the market action takes a turn for the worse, be flexible and start to scale out of your positions.

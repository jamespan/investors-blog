An optimistic Wall Street started a week chock-full of stock market headlines with gains Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its win streak to 11 sessions, the longest in more than six years.




The Dow climbed 0.5% and did it with relative ease. It sprang up from the open and sailed undisturbed until a late pullback. If it rises Tuesday, the Dow will match a 12-session win streak that ended Feb. 27, 2017, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The industrial average — still lagging the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in year-to-date-performance — is the current leading index. It climbed to an April 2022 high, and its July gain of nearly 3% is beating the other main indexes.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) contributed 46 points to the Dow's 183-point advance. The investment bank rose for a sixth straight day. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) added 2%, taking it to the highest point since February 2022.


**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) added 20 points to the Dow. The oil giant gapped up 1.97% after it surprised the stock market with a [preannouncement of second-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/chevron-announces-leadership-shakeup-as-q2-profits-slip-nearly-50/) on Sunday that beat analysts' estimates. It also said it waived the mandatory retirement age for CEO Mike Wirth, 62. And CFO Pierre Breber will retire next year.


Chevron's news added to the energy sector's rebound. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) climbed 1.6% and closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since May 1. Nymex crude for September delivery rose 2.2% to $78.74 per barrel.


S&P 500, Nasdaq Fade
--------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP072423-244x300.jpg)The S&P 500 closed 0.4% higher but that was off its earlier pace. The Nasdaq composite almost wiped out the day's gains but finished 0.2% higher.


It was generally a lackluster day for growth stocks. The IShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 0.3%.


The IBD 50 index fell 0.8%, and that was mainly due to three big losers. **Symbotic** ([SYM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYM)) and **Lemonade** ([LMND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMND)) slid more than 6%. **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)) gapped below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume after earnings beat views, but the airline cited higher operating costs and gave a cautious outlook.


The Russell 2000 rose 0.3%.


Volume rose on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq from Friday's levels.


The rebalancing of the tech-bloated Nasdaq 100 index went into effect Monday. The unusual move was designed to reduce an excessive weighting in seven major stocks that came to account for about 55% of the index.


The rebalance reduced that weighting to 44%, Goldman Sachs Research Chief U.S. Equity Strategist David Kostin [said in a podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21qmjYfXEPs&t=250s). **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) weighting got cut from about 7.5% to 4.5%, while **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) went from 13% to 10%, Kostin said. **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) are some of the stock gaining exposure in the Nasdaq 100.


The Magnificent Seven held up well Monday. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) dug a bit more below its 21-day exponential moving average.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) reversed to the upside and closed 3.5% higher despite a downgrade from UBS. Analysts Patrick Hummel, David Lesne and Juan Perez-Carrascosa cut the EV stock to neutral from buy.


The recent strong share performance "fully reflects the strong demand response seen after the price cuts, as well as a solid execution in 2024," the analysts said. At the same time, they raised the price target to 270 from 220.


Multiple Headlines For Stock Market
-----------------------------------


The [earnings calendar this week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) is one of the heaviest. The notables include **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and Microsoft Tuesday; **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) on Wednesday; **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) on Thursday.


On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the Fed funds rate by a quarter point. What is less certain is the Fed's strategy after it takes that step.


In economic news Monday, the S&P Global Flash U.S. Composite PMI fell in July to 52.0 from 53.2 the previous month, dropping to a five-month low.


While the service sector continued to drive growth, manufacturers reported mainly unchanged levels of production as Q3 started.


"July is seeing an unwelcome combination of slower economic growth, weaker job creation, gloomier business confidence and sticky inflation," Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in the report.


Overall output growth across manufacturing and services is consistent with GDP expanding at an annualized quarterly rate of about 1.5% at the start of the third quarter. That's down from a 2% pace the survey indicated in the second quarter.

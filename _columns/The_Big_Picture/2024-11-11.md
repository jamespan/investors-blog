  Small Caps Shine In Stock Market, But Equal-Weighted S&P 500 Gauge Does Fine; This Is The Biggest Risk Factor Now

After a tremendous rush of buying last week, the stock market showed at least two key themes on Monday. One, investors still showed a bullish appetite for small caps. And two, traders decided to digest some profits among larger stocks.




A daily look at how the indexes acted serves a useful purpose for the above reason, even if IBD readers prefer to trade stocks, not stock market benchmarks. While the Nasdaq 100 edged a fraction of a point lower, it did fall back from an opening high of 21,182, a brand-new record. Yet a 10-point loss by the Nasdaq 100 doesn't even qualify as a pinprick compared with gains of more than 5.7% over the prior four trading days.


The S&P 500, meanwhile, strode to a new high of 6,017 on Monday before easing to 6,001, up only 0.1%. That gain adds minimally to last week's 4.7% catapult on the results of U.S. elections last Tuesday.


A close look at the weekly chart of the S&P 500 is worthwhile. Notice how the large-cap index refused to fall below its rising 10-week moving average (plotted in red on IBD weekly charts).

Stock Market Today
------------------



Action among the [Magnificent Seven megacaps](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) was decisively mixed. This hurt the S&P 500, which is market cap-weighted. So, it's worth noting too that the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ETF did better, rallying 0.5% and marking its seventh straight win.


Still, the star of Monday's stock market was the mighty mites on Wall Street. The Russell 2000 rose 1.5% on Monday, on top of a 8.6% explosive move higher last week. At 2,434, the Russell stands only 1% away from taking out its Nov. 8, 2021, peak of 2,458.86.


Meanwhile, the "value" components of the stock market appeared to generally outperform.


Looking at the 1,000 largest stocks covered by the Russell indexes, iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) advanced nearly 0.6%. That easily beat a 15-cent loss, less than 0.1%, by iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average grew nearly 0.7%. A related sector index did even better: The Dow transportation average rallied 1.2% amid a sharp drop in crude oil prices. Gasoline futures fell 2.6% and finished the day at $1.96 a gallon.

Mixed Stock Market Turnover
---------------------------


Volume grew on the Nasdaq while turnover on the NYSE declined from Friday's levels.


The higher turnover posed a small concern for the Nasdaq, as it appeared as if some traders sold into the early advance of today's stock market. Such action is typical for a stalling session. However, the Nasdaq finished above the upper 50% range of Monday's trading. Hence, based on [Market School rules](https://get.investors.com/online-courses/market-school/), the close did not meet the requirement for this type of distribution.


Either way, as the Market Pulse illustrates, the distribution-day count for the Nasdaq had gotten wiped totally clean in recent sessions. That's due to the powerful rally that began on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, with just two institutional-level sell-offs on its books over a rolling 25-session count, indicates that the buyers are more energetic than the sellers.


When the [Aug. 13 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dow-jones-sp500-nasdaq-inflation-starbucks-chipotle/) took place, the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were at a D grade or worse. The rating tracks 13 weeks of price-and-volume action. In selecting stocks, you'd much prefer to see candidates show a grade better than C, which is neutral.


Yet in terms of the indexes, it's actually not uncommon to see a very poor A/D rating at the start of strong tradable rallies.


Headed into Monday's stock market action, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 held a [B Accumulation grade](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI_110824.pdf).


Since that pivotal session on Aug. 13, the Nasdaq has risen about 20%, the S&P 500 10.4% and the Russell 2000 16.2%.

Industry Groups Today
---------------------


A look at the day's leading industries reflected what has been gradually happening throughout the year: Leadership in the stock market is broadening.


As many as 31 industries covered by IBD rose 2% or more. They spanned from automakers (the best, up 6.6% on a price-weighted basis) and trucking (up 2.5%) to Midwest banks (up 3.3%) and investment banks (up 2.4%).


**Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), operator of a host of brand name RVs such as Airstream, is not a stock market leader yet. But the cyclical spending play attempted a breakout from an [early-stage cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/) that offers a 115.86 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Thor rose 5.6% to 114.91 in average turnover and paced the Building-Mobile Manufacturing and Recreational Vehicle industry group to a market-beating 2.3% rise.


As the Treasury bond yield curve continues to bend more positively in favor of lenders, it's likely no surprise that banks of all shapes and geographies have been doing so well.



With less than two months left in the year, what are real risks to the current rally?


What's Your 'Giddy Level'?
--------------------------


One area to watch within the stock market? Eye signs of excessive optimism. Are we there yet? Likely not.


[Margin debt in September](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=margindebt) grew 19% vs. year ago levels. That's clear evidence that the animal spirits are rising. Yet it's nowhere near levels seen in March 2021, when the amount of money borrowed by investors to speculate in stocks shot to 71%.


As noted on the chart, IBD states that the "year-over-year percentage change in margin debt can help flag major tops in bull markets. This contrarian sentiment indicator will exceed 55% when optimism runs rampant on Wall Street and investors are heavily borrowing money during the late stages of a bull market."

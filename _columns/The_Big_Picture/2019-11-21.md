You'd think a sell-off in semiconductor equipment stocks in the stock market Thursday would've sparked some stiff selling in the Nasdaq composite, but that wasn't the case at all. The stock market has shown uncanny resilience amid occasional daunting headlines, and it was more of the same Thursday.




Chip-equipment firms weakened after UBS slapped sell ratings on three leaders: **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)). While Applied Materials and Lam Research continue to hold above recent buy points and their 50-day moving averages, KLA [flashed a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) with a decisive break of its 50-day line.


IBD's chip-equipment group lost nearly 4%, but the Nasdaq traded in a tight range and showed another inside day, falling just 0.2%.


The Dow Jones extended its losing streak to three sessions, down 0.2% after getting turned away at the 28,000 level Tuesday. The S&P 500 also eased 0.2% and small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.5%. The small-cap index is getting resistance at 1600.


**Paccar** ([PCAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCAR)) was a nice gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up around 1%. It's been holding gains bullishly as it works on a potential [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP112119.jpg)The Nasdaq and S&P 500 flashed [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) Wednesday, but it was another instance of mild [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). Of the S&P 500's five distribution days, the worst percentage decline is 0.4%. In fact, you have to go back more than a month to see a percentage decline of more than 0.4%.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


Still, after seven straight weekly gains for the Nasdaq composite, and six for the S&P 500, a pullback for the stock market wouldn't be surprising. A 2.5% pullback for the S&P 500 from here would bring the index down to its last breakout area, which is pretty close to its 50-day moving average. It's a logical support level to watch.


What we know right now is that market technicals remain bullish, along with the price action of leading growth stocks. That means the search should continue unabated for stocks with strong fundamentals showing relative strength.


**Market Movers**
-----------------


**InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) was a drag on Innovator IBD 50 **ETF** ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which lost 1.3%. InMode shares slumped more than 11% in heavy volume, good for a sell signal, as the stock tests support at its 21-day moving average. No doubt InMode had been showing signs of overheating. The stock on Monday hit an intraday high of 58.76, putting it 94% above its 50-day moving average.


Meanwhile, Loop Capital downgraded shares of **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), but the retailer went the other way, up nearly 3% to a new high. RH stock gapped up on Nov. 15 on news it's a new holding of Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)).



Meanwhile, the recovery in software stocks has been impressive. Since its Oct. 23 low, the group is up just over 14%, helped by strength in stocks like **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) (recently making a return to [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).


Paycom edged higher Thursday after shares soared 9% Wednesday. Wednesday's move was good for a breakout over a 259.81 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/); Paylocity is still in buy range from a 112.56 entry, and a six-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) will likely be in place by the end of the week for RingCentral. [ServiceNow joined Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) earlier this week when it cleared an [early entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) of 276.60.

In the retail sector, **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) rebounded after two straight declines, up 2% to 206.07. It's just below a 209.46 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) ahead of its earnings report next week. Results are due Tuesday before the open.


Among security software firms, small cap new issue **Ping Identity** ([PING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PING)) topped an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 21.10 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) but an 11% intraday gain was halved by the close. Group peer **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is back near highs ahead of its earnings report next week. Results are due Monday after the close.

Stocks Edge Up, Nasdaq Up 7.4% In January; Will Large Caps Keep Leading?

Thank you, Janet.


Perhaps the greatest achievement by Janet Yellen during her tenure was being decisive in not moving too fast on raising short-term interest rates.


Â Wednesday, as Yellen presided over her final meeting as the head of the Federal Reserve, investors seemed to give a show of uncertainty and continued nervousness over one of the biggest issues for the market in 2018: the pace of inflation and how much more will it cost to borrow money.


What is certain? The former assistant professor at Harvard, economics scholar, and ex-chief of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank is stepping aside for President Trump's choice for Fed chief, Jerome Powell. The exit comes amid three important trends.


One, a stock market that has been booming since the most recent 20%-plus correction in 2011. Two, record and growing corporate profits among S&P 500 firms. And three, an economy that, after years of slow-burn increases, now seems to have a real chance of keeping a solid if not spectacular rate of growth this year.


Since Yellen's U.S. Senate confirmation on Jan. 6, 2014, as the first woman to head the U.S. central bank, the S&P 500 rallied from 1826 to Wednesday's close of 2823, good for a total advance of 54.6% (excluding dividends) and a compounded annual growth rate of 11.2%.


The choppy action on Wednesday, however, is only a light blemish on what has been a powerful advance in January.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP013118-231x300.png)The Nasdaq composite surrendered an early-morning gain of 0.7% to finish the session up just 0.1%. Ditto for the S&P 500, which rose less than 0.1% (it was up 0.6% intraday), and the Dow Jones industrials (up 0.3%, giving most of a 1% advance back).


During January, the Nasdaq reached 7500 for the first time ever and closed up 7.4% for the month, one of the biggest monthly advances since late 2011, following a 20% bear market-level correction.


The S&P 500 jumped 5.6% in January while the Dow industrials rallied 5.8%.


Small caps and interest rate-sensitive issues badly underperformed this month. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 2.5%, while the Dow utility average fell 3.3%. The utility index also fell more than 10% from its 52-week peak, enough to qualify as an intermediate-level correction.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. That's not a surprise given it was the final trading day of January.


It would have obviously been a much more satisfying trading session if the indexes had closed near or at session highs. In a bull market that is really humming, closes high in the day's range are often the norm. That was clearly not the case on Wednesday.


Instead, the market showed a lack of rebounding strength after two straight sessions in which it was clear that institutional investors were intensively selling stocks and bagging gains.


On Tuesday, the Nasdaq fell in higher volume for a second straight session, sending the [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count to four, a significant level. The last time the market saw a quartet of significant sell-offs in higher volume within a 25-session span was in mid-December for the Nasdaq. The last time the S&P 500 showed three distribution days over the same time frame? Late September.


In 2017, the market handled such levels of distribution admirably. None of the pullbacks generated more than a 3% chili dip in what turned out to be a banner year for equities and roughly flat prices for U.S. government debt on the long end.


The average decline among the four distribution days is 0.6%. Meanwhile, on the NYSE, declining issues beat winners by a nearly 9-5 ratio, a curious divergence.



**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is off to a limp start after a glorious 2017. Thursday's earnings report after the close will help define the megacap tech's next move. Yet until the iPhone giant seriously takes out its long-term 200-day moving average, Apple is still in a solid long-term uptrend.


Gains are still big ever since Apple cleared a first-stage base, a [perfect cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017. But it's threatening to erase the entire 11% gain from a new breakout from a second-stage cup with handle at 160.97. It's already down from the more recent 176.34 buy point.


Homebuilders ended the month on a sour note, as at least half a dozen names cut through their 10-week moving averages in heavy volume.


After years of a virtually zero fed funds rate, accompanied by massive buys of Treasury bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities, Yellen and the Fed finally pushed the fed funds rate (what money center banks pay for overnight stopgap loans from the Fed) to a target range of 0.25%-0.5% in December 2015. The next quarter-point rate hike came a year later in December 2016, followed by three more quarter-point hikes in 2017.


Today, the fed funds rate stands at a 1.25%-1.5% range, and a far majority of bond traders tracked by the CME Group are convinced that the U.S. central bank will make its sixth increase during the March meeting. The actions by the Fed did not lead to a distortion in the yield curve, which means that lenders can afford to extend credit to entrepreneurs and fast-growing companies that need the cash to expand.


On Wednesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond edged up to 2.73%, remaining at three-year-plus highs.


The relatively low interest rates in U.S. Treasuries still make U.S. equities attractive. Numerous observers are seeing a low double-digit percentage gain in earnings among S&P 500 firms for Q4, driven in part by the rebound in profits for oil and gas firms. But the profit growth so far appears to have been spread widely across many sectors.

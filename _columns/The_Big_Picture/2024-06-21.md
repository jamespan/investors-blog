  Stock Market Falls At The Witching Hour; Critical Inflation Report Looms

The stock market closed Friday mostly lower but still managed meager weekly gains. Now a critical inflation report and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) earnings are due.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day in the red as it dipped 0.2%, but still sits clear of its short-term moving averages. It inched fractionally higher for the week, its eighth weekly gain out of the past nine. The tech-heavy composite has climbed 17.8% for the year so far.


The S&P 500 is only slightly off all-time highs despite sinking 0.2% Friday. The benchmark index turned in a weekly gain of 0.6% and has risen eight of the past nine weeks. So far this year it is up 14.6%.


Advancers actually ended the day with a slender edge on decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was heavier than average amid quadruple witching, a quarterly event when four different sets of futures and options expire on the same day.


No New Distribution Days
------------------------


There are now three distribution days on the S&P 500 as the May 30 stock market session was eliminated Thursday under the 5% rule. There were no new ones added Friday as declines came in fractionally lower than 0.2% without rounding.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared better than the other two major indexes as it made a 16-point gain despite ending essentially flat. Big cap bulls will cheer the fact it ended the week back above the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) fared best here while **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were among the laggards.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP062124.jpg)Small caps fought back to close in the green with the Russell 2000 rising 0.2%, though it remains stuck below the 50-day line. Growth stocks were spanked by the bears, however, with the Innovator IBD 50 exchange traded fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) sliding 1.3%.


With the stock market near highs, Investor's Business Daily continues to recommend exposure at the 80% to 100% level. But with fears of a pullback growing, it makes sense to be at the lower end of this scale. Also, be careful about making any new stock purchases at the moment.


Fed's Favorite Inflation Reading Due
------------------------------------


The coming week will be busy on the economic data front. The latest consumer confidence reading from the Conference Board is due Tuesday. Economists expect the reading to fall to 100 from the previous reading of 102.


Additionally, new home sales figures for May come Wednesday while durable-goods orders data and a revised first-quarter GDP reading are due Thursday.


But Friday will be key once again, when May's Personal Consumption Expenditures price index data is due from the Department of Commerce. Economists see core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rising 2.6% year-over-year. This would be lower than the previous month's reading of 2.8% annualized growth.


Next week is relatively quiet on the earnings front. [But noteworthy quarterly reports are due](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/micron-mu-stock-technology-drone-maker-aerovironment-earnings-calendar/) from memory chip giant **Micron** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), Dow Jones stock **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and drone maker **AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)).

Smell Of Success For This Stock Market Group
--------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended mixed](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) on Friday. Communication services and consumer discretionary were the strongest areas while energy and technology lagged.



Once again, the relative performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups gave a deeper view of the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Funeral services firms, toy stocks, cable plays and desktop software stocks were among the best performers. Agricultural chemicals plays also enjoyed the smell of success Friday despite the fact fertilizer giant **Nutrien** ([NTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTR)), a giant of the group, ended lower.


In contrast, media periodicals, coal stocks, consumer electronics retailers and oil and gas royalty trusts were among the laggards. Data storage firms also struggled.

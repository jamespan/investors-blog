  Stocks Extend Gains As Oil Rallies, But S&P 500, Dow Retreat At This Crucial Test

The stock market extended its rebound Monday, but indexes came up short just as they came to a crucial test.




The S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.75% before closing 0.3% higher. The Nasdaq composite did better, rising 0.8% while protecting most of Monday's 1.1% intraday increase. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4% to make it three straight gains.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq from Friday's levels and was indicated lower on the NYSE.


While investors will take any gain, Monday's advance came with some frustrations. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average stopped their advance just as they touched the 50-day moving averages. That indicates a potential barrier, one that has been witnessed in the S&P and Dow since April.


The Nasdaq made it back above its 50-day line Friday and held above it Monday. It's a narrow cushion, and one that needs to hold for the rebound to have a chance. As for the next key step, look for the composite to top its April high at 7319. The S&P 500 and Dow are farther off their own April highs.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MP050718-229x300.jpg)Watching longer-term price trends, some encouraging signs do emerge.


The S&P 500 is bouncing off its 200-day moving average for at least the fourth time in the past three months. The S&P 500 and other main indexes have made three main pullbacks since late January. Each time, the S&P found support at the 200-day average.


Stock market lore says bear markets end after indexes sell off hard and make three major lows. Today, stocks are clearly not in a bear market. Yet they've made the most serious declines since early 2016, when the Nasdaq slid as much as 18.7%.


As indexes get squeezed between the 50-day and 200-day lines and the Nasdaq trades just above its 50-day, you get the sense that the market is nearing an inflection point.


Have stocks shaken out enough to put the market on a sustained uptrend? Monday's retreat created doubts. Still, other areas are more positive.


The IBD 50 added 1.4% Monday, and is 2% from a record high. Small caps stood strong as the Russell 2000 climbed 0.8%. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund, [managed by Innovator Capita](http://www.innovatoretfs.com/etf/?ticker=ffty)l, ramped 1.9% higher to 34.23.


The energy sector was a leader after the price of U.S. crude briefly topped $70 a barrel for the first time since late 2014. WTI futures closed lower in the regular session. The Dow transports fell 0.1% on the rise in fuel costs, but the oil rally contributed to the broad market's gains.

Energy stocks rallied on expectations that the U.S. may reimpose sanctions on Iran, which would limit Iranian oil in the world's supply. Stocks started sliding late just as President Trump announced on Twitter that he'd announce a decision at 2 p.m. ET Tuesday.


Of the many stocks that topped buy points Monday, the best breakouts were mainly oil companies.


**PDC Energy** ([PDCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDCE)) topped the 57.87 buy point of a cup with handle in more than double its average volume. **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) broke out past a 130.80 entry in another cup with handle. **CVR Refining** ([CVRR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVRR)) and the related **CVR Energy** ([CVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVI)) broke out of bases after Goldman Sachs raised CVR Refining to buy from neutral.


Outside energy, **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) broke out cleanly out of a first-stage base, a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Volume jumped more than 160% above its 50-day average. The attractive breakout prompted Pure Storage to be added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/Leaderboard/Leaders/default.aspx/Leaderboard/Leaders/default.aspx).



Technology stocks were generally higher also. It helps explain why the tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed when oil stocks were so actively being bought. Medical software, networking, data storage, cybersecurity and enterprise software joined the top 20 industry groups in terms of Monday's gains.


Indeed, the Nasdaq is handily beating the S&P 500 this year, up 5.2% while the S&P 500 is essentially flat.


Department stores fell sharply Monday after a [Deutsche Bank analyst doused the industry's comeback story](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/theres-limited-upside-for-department-store-stocks-analyst-says.html?__source=sharebar|twitter&par=sharebar).  The group — facing pressure from online retailers — last week climbed back all the way to No. 1 in IBD's 197 group rankings. **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) fell back below the 31.14 buy point of its [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).


Some acquisition news helped spur buying.


**Athenahealth** ([ATHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHN)) soared 16%, even after paring gains, on news that Elliott Management made an unsolicited bid for the medical software firm. **International Flavors & Fragrances** ([IFF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IFF)) said it will buy Israel-based Frutarom Industries for around $7.1 billion. International Flavors plunged 11%. And **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)) announced plans to buy commercial real estate giant **Gramercy Property Trust** ([GPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPT)) in an all-cash deal valued at $7.6 billion. Gramercy soared 15%.

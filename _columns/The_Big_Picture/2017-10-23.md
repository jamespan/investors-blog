Monday was shaping up like many other recent sessions, with another round of new highs for the three major stock indexes, but sellers came in late, with most of the selling focused in technology and small-cap stocks.




The same script was playing out again for the bulk of Monday's session, as major stock indexes held near highs, not moving much in either direction.


But by the close, the Nasdaq composite lost 0.6%; the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE came in lower than Friday's level. Nasdaq volume rose a bit, resulting in the Nasdaq's third [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in four sessions.


Last week, the Nasdaq showed stalling action on Wednesday, basically higher volume with no price progress. The next day, it fell modestly in higher volume, good for a mild distribution day. Monday's session felt more like distribution as the Nasdaq weakened into the close.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP_4x1_102317-176x300.png)The Russell 2000 gave back 0.8%. It's been trading near the 1,500 level for several days now. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) held up well again, ending mostly flat, helped by bullish gains for **YY Inc**. ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)), **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)), **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) and Argentina-based bank **Grupo Supervielle** ([SUPV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPV)).


At this point, many seasoned growth investors are holding some cash, while maintaining some exposure to stocks, especially the ones that are working the best. It's easy to endure the market's gyrations when a profit cushion is large in a stock.


But a heightened risk level is worth acknowledging even with the distribution-day count on the light side. It's not a market under meaningful distribution at this point, but the Nasdaq once again is starting to show mild signs of institutional selling.


This week promises to be a busy one for earnings, with reports due Thursday from dominant cloud providers like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Shares of Amazon fell 1.7% to 966.30 in higher volume, closing below the 50-day moving average. It also has fallen back below the 1,000 price level. Amazon is working on a new base, but keep in mind it's a late-stage base after several breakouts already.


Speaking of the 1,000 level, after eight straight closes above the round number, Alphabet lost 1.9% to 985.54. It tried to break out past an entry at 1,006.29 but has sunk back into the pattern.


Other movers Monday included Argentina-based **YPF** ([YPF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YPF)). The Argentina-based integrated oil and gas name cleared a 23.32 cup-with-handle buy point in heavy volume. Shares jumped 5% to 24.21, but its weekly chart shows a lagging relative strength line. It's good to see the RS line in new high ground when a stock breaks out.


**LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)) added 1.6% to 121 in strong volume. It cleared an entry of 121.35 but ended slightly below the buy point. It's in a similar situation as YPF, with a lagging RS line.


**PetMed Express** ([PETS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETS)) gapped above the 50-day moving average on a big earnings beat, but the stock ended in the bottom half of its intraday range. Shares still soared 18% to 43.41.

  Stock Market Sinks On Third Fed Rate Hike Of 2023, But Hides These Silver Linings

Investors mostly frowned on [Wednesday's decision by the Federal Reserve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-signals-rate-hike-pause-amid-bank-woes-sp-500-rises/) to push up short-term interest rates by another quarter point for the third time this year. But if recent history indicates anything, the stock market also showed a few silver linings.




One of them? Overall, the decline wasn't that nasty.


Plus, small caps bucked the general malaise shown by the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?).


Meanwhile, oil futures plunged again. Dow Jones data showed front-month crude oil fell 4.3% to $68.60 a barrel. That marks the lowest settle since March 20. While the drop in oil casts a pall on the future of the economy, it also means good news for current inflation.


While the Nasdaq composite outperformed other key indexes with a nearly 0.5% drop, the Russell 2000 actually ended 0.4% higher. That, of course, pales vs. an intraday gain of as much as 2%. Meanwhile, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), at 172.33, still harbors a loss of 1.2% year to date.


On Wednesday, the S&P 500 lost 0.7%, marking a third straight loss. At 4090, it holds a thin cushion above its flatlining [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.8%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


IBD readers might have expected a bigger drop by the Russell 2000. After all, breadth was much worse on the NYSE. Early data showed decliners beating gainers by a nearly 5-3 margin. On the Nasdaq, winners pretty much matched losers.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq. This handed the composite index a [fifth day of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), a clear-cut sign of professional selling. However, this doesn't really come as a surprise given that IBD downgraded the current outlook for stocks on April 25 to "Uptrend under pressure." This means all new buys should be made very cautiously, and profits can be taken in most of your winners.


The suggested portfolio exposure in stocks remains at 20% to 40%.


NYSE volume fell slightly.


By raising the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 5%-5.25%, the U.S. central bank raised the cost of lending to the highest level since June 2006. Back then, the Fed did not use a target range.


In its statement Wednesday, the interest rate policy committee cited a number of cross currents that have made judging the economy a tricky business. Job gains? "Robust in recent months," the statement noted. Inflation? Still elevated, meaning that year-over-year increases, especially in service-related prices, are still way above the Fed's long-term goal of 2%.


The Fed also stressed that the banking system is "sound and resilient." During a long news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed that the resolution of assets transferred from the badly asset-bleeding **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) to Dow Jones component **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) marked a key moment in addressing a trio of three major lenders that teetered over the edge of solvency. The statement acknowledged that "tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."


The Fed Today
-------------


"I don't think Powell offered a clean response to the question of tolerating inflation at 3%," Christian Hoffman, portfolio manager and managing director at Thornburg Investment Management, said in a comment emailed to IBD. "He offered tea leaves that suggest the unspoken, uncomfortable reality that at some point the Fed may have to balance higher than desirable inflation to balance employment and economic stability goals."


Perhaps the biggest take-away from the Federal Reserve's statement?


The Fed, despite seeing a unanimous agreement within policymakers to raise rates on Wednesday, hinted that it may be much closer to halting its epic rate-hike campaign than ever before. Why? In its March statement, the bank noted the committee "anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate" to get the economy back to state of low inflation and continued growth.


In Wednesday's statement, such resoluteness got zapped.


"The Fed has been epically wrong since the fall 2020 decision at Jackson Hole to 'become data dependent.' We think they are done (with hiking rates) and should be!" Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments. "Now all eyes will be focused on the debt ceiling debate. Volatility is the watchword for the next few months."


Tengler added that she has been trimming back on some tech holdings and "will be doing the same with the outperformers in (the consumer) discretionary" sector.


On Wednesday, the [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) ([0VIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=0VIX)) rose 3.2% to 18.34, well off its recent highs near 35.


What U.S. Bonds Are Saying Now
------------------------------



So even though the stock market mostly backtracked on the day, bond investors continued to load up on Treasuries.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. government 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 3.40%. That's 93 basis points below an Oct. 21 peak of 4.33%.


Put another way, the 2022 disaster for investors — in the sense that both equities and fixed income assets fell in value — is not getting repeated in 2023. At least for now.


If you look at the whole yield curve, it still looks ugly. That is, the inversion remains, which is not good for banks. The 2-year note fell sharply on Wednesday as well, down 12 basis points to 3.89%. That's still much higher than what the 10-year bond pays out. Plus, the three-month T-bill, at 5.26%, almost matches the new level for the fed funds rate, or what the U.S. central bank charges on overnight cash infusions.


Still, the gap between the 2- and 10-year bond yields has shrunk some.


Will Volatility Rise Again?
---------------------------


At the start of the year, the 2- and 10-year bond yield gap stood at 69 basis points. It now stands at 49 basis points, or roughly half a percentage point. The spread between 3-month T-bills and 10-year bonds, however, has widened appreciably. That's understandable, given that in just in the space of 14 months, the Fed has jacked the fed funds rate from a midpoint of nearly 0.13% to just below 5.13%.


In a recent interview with IBD, Cindy Beaulieu, CIO and chair of the investment policy committee at investment manager Conning, noted that in March, when equities gyrated over fears that Silicon Valley Bank operator SVB Financial would go belly up, the bond market witnessed its worst volatility in 40 years, particularly in the 2-year note arena.


"A big short position had been built into the 2-year bond market, and then in March, with the banking crisis, everyone rushed to buy," Beaulieu said. She added that traders even saw large gaps between bid and ask prices on short-term Treasury bills, adding to wild action and uncertainty.


After hours Wednesday, Beverly Hills, Calif.-based **PacWest Bancorp** ([PACW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PACW)) plummeted 54% to 2.90. Bloomberg reported Wednesday night that the regional bank's management is looking at a possible sale. Investors may want to see if volatility returns to the Treasury markets, which could disrupt the stock market as well.



PacWest stock peaked at 64 in 2007, right before the Great Financial Crisis bear market slammed the stock market in 2008 to early 2009. This means PACW held a maximum market value of $7.6 billion. It has 117.9 million shares outstanding. Trading near 2.87 a share after hours, its value has fallen to less than $340 million.


According to MarketSmith, PacWest's revenue grew at a healthy clip of 3%, 12%, 19%, 8%, 20%, 31%, 22% and 61% vs. year-ago levels over the past eight quarters. However, profits have fallen five quarters in a row (down 20%, 33%, 13%, 71% and 35%), due in part to the law of large numbers.

Comparing Wednesday's Stock Market Drop
---------------------------------------



Yet, in looking at the way the stock market reacted to recent rate hikes and Powell's comments after the decision, the stock market on Wednesday seemed to show more backbone.


Let's go back to Sept. 21, when the Fed raised rates by 75 basis points to a range of 3%-3.25%. The S&P 500 reversed sharply lower, falling 1.7%. The next day, it fell another 0.8%, and dropped the next three sessions.


On Nov. 2, the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points again. On Dec. 14, the bank tapered the increase to half a point, or 50 basis points. The stock market fell a combined 3.5% over Nov. 2 and 3, and slid 5.1% over a four-session decline from Dec. 14 to 19.


After Wednesday's decline, the S&P 500 lost its gains for the quarter, yet holds a 6.5% gain year to date.


More Silver Linings
-------------------


Meanwhile, the earnings season has given stock pickers some rewards.



**Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) rewarded patient investors with a 9% gain in massive turnover after the small-store format chicken wing and sandwich chain reported a 79% jump in first-quarter earnings. Sales grew 43% to $108.7 million. It seems the Addison, Texas-based chain is on pace to reach $500 million in annualized sales. The stock has advanced 29% since making a rocky breakout from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 169.04 in mid-February.


Wingstop held a tasty [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) of 92 three months ago. It's since improved to a 98.


Elsewhere, **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) and **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) vaulted on their latest quarterly results. But others have gotten slammed, including **Huron Consulting** ([HURN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HURN)) (down 12% despite a 78% rise in Q1 earnings per share, 23% pop in sales) and longtime leader **Clean Harbors** ([CLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLH)).


Finally, the [Daily Market Indicators page on MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) shows that on a short-term basis, the overbought vs. oversold oscillator is at -447, well below the neutral zero level.


As noted on IBD Live, when this oscillator jumps past 500, the stock market is usually ripe for a pullback. (To see the chart, go to "NASDQ" on a daily chart at MarketSmith.)

Stock Indexes Post Gains After Weighing Fed Decision
=====================================================

U.S. stock indexes got back on the up escalator Thursday, after pondering the Fed's message of the previous day.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 jogged 0.4% higher, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE. Because the Nasdaq closed in the lower half of its daily price range, the composite suffered a stall day, which is a type of distribution. That gave the Nasdaq seven total in the past several weeks.


On Wednesday, the stock market sagged after the Federal Reserve nudged up interest rates by a quarter point. The rate hike was expected. But the Fed added an unexpected twist when it said it is contemplating three interest rates hikes in 2017. This was one more than the Street expected.


![mp_73_121516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP_73_121516-197x300.png)After sleeping on that news, the market apparently decided the glass was half full, not half empty. Perhaps the rethinking was well-taken. When the Fed raised interest rates a year ago, its forecast implied four quarter-point hikes in 2016.


That constituted a wild miss. Wednesday's move was the only hike in 2016. Does the Street have any reason to trust the Fed's forecast for 2017?


The market Thursday decided to shrug off the worries.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Finding the right stock can be tricky. Are you [monitoring this medical](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/top-medical-stock-biotelemetry-delivers-mobile-healthcare-monitoring-devices/) stock?*

Among IBD's 197 industry groups, those rising smartly for the day included highly rated groups such as airlines, chips, life insurance and super regional banks.


The day's biggest percentage losers included gold miners, apparel makers and toys — all lowly rated.


This is exactly what bulls like to see — strength among highly rated groups and if there must be weakness, let it be among the low-rated groups.


The rising  chip stocks mostly involved continuation stories, i.e., add-on gains from old entries.


**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) was the exception. The stock is trying to follow through on a breakout from a flat base, bobbing above and below the 178.12 buy point.


**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) is battling to clear a three-weeks-tight pattern. The buy point is 39.99.


On the downside, data storage provider **Carbonite** ([CARB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARB)) slouched for the sixth time in seven sessions. The stock pushed further under its 50-day line as support clearly has failed.


Carbonite broke out in July and rose 83% by late November. Normally a stock should be sold when it reaches a gain of 20% to 25%. But Carbonite reached the 20% level on a gap up. A stock that gaps up is showing exceptional strength and should be held to see if it can rise further. (A gap up involves an opening above the high of the previous session, creating white space on the chart.)


Are banks getting tired? Banks scoring new highs Wednesday tallied only 29 in IBD's adjusted list. The bank tally hadn't been that low since Election Day, when it scored 14. The sector is benefiting from a rise in interest rates. But [yield spreads may also be having an impact on banking stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/bank-stocks-push-dow-toward-20000-after-1-day-fed-pause/).


In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury has been greater than the yield on the Dow Jones industrial average since Dec. 8. The last time that happened was in October 2015.


Checking sentiment indicators, the Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears reading has gone into what the research firm calls "the danger zone." Bulls are at 59.6% and bears 19.2%.

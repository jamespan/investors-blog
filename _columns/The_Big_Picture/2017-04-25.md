The stock market embraced buyers for a second straight day Tuesday, a day that saw more reasons for investors to feel confident.


The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.7% and topped the 6000 level for the first time. Such landmarks don't necessarily indicate bigger gains ahead. More important was the index's support at the 50-day moving average last week, which triggered a rebound.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP042517-177x300.png)The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 are rebounding off their 50-day moving averages much like the Nasdaq did a week earlier. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% Tuesday and is less than 1% from a record high. Small caps shined also, with the Russell 2000 making a 0.9% jump and the first new high since March 1.


The Dow outperformed with a 1.1% increase as earnings from **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) sparked uncharacteristically strong rallies in those Dow components. Caterpillar, for example, soared nearly 8% in more than three times its average volume, [gapping past a flat base](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-industrials-leads-can-these-4-big-cap-stocks-smash-sp-500-in-2017/) at 99.56.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Winners beat losers by 2-to-1 on the NYSE and by 11-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


It's fair to give the Nasdaq some love, since it has about doubled the S&P 500 this year.


The Nasdaq took 15 years to surpass the March 2000 peak, and its monthly chart shows prices rising from that huge consolidation. Surely that's an extreme long-term view, sort of like paleontologists studying fossil records. Yet, it's one to keep in perspective.


A shorter-term view also shows some favorable signs, and the market's tone certainly has improved this week. After weeks of dull, listless trading, the indexes are turning to the upside. Since March, indexes often surrendered early gains. But since returning from the Good Friday holiday, the main indexes have had a tendency to hold gains and close near session highs.


The market is in the thick part of earnings season, and the reception on Wall Street so far is generally favorable. A dangerous standoff with North Korea is fading from investors' conscience.


Many highly-rated stocks are breaking out, providing new opportunities to invest now that the market outlook is back to a confirmed uptrend. On Tuesday, there was another batch of breakouts.


**Seagate Technology** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)) topped the 49.57 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in nearly double its usual volume. The data storage company reports earnings Tuesday.


**On Assignment** ([ASGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASGN)) closed above the 49.22 buy point of a base-no-base pattern. The health care staffing services providers announces Q1 results Tuesday after the close.


**Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) cleared a flat base with a 90.77 entry after it beat profit expectations and closed just below that buy point. Volume was double its usual amount. **Restaurant Brands** ([QSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QSR)) broke out from a flat base with a 58.08 entry in solid volume.


There was some follow through to Monday's breakouts, and that's where investors can look for clues on the current market. How these new breakouts progress will help determine whether this week's bullish fervor translates to a sustained advance. Those stocks should continue to climb and move past buy zones, eventually producing profits for shareholders.


Already, a shift is occurring as homebuilders suddenly fall out of favor. Some of the group's leaders acted well from late January. But earnings reports have sent institutional investors fleeing.


On Tuesday, **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) dropped 3.8% and tumbled below its 50-day line in heavy volume after the company missed sales and profit expectations. On Thursday last week, **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) slid 2.5% on concerns about its guidance and cancellations. In addition, the Trump administration [imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber](https://www.investors.com/news/pulte-group-earnings-new-home-sales/) imports, which is sure to increase costs for builders.

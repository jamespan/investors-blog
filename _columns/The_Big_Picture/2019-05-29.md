  Stock Market Hit By More Selling As Nasdaq, S&P 500 Probe Longer-Term Support

The stock market got hit with more selling Wednesday, but indexes closed off lows, although earnings from **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) fueled another sell-off in software stocks. A fear indicator on Wall Street notched a welcome reading for stock market bulls.




After closing slightly below its 200-day moving average Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrials gapped down Wednesday, ending with a loss of 0.9%. The blue-chip index also showed bearish action by taking out its March lows.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500, meanwhile, are testing support at their 200-day lines. The Nasdaq fell 0.8%, with the S&P 500 down 0.7%. Both made new lows for the current downtrend. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday.


If the Nasdaq breaks longer-term support at its 200-day moving average, it would bring a trip down to its March 8 low of 7332 level into play as the next possible low. The Nasdaq closed Wednesday at 7,547.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP052919-257x300.jpg)A close off lows for the Nasdaq was constructive, but the index, like the S&P 500, isn't out of the woods yet. Still, a high put-call volume ratio of 1.26 Wednesday was a bit of good news for the bulls. It's an excessively fearful reading, and a lot of fear has been seen at market bottoms in the past.


Stock Market Distribution
-------------------------


With the market in a correction, there's no distribution-day count in the Market Pulse. But make no mistake. It's still a stock market under distribution.


Distribution is synonymous with institutional selling. Institutional selling is the fuel behind stock market downtrends, and institutional buying provides the fuel for new market uptrends.


For now, wait for the selling to run its course. Growth stock are swimming against a tough market tide.


Transports, Bond Yields Fall
----------------------------


The Dow Jones Transportation Average broke below the 10,000 level with conviction, down 0.8%. The Dow Transports seem to be supporting the bond market's stance of an economic slowdown possibly leading to a recession.


The 10-year Treasury yield fell hard again Wednesday, hitting an intraday low of 2.21%. But sellers came into the bond market late, lifting the 10-year yield to 2.26% just after 4 p.m. ET. The spread between the 10-year yield and the 3-month yield (currently around 2.36%) hit its highest level since 2007, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-28/key-slice-of-u-s-yield-curve-dives-further-into-inversion-zone).


In related news, the number of unemployed in Germany unexpectedly rose in May, doing little to quell fears about a worldwide economic slowdown. The weak data, however, didn't have much impact on the German bond market as yields didn't move much. The yield on Germany's 10-year bond is -0.17%.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


A weak stock market eventually takes everything down with it. Shares of **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), which had been trending nicely above the 50-day moving average, took out that support level with conviction Wednesday. Big sellers were in the stock as shares slumped 7%.



Elsewhere, Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) swooned 1.5%, hurt by weakness in **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)).


Shares of Veeva rose sharply in after-hours trading after [earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/veeva-stock-veeva-earnings-q1-2020/) topped expectations.


**Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) outperformed in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), up 1%. The health care leader is trading tightly near highs as it sits just below a 71.31 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Top-rated new issue **Palomar Holdings** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)) was another bright spot Wednesday, up 1.6%. The small-cap insurer continues to show relative strength after a breakout from an IPO base. Another new issue, **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)), is also holding gains smartly after a breakout.


The truly bad news came from **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) and **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)). Both notched losses of more than 25% as Wall Street frowned on earnings reports from both. Canada Goose was highlighted as a possible put-option trade in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/ulta-beauty-bullish-chart-ahead-of-quarterly-earnings-report/) column.

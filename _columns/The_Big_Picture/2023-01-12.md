CPI Inflation Report, Jobless Claims, Earnings
----------------------------------------------


[The consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/tamer-cpi-inflation-rate-should-keep-sp-500-rallying-until-the-fed-meeting/) eased to 6.5% in December from 7.1% the prior month, a better number than the 6.6% Wall Street expected. The CPI fell 0.1% on the month vs. an expected flat reading. The core CPI rose 0.3% from November levels, as expected. The annual core inflation rate eased to 5.7% from 6%. The core CPI inflation rate peaked at a 40-year-high 6.6% in September.


Meanwhile, the Labor Department's initial unemployment claims rose to 205,000 vs. 204,000 in the previous week, below expectations for a rise to 215,000.


**KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) sold off 2.9% after the [company missed earnings and revenue estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/kb-home-earnings-q4-kbh-stock-homebuilder-outlook-mortgage-rate-shock/) for its fourth quarter. The homebuilder gave a lackluster Q1 housing forecast and suggested it's cutting prices to boost homebuying demand.


Apple chip supplier **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) jumped more than 6% after [reporting mixed Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-chipmaker-tsmc-posts-mixed-q4-results/).

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%, and the S&P 500 gained 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% and closed above the 50-day moving average for a second straight day. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.7%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP011223-269x300.jpg)The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.7% Thursday as the ETF extended a win streak to five sessions. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), energy giant **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) climbed 1.7%, nearing a flat base's 114.76 buy point.


IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains "confirmed uptrend," after strong gains in recent sessions. Still, it makes sense to remain conservatively invested, with an invested percentage of 20%-40%.


If you're making progress with your recent purchases, then you can be at the top of that range. But if your purchases are struggling, then it doesn't make sense to keep raising exposure. So, keep it lighter until your trades start to gain traction.


If the market uptrend continues, there should be plenty of chances to increase stock market exposure.


Meanwhile, there are two technical indicators that offer reasons for caution after the big stock market gains since Friday.


First, the VIX is at a level, below 20, where it marked market tops last year. Going back to at least April of 2022, the stock market rolled over every time the [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) fell to around 20. It is currently at 19.09 and at its lowest level since Dec. 2.


Second, the Nasdaq short-term overbought/oversold oscillator, found on [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) under the ticker NASDQ, is near levels where the Nasdaq has tended to peak. That's what happened in January, April, June and August of 2022.

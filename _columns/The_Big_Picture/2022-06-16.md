Stock Market Plunges To New Lows; HealthEquity, WWE Are Among Few Stocks To Watch
==================================================================================

The stock market finished sharply lower Thursday, as the major stock indexes plunged to new 2022 lows. Thursday's losses snapped a two-day advance in the Nasdaq, quickly wiping away Wednesday's 2.5% jump.




But **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) and **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)) are showing signs of strength.


Ahead of the market open Thursday, the Labor Department said first-time unemployment claims fell to 229,000, slightly lower than the revised 232,000 in the prior week. Initial jobless claims were expected to fall to 220,000, per Econoday estimates.


In other economic news, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index contracted for the first time since May 2020, coming in at -3.3. The index measures changes in business growth covering the Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware regions. Any number below zero indicates a contraction in the manufacturing sector.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP061622-259x300.jpg)The 10-year Treasury yield ticked lower to 3.3%, but is still up 10 of the last 14 sessions and holding near its highest level since April 2011. Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices rebounded from early losses. West Texas Intermediate trading just around $115 a barrel. In early March, WTI briefly topped out above $130 a barrel.


[Elon Musk held a town hall meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-musk-takeover-drama-takes-another-turn-with-town-hall-meeting/) with **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) employees, addressing staff for the first time about his proposed acquisition of the social media company. Twitter shares reversed 1.7% lower Thursday, while **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) stock tumbled more than 8.5%.


Stock Market Correction Deepens
-------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 2.4%, while the S&P 500 declined 3.25%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dived 4.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 4.7%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, but appeared to be lower on the NYSE.


Top growth stocks also ended with big losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) tumbled 5.8%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) was the sole gainer Thursday, inching higher. Shares are building a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a 92.10 buy point.


All S&P sectors finished lower, with energy and consumer discretionary selling off 5.5% and 4.9%, respectively. Consumer staples was the best performer, and it was down 0.8%.


The stock market correction deepened Thursday, as the major stock indexes hit new 2022 lows. The fresh lows ended the fledgling rally attempt that gained some steam Wednesday after the [Federal Reserve announced](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-preview-4-key-questions-will-shape-dow-jones-outlook/) a 75-basis-point rate hike for the first time since 1994. Investors should now be the on the lookout for a positive session, which would be Day 1 of a new rally attempt. It would be the first step toward a rally confirmation.


Given the extremely challenging environment, investors should remain fully in cash.

Stocks To Watch: HealthEquity, WWE
----------------------------------


Despite the stock market correction, a few stocks are holding up much better than others, including **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) and **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)).


[Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/hqy-stock-with-55-ytd-gain-enters-untouchable-buy-range/), HealthEquity, broke out past a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/)'s 66.23 buy point Tuesday. The stock is still in a 5% buy area that goes up to 69.54, as shares fell 0.5% Thursday. Keep in mind the weak market environment should keep you away from buying stocks. With HQY's RS line at new highs, the leading HSA company is a top stock to watch.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock World Wrestling Entertainment is back in buy range above a flat base's 63.81 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), according toÂ [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis, after WWE shares slid more than 3% Thursday. That 5% buy zone tops out at 67. Meanwhile, the stock also shows an alternate entry at 68.82. Per Leaderboard commentary, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for WWE stock is at highs and has been gaining ground since January. The base is first stage, a bonus for the chart.

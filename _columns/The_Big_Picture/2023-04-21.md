Stock Market Calm Before The Storm? Equities Dig In Ahead Of Big Tech Earnings, Fed Inflation Gauge
====================================================================================================

The stock market shrugged off another week of quarterly reports to end almost flat Friday. But with Big Tech earnings dead ahead, it could be the calm before the storm.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day up 0.1% but fell 0.4% for the week. While it has risen in four out of the past six weeks, there has been an increasing amount of distribution. The index remains up more than 16% for the year.


The benchmark S&P 500 also rose by 0.1%. It managed to contain losses to just 0.1% for the week and is still holding clear of the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and its short-term moving averages.


Decliners ended the session with a slight edge over gainers on both the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to squeeze out a 0.1% gain. **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) popped on earnings to end well clear of **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), the next best performer .


The Russell 2000 inched up 0.1% as well, but small-cap investors will be disappointed to learn it has formed a death cross. This is the first time the index has flashed this bearish technical signal since Jan. 19, 2022.


Growth stocks were relative outperformers Friday, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) turning in a 0.6% gain.


Big Tech Earnings, Fed Inflation Gauge Loom
-------------------------------------------


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) caught everyone's attention this week after plunging on underwhelming results, but it was just the tip of the spear.

The coming week sees Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) all on deck with quarterly reports.


Big Tech stocks have played a key role in the stock market rally so far in 2023, so this could be crunchtime. META is a member of the [Leaderboard list of top stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) while MSFT has also shown impressive relative strength.


Next Friday could also be a pivotal session, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index due. This is important as it is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. PCE is seen rising 5% year over year, while the core reading is expected to lift 4.5%.


Nevertheless, the stock market has been digging in its heels and remains in a confirmed uptrend. IBD still recommends 40%-60% exposure, but be sure to take action when any sell signals are triggered in your portfolio.

Stock Market Health Groups Outperform
-------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors ended the day mixed. Consumer discretionary and consumer staples were the best areas, while energy and materials were the worst laggards.


Once again, the performance of the IBD Industry Groups gave a more granular breakdown of the price action.


Hospitals, leisure services and educational software all excelled. The medical equipment group also impressed after Leaderboard Watchlist name **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)) surged 10.2% on a report that **Boston Scientific** ([BSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSX)) is looking to acquire the company.


Electronics wholesalers, coal stocks, shipping transportation plays and superregional banks were among the worst performers on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).

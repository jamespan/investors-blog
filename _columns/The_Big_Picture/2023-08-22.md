  Stock Market Gives Back Early Gains, Weighed Down By Financials, Retailers; 3 Oil Stocks To Watch

Early gains faded for the stock market Tuesday on the third day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a loss of 0.5%. **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) was a drag on the blue-chip index, down 2.1%. JPM stock closed below Friday's low and is now firmly below its 50-day moving average.


The S&P 500 also closed off highs after trying to regain the 4,400 level. Financial stocks like **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)), **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)), **Zions Bancorp** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)), **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) and **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) were among the laggards, with losses of more than 4%.


Comerica and KeyCorp were among a group of five banks downgraded by the S&P late Monday. The downgrade comes after Moody's recently lowered its own ratings on a series of lenders.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) was one of the worst-performing S&P 500 sector ETFs, down 0.9%. The ETF is below all of its key moving averages.

The SPDR Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) fell nearly 3% is now firmly below its 50-day line.


The Nasdaq tried to extend gains after Monday's lower-volume bounce from oversold conditions. The index popped above its 10-day moving average early Tuesday, rising more than 0.7%, but sellers knocked the index down to session lows by the close. The Nasdaq is still mired below its 10-, 21- and 50-day moving averages, which are potential resistance levels to watch.


Declining stocks had a slight edge over advancers on both exchanges.


Rising bond yields and a strong U.S. dollar have been a headwind for the stock market. The 10-year yield didn't move much Tuesday, down just 1 basis point to 4.33%. But the yield is still near highs not seen since 2007. Meanwhile, the Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Index Bullish Fund ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) rallied for the 10th time in 12 trading sessions.


Rates have been heading higher, perhaps in anticipation of sticky inflation and the possibility that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates further to slow the economy. For now, federal funds futures traders expect the Fed to do nothing at the September meeting. But the chances for another 25-basis-point hike at the November meeting have risen to 39.9% from 27.8% a month ago.


The Nasdaq And Nvidia
---------------------


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) reversed lower after rising 2.6% at the open. All eyes will be on Nvidia when the chip bellwether reports earnings Wednesday after the close. After four straight quarters of declining earnings, adjusted profit is expected to jump to $3.04 a share, with revenue up 65% to $11.04 billion. There's no doubt it's an earnings report that could move the Nasdaq hard, one way or the other.

The Nasdaq rallied off lows Friday and notched a big percentage gain Monday. But the stock market is still in a correction, which makes new buys risky. Scan through IBD growth screens like the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) and [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and find stocks that have done a good job of sidestepping the selling.


IBD's recommended exposure is 20% to 40%, although the crop of buy candidates has gotten a lot smaller with so many former leaders below their 10-week lines.


But some stocks — like Brazilian brokerage **XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)) and shopping review site **Yelp** ([YELP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YELP)) — are finding support at their 10-week lines for the first time after breakouts.



In the oil and gas sector, stocks to watch include **Oceaneering** ([OII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OII)), **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) and **Noble** ([NE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NE)). They continue to show strength and support after recent breakouts.


And don't forget about two of the Magnificent Seven stocks — Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) — which are still holding support at their 10-week lines.


Retailers Thumped
-----------------


A sell-off in **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) cast a pall in the retail sector, with eight subgroups in the sector among the day's worst 10 performers.


DKS stock tumbled 24% after adjusted profit of $2.82 a share came in [well below the consensus of $3.81 a share](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-earnings-ramp-up-as-students-head-back-to-school-macys-kohls-dicks-sporting-goods-to-report/). Dick's blamed a rise in organized retail theft, but the company also said it had to mark down outdoor merchandise to clear out inventory. While several retailers have made good progress getting inventory levels down, Dick's inventory was down only 5% in the quarter.


**Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) slumped nearly 6% ahead of next week's earnings report. BBY's weakness weighed on the consumer electronics group, which fell around 5%.


The department store group slumped nearly 4%, hurt by an earnings sell-off for **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)).


Sellers also hit **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) ahead of its earnings due Thursday after the close.

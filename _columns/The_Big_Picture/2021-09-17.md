The stock market ended near sessions lows Friday, finishing the week on a down note, as the S&P 500 broke down below a critical support level. Tech bellwether **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) sold off sharply to give up a key benchmark as the market gave some weakening signals.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 0.9%. Despite holding above Wednesday's lows, there's a sense of an [expectation breaker](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-expectation-breakers-what-to-do-when-stock-market-throws-you-curveball/) after two consecutive bullish sessions. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lost 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively.


The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since June 18. It was disappointing action after a bullish bounce for the index on Wednesday.


The Dow remains under its 50-day moving average and is testing its recent lows. On the upside, the small-cap Russell 2000 inched 0.2% higher.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP091721-296x300.jpg)Volume rose sharply on the Nasdaq and NYSE compared with Thursday's numbers due to quadruple witching, a session in which stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures expire. That meant another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Even though the Nasdaq remains above its 50-day line, the weakening action in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq justify a downgrade in IBD's market outlook to "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/action-plans/)." While the market is not exactly breaking down, this is a precautionary move as indexes and many leading stocks appear to be on the edge of potentially larger declines.


What does that mean? It means it's time to proceed with caution until the major stock indexes firm up. Investors should be more guarded with new breakouts and be sure to cut losses short, even less than the [usual 7%-8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Recent breakouts have struggled. For example, **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) broke out Wednesday, extended gains Thursday and then sold off 5.5% Friday. That's unusual behavior after a strong breakout in a top growth stock.

Among tech leaders, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) decisively closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, sliding 1.8% in big volume. Apple was removed from [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Friday after losing support.


Positively, leading growth stocks showed modest losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down just 0.3% after briefly hitting an all-time Friday.



Stocks To Watch: AMD, Chipotle
------------------------------


Meanwhile, stock market leaders **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) are at their 10-week moving averages.


Advanced Micro Devices is forming a consolidation with a 122.59 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares are right at their 10-week line. If the stock is able to bounce, then investors can initiate a new position or add shares to an existing position. Then, they can buy more when the stock breaks out past the conventional buy point. Especially in this choppy market, it's important to get a head start on a position before new highs.


[Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/chipotle-stock-offers-buying-opportunity-after-rebound/), Chipotle Mexican Grill, is rebounding from its key 50-day moving average, though it fell 0.4% Friday. The burrito maker has been trading tightly following a post-earnings jump. Look for continued support around its 10-week line, which would be bullish for the stock's prospects during the current market weakness.

  Stock Market Ends Week Lower As Fed Sparks Bear Charge; Auto Strikes Help These Stocks

The stock market ended the week well lower after the latest Fed meeting sparked a bear charge. Investors need to be on their guard ahead of more inflation data next week.




The Nasdaq composite saw gains for the day evaporate as it closed down 0.1%, but its weekly dip of 3.6% told a more telling picture. It is now almost 5% below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and has fallen for the past three weeks in a row. But it still holds a robust gain of around 27% so far in 2023.


The S&P 500 also reversed lower, slipping 0.2%. Its weekly retreat of almost 3% was its worst since March and it is now well below its 50-day line. The trend now looks distinctly negative, with the benchmark index dipping in six of the last eight weeks. Its gain for the year has now eroded to about 13%, well off its highs.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared the worst out of the major indexes, sliding 0.3%. It now looks in danger of making a test of its 200-day line. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH))Â  and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were among the better performers on the blue-chip index. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) lagged.


Small caps were also bitten by the bears, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.2%. It sits well below its 200-day moving average. Growth stocks fared slightly better, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 0.3%.


There was some slight relief on the Treasury yield front. The 10-year yield fell 4 basis points to 4.44%, while the two-year yield also slipped 4 basis points to 5.48%. The yield curve remains inverted.


With the stock market now in the grip of a correction, investors need to concentrate on reducing market exposure to the 0%-20% range while building up a robust watchlist of strong stocks that could emerge as leaders when the next uptrend kicks off.


More Data Awaits After Fed Hangover
-----------------------------------


The bears have been giving the bulls a beatdown since Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision. Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear he remains committed to interest rates being higher for longer amid ongoing strength in the U.S. economy.

Investors will be turning their attention to more inflation data in the coming week. The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, is due out Friday. In addition, new home sales data is due Monday, while the latest reading on consumer confidence comes Tuesday.


Noteworthy companies [coming up in the earnings docket](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-costco-cintas-set-to-report-amid-bullish-fundamentals/) in the coming week include **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **Cintas** ([CTAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTAS)) and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)).

Auto Strikes Help This Stock Market Group
-----------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors closed mostly in negative territory. Technology and energy were the only positive areas, while consumer discretionary and financials struggled the most.

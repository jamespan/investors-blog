title: Nasdaq Leads Retreat, But Here's Why The Damage Was Limited

The stock market revealed again its nervousness over how the coronavirus is impacting the economy. But Tuesday's price-and-volume action did not show heavy dumping of top stocks. Plus, the selling itself actually failed to be widespread.




The Nasdaq fell 1.3%, giving back the lion's share of Monday's solid advance. That slightly exceeded a 1% bite out of the Russell 2000. The small-cap S&P 600 lost nearly 0.8%. That turned out to be only slightly bigger than the S&P 500's 0.7% slide.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE. That gave the S&P 500 a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq saw falling issues beat rising ones by a 2-1 ratio. Yet the NYSE's margin of losers vs. winners was less severe. It came in around 5 to 4. Investors appeared to continue hunting for bargains in the utility, retail, transport and REIT sectors.

At one point, it looked like an [inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/) would emerge.


By day's end, that thought was squashed. Tuesday's low in the Nasdaq, 10,397, nipped the Monday session low by 2 points.


That's a trifling amount. But the close at virtually the lows of the day was not.


Relatively few top stocks saw heavy selling.


Headlines streamed across the internet and airwaves of dissension among leaders on Capitol Hill over a new economic aid package to assist workers and firms ravaged by coronavirus.


Congress And Covid-19: More Squabbling Ahead?
---------------------------------------------


The Senate's majority leader, Mitch McConnell, made it 110% clear there's no room for negotiation on liability protections for businesses. Meanwhile, TheHill.com quoted the top ranking Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as saying, "The Senate GOP proposal is a sad statement of their values, selling out struggling families at the kitchen table in order to enrich the corporate interests at the boardroom table."


The HEALS Act also features a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks. But perhaps the market is trying to adjust to the possibility that the fifth legislative measure to keep the economy from dying from Covid-19 will take time to complete.


Can Indexes Move Sideways, Even During Earnings Season?
-------------------------------------------------------


At this point, sideways action would actually serve the confirmed uptrend well.



As seen on a daily chart, the Nasdaq's 50-day moving average has hardly lowered the slope of its advance. At the start of the third quarter, the 50-day line stood at 9352, roughly 7% below the composite index's close of 10,058.


At Tuesday's close, the 50-day line has hiked its way up to 9992, coming within 4% of the Nasdaq's close near 10,401.


When was the last time the Nasdaq made contact with its 50-day line? You'd have to go all the way back to mid-April, just days after the index marked its own [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on April 6.


A sharp two-day pullback on April 20-21 sent the Nasdaq back below the 50-day line. But this pullback served only to recharge the bulls' batteries after the market had charged sharply higher after bottoming out on March 23.


What The Federal Reserve Did Today
----------------------------------


Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is slated to wrap up another two-day meeting on interest rates Wednesday. Virtually no one expects any change in the fed funds rate, which has drifted in a target range of 0% to 0.25% since the U.S. central bank made a 100-basis-point cut in between regular meetings on March 15.


On Tuesday, however, the Fed also made clear that it wants the financial system to continue to support business and lending activities across all sectors. Numerous credit facilities to support money market funds, corporate debt and asset-based securities markets got a three-month extension to Dec. 31. The "Commercial Paper Funding Facility" program saw a six-month extension of operation through March 31.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) sank 1.3%, but the growth-stock ETF continues to ride on the north side of its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).

Stocks Reverse Lower; Market Awaits Fed Chief's Speech
=======================================================

U.S. stock indexes had at least five reasons to step back Thursday, with investors unwilling to risk much on either the bullish or the bearish side.




The Nasdaq closed off 0.1% after being up about 0.5%. The S&P 500 slipped less than 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the small cap S&P 600 fell 0.3% each.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


The July 19 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) fell of the S&P 500's count, whittling the count to four.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MP082318-209x300.jpg)Traders had reasons to play it safe Thursday.


First, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell will be speaking at the Jackson Hole, Wyo., summit Friday. Nothing bold is expected, but the stock market will be watching nonetheless.


Second, the U.S. and China slapped each other with additional tariffs despite trade talks in Washington. Bulls were hoping for signs of agreement rather than additional hostility.


Third, Mexico said Wednesday that the U.S. and Mexico were "hours" from a trade deal. But that proved to be wishful thinking.


Fourth, durable goods orders for July will be released Friday before the open. The Street will be watching closely. Estimates are all over the place â€” from as low as a 2% drop to as high as a 4% increase.


Fifth, the second take on second-quarter GDP will be released Wednesday. The first estimate was 4.1% released July 27. (Q1 GDP also was revised in late July to 2.2%, up from the third reading of 2%, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.)


The St. Louis Fed reports that a survey of professional forecasters pegged U.S. GDP to grow 2.9% in the second half of 2018.


Breakouts And Follow-Up Action
------------------------------


A handful of stocks broke out Thursday. Good follow-up action also emerged among some consumer stocks.


Connected-home play **Control4** ([CTRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRL)) scored a 1% gain Thursday, padding a Tuesday breakout. The stock also rose almost 3% Wednesday.


Control4, a small-cap stock, grew earnings 29% or better in each of the past nine quarters.


Hardware-style retailer **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) knifed 3% higher as it followed up with gains a second straight day after Tuesday's breakout.


Analysts expect Tractor Supply to grow earnings 25% this year, which would be the best growth in six years.


Upscale home furnishings chain **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) gapped above a 63.27 buy point in a double-bottom base. The stock advanced 10.33 to 72.94. Williams-Sonoma late Wednesday [beat profit views and raised guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/williams-sonoma-earnings-rh-stock-buy-points-breakouts/).


Jackson Hole Meeting
--------------------


The Jackson Hole, Wyo., economic summit will continue Friday and Saturday.


On Friday, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell will speak at 10 a.m. ET. The Street will be listening for any changes in the Fed's interest-rate stance.


President Trump recently criticized Powell and the Fed for raising interest rates. Fed watchers will be watching Powell to see if he responds to Trump.


Economic Data
-------------


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 210,000, in line with the lowest estimate in the range.


The flash Composite Purchasing Managers Index for August came in at 55, missing the consensus target of 55.6.


New home sales in July were about 3% lower than expected and below the lowest estimate in the range. Homebuilders and related groups such as wood products were among Thursday's weakest industry groups.

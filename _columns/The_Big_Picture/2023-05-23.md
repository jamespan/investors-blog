Stock Market Takes A Hit As Growth Stocks Fall Hard. Visa, Las Vegas Sands, Meritage Homes Trigger Sell Signals.
=================================================================================================================

Sellers came into the stock market Tuesday as debt-ceiling talks continued on Capitol Hill. Several bank-related industry groups outperformed, but a large number of growth stocks fell sharply as Wall Street continued to fret about a big jump in the 10-year Treasury yield in recent days.




After seven straight up days, the 10-year yield rallied another 4 basis points intraday to around 3.76%. But the yield turned lower by the close, down 2 basis points for the day to 3.70% just after 4 p.m. ET.


Interest rates have been heading higher, but the [CME FedWatch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) is still leaning toward a pause for the Federal Reserve at the June meeting. Futures traders think there's a 72% chance that the federal funds rate will stay right where it is, at 5% to 5.25%.


In related news, the minutes from the early-May Fed meeting will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. After that, the latest monthly report on personal income and spending will be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. Inside the report, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index is expected to come in at 4.3%, up slightly from 4.2% in the year-ago period. Core PCE is expected to be unchanged at 4.6%. That's still well above the Fed's preferred inflation target of 2%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite fell 1.3% but held above its 10-day moving average. Volume rose, giving the index a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


After a series of low-volume gains, **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) slumped below its 21-day exponential moving average and the 300 level, falling nearly 5%. It was one of several stocks in the health care sector that fell sharply.

Meanwhile, several top performers in the medical products group came under heavy selling pressure, including **Stryker** ([SYK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYK)), **Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)), **Inspire Medical Systems** ([INSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSP)) and **Merit Medical Systems** ([MMSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMSI)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP052323-227x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 0.7% and closed below its 50-day line after finding support at the line last week.


**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) was a top gainer in the blue-chip index, up 2.9%, after HSBC upgraded the stock to buy from hold. Chevron on Monday announced plans to buy **PDC Energy** ([PDCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDCE)) in all-stock deal valued at $6.3 billion.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $72.91 a barrel, up 1.2%.


[IBD's homebuilding group](https://www.investors.com/research/homebuilders-top-ranked-industry-suddenly-sees-cracks-appear-dr-horton-lennar/) slumped 1.8% and is now testing its 50-day moving average. **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) slumped below its 50-day line, falling 4.5% in heavy turnover.


Among casino operators, **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) crashed below its 50-day line, falling more than 6% in fast trade.


Movers And Shakers
------------------


The S&P 500 fell 1.1% and closed just above its 21-day line after getting turned away at the 4,200 level on Friday and Monday. Volume rose, giving the benchmark index its seventh distribution day since April 20. But as noted in prior columns, only two of those days saw declines of greater than 1%.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) rallied up close to its 200-day moving average, but a 1.3% intraday gain faded to a loss of 0.5% by the close.


Tuesday's selling notwithstanding, the stock market remains on a confirmed uptrend. But it's been a challenging time for most growth stocks for some time now. And Tuesday's selling was a reminder of that. It's still OK to target fundamentally and technically strong growth stocks, but don't be afraid to lock in partial profits if you have them. Above all else, don't let a small loss spiral out of control. In the current stock market environment, cutting a loss before the 7% common threshold is hit is good practice.

Revenue increased 24% to $1.7 billion.

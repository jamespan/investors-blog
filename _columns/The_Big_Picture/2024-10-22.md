The stock market turned in another resilient performance Tuesday despite earnings sell-offs by homebuilders **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) as well as defense contractors **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) and **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)).




After a sharp drop Monday, the Russell 2000 eased 0.3% and held support at its 21-day exponential moving average. The Nasdaq composite reversed slightly higher for a gain of 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 dipped less than 0.1%. And volume rose on the Nasdaq while it fell slightly on the New York Stock Exchange.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) outperformed on the Dow Jones index, up around 2.5%. It was helped in part by a strong earnings report from Germany-based **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)), which also gave an upbeat outlook for its cloud business.


PulteGroup was one of the worst decliners in the S&P 500 despite reporting accelerating revenue growth. Investors were spooked by news that gross margin fell to 28.8%, hurt by higher incentive costs. PulteGroup slumped 7% and closed below its 50-day line. IBD's homebuilder group was one of the day's worst performers, falling 2.5%.


NVR, Lockheed Martin and GE Aerospace also lagged badly in the S&P 500 after reporting earnings. NVR gave back 2% but held support at its 50-day line. But Lockheed and GE Aerospace fared much worse, with losses of 6% and 9%, respectively.


Stock Market Today: Selling Below The Surface
---------------------------------------------


Despite a mixed and mostly unchanged performance for the major stock indexes, there was some selling below the surface on the stock market today. On a day that saw the market cap weighted S&P 500 edge lower, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) lost nearly 0.5%. The Nasdaq 100 inched up 0.1%, but the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) gave back nearly 0.4%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102224.jpg)Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges by about 5-to-4.


Leading gold producers like **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)), **Alamos Gold** ([AGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGI)) and **Newmont** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) closed with gains ranging from 1.6% to 2.8%. Gold stocks continue to lead the market even as the U.S. dollar strengthens. The gold group was one of the day's best performers, up 1.7%.


The S&P 500 now shows three distribution days, down from four as of Monday. The Sept. 17 [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) for the S&P 500 was removed from the count because enough time has passed — 25 days — to make it irrelevant. The index's mild distribution day from Sept. 18 is scheduled to fall off the count after Wednesday's close.


Distribution days have been more pronounced on the Nasdaq than the S&P 500. Of the Nasdaq's five distribution days, three show declines of at least 1%.


Tesla, ServiceNow Set To Report
-------------------------------


Major stock indexes are still perched near all-time highs even as bond yields rise. After a sharp jump Monday, the 10-year yield added nearly 3 basis points to around 4.21%.


Futures traders at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) are fairly confident about another quarter-point rate cut at the November meeting. But another quarter-point cut in December isn't a sure thing, especially if economic data in coming weeks continues to support the growing narrative that the U.S. economy is in good shape and more rate cuts aren't necessary.


A couple of key earnings reports loom large in the stock market for Wednesday, including **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)). Both report after the close.


Buying demand has dried up in Tesla after a negative response to the company's Robotaxi event on Oct. 10. ServiceNow, on the other hand, continues to hold near highs.

ServiceNow gapped up sharply on July 25 after the company reported strong earnings and raised its full-year subscription revenue outlook.


At the time Chief Executive Bill McDermott said: "ServiceNow's elite‑level execution is reflected in our continued outperformance across all top-line growth and profitability metrics."


He went on to say: "Our relevance as the artificial intelligence platform for business transformation remains stronger than ever as CEOs are looking for new vectors of growth, simplification, and digitization. ServiceNow intends to reinvent every workflow, in every company, in every industry with generative AI at the core."


What To Do Now
--------------


While leading growth stocks like ServiceNow are generally acting well, it's not easy finding new buys because so many big leaders are extended past proper entries. When it comes to new buys, be patient and don't chase the highfliers.


If you see a stock setting up in what looks like a healthy base, make sure the stock's relative strength line is near highs.


And when it comes to current holdings, identify the leaders and laggards and funnel money into what's working. Never throw good money after bad by averaging down.

Nasdaq, S&P 500 Hit All-Time Highs; Farfetch, Palo Alto, ServiceNow In Buy Range
=================================================================================

The major stock indexes added to this week's rebound with strong gains Thursday. Top growth stocks were particularly strong, as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 set all-time highs.




The Nasdaq climbed 1.2%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 2% advance. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.1% each.


Leading growth stocks handily outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 2.1% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 20-ranked **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) soared nearly 20% on strong earnings. Shares are sharply extended from a 9.23 buy point from a June breakout and ripe for at least some profit taking.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, while NYSE volume was slightly higher Wednesday per preliminary data.


Stocks Extend Rebound
---------------------


![MP020421_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP020421_2-254x300.jpg)The Nasdaq followed through on Tuesday's stock market upgrade, shrugging off Wednesday's mild downside reversal. The tech-heavy composite and S&P 500 more than made up for last week's sharp losses and are back at record highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 also hit a new high, indicating institutional investors remain committed to riskier investments.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average is nearing new highs.


With the market showing new strength, investors can shift back to an offense stance, with an understanding that there are still good reasons for some caution. There is an elevated amount of institutional selling on the S&P 500, with five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), although there is still only one on the Nasdaq. Meanwhile, earnings season remains in full swing.


Look for stocks that are breaking out above new buy points, like **Farfetch** ([FTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTCH)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW))**.**


Focus on stocks that showed [strong relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) during last week's sell-off. They could be some of the market's leaders if the indexes continue to rally.



Breakout Stocks To Watch: Farfetch, Palo Alto, ServiceNow
---------------------------------------------------------


New [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Farfetch remains in the 5% buy area above a 65.64 buy point in a narrow pattern. The buy range goes up to 68.92. Shares erased early losses Thursday, closing up 0.2%.


Cybersecurity leader Palo Alto Networks is in the 5% buy area past a 375.10 buy point in a flat base. The 5% buy zone goes up to 393.86. Shares climbed 1.3% Thursday.


ServiceNow is in the 5% buy zone above a 566.84 buy point in a flat base, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis, following Tuesday's breakout move. Shares moved up 2.1% Thursday.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [NOW stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-servicenow-inc-now.aspx) shows a strong 96 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The Composite Rating — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.



Stock Market Earnings: Peloton, Pinterest
-----------------------------------------


**Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) and **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) reported earnings after the close Thursday to mixed reactions.


Peloton closed Thursday with a strong 7% gain, as the stock's 10-week rebound continued. Last week, the stock triggered a round-trip sell rule from a 139.85 buy point. The company reported [better-than-expected quarterly earnings and sales results](https://www.investors.com/news/peloton-earnings-q2-2021-peloton-stock/). But shares tumbled about 6% in extended trade.


Pinterest ended Thursday at new highs after extending a win streak to six sessions. Late Thursday, the company's [strong results](https://www.investors.com/all-categories/pinterest-stock-jumps-earnings-fourth-quarter-pins/) sent shares jumping more than 6% in overnight trade.

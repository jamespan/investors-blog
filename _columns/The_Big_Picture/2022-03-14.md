  Nasdaq Nose-Dives To Its Worst Close Since December 2020; Is It Time To Take Gains In This Industry?

The stock market correction took another turn for the worse Monday as the glamour stocks of 2020 continued to fall harder than key indexes. And the Nasdaq composite, falling 2%, took out its Feb. 24 intraday low. Translation: Its latest rally attempt has gone kaput.




The S&P 500, meanwhile, remains above its Feb. 24 low of 4114. But a 0.7% decline, while lighter than what the Nasdaq suffered, hardly spells confidence for market bulls right now. A seventh loss in eight sessions pushed the large-cap index's year-to-date loss to 12.4%.


Small caps offered no refuge as well. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund slumped 2%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 2.8% to end the day more than 31% below its Nov. 9 peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 1 point.


Monetary Policy, Top Of Mind
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP031422-206x300.jpg)As the Federal Reserve opens a two-day meeting on interest rates Tuesday, practically no one on Wall Street expects anything but for the central bank to raise the fed funds rate by a quarter point to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%. The cost of money has been ultracheap for years. Yet the Fed has made it clear that containing inflation is Job No. 1 right now.


"The primary concern of the Fed is a full un-anchoring of inflation expectations which would then lead to a 1970s stagflationary environment," Joseph LaVorgna and Troy Ludtka, economists at Natixis, wrote in a Monday note to clients. "In response to such a development, the Fed may err on the side of causing a recession in order to further dampen already slowing demand with the intention of wringing inflationary pressure out of the system."


The [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html#) shows a 61% probability that the fed funds rate will stand at least in a range of 1.5%-1.75% by the end of the June 15 FOMC meeting. This would imply at least one quarter-point hike in short-term interest rates this week and a combined five additional quarter-point hikes in May and June.


John Lynch, CIO at Comerica Wealth Management, notes the Fed has not clearly stated its plan about how it would shrink its balance sheet, currently swollen with purchases of long-dated Treasury bonds and agency-backed mortgage securities.


"We have used an assumption of $30 billion per month beginning in May that rises to $75 billion by September and continues at that level through 2025, when the Fed's balance sheet would still total around $6.4 trillion," Lynch wrote in an email to IBD.

Beyond Nasdaq: Oil Falls Hard Again
-----------------------------------


The U.S. is still leading a global campaign to squeeze Russia's finances as the country continues to wage war on neighboring Ukraine. Yet sellers ruled the day in the oil futures market as a sharp drop in black gold did little to help the stock market.



West Texas Intermediate crude oil slid 6.7% to $102 a barrel. Just last week, WTI futures poked above $126. No wonder, then, that some oil producers — from megacap **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) ($324 billion in market value), down 2.4%, to pint-size Permian Basin play **Laredo Petroleum** ([LPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPI)) ($1.2 billion), down 7.2% — fell even harder than the U.S. stock indexes.


**Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)), a large cap with assets across North America and trailing 12-month revenue topping $12 billion, suffered its biggest point-based and percentage-measured decline in a single day since its breakout set afoot on Sept. 23. Shares fell 5.95 points, or 10.1%, in heavy volume.


Devon also closed 8 pennies above its fast-rising [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Meanwhile, the Market Pulse highlights some unusually strong declines in above-average turnover in another small yet significant leading industry group on Wall Street: coal producers.


Testing Key Technical Levels
----------------------------



In addition to **Alpha Metallurgical Recources** ([AMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMR)) and **Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)), keep a close eye on **Peabody Energy** ([BTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BTU)).


BTU shares gapped down at the open and ended down 13.7%. Volume rushed 52% higher than the stock's average over the past 50 sessions.


In the short term, Peabody is making two key technical tests: one, the 21-day exponential moving average; and two, the top of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) that featured an 18.30 [handle entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/).



In the agricultural chemicals industry group, **FMC** ([FMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FMC)) has seen its share of whipsawing action, too. Yet since the Feb. 9 breakout from a [large cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/), the specialist in insecticides, herbicides and fungicides offers a good example of bullish support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).

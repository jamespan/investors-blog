The stock market is getting its winter tan, after capping a rebound week at record highs Friday.




The S&P 500 climbed every day of the week, including Friday's 0.4% increase. The Nasdaq composite added 0.6% Friday. Indexes more than wiped away the previous week's losses. The Nasdaq's 6% gain and the S&P 500's nearly 4.7% rise made it the best week so far for both indexes.


With the late-January bump out of the way, indexes remain in upward price trends. Those began with the October shakeout.


The S&P 500 reduced its [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) by one, after the Jan. 4 sell-off lost its spot thanks to a 5% advance from that day's closing price. The Nasdaq has just one distribution day, and the moderate pileup of distribution in the S&P 500 did not deter indexes from making new highs.


![MP020521](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP020521-219x300.jpg)While distribution is not much of a concern, the Nasdaq still looks overbought. The gap between the composite and its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) swelled to more than 7%. Investor sentiment remains frothy. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) seems stuck below 0.6. In short, investors can't be complacent.


Leading stocks are performing well, with more [breaking out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) each day. On Friday, **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) and **Columbia Sportswear** ([COLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COLM)) were among the breakouts. Earlier in the week, it was **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Joyy** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)).


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) and Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) are both up nearly 12% for the year, pacing well above the stock market indexes.


Small Caps Boost Stock Market
-----------------------------


Small caps continue to exert leadership. The Russell 2000 rose 1.4% Friday and is up more than 13% for the year. In tech, software stocks are on rally mode, with iShares Expanded Tech Software ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) breaking out to new highs. But chips are weakening. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) dropped 0.7%.



One reason for the stock market's strength is the expectation for more stimulus. On Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate on a resolution that cleared the coronavirus relief package. Also, the House approved a budget bill that moves the $1.9 trillion relief plan closer to reality.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average didn't make new highs, but climbed 0.3%. The Dow got a shot in the arm, so to speak, after **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) rose 1.5% after [asking the FDA to approve its Covid-19 vaccine](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-buy-now/).


Friday's [jobs report was mixed](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jjobs-report-hiring-soft-unemployment-rate-falls-dow-jones-futures-rise/). Job growth returned with an increase of 49,000 hirings in January. The unemployment rate eased to 6.3%. Seth Carpenter, an economist at UBS, said the headline job increase largely fits withâ€‰the firm's views of a strong first half.


"Although private payrolls were basically unchanged, aggregate hours worked increased very rapidly," Carpenter said in a report. "The implication is that labor demand was still rising rapidly. The choice to fill labor demand through longer hours rather than new hiring may reflect the Covid constraints that continue to limit labor force participation."

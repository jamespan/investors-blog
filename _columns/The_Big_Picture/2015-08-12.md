=============================================

The major indexes charted one of their most dramatic reversals of the year on Wednesday, but action among market-leading stocks remained negative. At 10:25 a.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was down 1.7%. Just an hour into the 6-1/2 hour session, it looked as if the leading index was going to have its worst day since a 2.4% mauling on June 29.

  

Yet over the next five hours, the Nasdaq rebounded in steady fashion to finish up nearly 0.2% and almost at the session's high. It never came close to potentially taking out its July 8 low of 4901.

  

The S&P 500 rose 0.1%. Volume grew on both major exchanges.

  

Positive reversals deserve an investor's sharp attention. In October, the Nasdaq's intermediate-level correction ended with a pair of back-to-back reversals on Oct. 15 and 16. Three trading days later, the Nasdaq followed through, rising 2.4% in higher volume.

  

That big up day ushered the market's uptrend, which remains intact today.

  

However, a closer look at the market's internals reveals deteriorating health.

  

The Nasdaq's advance-decline continues to fall sharply. On Wednesday, losing stocks edged winners 5 to 4. On the NYSE, the ratio was 17 to 14.

  

There seems to be too many worries on investors' minds — including China's move to devalue its yuan — to encourage widespread buying by institutional players. The Market Pulse shows a much larger contingent of leading stocks that fell in heavy volume than those that rose.

  

More leading stocks are surrendering their recent breakout gains. San Francisco-based **Fitbit** ([FIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIT)), a hot IPO this year, slid all the way back to its 40.55 IPO-base buy point. Just five sessions earlier, the wearables play hit a high of 51.90, up 24%.

  

Fitbit's earnings per share grew 125% and 178% in the past two quarters on sales gains of 209% and 253%. Great numbers. But a new base still needs to form.

  

IBD's New Issues index continues to outperform. As of Wednesday's paper, it's up 8.5% since Jan. 1. IBD's stock tables show the medical, apparel, consumer, finance and leisure sectors are still offsetting prolonged poor action by commodity stocks.

  

The Philly SOX rebounded nearly 0.6%, yet semiconductor stocks generally remain weak. Further declines could affect the Nasdaq's ability to outperform.

  

The Dow utility average, a defensive gauge, rose 1.5%.

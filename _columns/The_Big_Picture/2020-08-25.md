If you love to pick stocks and you exercise discipline in buying [breakouts](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), not breakdowns, then you likely adored the action on Tuesday.




The major indexes showed a sheepish quality — at least in their messaging about the current status of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down nearly 0.3% even after a six-stock shuffle in its components? Midcap stocks down nearly 0.2% (as measured by the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ETF) while the large-cap S&P 500 rallied 0.4% to strike a fourth straight gain?


And how about that Nasdaq composite?


A nearly 0.8% rise, new all-time highs, and 11,000 looking smaller in the rear-view mirror. Certainly, the naysayers on Wall Street are shaking their heads, saying divergence among the major benchmarks is unhealthy.


![MP082520](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP082520-221x300.jpg)Like a broken clock, they'll eventually be right on the timing. But with roughly 5-1/2 weeks left in the third quarter, the market continues to generally favor the dynamic, newer sectors of the economy that are helping Americans and other citizens of the world keep business running and generating sales in the coronavirus era.


Kind of feels like what happened in the second quarter, right?


Powering The Nasdaq
-------------------


Please scan the Market Pulse table. More than half of the leaders up in volume herald from the world's No. 2 economy. Most of these Chinese stocks trade on the Nasdaq.


Tuesday's news of an across-the-globe handshake between U.S. and China negotiators to move forward with Phase 1 of a bilateral trade deal certainly did not hurt the market. But as young NYSE-listed [IPO leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and emerging electric vehicle company **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) showed, China too is not at all afraid to embrace change and innovation in its vast consumer markets.


Nio is clearly in the high 90s when it comes to its "speculative rating." In the second quarter, the all-electric SUV seller lost money, 15 cents per share.


Yet the 140% jump in sales to $526 million has impressed the Street. As MarketSmith pattern recognition noted, the large cap bolted out of a [narrow cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 15.55 buy point, rising 19%. Volume soared to 291 million shares, 124% above the 50-day moving average and the highest level since July 13.



(On Monday, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) grabbed the early attention of the panel on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A). On Tuesday, it was Nio's turn.)


Don't Buy Blindly
-----------------


Not all Chinese ADRs and American Depositary Shares thrived.


Car marketing firm and auto-related website operator **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) fell 2% in heavy trade after posting flat earnings in Q2 on a 3% dip in revenue. The stock is still trying to flesh out a huge base. Autohome hasn't posted a [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/)-style quarter of solid earnings and sales growth since the first quarter of 2019.



Meanwhile, rebounds by the likes of [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), edge computing play **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) and young Brazilian brokerage **XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)) added a bullish tint to Tuesday's session. Reason? All five companies got much-needed institutional buying support — at least for a day — at their respective 50-day moving average.


Numerous other true market leaders, meanwhile, have made pullbacks that have been so light that they are coming more into contact with their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). A plunge below the 21-day line can be viewed as a signal that the stock is poised to make a significant decline and [begin the base-building process again](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


In recent weeks, [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) has quietly raised a red flag about one technical weakness in the market: declining breadth.


But Tuesday's action was positive in this regard: On the Nasdaq, winners trounced losers by a nearly 5-3 margin; on the NYSE, advancers came in at 1,948 vs. 1,850 decliners, based on early data.


Another Red Flag Warning
------------------------


Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management, notes that an 11% rise by the S&P 500 above its 200-day moving average is historically rare yet meaningful. Cetera's research finds that in the past six instances of this occurrence, the benchmark went sideways for an extended period. Yet Goldman is bullish about the middle term for U.S. equities and for active portfolio management.


Here are three reasons. One, his team forecasts a U-shaped economic recovery. This, however, means it will take a while before U.S. GDP growth returns to pre-Covid-19 levels. Two, market volatility is bound to rise as Wall Street continues to react to news on coronavirus. Three, he sees a "shifting investing landscape" not unlike what happened after the Great Recession of 2008-2009. That is, leadership will keep rotating from sector to sector.


"Both financials and industrials have done better when the market is coming out of an economic recession. We do expect industrials to benefit from infrastructure spending," Goldman told IBD. "Tech is expensive, especially relative to other sectors, but it's benefiting from work-from-home."


Cetera provides investing strategy to a large network of financial advisors and investment professionals and has $260 billion in assets under administration.


"We think AI (artificial intelligence) will be like electricity in the 1890s. It will be big, but we don't know yet how big," he added.

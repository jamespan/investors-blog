The stock market took a breather following its blockbuster climb in July. Nevertheless, there were still pockets of strength, with a strong move from **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) helping its industry group bubble higher.




The Nasdaq composite endured a seesaw session, ultimately ending the day about 0.2% lower. This, coupled with lower volume, means it managed to avoid another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


The S&P 500 also flirted with positive territory before ending down 0.3%. Low volume means the index remains unblemished by a distribution day.


Mild losses mean both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 remain well clear of their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


There were slightly more losers than winners among [the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Consumer staples and consumer discretionary were the best areas. Financials and energy fared the worst.

Blue chips showed strength, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping just 0.1%. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) was the standout performer as it powered more than 6% higher, though it remains down almost 19% for the year.


The Russell 2000 bounced off lows to close down just 0.1%. But the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) impressed the most thanks to a slender 0.1% gain.


Overall, losses were mild considering the stock market enjoyed its best month since late 2020 in July. Nevertheless, investors should continue to be nimble and exercise caution in case this is yet another bear-market bounce.


Manufacturing Index Falls As Inventories Rise
---------------------------------------------


The Institute for Supply Management's U.S. manufacturing index fell to 52.8 in July from 53 in June. This was slightly higher than economists expected.


Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, said that firms "continue to hire at strong rates, with few indications of layoffs, hiring freezes or head count reduction through attrition."


The ISM report also showed that price increases for inputs are slowing as inventories pile up.


"Prices paid plunged the most since 2010 and that along with concerns of a softer economy should support further pricing relief over the coming months," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients. "New orders declined, while employment improved, which supports the argument that supply and demand side drivers are balancing here."


As the economy slows, it will give the Federal Reserve more latitude to slow interest-rate hikes. This would be beneficial to the stock market.


Stock Market Group Gains As Celsius Stock Fizzes Higher
-------------------------------------------------------


Celsius stock helped the nonalcoholic beverages industry group outperform on the stock market Monday.


CELH stock fizzed more than 11% higher on news that **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) is investing $550 million for an estimated 8.5% ownership stake as part of a long-term distribution deal with the energy drink maker. Celsius, [which ranks third on the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10), is now well clear of its moving averages and getting closer to its November peak.



PepsiCo stock bubbled up 1.1% while rival **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) dipped 1.1%.


Despite this, it was mail-order retail, periodicals and wholesale food stocks that shined the brightest.


Discount retailers also had a good day. A bounce off the 10-week moving average saw **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) win a spot on the prestigious [IBD Leaderboard list of stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


Energy stocks dominated the downside, with both national and international oil and gas explorers, oilfield services plays and machinery and equipment stocks locking the bottom spots. Newspaper plays and miners were among other lagging areas. The price of U.S. crude fell 4.8% to $93.89 a barrel in Nymex trading.

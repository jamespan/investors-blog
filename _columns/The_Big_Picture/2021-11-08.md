The stock market extended its rally, with the Nasdaq making an 11th consecutive gain, although a late fade and other signs suggested indexes are getting tired.




While the Nasdaq notched its longest win streak since December 2019, the index was subdued, with a 0.1% gain after a day of narrow price moves. For the first time in seven sessions, the Nasdaq did not make a new high, though it did make a new closing high. It now faces a test at the 16,000 level.


The S&P 500 climbed 0.1% also, its eighth consecutive increase. That matched the longest win streak since April 2019, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%. Both indexes made record closing highs.


Small caps started strongly but closed with the Russell 2000 up only 0.2%. That's another index that has been rising sharply. Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE.

While there's no clear topping signal and [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) has nearly disappeared, the market could use a break at this point.


Stock Market May Need A Break
-----------------------------


There are no signs of a correction, per se, but a cooling of the market rally would not be surprising. In other words, investors could see their holdings give back some gains but not face sell situations.


The stock market has some momentum going for itself, and history is on its side right now. November is the start of the best three-month period in the market. The Nasdaq's average gain in the November-January period is 6.3%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and Dow rise 3.4% on average.


November tends to be a good month on its own. Since 1950 and over the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, according to LPL Financial. It ranks second over the past 20 years and during postelection years.


"We all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare," Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist, said in an Oct. 27 report. "Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys."


Headlines drove much of the trading Monday.


Infrastructure Stocks Rally On New Funding Bill
-----------------------------------------------


Congress late Friday passed a massive infrastructure spending bill, which fanned [infrastructure stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/infrastructure-bill-cat-lifts-dow-jones-vmc-stld-x-fcx-stock-near-buy-points/). Construction machinery, cement, steelmakers and heavy construction were in the top 15 on Monday's industry groups.



U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF ([PAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAVE)) rose 1.3% to a new high, though it climbed as much as 2.3% early Monday.


**U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) broke out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) but closed just below the 27.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). IBD 50 stock **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) gapped up to a 5.5% gain.


Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) climbed 1.3% and was one of Monday's best performing S&P sector ETFs. The fund is trying to rise above the 89.31 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of an irregular pattern that nevertheless has the [elements of a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). From that perspective, XLB had already cleared an 86.73 buy point, 10 cents above the middle peak's high.


Travel stocks saw their own rally after the U.S. lifted its ban on nonessential travel from 33 countries, including European nations, to vaccinated travelers. The pandemic restrictions had been in effect for more than 18 months.


IBD's airlines industry group gained 1.4% on a price-weighted basis, travel booking rose 1.5% and lodging added 0.7%.


Stock Market's Chip Rally Continues
-----------------------------------


Bullish news for **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) helped extend a rally in semiconductor stocks.


AMD roared more than 10% Monday to a new high. The chip designer [announced new specialized processors](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-jumps-on-new-data-center-chips-facebook-win/) for data centers and said it will sell server chips to **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


The energy sector was Monday's second best after materials. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 0.9% after U.S. oil prices added 1.2% to $82.24 a barrel late Monday. State-run oil company Saudi Aramco boosted crude prices on exports Monday, which gave the sector some support.


**Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) climbed above a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) entry at 61.59 and gained 6% in active turnover. The small-cap stock has been rallying since the oil producer reported earnings last week.


The oil exploration and production company is in the IBD 50, which outperformed the stock market with a 0.6% increase. Callon, Cleveland-Cliffs and AMD helped the index.

Stocks stepped ahead for a fourth consecutive day Friday, as the market brushed aside its recent concerns.


The Nasdaq added 0.4%, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.2%. The IBD 50 slipped 0.2%. Volume fell across the board, as the July Fourth holiday approached. The market will reopen Tuesday.


Beginning June 28, the market did a remarkable job climbing the wall of worry.


Britain's vote to leave the European Union revived fears of a contagion that some said could lead to a recession in the rest of Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere.


![MP070116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP070116-223x300.jpg)Fears of a U.S. recession were a theme at the end of 2015. In early December, for example, Citigroup pegged the odds of a recession at 65%.


Those fears faded in February when the stock market began a fairly steady run-up over two months.


If the recession fears were back, they apparently were only worth a brief, though intense, sell-off. On Friday and Monday stocks sold off hard but by Tuesday's close, it appeared to be over.


However, a continued rebound is not a done deal or even necessarily likely. The coming weeks should be interesting.


One positive development during the past week was the manufacturing reports. The Chicago PMI survey for June and the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index both beat the Street's estimates soundly. Manufacturing has been a recent sore point in the economy.


In the coming week, factory orders for May will be reported Tuesday.


On Wednesday, two services indexes and the Federal Reserve's minutes from its mid-June meeting will be released.


Thursday's reports include chain store sales, the ADP employment report and first-time jobless claims.


Friday's headline report before the open will be the payrolls and unemployment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.


Regardless of how the week's reports shake out, caution is expected to have its adherents. The reason? Earnings season.


Companies reporting earnings include **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) on Wednesday and **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) on Thursday. But that's just the start.


In the week beginning July 11, earnings reports will get busier and of more weight. Several major financials will be reporting.


For the stock market itself, there will be some key charts to watch in the coming weeks.


First, keep an eye on the S&P 500. On Friday the index cleared its old nemesis, the 2100 area. Attempts to climb higher from there, and put that area in the rearview mirror, have failed repeatedly since August.


Second, monitor the Nasdaq chart. The Nasdaq has a more immediate problem -- staying above the 50-day moving average. This line has acted as on-again and off-again resistance since early May. If the 50-day line can be turned into support, then the Nasdaq's next big test will be around 5000.


Third, watch the balance of new highs to new lows. This has improved, but largely because of NYSE stocks. The Nasdaq is lagging.


Fourth, watch for breakouts. On Friday, **Beacon Roofing Supply** ([BECN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BECN)) broke out of a flat pattern in heavy volume. The relative strength line is at a high, which is bullish.


For the week, the Nasdaq bolted 3.3% higher. The S&P 500 and the IBD 50 each gained 3.2%.

The stock market started off the third quarter in fine fashion Tuesday, with solid percentage gains in higher volume. The Nasdaq notched another 14-year high and the S&P 500 marked another closing high.


At the close, the Nasdaq rose 1.1% and the S&P 500 added 0.7%. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.8%, closing 44 points below the 17,000 level. Volume rose nicely from Monday, a sign that institutional investors are doing a lot of the heavy lifting.


Breadth was solid as advancers topped decliners by about 2-to-1 on the NYSE and better than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


The IBD 50 picked up 1.7%, helped by shares of **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)), which soared 14% on positive drug-trial results. Nearly half the names on the list outperformed the Nasdaq.


Tuesday's session was a bullish accumulation day for the major averages. The market has acted well since the May 27 follow-through day, with scant signs of institutional selling. True, some recent breakouts have been hesitant — like **Facebook**'s ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) — but plenty of others are working. There's no reason to be overly negative about the market with the distribution-day count as low as it is.


Most Wall Street firms closed their books for the second quarter on Monday. That means earnings season is right around the corner. The market not only seems optimistic about continued economic improvement but also about the prospects for a solid second-quarter earnings season.


A couple of headlines fueled positive sentiment early, including solid manufacturing data out of China and a Goldman Sachs' upgrade of **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).


Netflix and **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) helped lift the Nasdaq 100 to a 1.2% gain. Netflix soared 7% after Goldman upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and raised its price target to 590 from 380, citing the potential for continued strong subscriber growth ahead.


After some recent signs of institutional selling, Regeneron reclaimed its 10-week moving average, rising 7%, after **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)) increased its stake in the drugmaker to 22.5% from 20.5%. The two companies are working on several promising drugs together, including a cholesterol drug and rheumatoid arthritis drug.


Other Nasdaq-listed drugmakers turned in solid performances with gains of 3% to 4%, including **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)).


Fast-growing **King Digital Entertainment** ([KING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KING)) added 3%, bringing its two-day gain to 19%. It poked above a 21.49 IPO base buy point but ended just below it. It went public in late March at 22.50. King Digital is the developer of "Candy Crush Saga" and other mobile games.

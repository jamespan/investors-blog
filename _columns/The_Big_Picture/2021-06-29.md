  Market Favors Bulls On Penultimate Day Of 2nd Quarter; How Do Internals Look Now?

If you had to pick a single word to describe the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) on its penultimate session of the second quarter, perhaps you could choose this one: friendly.




Gains among the major indexes? Mild. Losses by the Russell 2000 (down 0.6%) and midcap stocks (around 0.1%, judging by SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund)? Also on the milquetoast side of the spectrum. Movements in key government bonds? Calm. And finally, action in the normally big-swinging commodities markets, including WTI crude oil (now above $72 barrel) and copper? Favorably dull.


In short, for a stock market that has spent all but two trading days in June under IBD's "confirmed uptrend" banner, the action has remained friendly to the bulls.


The Nasdaq composite traced its sixth gain in seven sessions on Tuesday. It rose 0.2% to new all-time highs. The S&P 500 edged up a little more than 1 point. The large-cap benchmark also stretched into new highs for the fourth session in a row.


![MP062921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP062921-229x300.jpg)The recent gains have been so mild that none of the three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on either the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 are close to getting wiped out by the 5% advance rule. But the amount of [pronounced institutional profit-taking](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains at a level that justifies risk-taking among high-quality equities.


Plus, recent sell-offs in higher turnover vs. the prior session have tilted toward the milder side.


On the S&P 500, the biggest drop within the distribution-day count stands at 1.3%, set on June 18. Volume soared that day on [quadruple witching](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/options-expiration-witching-days-do-they-place-the-market-under-a-spell-or-not/).


The average decline among the Nasdaq's three distribution days, at 0.6%, lacks bite.


A Subtle Sign Of Stock Market Strength
--------------------------------------


The accompanying Market Pulse shows more highly rated companies rising in heavy volume vs. those that fell in above-average turnover.


Meanwhile, volume rose nearly 14% on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE, early data showed. However, [the MarketSmith homepage](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) notes that 140 stocks gained in heavy volume while 181 fell in the same manner.


When stocks break out, you want them to [break out with gusto](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) — not just in terms of price, but also in trading volume.

Early readings on Tuesday showed a curious divergence in terms of the stock market's breadth.


Data on E-Trade's market site shows falling issues outpacing rising ones by a 7-6 ratio on the NYSE, and by a much wider 3-2 margin on the Nasdaq. For a complete picture, please see the advance-decline lines plotted for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq in the General Market Indicators page, found as a link at the bottom of this story.


You generally want to see more stocks climbing as the major indexes advance. When the opposite occurs, it indicates fewer stocks are participating in the rally. We saw this negative development ahead of the awful bear market of 1973 to 1974 — when the "Nifty Fifty" term became Wall Street jargon — and ahead of the mighty dot-com bubble when it crashed in March 2000. From its then peak of 5132, the Nasdaq composite fell 79%.


Is Leadership Still Broadening?
-------------------------------


Today, however, market leadership is not completely driven by just one or two sectors.


A minority of banking issues showed fortitude on Tuesday following recent sell-offs in the wake of a flattening U.S. Treasury bond yield curve. On Tuesday, the spread between 2-year and 10-year notes shrank to 122 basis points (0.27% vs 1.49%, according to U.S. Treasury data) vs. 146 basis points on June 1. Many of the biggest lenders announced big dividend increases after they passed the latest Federal Reserve-imposed stress tests.


Just look at the new highs list at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) these days, and it's lately been broadly distributed across multiple areas of the economy.


For instance, on Monday, [140 companies reached new all-time or 52-week highs on the Nasdaq](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jun-28-2021/). Just 29 slumped to new lows. On the NYSE, the ratio also proved favorable (90 vs. 13). Software, Medical, Finance, Business Services and Retail topped the new highs list.

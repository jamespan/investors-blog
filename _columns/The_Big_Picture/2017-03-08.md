Is the porridge still just right? That is, not too cold, not too hot? It may depend on what asset class you are tasting.


The S&P 500 fell for the fourth time in five sessions on Wednesday, falling 0.2%. Yet at 2362 the large-cap benchmark is only 1.6% below its all-time high of 2400.98. The Nasdaq composite squeaked higher, halting a virtually invisible two-day losing streak.




Those moves stood in stark contrast to heavy selling in some commodities and U.S. government bonds as investors got more evidence via a strong private sector jobs report that the U.S. economy is picking up steam. But it's not quite yet to the level of overheating that would spur the Federal Reserve to raise the cost of money sharply.


Amid strength in the U.S. dollar and surging oil output and stockpiles, U.S. crude oil prices plunged more than 5% to $50.28 a barrel, hitting their lowest levels for the year. Gold slid to five-week lows. Copper prices fell 1% and have now sunk 7% below their February peak.


The continued tiny moves by the U.S. equity markets seem to show that stocks looked poised to keep rising, even as the bull market goes into Year 9 since the March 2009 bottom (or Year 7, if you consider the 20.4% drop by the Nasdaq from May to October in 2011 as big enough of a decline to have been a bear market).


The NYSE composite showed it's more exposed to commodity and rate-sensitive names, falling 0.5%. The Russell 2000 dropped 0.6% while the Dow Jones utility average got whacked with a 1.5% sell-off.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP4-4_030817-602x1024.png)Volume rose on both major indexes, so the S&P 500 got tagged with a fourth day of mild distribution over the past 25 sessions. None of those four [distribution days](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), which include a stalling day on Feb. 7, showed a decline of more than 0.3%.


The selling in government debt, however, got nastier.


Yield on the 10-year benchmark U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.55%, according to Tradeweb. That's just 5 basis points below its 52-week high of 2.60%. Yields on the one-, two-, three- and five-year notes are all at multiyear highs.


Based on fed funds futures data provided by the CME Group, the market now sees a 91% probability that the Federal Reserve will boost short-term interest rates by another 25 basis points at next week's meeting. That would be its second rate hike in just four months.


On the economic side, an unusually strong ADP private sector jobs report (298,000 jobs added, blasting the Econoday consensus estimate of 183,000) reflected growing confidence by employers. On the other hand, a revised batch of data showed that U.S. productivity is still mild. Plus, unit labor costs rose 1.7%, still below the Federal Reserve's preferred target of 2% inflation.


While the rise in yields certainly is hurting holders of long-term bonds, it actually helps bolster the long-term argument for equities.


One, a higher interest rate will encourage saving, the mother of investment. Two, banks, long suffering from eight years of an upward spiral in federal regulation, have the chance to offset their higher costs with more profit on products that depend on a spread between the rates in which they pay to gather deposits and the rates in which they offer loans. And three, the Federal Reserve continues to emphasize an intention to remove "accommodative" policy that has artificially kept interest rates near zero for years to prevent the 2008-09 Great Recession from coming back.


The Fed has an ally in the strong U.S. dollar. A strong currency may not be an exporter's good friend, but it certainly is helping to contain inflation. Many commodities, including crude oil and gold, are priced in U.S. dollars. Remember back in 2008, when crude oil screamed to more than $145 a barrel? A weak U.S. dollar helped the cause.


While the energy sector suffered a broad meltdown, investors snapped up shares in some biotech, chip, software and beaten-down retail stocks. As seen in IBD's Smart [Nasdaq and NYSE research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-mar-07-2017/), just behind No. 1 Banks are Chips (No. 2), Computers (No. 3) and Electronics (No. 4).


Looking at the 197 group rankings, the bottom 25 are still littered with retail and food stocks. So, strength in retail names pointed to bargain-hunting, but economists generally agree that lower energy prices serve as a sort of tax cut, benefiting consumers.


Market breadth was negative on Wednesday. Despite the Nasdaq's slight gain, losing issues actually exceeded winners by a nearly 3-to-2 margin. On the NYSE, losers spanked winners by nearly 3-to-1. Even as the Nasdaq has moved into new high ground lately, the composite's advance-decline line has fallen sharply for nearly two weeks. You'd prefer to see both measures rise together.


While banks are still at the top of IBD's 33 sector rankings (found in the IBD [Data Tables section)](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). Yet these stocks' recent moves are clearly not as shiny as they were in November and December.


For example, banks have lost their spot at the top rung of IBD's screened new high list in recent days. On March 1, a big up day for the market, banks topped the heap with 72 new highs; medical was a distant second at 28, followed by insurance (27) and finance (25). But in the past three trading days, the medical sector moved to the top.


Granted, the new-high list itself has shrunk considerably compared with mid to late February. It's natural for fewer banks to hit new highs, even as the world now expects the Fed to raise the fed funds rate next Wednesday. Why? The banks have had a hot run, and need to cool off.


The possibility of three hikes in interest rates this year, coupled with a [potential change in tax deductions](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/tax-reform-threatens-to-end-key-deduction-for-utilities/) related to interest paid on debt, is pressuring the REIT sector.


 **DuPont Fabros Tech** ([DFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DFT)) slid beneath its 50-day moving average in 25% higher than normal turnover. Peer **Digital Realty Trust** ([DLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLR)) is testing support at the 50-day line. In 2016, both data center operators got plenty of press in IBD's [The Income Investor column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/).
High-growth stocks are still having a good year so far. The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) sported a 6.8% gain year to date through Tuesday, better than the S&P 500's 5.5% gain through Wednesday's close.


Bulls polled by Investors Intelligence actually came down a notch this week, which may be healthy for the long-term uptrend. Bullishness fell to 57.7%, dropping below the 60% level (that the research firm calls a red flag) for the first time since the end of January.


This means that as many as 42.3% of pundits polled now see the market either going into an intermediate-level correction or a full-blown bear market. Healthy pessimism is ultimately good for the market.

Stock Rebound Showed Some Positive Elements; Investors Watch Senate Election Results
=====================================================================================

The stock market rebounded from Monday's sell-off, as major indexes passed their first test of the new year.




The Nasdaq, buried for a 1.5% loss on Monday, made up much of it with a 0.9% gain Tuesday. The S&P 500 bounced 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%.


While the stock market's gains did not offset the prior day's losses, it didn't mean bulls went away unhappy. Indexes closed near session highs. Advancers led decliners by a 13-5 ratio on the NYSE and by 12-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


![MP010521](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP010521-209x300.jpg)More important was the successful test of support. As [The Big Picture noted](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-slides-faces-key-test-2021-starts-on-bad-note/) after Monday's sell-off, indexes tested their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Tuesday's gains meant that a crucial support level held, and the market passed a new year's test.


Small caps led the rebound as the Russell 2000 rallied 1.7%. The index stood out by recouping all of Monday's losses, and then some.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and early data showed lower NYSE volume. It's always better when market gains come in higher volume, especially after Monday's decline in heavy trading. The S&P 500 still has a high number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which is a risk for the market.


New Breakouts In Stock Market
-----------------------------


Two days into the new year, the stock market seems to be getting through a bout of volatility without major damage. Investors should feel confident enough to remain with a high exposure to stocks and add to their portfolios.


The IBD 50 rose 1.3%. **Futu Holdings** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) was responsible for much of the gain. The Chinese online brokerage soared nearly 20% and broke out of a cup base. Shares closed extended from the 51.20 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



Leading stocks passed a technical test of their own. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and other leading stocks that slid to their 50-day moving averages held above those key levels Tuesday, even if their gains were mild.


Futu wasn't the only Chinese stock to rally. Most rose on favorable news for companies facing delisting. The New York Stock Exchange reversed a decision to delist three China telecoms the U.S. government said are allies of the Chinese military.


[IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/jd-com-ibd-stock-of-the-day-china-stock-baba-pdd/) **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) also broke out, clearing a 92.87 buy point in heavy volume. U.S.-based **Diodes** ([DIOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIOD)) and **PerkinElmer** ([PKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKI)) broke out of ascending bases.


Georgia Senate Election In Focus
--------------------------------


If the stock market was [concerned about the U.S. Senate elections in Georgia](https://www.investors.com/news/georgia-runoff-elections-have-huge-implications-for-stock-market-outlook/), that fear did not manifest itself Tuesday. Control of the Senate is at stake, and so is the future of key policies such as coronavirus aid, antitrust regulation and health insurance.


The stock market is keenly aware of the consequences. One reason stocks rallied after the November election was the likely scenario in which Democrats held the White House and House, but Republicans kept a majority in the Senate. That ensured a divided government, which many on Wall Street view favorably.


The energy sector was Tuesday's best after the price of U.S. crude climbed above $50 a barrel for the first time since February 2020. Oil prices topped the $50 level before closing slightly below $50, up 5% on the day.


Crude rallied after [Saudi Arabia made a surprise announcement that it will cut production](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/05/oil-breaks-above-50-for-the-first-time-since-february.html) by 1 million barrels per day production from February through March, CNBC reported. It came one day after major oil producers agreed to hold production at current levels.


Oil prices already were rising this week after Iran claimed it detained an oil tanker, ostensibly because of environmental violations. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) jumped 4.5%.

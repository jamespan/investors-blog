No matter what year we are in, the challenge of a stock market that has gone into new-high ground often comes down to this: Stocks can gush lower as well.




Perhaps that was best seen among one of the popular indexes Wednesday, even if it's not the strongest performing: the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which slumped 411 points, or 1.1%, to 38,441.


At the close, the Dow industrials finished 4% below the all-time peak of 40,007, which the index accomplished only six days ago. At that peak, the Dow Jones hoisted its year-to-date gain to a respectable 6.3%.


Yet, as the daily chart shows, the slide has been visibly steep. Plus, the Dow Jones index dropped further below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), one of the most important technical levels that savvy investors monitor.



At least 11 components in the price-weighted Dow fell 2 points or more. But **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) really stood out.


A nearly 19-point loss, or 3.8%, to 484.72 yanked the health insurance giant back below the 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly four weeks.


Investors got spooked by [news of states making low reimbursements to Medicaid program providers](https://www.investors.com/news/unh-stock-unitedhealth-dow-jones-medicaid-redeterminations/). UNH stock's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) of 32 (according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-unitedhealth-group-unh.aspx)) means UnitedHealth has outperformed just 32% of all companies in the IBD database over the past 12 months. According to the Technical panel of UnitedHealth's chart in [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF), the three-month RS Rating of 63 is better, yet still mediocre.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Fellow Dow Jones component **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) got hammered as much as 18% after hours on its quarterly earnings. Earnings beat views, but the April-quarter revenue of $9.13 billion [missed Wall Street's forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-news-q12024/) by $20 million.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP052924-213x300.jpg)Selling turned out broadly across the stock market. And the decline arrived in tandem with another sell-off in long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds.


Smaller issues fell the most, with the Russell 2000 closing down 1.5% and the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund off 1.3%. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%, same as the Nasdaq 100. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.6%.


Nasdaq volume rose vs. Tuesday to 6.65 billion shares, spelling a fresh [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for that index. Turnover fell 5% on the NYSE.


Meanwhile, the price of the benchmark 10-year government bond rose for the fourth time in five sessions. It also marked the seventh fall in nine trading days. Hence, the cost of money has surged in recent weeks. On May 15, the 10-year note yielded 4.35%. It's now jumped to 4.62%.


Investors will be bracing for Friday's PCE index reading on April inflation as well as monthly labor market data the following week. [According to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), Wall Street sees the personal consumption expenditures index rising 2.7% year over year, unchanged vs. March.


Declines Beyond The Stock Market
--------------------------------


In terms of industry groups, retailing, computer, and oil and gas firms led the stock market drop. At least two dozen of IBD's 197 industries slid 2% or more. (See the entire daily performance at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Like the Dow Jones, the NYSE composite, down 1%, also undercut its 50-day moving average. Losers surpassed winners on that exchange by a 5-1 margin.


On the Nasdaq, breadth had actually turned positive in recent days. Not on Wednesday. Falling issues beat gainers by nearly a 3-1 ratio. Also, the 10-day moving average of the Nasdaq's advance-decline line peaked in the middle of last week and has begun to soften. ([See the chart on MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) by going to "GMIAB" on a daily chart. The NYSE's A-D line, along with the 10-day moving average, is seen on "GMIAA.")


IBD has kept the current outlook at a target exposure range of 60%-80%, despite the market's notable achievements lately â€” whether it's Dow 40,000, Nasdaq 17,000, or simply the key indexes rising to new highs.


Keep in mind that even 60%-80% is quite a wide range. Amid Wednesday's stock market drop, the impact of having 20% cash in the portfolio will be notably different vs. a 40% cash holding.


Portfolio Management Today
--------------------------


If you've had good feedback from your most recent buys, it likely means that you're selecting the true stock market leaders. Such positive selection would warrant increasing exposure to the high end of the 60%-80% range. But a string of losses may signal that your newest holdings have peaked and may need more time to set up properly.



Plus, the pounding of shares in enterprise software firm **Nutanix** ([NTNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTNX)) in extended-hours trading hammered home the importance of not chasing stocks beyond their proper buy points.


Nutanix, which gained 2.1% in heavy volume in the regular session, slumped more than 9% after hours. The company soundly beat views on earnings (28 cents per share vs. the FactSet forecast of 16 cents) and sales ($524.6 million vs. estimate of $516.2 million). But Nutanix's fiscal Q4 top-line estimate of $530 million to $540 million fell short of Wall Street's target of $546.1 million.


Nutanix had recently exited the 5% buy zone from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) with a buy point at 66.98.


Investor Sentiment Indicators
-----------------------------


Despite the Nasdaq hitting 17,000 for the first time earlier in the week, it's hard to say that investors are feeling overly ebullient.


Amid the strong gains in five straight up weeks, the Investors Intelligence survey of stock market pundits showed the bullish ratio climb to 59.4% vs 46.2% in late April.


When the bulls' ratio reached 62.5% in the week of April 1, marking a nearly three-year high, this unusually high level of optimism arrived just as the S&P 500 initiated a three-week slide.


Yet the CNN Fear and Greed Index finished the day at 47, or neutral territory, on a scale of 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). One week ago, the index rose to 58, in the greed territory. A month earlier, it was at 43, or in the fear zone.


In general, focus your new buys when there's a healthy sampling of fear or skepticism. This means a considerable number of investors doubt the stock market advance. However, at some point they could become obliged to buy.

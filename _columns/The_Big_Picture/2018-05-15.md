Stock Market Slides As Bond Yields Spike; Are Indexes Making Another Turn?
===========================================================================

While spiking interest rates had Wall Street rattled, Tuesday's decline in the stock market seemed normal after several days of gains.




After stalling out Monday, the S&P 500 fell 0.7% and the Nasdaq composite 0.8%. Volume was higher. It was the largest loss this month for the Nasdaq and nearly the largest for the S&P 500. But in the context of the month's gains, some type of breather was almost inevitable. The Nasdaq climbed 5.7% from a May 3 low to Monday's peak. May is still a positive month, with the composite up 4%.


The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.8% and is meeting resistance around 25,000.


Still, Tuesday's selling left its mark and left investors wondering if the market is headed for another one of its turns. The losses in higher volume gave the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 a new [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). That's six for the S&P 500.


IBD raised its market outlook to "confirmed uptrend" on Thursday, and gains from that point are mostly gone now. Such is the market in 2018, when it's hard to get stocks in any direction for more than a couple of weeks. The longest Nasdaq move this year was the advance from the Feb. 9 low to the peak on March 13, which still stands as its all-time high. That's a sharp contrast with last year, when the market hardly dipped.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MP_6x2_051518-242x300.jpg)On Tuesday, rising bond yields caused new worries. At 3 p.m. ET, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 3.08%, up 8.5 basis points from Monday and up 66.9 basis points so far this year, according to data from Tradeweb. That left the bench mark yield at its highest closing point since July 2011. Tuesday's high of 3.094% also is the highest since July 2011.


Tuesday's spike in yields came after news on April retail sales that rose 0.3% from February and 0.3% excluding autos. That met forecasts, but economists expected a 0.5% gain ex-autos. The report [looked stronger after March's increase was revised upward](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/solid-retail-data-in-april-boost-fed-rate-hike-odds/) to 0.8% from 0.6%.


Expectations are increasing for more interest-rate hikes. Futures markets see a roughly 55% chance of a fourth rate hike this year, in December. A month ago, the odds for a December hike were less than 40%. With yields moving sharply, stocks most sensitive to interest rates fell the most.


Homebuilders were the worst-performing industry group. **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **William Lyon Homes** ([WLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLH)) and **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) fell sharply below the 200-day moving average. Some other builders made new lows.


Property real estate investment trusts and automakers — two other types of investments sensitive to interest rates — were down 1.5%. Semiconductor, consumer products and auto manufacturers were sharply lower as well.


**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) fell after the home-improvement chain's [revenue and same-store sales](https://www.investors.com/news/home-depot-reports-earnings-sales-miss/) for the first quarter came in soft. Concerns over severe winter weather in parts of the country and rising mortgage rates also have weighed.


The 10-year Treasury yield rose even more than 2-year yields. That steepening the slope of the yield curve, which was a good change for banks' net interest margins. The SPDR S&P Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) ETF climbed 0.7% and SPDR S&P Bank ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) 0.5%.


On the regulatory front, Bloomberg reported that [regulators may change the Volcker Rule](https://www.investors.com/news/regulators-volcker-rule-jpmorgan-chase-goldman-sachs/) to make it easier for banks to handle short-term trading.


Semiconductor stocks also were weak, but **Cree** ([CREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREE)) made a new closing high, while beaten-up **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) rose for the eighth time in the past nine days.

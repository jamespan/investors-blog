The stock market plunged Tuesday, a reminder of just how difficult it's been for the indexes to mount a lasting rally.


The Nasdaq melted 2.2% and the S&P 500 1.9%. Volume rose, marking the second time in a week that Wall Street came under institutional-sized selling, i.e., a distribution day.


Both indexes closed near session lows, but stopped their declines at important chart levels: The Nasdaq's current footrest is at the 4500 level, the S&P 500's is at 1900.


Tuesday's slide echoed the difficulties the market is having trying to stay upright. Since January, days of strong gains soon have been doused by sell-offs.


![MP020216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP020216-1-185x300.jpg)The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are now below the closing prices of the Jan. 26 follow-through. Downside volume has exceeded upside trading, a bearish factor reflected in the indexes' weak Accumulation/Distribution Ratings.


Despite those struggles, the indexes are starting to trend upward and have the benefit of last week's follow-through bottoming signal.


But if the market is getting out of rehab, it's still in a halfway house, not ready to venture out unsupervised.


Only a handful of leading stocks have broken out of bases. That alone should be keeping investors with ample cash in their portfolios.  If the uptrend truly can blossom, expect more top stocks to break out, and to add exposure with more confidence.


Tuesday's rout came as oil prices ebbed, and stocks followed. Crude's two-day rout of 11% is the biggest in seven years. The energy sector was one of the day's poorest performers.


The IBD 50 tumbled 1.9%. **Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)), which plummeted 27% after reporting results, was responsible for much of that loss. The chipmaker's [sales guidance was disappointing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/integrated-device-plunges-on-q4-too-high-bar-sales-guide-miss/?ven=YahooCP&src=AURLLED&ven=yahoo).


Other earnings reports caused sharp stock declines. It was noteworthy how some companies cited trends symptomatic of a slowing economy.


Global shipping company **UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) beat profit views, but CEO David Abney said the outlook for the global economy remains uncertain.


**Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) gave weak guidance for the current year while Q4 and 2015 revenues missed expectations. The cruise line cited, among other factors, a strengthening dollar and weakness in Latin America.


**Ryder System** ([R](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=R)), the giant truck rental company, slid 5% in heavy volume after it missed estimates and gave a soft forecast, citing used-tractor prices and rental demand at the low end of company forecasts.


Auto manufacturers were one of the day's weakest groups, mainly because **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) got hammered 7%. Pacific Crest Securities cut its 2016 EPS estimate to 27 cents from 76 cents, saying that channel checks show Model X orders continue to lag expectations.


The car industry's sales for January were better than expected, though. The annualized sales pace rose to 17.56 million units last month, up from 17.34 million in December and above forecasts for 17.5 million.

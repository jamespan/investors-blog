title: Stock Market Rally Finds Another Gear; Nasdaq Rises Above 9000 Despite Weak Jobs Data

The stock market delivered another day of strong gains Friday, undeterred by a weak [April jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/coronavirus-jobs-report-20-5-million-jobs-lost-14-7-unemployment-rate/). Small caps led the charge, and the Nasdaq composite delivered a subtle clue about its underlying health.




The Nasdaq ended the week on a high note, rising 1.6%. For the week, it rose 6%. Not only did the leading index close solidly above the 9000 level, but its 50-day moving average has started to point higher after a two-month downtrend. This is a noteworthy occurrence and bodes well for the confirmed uptrend.


But a pullback for the stock market wouldn't be surprising, either.


The Nasdaq has paid a couple of visits to its 10-day moving average since its April 6 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-multiple-positive-signals-but-short-one-ingredient/). The Nasdaq closed Friday over 3% above its 10-day moving average and nearly 6% above its 21-day moving average. The index could pull back to both of these levels without doing any damage to its chart.


Stock Market Rally Helped By Low Distribution Day Count
-------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MP050820-260x300.jpg)A decisive break of the 21-day line could be problematic, especially if there are increased signs of institutional selling. But the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) remains light, and leading growth stocks continue to act well overall.


The Nasdaq's April 28 distribution day fell off the count Friday because the index rallied more than 5% from its closing price that day.


After finding support at its 50-day moving average earlier in the week, the Russell 2000 small-cap index outperformed, rising 3.6%. The S&P 500 added 1.7% for a weekly gain of 3.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.9% and rose 2.6% for the week. Nasdaq volume was slightly higher than Thursday. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume slightly lower.


There's been growing talk lately of a disconnect between the stock market and the economy. This is true, but keep in mind that the stock market is always looking ahead. The strong rally off lows is the market's way of saying the market sees better times ahead for the U.S. economy.


Retail Stocks Perk Up
---------------------


Indeed, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) is also telling a bullish story. It jumped 4% Friday, helped by strong showings from top holdings like **Wayfair** ([W](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=W)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) and **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)).



Two other stocks in the [retail sector](http://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news) turned in solid performances Friday. **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) cleared a 909.98 buy point in light volume. **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) topped a 257.39 cup-with-handle entry, also in weak volume. Both joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) Friday.


Amid early concerns about the quality of first-quarter earnings reports, it was another great week of corporate results. **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)) and **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) gapped up powerfully.


Twilio helped lead the enterprise software group to a weekly gain of more than 15%.

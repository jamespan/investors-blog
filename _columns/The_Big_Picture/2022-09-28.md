Stock Market Rides A Biotech-Happy Rebound, But Here's Why The Market Has Not Yet Turned
=========================================================================================

The [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) has disappointed most bullish investors who think that sellers are finished with their business — even after the heavy damage already seen during the first six months of the year. Yet the June lows, combined with a relief rally in U.S. government bonds, likely provided a backdrop for Wednesday's sharp rebound.




In terms of equity indexes, small-cap and midcap issues provided the strongest rays of sunshine during a day when Americans turned their attention to how the Gulf Coast side of Florida would handle an immense storm. The Category 4 hurricane, packing winds of more than 150 miles per hour, made landfall on Wednesday morning and slammed key southwestern urban centers in the Sunshine State.


The Russell 2000 jumped 3.2% and the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) rose 2.7%. Those finishes outclassed gains of 2% to 2.1% by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.9%. Fourteen blue chips of the 30-member index rose 2 points or more.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year government bond sank 25 basis points to 3.70%, according to Cboe data.


Perhaps without surprise, home-improvement chain **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) led the cause for the Dow industrials.



Amid the heavy damage being left in Hurricane Ian's wake, the megacap retailer soared 13.50, or 5%. Volume shot 70% higher vs. its 50-day average.


But as the daily chart of Home Depot shows, it and scores of quality blue chips are trying to dig out of their holes after sliding beneath their 50- and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). Home Depot is no stock market leader. It's still languishing 33% off its 52-week peak. Therefore, you want to see more stocks — and indexes, for that matter — trade well above these technical levels before even thinking about purchasing shares.


Good News In Biotechnology
--------------------------


Biotechs grabbed the day's biggest headlines. **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) has developed a reputation for huge moves up and down in recent years. Yet on Wednesday, the company declared a small victory in its long war against Alzheimer's disease following [positive clinical trial results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biogen-stock-explodes-higher-after-alzheimers-drug-succeeds-in-final-phase-test/).


BIIB shares catapulted nearly 40% in the heaviest turnover of the year, making a 10-month high. At this point, investors may want to see if Biogen can defend a bullish gap produced from Tuesday's high and Wednesday's low.


Time will tell.



Meanwhile, Biogen's Alzheimer's therapy development partner **Eisai** ([ESALY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESALY)) of Japan skyrocketed to all-time highs since its listing on the over-the-counter market in late March. In the large-cap region of the stock market, **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), another key player in the race for a cure, briefly surpassed a 335.43 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [10-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/).


The positive news helped push IBD's biotech industry group to a 4.2% gain for the day. But the stock market also saw a large bunch of industry groups rally 3% or 4%. They included integrated oil and gas, automotive retail, construction products, lodging, mobile home and RV makers, metal ores, medical services, and hospitals. Even internet content, leisure products, travel booking, basic chemicals and airlines moved up 3% or more.


This heavy swath of gains among industries buttressed the improved breadth of the market, at least for a day.


Stock Market Today: Equal-Weighted Indexes Outperform
-----------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP092822-258x300.jpg)Volume expanded modestly vs. Tuesday on both main exchanges.


As discussed in [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), consider looking closely at how the conventional index ETFs did vs. their equal-weighted expressions. And the latter did a touch better as a few megacap techs either posted smaller gains or fell.


You can see just how much influence the 10 largest companies on the Nasdaq have on the overall performance by looking at the weightings at the top of the Nasdaq composite's chart in the [General Market Indicators PDF](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DailyGMI_092822.pdf). (Find it at the bottom of every day's Big Picture or at [Market Trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) on the homepage of Investors.com.)


Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weighted ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ended a six-session slump, rising 2.3%. Another exchange traded fund, Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)), bulldozed its way to a 2.8% finish higher.


No Follow-Through In Stock Market, Yet
--------------------------------------


Nonetheless, the market has yet to prove to IBD readers that a serious new rally is underway.


One positive element of Friday's action was the indexes bouncing well off their day's lows, but the reversal wasn't strong enough to justify it as "pink rally day."


To explain the pink rally day, you must first know that down days on charts at Investors.com and [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) are drawn in dark pink. And in a few rare cases in history, a [new follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) occurred after a big rally in the stock market started with a small decline as Day 1 of the rally attempt.



Friday saw the indexes gap lower. In this situation, IBD research has found that you want to take the closing price of the prior session, or in this case 11,066, and Friday's low of 10,732 to calculate a midpoint of 10,899. On Friday, the Nasdaq finished at 10,867. That falls within the lower half of the "true range" of trading. Put another way, Friday does not qualify as the first day of a budding rally attempt.


Thus, the Nasdaq has accomplished two up sessions in a row. That's nothing to really crow about for the bulls, especially in a stock market that continues to flash bearish action. The S&P 500 just snapped a six-day losing streak. So, it's only just begun a new rally attempt after undercutting its June 17 low of 3636.


That said, keep your contrarian hat on.

Optimism Falls Some More
------------------------


Bullishness fell to a multiyear low of 25.4% from 30% the prior week, based on the weekly survey of market pundits surveyed by Investors Intelligence. That undercut this year's previous low of 26%.


This simply means only one out of four professional observers think a bull market in stocks is present or around the horizon. The bearish ratio jumped almost 3 percentage points to 34.3%.


This also means that most people are really beginning to throw in the towel. What this really means: They've cashed out and now believe that they were right in doing so, since stocks are bound to go lower.


This is where contrarian thinking can play a key role.


If most folks have sold out, they in turn can become future buyers. And once evidence of heavy institutional buying returns, the institutional herd can collectively turn greedy again.


But that's apparently not the here and now, yet.


Wait for the catalyst in the stock market to arrive first.



Don't forget too, that the bulls-vs.-bears reading only makes up one of [multiple measures of investor sentiment](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) in the stock market today.


The Cboe Volatility Index, tracking fear vs. greed among S&P 500 options players, fell nearly 7% after running up as high as 34.14 on Tuesday. That's far below this year's peak of 38.94. The VIX also sits well beneath the 85.47 peak seen at the height of the pandemic bear market.

Stocks followed Tuesday's positive reversal with a solid, broad advance. Leading stocks did well. Small caps outperformed. The gains were all the more impressive considering that crude oil futures rallied even harder. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, unlike other nice up days this year, rose more or less in step.

  

The former gained 1.2%, the latter was up 1.3%. Volume climbed on both exchanges, a sign of a healthy institutional appetite for equities. The IBD 50 rose 0.7%.

  

The S&P 500 rebounded enough to reclaim its key 50-day moving average (see the daily chart on B2). The large-cap gauge also recouped much of three days of losses it suffered since last Thursday.

  

This action is just one clue that institutions want to support the market and build their positions.

  

The new high list (on Page B1) showcased financial, business services and building-related names. Winners beat losers by close to a 3-to-1 margin on both major exchanges.

  

Withering breadth was beginning to be a serious concern on the NYSE. As seen by the NYSE advance-decline line (on the S&P 500 daily chart on B2), advancing stocks have been shrinking fast for several weeks.

  

The 1.7% gain in July-expiration crude on the NYMEX gave a big boost to oil producers and oil stock speculators. U.S. exploration companies have improved their cost structure and appear to stay profitable even when oil is trading in the $50-to-$60 range per barrel or higher.

  

However, today's Industry Themes column (see Page B6) demonstrates how far away the energy sector is from becoming a vibrant leader. Energy is still dead last in the ongoing derby among 33 broad sectors in terms of a combination of multi-month performance periods. The sector was down 3.5% year-to-date as of Wednesday's IBD, better than No. 29 Utility (-10.1% since Jan. 1) and No. 32 Metals (-10.2%).

  

The banking and finance sectors are doing some of the market's heavy lifting lately. No. 10 S&Ls is up 7.2% since Jan. 1 while No. 11 Banks is up 5.2%.

  

As gloomy as the headlines on Wall Street banks have been, they are leading the market now.

  

**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) (77 Composite, $253 billion market cap) rose 1.08 in heavy volume to 68.26, a new high. **Texas Capital Bancshares** ([TCBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCBI)) (96 Composite, $2.8 billion), a former member of [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) back in 2011, rose 2.52 to 61.24 in nearly double average trade. The stock is trying to crack resistance near 62.

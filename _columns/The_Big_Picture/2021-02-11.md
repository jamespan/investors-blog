The stock market ended mostly higher Thursday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 turned positive in afternoon trade. Bitcoin surged to record highs, while top growth stocks sharply outperformed.




The Nasdaq rose 0.4%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 edged 0.1% higher. The S&P 500 moved up 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched lower.


Leading growth stocks handily outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) soared nearly 14% on strong earnings and sales. Shares closed more than 30% above a 234.65 flat-base entry. Investors should take at least some profits when a stock climbs 20%-25% from a proper buy point, although there's no clear topping signal so far.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE vs. Wednesday.


Stock Market Rally Overheated?
------------------------------


![MP021121](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP021121-239x300.jpg)The Nasdaq rebounded from Wednesday's small loss. The Nasdaq remains sharply extended from its 50-day moving average. The tech-heavy composite is about 7% above it, as it battles to decisively claim the 14,000 level.


With the market pausing at new highs, investors should be ready to play offense and defense. Some recent breakouts continue to work, like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)); however, there are still good reasons for caution. There are not nearly as many buying opportunities in today's environment.


Meanwhile, a number of highfliers have shown climax-type moves, including marijuana leaders **Canopy Growth** ([CGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGC)) and **Tilray** ([TLRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLRY)), Chinese broker **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)), **Digital** **Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) and **EXP** **World** ([EXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPI)).


[Digital Turbine](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/apps-stock-flashes-possible-sell-signals-as-digital-turbine-expands-from-mobile-apps-to-internet-tv/) and [EXP World](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/expi-stock-time-to-take-profits/) were featured as IBD Stock Of The Day picks this week.


Bitcoin Hits Record High
------------------------


The price of Bitcoin rallied more than 5% to all-time highs Thursday. Bitcoin reached as high as $48,635 before paring gains to about $46,800 in late trade, according to [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin).


Bitcoin plays Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ([GBTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBTC)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) all hit new highs Thursday. The GBTC ETF surged 6.8%. PayPal advanced as much as 6.7% Thursday before cutting gains to less than 0.7%. Square advanced 3.3%.



Stocks To Watch: Nvidia, Playtika
---------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Nvidia is in the 5% buy area above a 587.76 buy point in a flat base, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The buy range goes up to 617.15. Shares advanced 3.3% Thursday.


Earlier this week, the graphics-chip maker broke out past an early buy point at 560.07. With early buy points, investors should buy fewer shares than at the proper buy point due to increased risk. According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [NVDA stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-corp-nvda.aspx) shows a strong 98 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


[Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ipo-stocks-playtina-joins-docu-stock-huya-beke-on-ipo-leaders/), **Playtika** ([PLTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTK)), is tracing an IPO base with a 36.16 buy point. An aggressive entry at 35.19 is also valid.

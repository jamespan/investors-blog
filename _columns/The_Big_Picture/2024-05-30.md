  Dow Jones Extends Losing Streak After Taking A Hit Not Seen In 20 Years

The stock market ended with losses Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled further below a benchmark level. Up next, Wall Street will shift its attention to Friday's inflation report, with the early release of the personal consumption expenditure price index.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined almost 0.9%, its fifth decline in the past six sessions. It closed at its lowest level since May 2. The Dow's three-day decline is now the largest since October 2023, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The S&P 500 lost 0.6% and the Nasdaq composite slid 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 bucked the overall trend with a 1% rally.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session. The higher volume meant the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both added [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). That takes the total on both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to four and further clouds the market.


Due out early Friday, the Commerce Department's personal income and outlays report will update inflation for April and indicate the strength of consumer spending. The PCE reading is expected to rise 0.3% on the month, with an annual increase of 2.7%, per Econoday. The core PCE price index  — the Fed's favorite inflation gauge — is estimated to increase 0.2% in April, with a year-over-year increase of 2.8%.

Dow Jones Movers: Salesforce
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was the biggest loser Thursday, as the software maker plunged nearly 20%. Salesforce contributed to a decline of more than 352 points in the Dow, which closed 307 points lower. That's the largest single-day point drag on the Dow in 20 years, per Dow Jones Market Data.


The earnings report also brought down many other software leaders, including **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), which plunged 12%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) declined 5.8%.


[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) reversed nearly 4% lower after briefly notching more record highs Thursday. Nvidia is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1% to extend a losing streak to three sessions. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Hims & Hers Health** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)) briefly reached its 20% profit target from a 17.16 cup-base entry.

So far, the pullback in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 appears to be quite orderly, but cracks are starting to show. The S&P 500 closed below its 21-day exponential moving average for the first time since May 2. That's a short-term support level to watch. The Nasdaq remains above its own 21-day line.


With that in mind, IBD is maintaining its recommended market exposure range at 60%-80%.


In a sign of a weakening market environment, there were only a couple new breakouts, including **Universal Health** ([UHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UHS)). Shares topped a cup-with-handle entry at 182.92. While investors should be vigilant, remember that stocks with strong [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) like Universal Health could become market leaders, if they are not already.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch
-----------------------------


**Birkenstock** ([BIRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIRK)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)) and **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) are among stocks to watch as they trade in or near buy zones.


Birkenstock soared nearly 12%, breaking out past a cup base's 55 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) following the [company's fiscal second-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/birkenstock-stock-earnings-consumer-demand/). The company said its earnings increase was primarily due to "strong consumer demand supported by new production capacity." The company also opened six stores, bringing its total number to 57 in Q2.


[Streaming video company Netflix](https://www.investors.com/research/netflix-stock-nflx-ibd-50/) remains in buy range past a 639 buy point in a cup base following a May 20 breakout move, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). However, the most recent formation was a late-stage base. Such bases are more prone to failure than earlier ones. Also, they tend to offer less upside potential than first- and second-stage patterns.


[Trading platform Robinhood](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/robinhood-stock-buy-point-1-billion-buyback-plan/) broke out Thursday past a 21.21 handle entry with a 3.6% gain. The stock received a boost this week after the company announced plans for a $1 billion stock buyback program.


[TJX decisively regained](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tjx-stock-buy-zone-earnings/) a 102.04 double-bottom entry Thursday, rallying 1.9%. The off-price retail giant jumped back into a buy zone on the strength of last week's earnings beat and a number of analyst price-target hikes.

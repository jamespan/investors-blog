The stock market ended Thursday's session sharply lower, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite reversed from early gains sparked by earnings results from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). The Nasdaq finished down 0.3%. Late Thursday, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) both slid after reporting their earnings results.




Worse-than-expected jobless claims and plunging consumer spending drove Thursday's selling. The S&P 500 lost 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.2%. Leading growth stocks performed in line with the S&P 500: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) lost 0.85%. Volume edged lower on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 sharply lagged with a 3.7% loss.


Stock Market Uptrend Continues
------------------------------


With the new stock market uptrend more than a month long (IBD [upgraded the outlook into a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) on April 2), investors continue to see a solid rally with a number of strong breakouts past [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Bullishly, the Nasdaq continues to lead the current stock market rally with tech giants Apple, Microsoft and Tesla notching new breakouts. Meanwhile, there is only one day of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP043020-264x300.jpg)Earlier this week, the S&P 500 decisively moved above its 50-day moving average, a key resistance level. Now, a new resistance level emerges in the form of the long-term 200-day moving average line. The 200-day line is currently priced around the 3,000 price level.


Despite a solid uptrend, there is still substantial risk in the current market. Notably, Tesla surged as much as 8.7% to a high of 869.82 before closing with a 2.3% loss after [reporting earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-in-spotlight-with-quarterly-earnings-report/) late Wednesday. Shares ended the session about 1% above a cup with handle's 775.05 buy point. Tesla is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock idea.


Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic continues to provide a backdrop to the current daily stock market action. As the pace of growth in new cases continues to slow, investors are shifting their attention to the economic impact of the virus and the likelihood of reopening the country. Colorado, Georgia, Florida and Texas, have already started to slowly reopen their economies. On Monday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he will let the state's stay-at-home order expire Thursday, paving the way for restaurants to open with some restrictions.


Breakout Stocks To Watch: Adobe, Microsoft
------------------------------------------


Top stocks near buy points in the current stock market rally include new [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) member **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and [IBD Leaderboard member](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Microsoft.


Software leader Adobe is once again breaking out above a 350.48 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/), according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) tops out at 368.



According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Adobe stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-adobe-inc-adbe.aspx) boasts a highest-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the top echelon of growth stocks.

Dow Jones leader Microsoft rose 1%, ending Thursday's volatile session in buy range above a 175.10 buy point in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), but below a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) 180.10 entry. Late Wednesday, the software giant [easily topped](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-earnings-q3-2020-msft-stock/) Wall Street's targets for its fiscal third quarter thanks to strong sales of cloud computing services.

Tech Earnings: Amazon Dives, While Apple Fades
----------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, earnings season continues to be a driving force behind big stock moves. After the close Thursday, FAANG stock leaders Amazon and Apple reported their quarterly results.


Amazon [reported strong revenue](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-trading-quarterly-earnings-report/), but earnings came up short of estimates. Shares dove about 5% to 2,350 in the after-hours session. Amazon stock hit a new high Thursday with a 4.3% advance. Shares closed about 13% above a cup base's 2,186.05 buy point after an April 14 breakout.


Meanwhile, Dow Jones leader Apple broke out above a cup with handle's 288.35 buy point, ending the session in buy range. The 5% buy range runs up to 302.77.


Buying a stock ahead of earnings is a particularly risky venture. It can be prudent to buy half of a desired position at the correct buy point ahead of earnings. If the stock reacts favorably, you can buy the other half, albeit at a higher price. If the stock gaps down instead, then your losses are mitigated. Investors may prefer [options trades for earnings plays](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/) to help control risk.


After the stock market close, Apple reported [better-than-expected earnings and sales results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-q2-2020-aapl-stock/). Apple stock jumped as much as 2.6% to 301.48 in the after-hour session before fading to a 1% loss at about 290.50.

It does not matter if you're new to the game of investing in growth stocks or a veteran hand. True stock market leaders and potential leaders can catch you off guard at around this time every three months of the year. And what generates the equivalent of a Major League-level curve ball on the field of Wall Street? [Earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/).




As you can surmise from the level of content emanating from Investors.com and IBD Weekly, how companies fared in their latest quarter matter tons to institutional investors. That's why individual investors in growth stocks need to pay constant attention to this type of news, which is hitting the market with gale-force winds now.


In the meantime, a pullback by the major indexes on Tuesday produced the first genuine session of [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) — or heavy institutional selling into initial strength — in a quite a while.


During a stalling day, major benchmarks make initial progress, but their rallies stall later in the day. In almost all cases, the indexes close in the lower half of the intraday range, while still gaining for the day. Volume increases vs. the prior session.



A Rare Form Of Distribution
---------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP102621_2--199x300.jpg)The Nasdaq suffered unequivocal stalling action on Tuesday.


A gain of as much as 1% melted into a measly advance of 9 points, or less than 0.1%. Volume surged 24% vs. Monday to one of the heaviest sessions all year long. Thus, this stalling day boosts the [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The S&P 500 surrendered most of its healthy morning rally. It sliced an early 0.7% gain to less than 0.2%. Smaller stocks lagged and lost ground; iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fell 0.7%, nearly giving back all of Monday's advance. The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund snapped a 10-day winning streak and ran to new-all time highs. It shaved 0.6% but remains securely above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


NYSE volume fell, so the S&P 500 avoided a stalling day of its own.


However, IBD research of decades' worth of [stock market tops](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) has found this: Bull markets do not die of stalling days.


Also, does Tuesday's "distribution day" on the Nasdaq deserve an asterisk?


Israel's **My Size** ([MYSZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYSZ)), which trades under $2 a share, saw 269 million shares exchange hands vs. just 384,000 on Monday. Its turnover made up nearly 4% of the Nasdaq's 6.97 billion shares in total exchange volume. In other words, this member of IBD's internet retail industry group certainly made its impact on total Nasdaq turnover.


So did the next four stocks in terms of heaviest turnover on Tuesday, according to data from eTrade Financial: **Progenity** ([PROG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PROG)), **Ocugen** ([OCGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OCGN)), **BIMI International** ([BIMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIMI)) and **Inspira Technologies** ([IINN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IINN)).



Trade Growth Stocks With Discipline
-----------------------------------


All five issues trade on the Nasdaq.


Low-priced stocks aside, without question, expect volatility in even your top stocks right before and right after earnings.


If you see a company go up days in a row, then get dumped by sellers on a good quarterly report, you just witnessed the old Wall Street saw at work: Buy the rumor, sell the news.


For this reason, IBD has espoused for decades the importance of [buying right](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). [Don't chase a stock beyond the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). And size your position correctly. Pyramiding into a good stock means you're being disciplined in how you're deploying your capital into a good investment.

Expectation Breakers Among Growth Stocks
----------------------------------------


In the meantime, while we're now approaching the two-week mark since the [Oct. 14 follow-through on the Nasdaq](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-powers-up-these-four-top-growth-stocks-in-or-near-buy-zones/), it's clear that some leading growth stocks are showing some fatigue.



**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), a key member of the IBD Long-Term Leaders, sank in above-average volume for a second straight day. Gains are magnificent both year to date (up as much as 133%, up 155% from a double-bottom buy point at 135.04). But the force in cybersecurity, recently showcased in [The New America](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-new-america/), is ducking below a [new flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) and its buy point of 322.10.


**Asbury Automotive** ([ABG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABG)) pretty much gutted its nice gains from a [cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) at 211.56. Those who used a [trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) to spot a lower entry point still possess a profit likely in the ballpark of 10%-11%.


**Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), meanwhile, exemplified how buying before an authentic breakout does harbor higher risk. Shares plunged nearly 12% in intense turnover after the defense contractor saw Q3 sales slump 3%.

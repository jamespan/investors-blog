Gains were modest in the major stock indexes Monday, but it was another session of new highs as the bulls maintained control.




The Dow Jones industrial led the way, up 0.4%. It's only about 45 points from the 23,000 level. The Nasdaq composite picked up 0.3% and the S&P 500 added 0.2%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE from Friday's level.


New highs in light volume is never anything to get excited about, but it's been the norm at least in the S&P 500 lately as a resilient market focuses on the prospects of another solid earnings season, a healthy economy with contained inflation and interest rates that are likely to stay low for the foreseeable future.

Crude oil rose on news that Iraqi troops have taken control of Kurdish-held oil fields. Benchmark crude oil futures for November delivery settled at $51.87 a barrel, up 42 cents, or 0.8%.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) outperformed in the Dow with gains of 1.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Goldman Sachs is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 247.17 buy point. JPMorgan, meanwhile, is starting to make some headway after a breakout over a 95.32 entry.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), meanwhile, climbed above its 50-day moving average, helped by an upgrade. Shares rose 1.8% to 159.88 after KeyBanc upgraded shares to overweight from sector weight, citing the potential for better-than-expected fiscal 2018 earnings.


Apple is working on a flat base with a 165.04 entry, but an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of E definitely raises an eyebrow. Signs of institutional buying from here, basically higher-volume gains, would strengthen its technical picture.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) turned in a solid showing Monday, rising 0.5%, helped once again by strength in China names. **Jupai Holdings** ([JP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JP)), featured in Friday's [Sector Leaders column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/jupai-holdings-in-sweet-spot-of-growth/),Â  jumped nearly 18% to 24.13, but it's well extended after clearing the 10 level in August.


**China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), **YY Inc**. ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) and **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) ended with gains ranging from 2.6% to 5.9%.


Many savvy growth investors with big gains in some individual names are giving their leaders room to work, especially those where sell signals are nonexistent. More conservative investors might've have already taken some money off the table, content to hold some cash amid occasional yellow flags.


Where it gets tricky is if you're an investor with new money to put to work. No doubt there's a fair amount of healthy charts out there, but will volume be strong enough to lift base-building stocks to powerful breakouts?


FANG name **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) could be on the cusp of a breakout over a 175.59 buy point. Shares closed Monday at 174.52, up 0.4%. Earnings are due Nov. 1 after the close.


Shares of Netflix rallied nearly 2% in Monday's after-hours session to around 207 after reporting [mixed quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-beats-on-third-quarter-sales-misses-on-earnings/). Headed into earnings, the [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name was slightly extended from a 190.05 buy point.

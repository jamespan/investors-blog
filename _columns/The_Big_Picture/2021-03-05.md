Stock Market Surges, Eventually, After Robust Jobs Report; IBD 50 Firms Polaris, Dynatrace Show Bullish Action
===============================================================================================================

It was another volatile session for the stock market Friday, but the end result looked pretty good.




The Nasdaq composite gapped up and quickly rose 1.2% after the February [jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-379000-jobs-us-economy-shakes-covid-dow-jones-treasury-yields/) came in much better than expected. The economy created 379,000 jobs, more than double the consensus estimate of 175,000. January job growth was revised sharply higher to 166,000 from 49,000.


After a morning swoon knocked the Nasdaq to a loss of 2.6%, buyers came back into the market in late-morning trade and major stock indexes ended with bullish gains by the close.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.9%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added just over 2%. The Nasdaq composite picked up 1.5% and is the only index below its 50-day moving average at this point. Nasdaq volume was lower, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly lower than Thursday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP030521-274x300.jpg)The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) reversed higher with the broad market, rising 1.1%, but it still fell 4.6% for the week. That's on the heels of a 6.6% decline the prior week.


But there were a couple of bright spots in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) Friday. **Polaris** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/), jumping nearly 6% to 129.48. It's still in buy range from the 129.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), meanwhile, reversed higher after a test of its 50-day moving average. Shares rose nearly 4%.


The stock market went into a correction Thursday, when the S&P 500 marked its sixth distribution day in 11 trading sessions. Friday marked the first day of a rally attempt for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. If the S&P 500 holds above Thursday's low, the rally will be in intact. The Nasdaq needs to hold above Friday's low. A [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) on Day 4 or later of the rally attempt would put the stock market back in a confirmed uptrend.

The 10-year Treasury yield went over 1.6% early Friday but was trading around 1.55% at the stock market close. Rising interest rates have spooked the stock market lately, including Thursday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the possibility of inflation. But he didn't give any hints about changes the Fed could make to its monthly bond-buying program, including selling short-term notes and buying long-term debt. This would help hold down long-term yields that are key to mortgage rates and auto loans. The Fed's next meeting is March 16-17.


Energy Stocks Lead Again
------------------------


Oil and gas-related industry groups outperformed again amid another surge in oil prices. Benchmark crude oil futures settled at $66.09, up 3.5%, one day after OPEC and a Russia-led coalition of oil producers unexpectedly kept production cuts in place. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) jumped nearly 4%.


**Nabors Industries** ([NBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBR)) led the oil driller group to a gain of around 9%. Even though Nabors is well extended after a breakout from a seven-week consolidation in early February, big breakouts like this can often yield alternate entries, usually after a period of sideways movement.

In the exploration and production group, solid watchlist candidates include **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)). But it will take a while for new patterns to emerge because those stocks are so extended.


The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) recovered nicely after slumping 1.9% Thursday in higher volume. It moved back above its 50-day moving average Friday, helped by strong showings from **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) and **International Paper** ([IP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IP)). IP stock is still in buy range after a breakout from a flat base with a 53.49 entry.


Meanwhile, most growth stocks continue to struggle after stiff bouts of selling. Sell signals have been rampant in some of the market's big winners in 2020, including IBD 50 stocks **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), just to name a few.

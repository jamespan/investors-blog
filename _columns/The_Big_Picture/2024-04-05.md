The stock market staged a fightback Friday despite a jobs report that was much stronger than expected. Now, investors can look toward a new inflation reading and the latest Federal Reserve minutes in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite fared best among the major indexes as it soared 1.2% Friday. This did not prevent a 0.8% weekly drop but was enough to help the tech-heavy index retake the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It has now reversed in two of the past four weeks but remains up 8.2% so far in 2024.


The S&P 500 closed near session highs as it posted a 1.1% gain amid a so-far successful test of its own 21-day line. While it suffered a weekly decline of 1%, the benchmark index is still up 9.1% this year.


Advancers held the edge on decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq exchange. Volume was lower on both, however â€” not the most encouraging sign on a stock market rally day.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8% but still suffered its worst week of the year. **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were among the top performers here.


Small caps rose, though the Russell 2000's lift of 0.5% was not enough to stave off a painful weekly drop of nearly 3%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ended on its 21-day line thanks to a 2.2% jump.


Jobs Report Destroys Views; CPI Inflation Data Next
---------------------------------------------------


Investors who had been hiding under the covers ahead of Friday's jobs report were able to breathe a sigh of relief. The stock market responded benevolently despite the fact the U.S. economy added 303,000 jobs in March, well above economist views for 200,000 and higher than February's 275,000 new jobs. Bulls seemed to take heart from moderating wage growth.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP040524.jpg)But investors are certainly not out of the woods. Wednesday's Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics now looks pivotal. Analysts expect headline CPI to increase 3.5% year-over-year, which would be an increase on the previous reading of 3.2%. Core CPI is expected to rise 3.7% on an annual basis, which would be a sequential decline of 0.1%. Producer Price Index data is due Thursday.


There will also be plenty of Federal Reserve-related activity to watch for in the coming week. The latest Fed Minutes drop Wednesday while Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee also make appearances that day. Boston Fed President Susan Collins is among the senior officials who will make appearances on Thursday.


A new [earnings season is set to kick off](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/wells-fargo-jpmorgan-citigroup-earnings/) in the coming week. As ever, bank stocks are set to take center stage, with the likes of **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) set to report. Look out for economic insights from these financial powerhouses.


Tesla Hurts This Stock Market Sector
------------------------------------


All [S&P 500 sectors closed higher Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Communication services, industrials and technology were the best-performing areas. The defensive consumer staples and utilities sectors lagged.



Once again, the relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's industry groups gave a deeper insight into the action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Gold miners, building maintenance firms, mining machinery makers and movie stocks were among the strongest performers.


In contrast, cable companies, water utility plays, food wholesalers and database software stocks were among the biggest laggards on the stock market.


Auto manufacturers were also weak, hurt amid reports that group behemoth **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) has called off plans for an inexpensive mass market vehicle.

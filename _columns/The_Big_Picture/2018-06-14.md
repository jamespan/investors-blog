The Nasdaq outperformed the S&P 500 on Thursday for a fourth straight day, as the major stock indexes continued to send mixed messages. In the meantime, the Trump administration is expected to reveal Friday a list of specific tariffs on China.




The S&P 500 posted a meek 0.2% gain, while the Nasdaq swaggered to a 0.8% advance. Blue chips faltered as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1%.


Volume slipped on the NYSE but inched up on the Nasdaq.


Technicals improved as the May 29 distribution day fell off the Nasdaq because of cumulative price gains.


This leaves the Nasdaq with only two distribution days vs. six for the S&P 500. Distribution involves a loss in rising volume. It points to institutional selling.

Among IBD's [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-13-2018/), the day's leadership was an odd mix. Lowly rated telecom services and appliances rose. But so did top-rated leisure and software security.


On the downside, department stores and dairy slid.


Breakouts were relatively scarce and some carried flaws.


Breakouts
---------


Chip equipment maker **Brooks Automation** ([BRKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKS)) cleared a 34.04 buy point. Volume was 66% above average, surpassing the desired 40% minimum. Ideally, bulls like to see volume more than 40% above average, and Brooks delivered.



Chipmaker **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) sailed above an 83.52 buy point late in the morning and closed just above the buy point. Volume was 73% above average.


Chip equipment maker **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) crept above a 216.10 buy point but then retreated under the buy point. Volume finished light, about 13% below average.


Personnel software developer **Ceridian HCM Holding** ([CDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDAY)), an April initial public offering, showed wild action. The stock galloped 9% higher in the first 10 minutes of trade. Next the stock dived to a 6% loss. Then it rebounded to gather in a 1.4% gain for the day.


Cloud storage firm **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) zoomed 20% higher at midday but then retreated to a 14% gain. The [newest member of IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) broke out above a 34.93 buy point.

Retail sales for May rose 0.8%, the most in six months and twice the consensus estimate.


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 218,000, about 3% fewer than expected.


The European Central Bank pegged December as the time to end quantitative easing. A rate hike is not expected before the summer of 2019. Analysts regarded the moves as a compromise between the hawks and the doves.


On Friday, the Trump administration is expected to reveal specifics of its tariffs on Chinese goods. China's diplomat Wang Yi said the choice is between "cooperation and mutual benefit" and "confrontation and mutual loss."


China has vowed to counter any tariffs with tariffs of its own.


Friday is a quadruple witching day. This involves the expiration of stock index futures, single stock futures, stock index options and single stock options. Often the expirations will boost volume.

  Stock Market Fades Late, But Growth Stocks Climb For Second Straight Session

The stock market didn't move much in the latest week. But it was a perfectly fine performance for the bulls, as growth stocks outperformed for the second straight session.




After rising 1.8% Thursday, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) was up 1% at one point Friday, but the gain faded to 0.3% by the close. It jumped 2% for the week, easily outpacing the major stock indexes.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) lagged Friday, but it completed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). Chipmaker **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) isn't in the IBD 50, but it also completed a three-weeks-tight pattern.

It wasn't a great close for the major stock indexes as sellers came into stock market during the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 fell about 0.7% each, and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.4%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index edged higher. Nasdaq and NYSE volume came in lower than Thursday.


The distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is still mild, and plenty of growth stocks have recovered nicely after the Nov. 9-10 sell-off.


Despite the losses, advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both exchanges by a small margin.


All in all, it was a resilient weekly performance for the stock market after futures got off to rough start Thursday night. News of a curfew in California due to soaring coronavirus cases rattled investors. So did news that the Treasury Department wants to end several Federal Reserve lending programs established to support the economy.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Top-rated large-cap stocks like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) have started to lag badly. But Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) still looks good as it holds support at the 10-day moving average. It's just below an alternate handle entry of 299.24.


Some stocks like **Bilibili** ([BILI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILI)) and **Dada Nexus** ([DADA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DADA)) are breaking out to new highs. Others are forming three-weeks-tight patterns or breaking out over [trend lines,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) such as **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)).

The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) has delivered plenty of powerful breakouts lately from the likes of **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), as well as chip-equipment firms like **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)). After powerful moves, tight trading near highs could result in alternate entry points.


In the meantime, avoid the pitfall of staying married to former stock market leaders like **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)). All three might have their day in the sun again. But there's a large supply of growth stocks that are showing better relative strength.

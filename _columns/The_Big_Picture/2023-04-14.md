title: Stocks Retreat As Fedspeak Riles Market; First Bank Earnings Impress But Consider This

The stock market eased lower Friday despite strong bank earnings after a Fed official spoke out. But the negative action was not enough to forestall a constructive up week.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day 0.4% lower. Still, it ended with a slender 0.3% gain for the week and has moved higher in four out of the past five weeks. The tech-heavy index is up almost 17% so far in 2023.


The benchmark S&P 500 also dipped, falling 0.2%. Bulls will point to the fact it made a solid weekly gain of 0.8% and built a cushion above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Decliners outnumbered gainers by nearly 2-to-1 on the NYSE. The margin was slightly wider on the Nasdaq, coming in at just over 2-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also dipped, falling 0.4%. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) surged on earnings while **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) was the worst laggard.


Small caps were given rough treatment, with the Russell 2000 diving 0.9% despite closing the week with a 1.5% gain. Growth stocks fared best of all for the day, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) limiting losses to 0.2%.


Big Banks Report; Fed Official Hits Stocks
------------------------------------------


Stock market earnings season kicked off in earnest with a slate of big banks turning in results. Megabanks **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) topped forecasts, JPMorgan was particularly impressive.


CEO Jamie Dimon offered his thoughts on the economy. "The U.S. economy continues to be on generally healthy footings," he said. "Consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape."

Friday reports were just the tip of the iceberg.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and embattled **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) are all due to report next week. Regional banks on the schedule include **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)), **U.S. Bancorp** ([USB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USB)) and **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), which got hammered amid the recent banking crisis.


Meanwhile, retail sales fell 1% in March or 0.8% excluding autos. Both were down more than expected.


But stocks got hit after Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller said further fiscal tightening is needed to bring inflation down.


"Because financial conditions have not significantly tightened, the labor market continues to be strong and quite tight, and inflation is far above target, so monetary policy needs to be tightened further," Waller said at the Graybar National Training Conference.


The 10-year yield rose 6 basis points to 3.52% while the two-year yield jumped 12 basis points to 4.01%. The yield curve, often an indicator of a recession, remains inverted.


With the market still in a confirmed uptrend, IBD recommends 40% to 60% exposure as earnings season kicks off in earnest. Remember to stay on top of any sell signals in your portfolio.

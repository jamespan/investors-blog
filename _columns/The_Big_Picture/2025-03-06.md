The stock market sold off sharply Thursday, as investors grappled with the fallout of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Reeling from the sell-off, Wall Street braced for Friday's jobs report and a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1%, while other indexes suffered much larger losses. The S&P 500 sold off 1.8% and closed slightly above the 200-day moving average. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled 2.6%, has now fallen more than 10% off its record close on Dec. 16, a common definition of a market correction.




The small-cap Russell 2000 index declined 1.6%.


All but one of the 11 S&P 500 sectors declined, with consumer discretionary and real estate pacing the losers. The energy sector was the only gainer on the day, as West Texas Intermediate futures held around $66.30 per barrel, just off their 52-week low.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


The sell-off came despite that [Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-nasdaq-djia-sp500-marvell-tech-stocks/) goods that are compliant with the current treaty between the U.S., Mexico and Canada would get a reprieve through April 2 from Trump's 25% tariffs. Trump issued a reprieve for automakers earlier in the week.


Meanwhile, [planned layoffs surged to the highest monthly total](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/layoffs-feb-initial-claims-elon-musk-doge-sp-500-tesla/) since mid-2020 last month, with the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk's fingerprints all over the data, according to the Challenger, Gray & Christmas outplacement firm.


Up next is the Labor Department's employment report for February, due out Friday morning. The U.S. economy to expected to have added 160,000 jobs in February, up from January's increase of 143,000, per Econoday estimates. The unemployment rate is expected to stay unchanged at 4.0%. Presumably, March will be when the employment situation reflects the U.S. government's layoffs.


Fed Chair Powell will provide an economic outlook at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum later in Friday's trading session.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MP030625-287x300.jpg)


Amid heavy selling in recent sessions, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 trading around their long-term 200-day moving averages, IBD's recommended exposure level stays at 0%-20%. That's a sure sign that caution is the best choice right now, which is a key element of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/).


Instead, investors should be creating new watchlists with stocks that are holding up the best in the current stock market correction. These could be some of the next uptrend's market leaders. However, many previous leaders are in the very early stages of forming new bases, so it will take time for new leadership to crystallize.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured zero new stocks, which makes sense given the pervasive market weakness. And the Near Pivot list remains low at six ideas, a sign that few are poised for a potential move higher. Look for that number to increase in the coming weeks if the market is able to stabilize.

Stocks Market Leaders To Watch: Clearwater, Eli Lilly, Veeva
------------------------------------------------------------


Now is not the time to be raising exposure in growth stocks. Doing so would be fighting the current stock market trend. Instead, keep an eye on market leaders holding up relatively well, including **Clearwater Analytics** ([CWAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CWAN)), **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).



Clearwater is building a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) that boasts a 32 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a cup with handle, according to [IBD MarketSurge pattern recognition](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). Shares are about 8% away from their new entry, while the RS line is nearing a new high.


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Eli Lilly is in buy range above a 889.36 [handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) following a recent breakout move.



Finally, Veeva surged more than 7% after the company's better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and upbeat Q1 guidance. Shares briefly topped a 240.95 early entry, but the market weakness should dissuade new purchases. The RS line jumped near a new 52-week high.

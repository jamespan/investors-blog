The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 331 points Thursday amid a pickup in inflation data, as the major stock indexes reclaimed key benchmarks.




As the stock market uptrend stabilizes from recent losses, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Amazon.com** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) are in or near buy zones in today's stock market.


Inflation Data, Jobless Claims
------------------------------


The Labor Department's producer price index increased 0.7% on the month, hotter than the 0.4% estimate. Year over year, the PPI rose 1.6%, above the 1.3% estimate. Excluding food and energy, core producer prices rose 0.2% for August, in line with estimates, with a 2.2% annual increase that was slightly below the 2.3% forecast.


First-time unemployment applications, also from the Labor Department, rose to 220,000 for the week ended Sept. 8 vs. 216,000 in the previous week. August [retail sales rose 0.6%](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-hold-up-but-the-u-s-economy-is-bracing-for-trouble-sp-500-futures-rise/), higher than the 0.2% estimate, vs. July's 0.7% increase.


The decent economic data pushed U.S. Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year yield settling at 4.28% Thursday, just off its 52-week high.


Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Leads
-----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP091423-262x300.jpg)On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite both moved up 0.8%. All three major stock indexes regained their 50-day moving averages, a critical benchmark to watch over the coming sessions. Will they build upon recent gains, or slide back below that level just like they did days ago?


The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.4%, closing back above its 200-day moving average.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.


In the Dow Jones Industrial Average, machinery giant **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) rallied 2.4%, ending a three-day skid. CAT stock is forming a flat base with a 293.88 buy point.


Top growth stocks lagged, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.2% Thursday, snapping a two-day losing streak. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Booking** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) made a bullish move Thursday, briefly topping a 3,201.95 early trendline entry. A flat base is close to forming that would have a 3,251.71 buy point.


This week's index gains, especially after two inflation reports, indicates bulls may be gradually overwhelming the bears. Thursday's gains placed the major stock indexes back above their 50-day lines, a sign that the troubled uptrend could finally be gaining traction.


The [IBD current outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) now calls for a recommended stock market exposure of 40% to 60% due to the improving general action. Keep in mind that exposure should only be raised if you're making progress with your own trades. If not, then keep the risk exposure small until your overall batting average improves. Once you're in sync with the market action, then you can raise your exposure level.

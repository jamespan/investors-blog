Nasdaq Ends Seesaw Day Up; Is This Sector Portending A Bear Market?
====================================================================

One day after the major indexes drummed up a nifty reversal to keep the confirmed uptrend intact and avoid a bear market, Wall Street delivered an underwhelming performance. Tuesday's early gains got the buzz-saw treatment. The only thing that seems to remain robust? Day-to-day volatility.



The Nasdaq composite severed an intraday gain of more than 1.5% to less than 0.2% by the close of the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Semiconductor shares helped lift the tech-rich index. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 0.6%, though it also pared gains.


Yet other key major indexes couldn't hold any of their early advance. The S&P 500, at one point up more than 1.3%, settled for a fractional drop of less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 both fell 0.2%.


Financials clearly underperformed, weighing more on the market. The SPDR Financial ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) sector exchange traded fund suffered a fifth straight significant drop, sliding 1% to 24.52 and hitting its lowest levels since September 2017.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MP121118-240x300.jpg)XLF now shows a 12.2% decline in 2018 with roughly three trading weeks left in the year.


If the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) had ended with heartier gains, the day would have been a lot more heartwarming, especially if volume increased as well. Instead, turnover decreased mildly on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Bulls And Bears Watch And Wait
------------------------------


The blase turnover indicated a lack of conviction by both the bulls and the bears — even though the indexes themselves gyrated like veggies getting chopped inside a Cuisinart food processor.


Headlines addressing the trade war crisis with China, the bail hearing of detained Chinese tech executive Meng Wanzhou of Huawei Technologies, and the never-ending saga of the U.K.'s Brexit deal are most definitely injecting volatility into the day-to-day action.


The big swoon in long-dated U.S. Treasury yields have also made an impact. Last week, both investors and the media talked up the rare emergence of an [inversion in one section of the bond yield curve](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/treasury-yield-curve-inverts-dow-jones-dives/) (namely, the 2-year to 5-year bonds) and a severe yield tightening between 2- and 10-year bonds.


On Tuesday, action in long bonds was calm. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rebounded 4 basis points to 2.89%. In general, low long-term interest rates give corporations the flexibility to borrow for investing, share buybacks and retire higher-priced debt. But the thin spread between it and the 2-year bonds (now yielding 2.76%) has increased worry about net interest-related earnings for banks.


Just look at the likes of **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **SunTrust** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)). You immediately get a sense that many banks are showing dwindling confidence in the future of the U.S. economy six to 12 months from now.


A Bear Market For The Big Banks
-------------------------------



The average correction to date among these five stocks: a deep 25%. JPMorgan is performing the best of the five, trading 15% off its 52-week high. But all in all, signs point to a financial sector already strapped within a technical bear market.


No banks have penetrated the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), currently housing eight stocks and a few on the watch list, for months.


It's been often said that bank stocks lead the market, not lag it. Is it going to be the case again?


One way in which they may have less impact on equities overall? Their cumulative footprint in the major indexes is likely smaller as a portion of the general market than, say, the late 1990s or the last months of the 2003-2007 market rally.


In contrast, the tech and internet sectors have grown magnificently over the past decade. It seems that how the [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) perform in the coming weeks and months will help drive future overall performance.


Top growth stocks did relatively better on Tuesday.


This Growth-Focused ETF Does Better Today
-----------------------------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF gained 0.4%, marking a rare day of outperformance in recent weeks. But at 29.61, the ETF is still down almost 11% year to date. The fund bolted 34% higher in 2017.


For now, the fragile market uptrend needs to show more evidence that institutions seek to accumulate more stock. Are there any clues today?


One place to look: See the Accumulation/Distribution ratings for the major bench marks via the General Market Indicators PDF link that is at the bottom of every Big Picture column. The Nasdaq's Accumulation/Distribution rating is at a mediocre C through Tuesday's close. A slightly positive C+ is calculated for the S&P 500.


Another place to look: Do a census of well-formed bases. Scan the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and [New Highs](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/) in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com. Indeed, over the past couple months, IBD is seeing a gradual bump up in the quantity of bases forming. But it's going to take a lot more time before scads of highly rated companies rally far enough to break out and hit new highs.


New Lows Still Dominate
-----------------------


On Tuesday, IBD's screened lists show 432 stocks hitting 52-week or all-time lows, while a paltry 54 issues notched 52-week highs.


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) are forming bases. But they're still trying to bottom out near or at their 200-day moving averages. Breakouts won't come anytime soon.


High-end furniture chain **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is showing more strength overall, despite still trading 17% below the 162.10 high of its new cup-style base. **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) have rebounded enough off near-term lows to get within around 15% of a 52-week high or less.


Defensive Sector Still Gains
----------------------------


The Dow utility average, up 0.2% on Tuesday, continues to outperform in this quarter. At almost 757, the defensive sector index has rallied more than 5% since Oct. 1. Clearly, the Dow utilities are having one of their best quarterly moves in years.



Gold mining play **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), featured in the [IBD Stock Spotlight feature](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/hot-growth-stocks-this-gold-stock-breaks-out-shows-2-bullish-chart-factors/), drove further past a new cup base with a 23.96 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). [The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) goes up to 25.16.

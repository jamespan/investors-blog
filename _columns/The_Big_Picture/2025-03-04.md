The stock market added to losses Tuesday as tariffs by the Trump administration took effect on Canada, Mexico and China. The Nasdaq composite reversed higher in the afternoon and rallied as much as 1.3%, but sellers eventually had the upper hand by the close.


**Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) cast a pall on the retail sector after the company reported earnings and said that tariffs will fuel higher prices for consumers. **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) CEO Brian Cornell said that tariffs on Mexican goods will fan higher produce prices. Best Buy shares plunged 13%, while Target lost 3%, bringing its weekly decline to 5.7%.




After an ugly downside reversal Monday, the Nasdaq composite pared a 2.1% morning loss to nearly 0.4% by the close. Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq. At its low of 17,956, the Nasdaq was 11.1% off its all-time high set on Dec. 16. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield reversed higher and rose three basis points to 4.209% after hitting a low just below 4.11%. Investors have flocked to bonds lately over fears that tariffs could fuel stagflation. That's when the U.S. economy slows but inflation stays stubbornly high. The stock market is always forward looking and could be flagging an economic slowdown in the second half of the year.


Indeed, futures traders over at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) are worried about the same thing. At one point Tuesday, traders put the chances at 74% that the federal funds rate would be down to 3.50% to 3.75% by the end of the year. That implies three quarter-point rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, with the first one expected at the June meeting.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MP030425-230x300.jpg)The S&P 500 came very close to a test of its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/), closing with a loss of 1.2% after falling 2% intraday. Volume on the NYSE also rose from Monday. Decliners beat advancers on the NYSE by more than 3-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped nearly 1.6%, while the Russell 2000 small-cap index gave back 1.1%.


A couple of daily market indicators on the Nasdaq don't look so hot. The 10-day moving average of stocks rising in heavy volume has been falling, while the 10-day moving average of stocks falling in heavy volume has been rising.


The 10-day moving average of new highs has been declining, while new lows have been rising. ([MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com) subscribers can access this data by using the symbol NASDQ.)


What To Do Now
--------------


It's possible that Nasdaq could bounce soon from oversold conditions, but one day of strength won't mean that the correction has run its course. Most leading growth stocks have been hit hard by institutional selling. That means many are in the very early stages of forming new bases. It also takes time for new leadership to come into better focus.


It's often said that a weak stock market eventually takes everything down with it. It looked like financial stocks were ready to lead the stock market. But several stocks in IBD's money center banking group fell hard Tuesday and lost support at their 50-day lines, including **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)).


Most importantly, don't stay married to former leaders like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)), among others. All three have suffered chart damage that will take time to repair.



Instead, populate your watchlist with stocks that are holding up well. Names like online curriculum provider **Stride** ([LRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRN)) and fitness chain **Life Time Group** ([LTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTH)) continue to show uncanny strength and still have the potential to be stock market leaders.


In the chip-equipment group, small-cap **ACM Research** ([ACMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACMR)) continues to trade tightly near a buy point after nine straight up weeks.


The [Leaderboard model portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com), which is lightly invested at this point, added **Kinross Gold** ([KGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KGC)) as a new half position. The gold producer is still in a buy zone after testing its 50-day line and a prior 10.82 entry.

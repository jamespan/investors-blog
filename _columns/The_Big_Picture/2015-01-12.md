Stocks Hit With Distribution
=============================

Stocks slumped for a second straight session Monday, putting a blemish on the new market uptrend.


The Nasdaq shed 0.8%, closing back below its 50-day moving average. Chips and solar stocks were areas of weakness for the tech-heavy index. But biotechs bucked the weakness.


The S&P 500 also ended down 0.8% amid selling in energy stocks. Seven of the day's 10 worst-performing industries belonged to the oil and gas space.


Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed near session lows.


The Dow Jones industrial average and the small-cap Russell 2000 fared relatively better. They lost 0.5% each.


While lower volume helped the market dodge a distribution day Friday, that wasn't the case Monday. Turnover rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE from Friday's pace. That, along with the day's losses, marked a distribution day, which is a sign of institutional selling. Distribution days within the first few days of a follow-through signal have been an ominous sign historically. The Nasdaq had just had a follow-through Thursday.


The market has been volatile amid sliding oil prices and worries over the eurozone. On Monday, West Texas intermediate crude slumped nearly 5% to $46.07 a barrel, a 5-1/2 year low, after Goldman Sachs cut short-term price targets.


While the market is in a confirmed uptrend, volatility can make it tougher to trade because most stocks will follow the direction of the general market, and the indexes have been indecisive.


To deal with volatility, investors can limit their risk by "pyramiding." That's when stock buys are made in three installments. You add more shares only if the stock moves in your favor.


It's also smart to limit stock purchases in general until the market shows better action.


While a few leaders have cleared buy points recently, overall action remains iffy. The IBD 50 dropped 0.9% Monday.


**BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) and **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) tumbled on news of slowing Chinese auto sales.


**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) had a wild day after making a presentation at an investor conference. (See story on Page A1.) Shares fell 8% below a 196.10 buy point before bouncing back. **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) cleared buy points Monday, but volume was subpar in both.


After the close, **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) kicked off earnings season with results that beat views. Shares rose nearly 2% in extended trading.

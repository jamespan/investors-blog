Major averages ended with moderate losses Tuesday, a reasonable performance considering European and Asian bourses fell more than 1% overnight. But higher volume on the Nasdaq resulted in a distribution day for the tech-filled index.


The Nasdaq fell 0.6%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.5% and the Dow eased 0.3%. The S&P 500 barely avoided a distribution day as NYSE volume edged lower from Monday. Nasdaq trade rose 2%.


The Nasdaq count stays at seven because the index's stalling day on Nov. 21 fell off the count after the close, due to time.


The IBD 50 lost 0.7%. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by less than a 2-1 margin.


Gold stocks were among the day's best gainers as gold settled at $1,200.40 an ounce, up 1.6%. Airlines continued their outperformance, but utilities underperformed after recent strength.


The debate between the bulls and bears remains a healthy one. The bears point toward a five-year-plus bull market that's long in the tooth, an elevated distribution count and recent new highs for the major averages in light volume. Indeed, outside of two big gains on Dec. 17 and 18, meaningful signs of institutional buying have been scant. Light holiday trading from Dec. 23 to Dec. 29 saw three straight all-time closing highs for the S&P 500 in soft turnover.


The bulls, meanwhile, look inside the IBD 50 and see several names showing strength, holding gains after recent breakouts. They include **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)), **Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)) and technology gear distributor **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)).


Bulls also like the look of improving market breadth. The NYSE advance/decline line (see S&P 500 chart, today on B4) has been in a nice uptrend since the mid-October market low.


The bull camp is also looking to fourth-quarter earnings season as a potential market catalyst.


With uptrend still under pressure, market downside is certainly elevated, but that doesn't mean a big cash position is automatically warranted.


Having some exposure to stocks makes sense. The issue is finding stocks still in a buying range. Don't force the issue by buying extended stocks. There are many of them out there after the Nasdaq's follow-through day on Oct. 21.


**LifeLock** ([LOCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOCK)) is an exception. The stock and new [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) member followed through after Monday's breakout, rising 3% in strong trade. It's still actionable at 4% above an 18.09 buy point.


Fundamentals are solid at the provider of identity theft protection services. Full-year profit is seen rising 24% this year and 40% in 2015. Estimates have been heading higher. Goldman Sachs brought the company public in October 2012 at 9 a share.


Meanwhile, **Idexx Labs** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) is showing tight sideways action as it works on a flat base with a 153.99 buy point. The field of animal diagnostics has been a lucrative one for the $7 billion market cap firm.


In economic news, the Conference Board's consumer confidence gauge climbed to 92.6, a tad below estimates for 93. Meanwhile, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index climbed 0.8% in October, ahead of September's gain and views for a 0.6% increase. Year-over-year, prices rose 4.5%, in line with views.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude oil gained 55 cents, or 1% to $54.12 a barrel.

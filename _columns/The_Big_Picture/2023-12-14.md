The stock market extended Wednesday's Federal Reserve-fueled gains, as small caps led the major stock indexes to additional 2023 highs Thursday. The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled below 4% for the first time since July.




Stock market leader **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are stocks to watch in the ongoing uptrend.


Ahead of Thursday's open, initial jobless claims unexpectedly dropped to 202,000. They were expected to rise to 223,000 vs. 220,000 in the previous week, per Econoday forecasts.


Also, the Commerce Department said November retail sales rose 0.3% for the month, handily topping estimates for a 0.1% drop. Both of those stronger-than-expected economic reports sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 3.93%.


"Retailers had a decent start to the holiday shopping season in November, with moderate growth of sales volumes," Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a note to clients. "The big picture is that American consumers continue to spend and sustain the economic expansion."

Adobe beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal fourth quarter but disappointed with its outlook. [ADBE stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adbe-stock-adobe-stock-falls-as-outlook-disappoints/) dived 6.4% Thursday, closing right at the 50-day line, a key support level.


Jabil shares rallied more than 13% Thursday. The stock regained its 50-day moving average, breaking out past a double-bottom entry at 134.93.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The stock market rose modestly Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4% to hit another all-time high. The S&P 500 gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite moved up 0.2%, as they both notched fresh 2023 highs. One notable divergence was the nearly 0.2% fall in the Nasdaq 100, indicating underperformance in the megacap techs.


The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 2.7%, making its highest close since July 31.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. Nasdaq volume was the second highest all year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average, **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) were the day's biggest winners, rallying 5.7% and 6.4%, respectively.


Goldman shares added to gains past a 361.62 buy point, while CAT stock moved closer to a cup base's 293.88 entry.


On the downside, **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) tumbled 2.7%, closing below its 50-day line in heavy volume. That move — combined with a diving relative strength line in recent weeks — indicates weakness for the health care giant. Shares fell below their handle entry at 546.78, too.


And top growth stocks reversed slightly lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) inched down 0.1%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) advanced nearly 6%. Shares are tracing a cup base with a 22.75 buy point.

What To Do Now
--------------


IBD recommends an exposure level of 80% to 100%, with the stock market rally hitting more new highs. If your buys continue to advance and you're making continuous progress in your portfolio, then the top of that range makes sense. But if you're starting to give back some gains, then it makes sense to reduce some exposure.


It's also O.K. to lock in some gains when leading stocks climb 20%-25% from their buy points.


Meanwhile, more leading stocks are breaking out. And a great resource for daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks topping buy points.


In Thursday's list, there were 18 new breakouts, including **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) and **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)).


Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows stocks nearing buy points in bases. **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) is in a double-bottom base with a buy point at 151.16.

Stock Market Leaders: Applied Materials, ARM, Netflix
-----------------------------------------------------



These stock market leaders are in or near buy zones in today's market action:


Chip giant and recent [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/amat-stock-applied-materials-returns-to-buy-zone/) Applied Materials rallied 3% Thursday, hitting a 52-week high. Shares are extended past a 148.40 double-bottom entry, but they are in buy range past an alternate buy point at 157.76.


Semiconductor equipment stocks got a lift this week from news that the U.S. Department of Commerce is starting to release funding for domestic chipmaking initiatives under the [U.S. CHIPS and Science Act](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/12/biden-harris-administration-and-bae-systems-inc-announce-chips).


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) [stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Arm broke out past a 64.92 buy point in a cup with handle, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://get.investors.com/marketsmith/?src=APA1BQ). The 5% buy area goes up to 68.17. Arm went public on Sept. 14, but quickly corrected around 33% before rallying up the right side of its initial base.


[IBD SwingTrader stock](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) Netflix slid 2.1% Thursday, ending a five-day win streak. The streaming giant is near a 482.70 buy point in a cup with handle. The relative strength line hit a new high in late November but has backed off.

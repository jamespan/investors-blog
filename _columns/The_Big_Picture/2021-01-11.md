Investors rotated away from growth stocks Monday as the stock market fell, but leading stocks — including many growth companies — actually outperformed.




Taking the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) as a gauge of leading stocks, the index was a hands-down winner, up an impressive 1% on a day when strength was narrow.


Nearly 20 of the 50 stocks rose more than 2%, including a couple that shot up more than 10%. **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) soared 12.3% after the company raised its sales outlook. Boat maker **MarineMax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)) surged 10.6% to a new high. A consumer theme continued with solid gains by **1-800-Flowers** ([FLWS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLWS)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), in Monday's [IBD 50 Stocks to Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/wsm-stock-home-furnishings-up-330-percent-run-near-buy-point-williams-sonoma-stock/).


Such performances illustrate the importance of picking quality stocks. On Monday, the broad stock market fell, taking a break after Friday's record highs. Given last week's sharp gains, the stock market could use a breather.

The Nasdaq composite stumbled 1.3% as software stocks dragged the technology sector. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) fell 4% to the lowest price since Oct. 7. A [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) for Facebook is looking weaker as the handle continues to droop.


Facebook and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) fell after the latter [shut down President Trump's Twitter account](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-drops-reacts-to-permanent-trump-suspension-twtr-fb/), citing a risk of "incitement of violence." Facebook suspended the president's account on Thursday.


But **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was a larger factor in the Nasdaq's drop. The electric vehicle maker's skyrocketing move since mid-November has given it a market capitalization close to $770 billion, making it the sixth largest company on the Nasdaq. Thus, Tesla's 7.8% slide Monday was a big influence on the index, and will continue to be one.


IBD's automakers industry group was Monday's weakest, and it also feels Tesla's influence. With a share price north of 800, Tesla moves the price-weighted group price more than any other stock in it.


Tesla Influence On Nasdaq
-------------------------



Tesla shares are [exhibiting signs of overheating](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tesla-stock-flashes-climax-top-signals/). Coupled with Monday's sharp drop, investors have reason to be on guard.


The S&P 500 lost almost 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.3%.


Indexes were spared a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) after volume fell on the NYSE and the Nasdaq. The decline in volume was an indication that institutional investors restrained themselves in selling shares.


No question, growth was out of favor in Monday's stock market: iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) slid 1.2%, while iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) edged up 0.1%.


Stock Market Today: Consumer, Health Care, Financials, Energy Do Better
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


There were some areas of strength in consumer, financial and health care sectors, while energy shares continued a hot streak.



Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) climbed nearly 0.5% and reached a new high. Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) rose 0.3% as regional banks extended gains.


Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) reversed higher and is challenging its December highs. Still in a turnaround situation, the sector doesn't have much in terms of growth stocks in proper chart patterns.


The retail sector showed consumer stocks remain stock market leaders. SPDR Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) rallied more than 2%. Department stores, discount chains, auto parts stores and apparel retailers were among many in the day's top 25 groups. Apparel makers were the No. 1 industry group Monday.

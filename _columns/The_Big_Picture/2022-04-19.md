Stocks Today Rebound Furiously; If This Happens, Market Bears Will Shudder
===========================================================================

The message from stocks today? More bargain hunters are coming out of the woodwork. And a few portfolio managers are even venturing to buy enough stocks to send some into new highs.




These actors on Wall Street's stage always show up, whether the mood of the market is highly bullish or exceedingly bearish.


Stocks Today: Broader Advance Than In Recent Weeks
--------------------------------------------------


Of course, the market has truly stood in neither extreme so far in 2022. Perhaps it reflects the complexity of reading the current economic tea leaves. As Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman said in a recent podcast with the New York Times, the U.S. economy is strong but it also has a lot of problems.


That said, stocks today reflected some bullish elements even though interest rates jumped again and some companies fell hard on negative earnings pre-announcements (see **Netgear** ([NTGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTGR)), a lagging member of the computer networking industry group) or weaker than expected quarterly results.


And the bears on Wall Street might have to reconsider their stance if these three elements become more pronounced:


* More stocks break out to 52-week highs, and they're not all hailing from the oil, metals and agriculture sectors
* More equity indexes retake their 50-day moving averages, then keep rising
* A greater number of noncyclical sectors join their commodity-driven counterparts on the upside


Tuesday's rebound saw the Nasdaq composite rip almost 2.2% higher and the Nasdaq 100 rise 2.2% also. Small caps beat their large-cap siblings. A 2% rebound by iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) nearly hoisted the key exchange traded fund back above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average settled for gains in the 1.4%-1.6% range.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond jumped 5 basis points to 2.91%.


Nasdaq volume edged up vs. the prior session, and early data showed higher NYSE volume as well. That's surely desired on big up days such as Tuesday's trading. The accompanying Market Pulse highlights a few companies that fit the profile of leadership within the small-cap universe.


Breadth Improvement
-------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP041922-208x300.jpg)Early data on E-Trade Financial showed winners beating losers on the Nasdaq by nearly a 5-2 margin. On the NYSE? A less extreme ratio, but a 2-1 margin of gainers vs. decliners should encourage the bulls.


Meanwhile, E-Trade's preliminary data also showed at least 100 issues on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE posted 52-week or all-time highs. Can you remember the last time that happened? (You can check the daily tally by going to Stock Lists at Investors.com, click on [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), then select New Highs.)


[The official daily count on Investors.com for Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-apr-19-2022/) showed that Nasdaq-listed stocks hitting new highs numbered just 63 vs. 189 new lows. On the NYSE, 96 issues made 52-week or all-time highs while 133 hit new lows. Go into the URL and adjust the date to see statistics for most prior sessions.


Of course, the vast majority of stocks today still swim beneath their 50-day moving averages, not above. This trend has to change if we are to see more promising breakouts emerge. And as the [Tuesday episode of IBD Live indicated](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live), strong breakouts out of excellent bases remain a rare commodity.


Stocks Today: Consumer Stocks Rebound
-------------------------------------


On Tuesday, **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) led the rebound and scored the biggest point gain within the Dow Jones industrials. In no way is the stock near any [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


The home improvement chain looks poised to finish a 16th straight week below its 10-week moving average.



Such action hints that, yes, a [base is forming](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). But is a really strong move to new highs just around the corner? Nope.


Meanwhile, retailers including **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) have shown much more positive traction lately. The former is shaping the right side of its new base. The latter is arguably still in the 5% buy zone after clearing a 566.85 entry in a nearly three-month [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


[The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) for Costco goes up to 595.19.



Meanwhile, hotelier **Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)), storage giant **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)), fellow REIT **Rexford Industrial** ([REXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REXR)) and **Simply Good Foods** ([SMPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMPL)) all deserve attention as their breakout attempts (at 179.40, 215.01, 78.44 and 43.27, respectively) serve as litmus tests for growth investors seeking to buy at the prime entry point.

BCA On The U.S. Economy
-----------------------


On Tuesday before the open in stocks today, U.S. housing starts in March shocked the Street by coming in at an annualized rate of 1.793 million. That crushed Econoday's consensus forecast of 1.75 million.


In an April 15 comment titled "Is A Recession Inevitable?" BCA Research wrote that the U.S. housing market "has cooled, but remains in reasonably good shape, supported by rising incomes and low home inventories."


BCA analysts also noted that "unlike the lead-up to many past recessions, the U.S. private sector is currently running a financial surplus. If anything, there are indications that both households and businesses are set to expand — rather than retrench — spending over the coming quarters."


For these reasons, the recession could arrive later than what many traders think.

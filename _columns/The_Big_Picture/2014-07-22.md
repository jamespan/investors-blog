Indexes Rise In Higher Volume As S&P 500 Hits A High
=====================================================

The main indexes closed near new highs Tuesday in a sign that the market is getting out of danger.


The S&P 500 climbed 0.5%, touching a new high around midday before ceding some gains.


Last time the market tumbled, in April, it took more than five weeks for the S&P 500 to make a new high. This time, it was just over two weeks.


The Nasdaq added 0.7% and is less than 1% from its July 3 peak. Small caps outperformed slightly as the Russell 2000 added 0.8%.


Volume rose, although it didn't take much institutional trading to top Monday's limp totals.


Still, just about any market increase in rising volume can be taken as a constructive step.


Broad participation added to the day's positive tone. Stocks in consumer, industrial, energy, health care and other sectors rose in active trading. Winners topped losers by more than 2-to-1 across the board.


Homebuilders were one of the top five industry groups after June sales of existing homes topped 5 million (on an annualized basis) for the first time this year. It was the third straight monthly increase.


The transportation sector, an indicator of economic activity, also was strong.


As different facets of the market improve, a serious correction is becoming less of a threat. Global hot spots that rattled Wall Street aren't having much effect any more.


But distribution remains higher than normal in the main indexes. Until the market displays more strength, it's smart to continue with moderate exposure to stocks.


While the broad market picture is brightening, several leaders such as **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Wabtec** ([WAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAB)) aren't making much progress from their buy points.


The IBD 50 vaulted 2% as Chinese leaders such as **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) and **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) rallied.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) was a huge boost for the IBD 50, soaring 12% after a solid Q2 report. Hot same-store growth surprised the Street. Runaway gains like Chipotle have been unusual. At the same time, most leaders are holding up or advancing steadily.


A cloud did form after the close, when **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) missed revenue expectations and gave a soft sales outlook. Earnings topped views.


Apple shares fell mildly in extended trading. The stock is important for the whole market as it represents 6.6% of the Nasdaq and it is a bellwether. Rival **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) was little changed in extended trading after the company reported mixed second-quarter results.


Earnings season is in full force, and individual investors need to be prepared for big movements in reaction to reports.

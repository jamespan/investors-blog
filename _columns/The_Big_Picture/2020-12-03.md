The major stock indexes ended sharply mixed Thursday, as coronavirus vaccine issues outweighed the return of stimulus optimism. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes hit record highs during the session before the late-day selling.




Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average again topped the 30,000 level before ending beneath it. Cybersecurity leaders **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) staged [breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) on earnings Thursday.


The Nasdaq reduced its gain to 0.2%, while the S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 0.6%, easily outperforming.


Leading growth stocks performed in line with the major stock indexes, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.2% on Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) advanced 3.9% and is approaching an 86.47 [buy point.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) Floor & Decor was featured as [Wednesday's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch pick.](https://www.investors.com/research/growth-stocks-to-watch-floor-decor-nears-buy-zone-after-triple-digit-earnings-increase/)


![MP120320_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP120320_2-229x300.jpg)Volume was higher on the Nasdaq, but preliminary data showed slightly lower volume on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's session.


Nasdaq, S&P 500 Hit Record Highs
--------------------------------


On Thursday, the Nasdaq set a record high before cutting gains. Thursday's action qualified as a [stall day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/). This is a type of distribution day, a sign of institutional selling. The S&P 500 reversed from new highs, while the Dow remained within striking distance of all-time highs.


On Tuesday, the Nasdaq managed to erase three distribution days from November thanks to solid gains. Thursday's stalling give the composite one distribution day; the S&P 500 still has three. That's a minor amount of institutional selling.


The major stock indexes hit session highs midday Thursday, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made optimistic comments that Congress can reach a coronavirus stimulus deal before the end of the year. On Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said they were willing to back a $900 billion stimulus package as a basis for negotiations.


But most of those gains disappeared in a flurry of late-day selling after **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) said is [scaling back its coronavirus vaccine plan](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-dives-drugmaker-reportedly-cuts-coronavirus-vaccine-deliveries-2020/) for this year due to supply-chain issues.


With the Nasdaq continually making new highs, investors should be gaining confidence in the current stock market rally. However, many stock leaders are [getting sharply extended from their buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/). For example, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is more than 25% above a 466 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).


New Breakouts: CrowdStrike, Zscaler
-----------------------------------


But the presence of powerful new breakouts is encouraging. While old stock market leaders — like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) — remain more than 10% from their 52-week highs, cybersecurity stocks **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) staged breakaway gaps Thursday following earnings reports.


[CrowdStrike](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crowdstrike-stock-crwd-earnings-q3-2020/) gapped above a cup-base buy point at 154. It was the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/crowdstrike-stock-pops-as-recurring-revenue-subscriber-momentum-builds/). Meanwhile, [Zscaler](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zscaler-stock-zscaler-earnins-q3-2020/) gapped above the 158.84 buy point of a [double-bottom base.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/)


During breakaway gaps — when a stock jumps above the proper buy point — investors can use the high of the first five minutes of trading to find a more reasonable entry.

Stocks To Watch: Facebook, PayPal
---------------------------------


There's a batch of leading stocks that are getting closer to breakouts. FANG stock **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is tracing a cup with handle with a 297.48 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares fell 2% Thursday.


A key flaw is the stock's lagging relative strength line: It remains far from its old highs. With a stock market at record highs, for now, the social media giant is not participating in the stock market uptrend as much as others. Facebook [was featured](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stocks-to-watch-advanced-micro-devices-amd-stock-breaks-out-chipotle-facebook-twilio-new-buy-points/) in this week's [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/) column.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is trading just below a 215.93 buy point in a cup base following Thursday's 0.9% gain.

Stocks ran out the clock Friday, posting small gains in a productive week for the bulls. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively. The IBD 50 rose 0.5%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

The S&P 500 did its part for the bulls, retaking its 50-day moving average Thursday and holding above it Friday. The Nasdaq sent a mixed signal: It finished below its 50-day moving average but above its 10-week line.

  

With the market in an uptrend, this might be a good time to check the instrument panel.

  

•Sector Leaders: This is IBD's toughest screen. The number of stocks that meet the criteria has fallen to five, as of Friday's IBD. However, two leaders — vehicle-fleet-management software provider **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) and low-end homebuilder **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) — scored closing highs Friday.

  

•New Highs: The combined new-highs tally (NYSE plus Nasdaq) hit triple digits in the past two sessions, a first since August.

  

•Rotation: Savings and loans, banks, apparel and other sectors have either taken over market leadership or threaten to do so. The medical sector, the former leader, is battered.

  

•Distribution: The count is low, but the Nasdaq's sell-off in rising volume two days after the follow-through day was troubling. •

The IBD Mutual Fund Index: After a W-like decline involving a lower low (which the major indexes didn't do), this index has a nearly straight-up look.

  

•Stocks on the Move: The market is delivering breakouts, and a few leaders are surging above the 5% buy zone.

  

•Percentage of stocks above the 200-day line: a miserable 28%. Yet that's an improvement: About two weeks ago, the needle pointed to 14%.

  

•Groups with highest percentage of stocks at highs: Soap and gas utilities lead, a defensive tilt.

  

•Bulls vs. bears: Investors Intelligence gauge still finds more bearish advisors (34.4%) than bullish (30.2%). Because the gauge is a contrarian indicator, this is bullish for the market.

  

•Recent index action: Positive reversals and high closes in the major indexes are bullish.

  

•The challenge: The Nasdaq faces tests at its 50-day line and the 5,000 area. A pullback could test the bulls' conviction but would not be a surprise after the sharp gains so far this month.

  

For the week, the small-cap S&P 600 gained 5.1%; the Dow, 3.7%; the S&P 500, 3.3%; the Nasdaq, 2.6%; and the IBD 50, 2.3%.

Small, Mid-Cap Stocks Buck Market's Mild Decline
=================================================

A mild rebound attempt sputtered Wednesday as the stock market finished with thin losses.


Yet a host of technical divergences seemed to contradict the general picture painted by the major stock benchmarks.


The Nasdaq composite squandered an early 0.3% gain to end 0.2% lower. The S&P 500 also reversed for a 0.2% loss.


Volume cooled on both exchanges. The overall trading range also reflected reluctance among fund managers with deep pockets to sell equities heavily.


Yet, in a curious divergence, the small-cap S&P 600 rallied nearly 0.7%. That reclaimed a good chunk of Tuesday's 1.3% drop. The index also found support at the critical 50-day moving average. The mid-cap S&P 400 rose 0.7% while the Russell 2000 was up 0.6%.


Another oddity was in the market's overall breadth. On the Nasdaq, winners actually beat losers by a 5-to-4 margin and nearly 18-to-13 on the NYSE.


The IBD 50 showed lingering strength among high-growth stocks and was up slightly.


Technicals aside, there's no question that investors should approach the market with a healthy scoop of caution. The Market Pulse's current outlook remains "Uptrend under pressure."


This means that new buys can be made. Yet with few new solid breakouts to new highs emerging, fewer buys will be made.


The real test for most investors is whether or not to hold a winner. It depends a lot on your level of conviction and the size of your profit cushion. Today's [Sector Leaders column](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/031115-742967-how-to-sell-akorn-stock.htm) highlights the importance of taking gains on the way up, especially with a stock like **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)).


A daily chart of the specialty pharmaceuticals play shows how even a stock with a market cap of $5.1 billion can still trade erratically. The price range in recent weeks has been superwide.


It's been 15 years since the Nasdaq peaked at 5132 on March 10, 2000. Yet the landscape of the leading stocks has dramatically changed. New bull markets breed new winners, giving determined investors another chance at stock greatness.


Take the upper echelon of the IBD 50. **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), No. 12 in Wednesday's list, went public in 2007. **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) (No. 1) and **IPG Photonics** ([IPGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPGP)) (No. 11) debuted well after the 2000 peak.


Remember **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) when it was the market darling of 1999? It rose 51% in that year's final week. Today, it's still a big stock, making up 1.3% of the Nasdaq. But growth has matured.

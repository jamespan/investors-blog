The stock market reversed Friday after President Donald Trump moved to levy tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Now, the coming week sees earnings reports from the likes of **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) while the January jobs report also looms.


The Nasdaq composite spent most of the day in positive territory but ended Friday down 0.3%. It held above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) despite notching a weekly decline of 1.6%. The tech-heavy index also managed to end January in positive territory, turning in a 1.6% gain.




The S&P 500 closed above the 6,000 level despite a daily drop of 0.5%. It also sits above its 50-day line and its 21-day exponential moving average. The benchmark index fell 1% for the week but remains up 2.7% for the year.


Decliners outnumbered advancers by nearly 3-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by almost 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was higher, adding a distribution day to both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average flirted with a positive close before ending Friday down 0.8%. It outshined the other major indexes by rising 0.3% for the week, and ended January up 4.7%. Amazon and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) were the only components to close in positive territory while **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) lagged most.


The bears punched small caps lower, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.8% Friday. It continues to meet resistance at the 50-day line but ended the month up 2.5%. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund outperformed for most of the day but ended flat. Its monthly gain came in at a robust 4.8%.


Trump Tariffs Hit Indexes
-------------------------


The stock market had to absorb a lot of information in the space of the week, including the emergence of Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek, the Fed's decision to hold steady on interest rates and a new personal consumption expenditures reading, which came in as economists expected at both the core and the headline levels.

But Trump threw the markets another curveball Friday by announcing [tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china-inflation-sp-500/) and a 10% levy on China. The move takes effect Saturday. Stocks fell while Treasury yields moved higher after the White House announcement.


The tariffs will be set at a lower 10% rate for Canadian oil. Canada and Mexico are expected to exact retaliatory tariffs of their own.


Meanwhile, there is a slew of other economic data due in the week ahead. This includes construction spending and auto sales data Monday, factory orders figures on Tuesday and January's final S&P U.S. services PMI reading on Wednesday.


But the key flavor of the week will be labor data, with job openings numbers coming Tuesday and the latest ADP employment report dropping Wednesday. The January jobs report comes Friday, with analysts expecting the economy to have added 256,000, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/?_gl=1*iwm577*_gcl_au*NTYxMTI5NzA5LjE3MzY2Mzg0OTIuMjEyMTQ0NTgwNC4xNzM4MjYzODk3LjE3MzgyNjM4OTk.*_ga*MzU3MjcwNjk3LjE3MzQzMDIxOTI.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczODM1NDI2My4yODcuMS4xNzM4MzU0NjQzLjYwLjAuMA..).


As if that was not enough, it is also a [bumper week for earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/palantir-stock-pltr-earnings-google-amazon-earnings/). Palantir Technologies, Amazon.com, Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) are among the most notable firms posting quarterly results.


Deckers Plunge Hits This Stock Market Group
-------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday mostly lower](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Communication services and consumer discretionary were the only areas to end in the green while energy and technology lagged the most.



Investors were able to get a more in-depth look at the action on [Friday's stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by parsing the relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups.Â Drug stores, meat products plays, office supplies retailers and a variety of oil-and-gas groups all lagged.


Shoe stocks were also booted lower. They suffered after **Deckers** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) crashed more than 20% after the company's revenue outlook came in below Wall Street expectations.


Despite an earnings beat, it plummeted below its 50-day moving average in massive volume, which caused the Ugg-maker to lose its spot on [the Leaderboard list of top stocks](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/).


In contrast, fiber-optics stocks, plastics plays, mobile home manufacturers and contract electronics manufacturers were among the best performers.

Good Day For The Bulls As Indexes Score Solid Gains; Darden Breaks Out
=======================================================================

The stock market managed solid gains Tuesday as the Dow Jones industrial average ended an eight-session skid.


The blue-chip index gained 0.7%, helped by strength in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)). JPMorgan is in a little better shape than Goldman, poised to reclaim its 50-day moving average while Goldman is still entrenched below the line.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP032817.png)The S&P 500 also rose 0.7%, the Nasdaq composite added 0.6% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.7%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in slightly higher than Monday's levels.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) fared the best Tuesday, up 0.8%, as nearly half the names on the list rose 1% or more. **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) was the best percentage gainer, up 3%, as it gets support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout in late January over a 32.85 buy point.


Tuesday's strength in the broader market was helped in part by another lofty reading in consumer confidence. The Conference Board said its index hit 125.6 in March, the highest reading since December 2000, and well above the consensus estimate of 113.8.


The latest sentiment reading from the Investor's Intelligence survey of newsletter writers will be out early Wednesday. Sentiment has been extremely bullish in recent weeks, but has trailed off recently. That's another positive development for the bulls because extreme bullish sentiment has been seen near market tops in the past.


Steel producers and beaten-down department store names outperformed. So did several oil and gas names as benchmark crude oil rose 1.3% to settle at $48.37 a barrel.


Defensive areas of the market like miners, food and beverage stocks lagged.


All three major averages are getting support so far at their 50-day moving average lines, a key support level, amid a distribution-day count that has been on the rise of late.


Markets sending mixed signals are tough to navigate, and we're in one right now with the market uptrend under pressure. IBD's market outlook was changed after an unequivocal day of distribution for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on March 21.


Distribution is synonymous with institutional selling, and a lot of it can stop a market rally in its tracks. The bulls like the fact that distribution has been relatively contained so far. Out of the S&P 500's five distribution days, four showed modest declines of 0.2% to 0.3%. The bulls also like the fact that there's no shortage of institutional-quality growth names showing supporting action, like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Among the day's movers, **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) was just below a conventional entry, at 82.83, headed into earnings, but gapped above the buy point Tuesday. In a situation like this, it's OK to buy as close to the open price as possible, which in Red Hat's case was 86.47.


**Darden Restaurants** ([DRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRI)) also had a good day on an earnings beat and news that it's acquiring Texas restaurant chain Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for around $780 million. Darden gapped up over a 77.21 cup-with-handle buy point, risingÂ 9% in heavy volume. Shares opened at 78.98.


Housing prices rose 5.7% in January from the year-ago period. Homebuilders have been moving for a while, but names like **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) continue to trade tightly near highs and could be poised for first tests of the 10-week moving average after recent breakouts. Meanwhile, ancillary housing plays like **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) also boast compelling charts.


In after-hours trading, **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) slumped around 4%. Another top-performing retailer, **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), rose 1% in extended trading, also on earnings.

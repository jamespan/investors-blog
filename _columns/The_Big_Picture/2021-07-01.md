When there's fresh capital to deploy on Wall Street, you often see strength in the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) on the first trading day of a new quarter. Thursday proved to be no exception.




Amid a rousing day for crude oil futures, the S&P 500 kicked off Q3 with a 0.5% gain, rising to fresh all-time highs and marking a rare sixth up day in a row. At 4319, the S&P 500 closed practically a hair below its session high.


Yet, as noted by commentators on the [daily IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live), the large-cap benchmark index does not appear to be hitting wildly overbought levels.


The S&P 500 finished Thursday less than 3% above its [rising 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). As seen over the past year or two, equities got frothy and pulled back significantly when this index got to 6%, 7% or more above the key intermediate-term technical level.


![MP070121](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP070121-192x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite managed to eke out a 0.1% gain. But it has done a lot of catching up with the S&P 500 and other benchmarks with its gain of 12.6% since Jan. 1.


Volume fell sharply on both main exchanges.


Meanwhile, small- and midcap issues showed a little more oomph after making no ground since early June. The Russell 2000 rose 0.8%. It nearly matched a 0.9% advance by the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund. The latter closed above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for only the second time since mid-June.


West Texas intermediate crude oil futures for August delivery added 2.4% to $75.23 a barrel, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That pushed the gain in this popular type of oil to 55% for the year. Alongside big gains this year in lumber, copper, iron ore and other commodities, oil is enjoying one of its best years in decades.


Stock Market In Q3: What's Next?
--------------------------------


Thursday's surprise drop in weekly jobless claims to 364,000 came in lower than even the most bullish estimate as tracked by [Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). That's good news indeed for the U.S. economy. A few of the day's best industry groups hailed from consumer spending and retail sectors. (See the entire list of IBD's 197 groups at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Can the market, meanwhile, maintain its streak of 16 months in a row without sinking into "Market in correction" mode? Let's consider five questions.


**Question 1**: Will new economic data sway the market? While we're heading into a three-day weekend to celebrate America's Independence Day, equity trading desks will no doubt eye the payrolls report for June. The May report was so disappointing that it helped send long-term interest rates falling, soothing concerns about how quickly the Federal Reserve would act to take away its ultra-dovish stance on the cost of money. For June, the Street sees [nonfarm payrolls jumping by 675,000](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


**Question 2:** Will investor sentiment get bubbly again? The [Investors Intelligence survey of stock market newsletter writers](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) showed bullishness hit 59.6% this week. That comes close to that 60% level where we've seen stocks then proceed to cool off. However, the bears ratio inched up to 16.2%.


Keep Watching New Leaders And IPOs
----------------------------------


**Question 3:** Is the extreme activity in new issues also a sign of market frothiness? IBD research finds that new IPOs as a ratio of stocks listed on the NYSE has now topped 15%, hitting a [five-year high](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DailyPsycho063021.pdf).


**Question 4:** How will earnings results for the second quarter shape up? Of course, the market always looks to future quarters. The size of profit and revenue surprises may impact investor reactions. (For more details on how the second, third and fourth quarters are shaping up, please see this [second-half stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-next-six-months-poses-new-risks-for-investors/).)


**Question 5:** Will sector rotation intensify? Amid broad gains, top-rated ship transport stocks fell. **Genco Shipping** ([GNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNK)) dropped 4.6% in slightly below average volume. The small cap has largely been holding its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) since April, a bullish sign.


But **Eagle Bulk Shipping** ([EGLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGLE)) dove 5% and undercut its 50-day moving average for the first time since it retook a 20.48 buy point in a cup with handle in February.


Headed into Thursday's trade, IBD's Transportation-Ship group ranked No. 3 among 197 industries for six-month price performance.

Is this just another [bear market rally](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/)? Or is something really bullish going on here?




Many a reader might be wondering about these questions. There's really only one way to answer it earnestly. Let the market decide.


Since the latest [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) took hold with a [Day 5 rally in higher turnover on June 24](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gains-pace-as-these-hopes-rise-casino-stocks-hit-the-jackpot/), the major averages enjoyed one of their best rallies on Tuesday. The Nasdaq composite rolled 3.1% higher and lifted above its fast-declining 50-day moving average for the first time in roughly four months. Small caps performed even better. Check out iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF, a 3.5% gainer on Tuesday in slightly higher volume vs. Monday.


IWM also retook its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) in a bullish style not seen since perhaps the middle of March.



Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lagged a bit vs. the indexes mentioned above. But it too climbed above the 50-day line, a key technical indicator of support and resistance, with a gain of nearly 2.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.4%. The blue chip index breathed air above its own 50-day moving average for the first time since April.


Volume expanded less than 5% vs. the prior session on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, total turnover edged higher by merely 10 million shares to 3.76 billion shares. (For [MarketSmith subscribers](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), please track a fuller picture of changes in NYSE composite volume by going to zero-SP5L for the S&P 500. Information on this chart has a one-day lag.)


The NYSE composite continues to underperform its Nasdaq peer. The former, up 2.5% on Tuesday, now shows a 5.5% advance from its June 17 low ahead of the Nasdaq's follow-through four trading sessions later. But the latter has thrust 10.9% higher over the same time frame.

A key element of a successful, tradable uptrend for the IBD methodology? A bedrock of solid breakouts by good stocks [surging past a proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/). Admittedly, in this area, the rally still tastes rather bland.


The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) ETF displayed more miserly behavior. Its 1.5% gain points to a still relatively barren field of top-notch growth stocks staging breakouts to new 52-week or all-time highs.


Given the recent market volatility, further strength in the indexes would certainly warrant a shift in the market outlook. The major stock indexes, after all, have made little progress in the past few weeks.

Bear Market Thesis: Under Pressure?
-----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP071922-237x300.jpg)Crude oil, meanwhile, reached triple-digit territory again. West Texas Intermediate oil futures rose almost 1% to hit $100.40 per barrel. At one point it got as high as $100.99. Natural gas plummeted 2.6%, but gasoline futures rallied 1.2%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond added back 6 basis points to 3.01%.


In 2022, the jump in energy prices and the rise in the cost of money clearly gave institutional investors reasons to lock in profits and shift money away from equities. The bear market this year will be remembered as one that's already deeper and longer in duration than the one experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018. Yet as noted [during a segment in the middle of Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), market observers have seen bullish action in U.S. stocks in the 12 months that follow the November midterm elections.


As further evidence of a broad rebound, the market has handled mixed results from Wall Street firms fairly well.


With the Volcker Rule in place since the destruction caused by the 2008-2009 Great Financial Crisis, banks have had to meet stricter requirements on reserving capital for loan losses. The most aggressive lenders on Wall Street have also gotten more hamstrung with rules that seek to limit proprietary trading of highly speculative securities for their own accounts.


Indeed, banking stocks have not gotten much relief from the harsh selling that typically accompanies bear-market conditions.


Regional banks have suffered deep losses as well. Just take a gander at the SPDR S&P Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) ETF. A 3.1% riser on Tuesday, KRE remains 23% below its Jan. 14 peak.

Looking Ahead: Where Will Leaders Emerge?
-----------------------------------------


So, if any sector is going to help the market move higher, it's going to likely have to come from somewhere outside the financial sector, at least in the short term.


Lately, oil and gas stocks have retreated. [As the IBD Big Cap 20 has shown](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), leadership has also rotated away from energy. Now, medical, retail and tech look poised to regain more of a leadership stance.


Breadth continued to improve. Early data showed winners beating losers on the Nasdaq by a 7-2 margin and nearly 5 to 1 on the NYSE.


Plus, a gradually rising number of stocks are also retaking their 50-day moving averages — and staying above their 50-day lines. **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and Long-Term Leader and cybersecurity leader **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) could be ones that eventually join a reader's large-cap watchlist.


However, buying breakouts is still not an easy game for making money.


Managed care firm **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) is thriving again after briefly falling below an 87.44 buy point in an [11-week double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/).


**Legend Biotech** ([LEGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEGN)) cleared a 50.10 buy point in a [large cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/). It quickly gained 15%, but turned tail after reaching a high of 57.67. Relentless selling yanked the speculative biotech all the way back to its [pivot point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

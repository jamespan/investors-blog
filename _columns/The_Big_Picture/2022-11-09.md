  Bitcoin Platform Turmoil Bangs Stock Market Lower; This Sector Gets Torched The Most

Do you remember the last time when the stock market appeared to deal with four — repeat, four — thick layers of uncertainty? Wednesday was just that type of day.




The sensational news of [Binance refusing to bail out fellow cryptocurrency exchange FTX](https://www.investors.com/news/cryptocurrency-prices-news/) raised uncertainty about the future of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. The much awaited U.S. midterm elections won't have an official conclusion until a runoff election gets held for a Senate seat in Georgia and other races are decided. Meanwhile, investors are facing questions about what Thursday's latest inflation report means for the path of interest rates.


Finally, the general reaction toward corporate third-quarter earnings has been stone cold. This too has thrown doubt about the durability of the latest rally attempt amid the bear market.


That old saying about how the stock market dislikes uncertainty rang true on Wednesday. Small caps to megacap techs swung lower in unison. Key indexes finished virtually at session lows. Make no mistake: The current uptrend remains under intense selling pressure. Thus, new buys should be avoided.



Stock Market Today: Broad Weakness
----------------------------------


The Nasdaq dropped 2.5% to 10,353. This all but wiped away three days' worth of gains. Another drop like the one on Wednesday could lead to a test of the Oct. 13 near-term low of 10,088.


Small caps did worse as the Russell 2000 sank 2.7%. The large-cap S&P 500 melted 2.1%. Blue chips and utilities offered no refuge. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped almost 2%, SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) edged 0.8% lower.


Nasdaq volume edged lower. Yet as the accompanying Market Pulse table indicates, many leading stocks suffered a [bout of heavy institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). That's not what you normally see in a healthy stock market. Higher turnover on the NYSE tagged the S&P 500 with a third [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) since the [Oct. 21 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-roars-back-to-life-amid-new-fed-hopes-these-stocks-shine-brightest/).


Early on Thursday, all eyes on Wall Street will focus on the October consumer prices report.


[Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) gives a consensus forecast for an 8% jump year over year; that would mark a slight deceleration vs. an 8.2% vault in September. The estimate for core prices excluding food and energy shows a stubbornly high 0.5% rise, slightly down from a 0.6% move up in the prior month.



Dry Powder Expanding
--------------------


Bitcoin slumped below $16,000 on Wednesday, extending its correction from a November 2021 peak of more than $64,000 to more than 75%. That decline more or less matches IBD research that finds the greatest stock market winners fall on average 72% after they've topped.


The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ([BITO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITO)) ETF has slid more than 26% over the past two sessions. At 9.63, it's fallen 78% from its November 2021 peak.


Dan Pipitone, co-founder and president of online brokerage TradeZero, says the spiraling decline of Bitcoin, combined with generally lower market volatility, has made the retail trader much more cautious in 2022.


"There's a lot of dry powder out there among retail investors," Pipitone told IBD. "We continue to add new accounts, but they're doing a lot less on a per-account basis. That said, we've reached a new, higher plateau" in terms of the public's general interest in stock market trading. "Before, people thought that the capital markets are not for me. That's changed. It's more approachable."


The Day's Biggest Decliners
---------------------------


Amid a news-heavy session, the oil and gas sector really got socked as crude oil futures fell even harder than the stock market benchmarks. West Texas intermediate near-term futures slid 3.7% to $85.61 a barrel. Natural gas fell 2.9%. Lower energy prices will indeed help soften the blow that raging inflation is having on the economy. But this has consequences for stock market investors as well.


Case in point: **Chart Industries** ([GTLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLS)) led a 20% plunge in IBD's oil and gas machinery and equipment industry group.



The midcap stock delivered a key sell signal, cleaving its 50-day moving average in huge volume. It also tripped below the long-term 200-day moving average on news that the company agreed to pay $4.4 billion in cash and stock to KPS Capital Partners for Howden, a specialist in air- and gas-handling equipment. That price tag is equal to almost 78% of Chart Industries' stock market value as of Wednesday's close.


Did the stock market judge the price tag as perhaps too much?


Outside the oil equipment industry, coal stocks plunged 8% as a group, also on a price-weighted basis. International, U.S. and Canadian oil exploration, oil and gas drilling and integrated firms skidded 5% lower or more.


Outside the oil patch, automaker, agricultural operations, department store, telecom infrastructure, fiber optic, retail internet, metal ores, steel alloy and clothing manufacturing industry groups each took haircuts of at least 4% on the day.

Is Fixed Income More Attractive Than Stock Market Now?
------------------------------------------------------


As the Federal Reserve appears set to raise the cost of money yet again at its final meeting of the year on Dec. 14, it's not a surprise to see long-term bond yields rise again on Wednesday. But the yield on the U.S. Treasury bond edged up just 2 basis points to 4.15%.


The return on certain debt securities seems to be attracting more institutional interest.


Steve Wyett began his career as an institutional bond salesman more than 40 years ago. Today, as chief investment strategist at Tulsa-based **BOK Financial** ([BOKF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOKF)), he says long-term Treasuries are looking the most attractive in roughly 15 years.


"In the last 15 years, investing in bonds was brutal due to the risk," Wyett told IBD. "But now, bonds can help fund distributions for our clients, instead of relying on capital gains. This increase in cash flow gives portfolios more flexibility."


Wyett also stressed that inflation is not going to stay at 8%. But he much prefers to see the Federal Reserve stay patient in its mission to tame inflation.


"If you want to see the Fed pivot too soon, that's at the detriment of long-term interest rates," he said. "Who would you want to fight inflation, (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell or the bond vigilantes?"

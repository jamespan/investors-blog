Stock Market Takes Bullish Step; Why One Money Manager Sees S&P 500 Hitting 5000 In 2022
=========================================================================================

If you've been observing the stock market long enough, you likely came to the conclusion weeks ago, or even months, that a battle between growth investors and value hunters has waged all year.




One day, the "undervalued" commodity, financial and industrial plays win the title for most bullish action. Another day, the "priced for perfection" growth names occupy the top of the market's heap. But on Tuesday, institutions made this clear for now: The uptrend lives on.


The Nasdaq notched an all-time high of 14,269 as the composite index rose 0.8%. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF rallied 0.9%. It, too, reached an all-time peak.


Other areas of the market did not fare as strongly — from measly gains of 0.1% to 0.2% for the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to so-so gains of 0.4%-0.5% by the S&P 500 and iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)).


Stock Market Today: Professional Selling Lightens
-------------------------------------------------


A quick view of two sector ETFs in small-cap land offer more perspective on the growth-vs.-value rivalry.



The iShares Russell 1000 Growth fund ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rallied 1% and marked an all-time high. Since April 1, the ETF has captured a terrific 10% gain.


Meanwhile, iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) edged up 0.1% on Tuesday; at 157.51, it's mustered a 3.9% move higher in the second quarter, which ends in six trading days. The value ETF also finished Tuesday beneath its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the fourth straight session.


Volume fell mildly vs. the prior day on both main exchanges. But enough time has passed for the S&P 500 to lose the May 17 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). At four sessions of declines in higher volume for both the 500 and the Nasdaq, heavy professional profit-taking still appears measured.

The other times IBD's current outlook got this downgrade? Jan. 29, Feb. 25, March 24, May 4 and May 12. With a brighter outlook, investors don't need to be extra cautious as they would in a weaker market outlook.


Nasdaq Up 10.6% Year To Date
----------------------------


This column posed a simple question last week: [Could Nasdaq stocks take the lead?](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-today-show-mixed-action-will-the-nasdaq-take-back-the-lead/)


So far, Tuesday reflected the best action among the [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) in quite a while. All five of these firms now trade back above their 50-day moving averages.


Perhaps at this point, the better questions to ask in the current stock market may include these: 1) How are my own stocks behaving? 2) How are leading stocks doing? And 3) Are more fundamentally strong stocks setting up?


Judging by a scan of screens across [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and the [Stock Lists section](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) of Investors.com, the answer appears to be a resounding yes.


As noted [among panelists on IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live-Free-Access&intcode=hpspt%7Ccms%7Cibdlvfr%7C2021%7C05%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C749906&src=JA3813), including three-time U.S. Investing Championships winner David Ryan, the amount of good merchandise on sale on Wall Street continues to freshen up in at least three ways. One, more new IPOs are participating in the rally, making new highs.


Two, software, internet and e-commerce firms that pounded the major indexes' returns in 2020 have rested at least nine months or more. Did their price-to-earnings ratios get too hot? Perhaps. But more than several handfuls of companies have proven to grow their earnings sharply in recent quarters. In Wall Street parlance, the "e" (earnings) is catching up with the "p" (price) in the P-E ratio.


Three, a lot more stocks are trading near the top of their bases — the best price area in which to break out to new highs.


Stock Market Tomorrow: S&P 500 To 5000?
---------------------------------------


Robert Maltbie, managing partner of the Argonaut Fund and president and founder of Singular Research, thinks that the coming second-quarter earnings season could help spur further market upside. His reasoning? The financial media has already trumpeted a widely held opinion that Q2 will represent "peak earnings."


Yet Maltbie told IBD that the ratio of S&P 500 companies beating the FactSet consensus estimate could hit as high as 3.2 to 1 vs. the historical average of 2.7 to 1. He adds the market is "undervalued relative to earnings growth in the next 12 months and the current interest rate environment." Plus, if a President Joe Biden infrastructure spending package passes through Congress to the tune of $1 trillion, this boosts the chances that S&P 500 earnings in 2021 will grow nicely from the $190 expected on Wall Street this year to around $210 in 2022.


Add a P-E multiplier in the mid-to-high 20s, and all of a sudden a figure of 5000 in the S&P 500 does not sound outlandish.


"The fog of Covid is lifting, and we can possibly have an economy that achieves even higher (profit) margins by companies due to the forwardization of digital technology," Maltbie added.


On Tuesday, the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond's yield fell 1 basis point to 1.47%. That's sharply down from a 2021 high of 1.76%. A year ago, the long-dated bond yielded 0.70%. U.S. crude oil futures cooled 0.8% to a still strong $73.06 a barrel.

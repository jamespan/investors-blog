After another erratic session, the stock market Monday closed about as badly as it could.




The Nasdaq composite was all over the place: It opened higher, reversed lower, then rebounded into the black. But late selling brought down the Nasdaq to a loss of 0.6%.


The S&P 500 also was aimless for much of the day. And when it counted the most, the index flopped. It closed 0.4% lower after shedding 0.8% in the final 45 minutes of trading. In fact, those bearish final 45 minutes saw the most decisive market move of the day.


In a minimal measure of relief, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat. The Dow held above its 200-day moving average, but still hasn't captured the 50-day line.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP020722-250x300.jpg)The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 0.5% increase on the day. It's still crawling out of a 20%-plus hole, however.


With volume higher on the Nasdaq from Friday's level, the index marked its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) of the new market uptrend. NYSE volume appeared to be lower.


Stock Market Direction Unclear
------------------------------


The [follow-through on Jan. 31](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-positive-move-as-nasdaq-again-rallies-more-than-3-percent/) signaled a new stock market uptrend. Yet, indexes are still seeking direction and investors are short on buying opportunities.


Friday's better-than-expected jobs report seemed to lock in an interest-rate increase at the Fed's March meeting, and some speculate it may even be a half-point hike. With conflicting messages like that, no wonder the market has difficulty staying on a single track.


Volatility continues to be the operative term. Since the start of the year, few times have the Nasdaq and S&P 500 opened and stayed in the same direction the entire session. Monday was only the eighth time this year that the S&P 500 ended with a price change of less than 0.5%.


Clunky as it is, the new stock market uptrend so far is mainly a cyclical affair. Energy, agriculture and mining are the only [IBD sectors up for the year](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-feb-04-2022/), not including the "Miscellaneous" category.


In [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), the list of recent breakouts shows just 17 stocks. It's mainly a mix of shipping, materials and energy companies.



In a new breakout Monday, **Bristol Myers Squibb** ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The pharmaceutical company on Friday gave a mixed fourth-quarter report, but [its outlook cheered investors](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/bmy-stock-bristol-myers-earnings-q4-2021/). Volume wasn't impressive and the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has some lag, however.


Stock Market Digests Earnings, Deals
------------------------------------


Chipmaker **Onsemi** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) [topped analysts' expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/on-stock-onsemi-tops-fourth-quarter-targets/) for the fourth quarter and gave bullish guidance for the current quarter. The stock rose more than 8%, extending a two-week rebound. Shares are testing resistance at the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Automotive voice assistant technology company **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)) plummeted 31% after it reported earnings this morning and cut its outlook for the current fiscal year. It is the [second straight quarter that Cerence gives a disappointing forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crnc-stock-cerence-tops-quarterly-views/). The stock sank to the lowest level since August 2020.


Airline stocks rose after two carriers announced a merger. **Frontier Group** ([ULCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULCC)), the parent company of Frontier Airlines, will buy **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)). The deal [would create the No. 5 airline in the U.S.](https://www.investors.com/news/frontier-will-buy-spirit-airlines-more-competition/) and is valued at $6.6 billion including debt and operating lease liabilities.


Spirit stock, which has been in decline for nearly a year, soared 15% in heavy volume. Frontier Group shares climbed 17%. U.S. Global Jets ETF ([JETS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JETS)) rose nearly 3%. IBD's airlines industry rose 2.6%, one of the day's best group moves. Mining, leisure and biotech groups also outperformed.


The IBD 50 fell 0.5% Monday.


Stock Market Faces Inflation Report
-----------------------------------


With inflation a sore point for the stock market, Thursday's consumer price index looms as a potential market mover. Economists [expect a 0.5% increase in January](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) from the previous month and 7.3% from the year-ago period.


On Monday, IHS Markit downgraded its forecast for 2022 U.S. GDP growth from 4.1% to 3.7%. Economists Joel Prakken and Chris Varvares said the change reflects a temporary weakening in consumer spending due to Covid infections, and inventory investment pushed up into late 2021 from 2022. Markit also raised its 2022 inflation forecast from 4.2% to 4.5%.


"A transition from pandemic to endemic, the resolution of supply disruptions and labor shortages, and still accommodative, albeit tightening financial conditions will support continued expansion in 2022 and beyond," the economists said in a report.

The U.S. and China confirmed a phase-one trade deal Friday, but it wasn't much help to the stock market as the Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended with marginal gains. But make no mistake, the confirmed stock market uptrend still has a lot going for it.




The stock market surged to new highs Thursday on preliminary reports of a deal. More details emerged Friday, including the [reduction of tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-deal-tiny-seals-beijing-victory-over-trump-dow-jones/) on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports. But China stopped short of committing to a specific dollar amount of agricultural purchases.


A rebound in software stocks helped lift the Nasdaq to a gain of 0.2%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones rose less than 0.1%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.4%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in lower than Thursday.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) picked up 0.35%, helped by solid showings from **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), which ended with gains of more than 2%.


Stock Market Strength
---------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP121319-292x300.jpg)Friday's session served up some bullish moves, including one from **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)). A strong earnings report fueled a breakout over a 310.10 [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) buy point. Shares rose nearly 4% to 317.94. Adobe reset its base count late last year after a 26% pullback.


Adobe's strong performance gave a much needed lift to software stocks, many of which had been under selling pressure in recent days. ServiceNow, a member of [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), jumped nearly 3% to 272.98. It's trying to reclaim a 276.60 double-bottom entry. IShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) picked up 0.8%.


[Semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) have provided major leadership for the stock market in recent weeks, but **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) was a drag on VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)), which reversed lower for a loss of 0.4%. But SMH notched a weekly gain of 4.4% and is still holding comfortably above its 10-week moving average.


Broadcom, which gets a 5% weighting in the exchange traded fund, slumped nearly 4% to 315.42 after topping a 325.27 alternate entry Thursday. The company reported [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/broadcom-earnings-q4-2019-avgo-stock/) late Thursday.


Meanwhile, IBD's biotech group has quietly moved to No. 1 in IBD's 197 industry group rankings, up from a ranking of 20th three weeks ago and 39th six weeks ago.

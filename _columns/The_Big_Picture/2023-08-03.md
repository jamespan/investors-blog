The stock market finished quietly lower ahead of Friday's July jobs report from the Labor Department. Late Thursday, tech titans **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reported their highly anticipated earnings results.




As the stock market continues to pull back from this year's highs, these four leaders have held up in or near buy zones: [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)).


U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply Thursday, with the 10-year Treasury yield settling at 4.18%, its highest level since November 2022. Early Thursday, the [Bank of England](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-england-rate-decision-august-d683d0a) raised its key interest rate, from 5% to 5.25%, its highest level since February 2008.


Out at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, the July jobs report is expected to show that nonfarm payrolls increased 200,000 last month, down slightly from June's 209,000. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.6%.


Stock Market Earnings: PayPal, Qualcomm
---------------------------------------


Earnings caused decidedly mixed moves among **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)). **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) were other key earnings movers.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP080323-238x300.jpg)DoorDash shares reversed modestly lower Thursday, while Etsy stock tumbled 13.7%. Fastly surged nearly 23% to a February 2022 high. HubSpot dived 11.3%, as MELI stock advanced more than 13%. [PayPal shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pypl-stock-paypal-earnings-revenue-edge-by-views-as-analysts-pine-for-ceo-news/) plunged more than 12%.


[Qualcomm tumbled](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qcom-stock-qualcomm-falls-after-fiscal-q3-report/) 8.2%, FOUR stock climbed 2.4%, and [Shopify](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shop-stock-shopify-earnings-q22023/) declined more than 5% to break below its 50-day line. Unity shares moved down nearly 1%.


Late Thursday, Amazon jumped more than 7% in extended trade after the e-commerce giant reported [better-than-expected earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-jumps-after-tech-giant-beats-q2-goals/). Meanwhile, Apple declined more than 1% in after-hours trade as [sales continued to decline](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-drops-as-iphone-maker-sales-decline-again/).


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%. In the Dow 30, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) skidded 2.2%, extending a losing streak to four sessions and closing below its 50-day line.


The S&P 500 dipped less than 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite edged barely lower Thursday. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.3%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq but eased on the NYSE from the prior session, so both indexes avoided a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The distribution-day count remains unchanged with five apiece on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.6% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) cratered more than 11%, breaking down below its 50-day line, a clear sell signal.


On Wednesday, IBD changed its current outlook for the stock market to "Uptrend under pressure" from "Confirmed uptrend." That was the first change in the outlook since May 10. Due to the current weakness, IBD recommends a 60%-80% exposure range.

Oracle, [a recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/oracle-stock-database-giant-looks-for-ai-boost-in-cloud-infrastructure-business/), continues to trace a flat base with a 127.54 buy point. With the stock at its 50-day line, a bounce would offer an earlier entry. Another early buy trigger is in play at 121.36.


Cybersecurity leader Palo Alto Networks is trying to find support around its 10-week line. A strong rebound would place the stock in a new buy area. Conversely, further weakness could lead to a breach of that support level, which would be at least a sign of caution.


[In IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), Palo Alto's exposure was reduced to a quarter size in recent weeks amid the stock's pullback. In late June, the stock hit the 20%-25% profit zone from the 203.44 buy point.

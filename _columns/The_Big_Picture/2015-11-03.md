The stock market kept steaming higher Tuesday, unimpeded by the latest raft of earnings reports. The S&P 500 added 0.3%, hitting its highest level since July. The Nasdaq climbed 0.4%.

  

Both indexes gave back some gains late in the day but kept their sharp price uptrends intact.

  

After months of a downward tilt, the 50-day moving averages of the broad indexes have started to turn higher. That should please the chart readers.

  

Volume rose across the board, giving the day's winning a measure of institutional support.

  

Advancing stocks led decliners by a 7-5 ratio on the NYSE and a 3-2 ratio on the Nasdaq. In fact, breadth has been improving along with the general market's uptrend.

  

The advance/decline line of the NYSE is at the highest level since July. The Nasdaq A/D line has not rebounded quite as well, however.

  

For clues on that divergence, investors can look to the top of the Nasdaq chart on Page B4, where the largest components are listed. It is those heavyweights that have shouldered much of the Nasdaq's advance. 

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) had terrific Octobers.

  

The graph of small-cap vs. big-cap growth funds (today on Page A10) still shows the big-capitalization camp with the upper hand.

  

As the indexes continue sailing under clear skies, some of the earlier distribution days are becoming irrelevant.

  

The Oct. 14 distribution day on the S&P 500 is now too far down the chart to matter any longer. Same goes for the Oct. 21 distribution day on the Nasdaq.

  

Those deductions left the number of distribution days — the higher-volume losses that typify heavy institutional selling — closer to what would be expected in a rallying market.

  

Energy, steel, machinery and other cyclical stocks led the market Tuesday. Crude oil jumped nearly 4%.

  

The IBD 50 rose 0.2%, and again lagged the broader market. The Relative Strength line of the IBD 50 has been showing limp form for more than six weeks. It's a bothersome trend, similar to the lagging action of small caps.

  

The Russell 2000 did perk up the past week. And there are enough leading stocks performing well from breakouts to calm concerns about the IBD 50.

  

Still, the trends in the leaders and small caps could be the soft underbelly of today's market.

  

Investors have few top-rated stocks to fret about these days.

  

**Universal Insurance** ([UVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UVE)) and **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)) have suffered some spasms.

  

**SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)) seemed committed to rise above a 74 buy point but reversed lower in heavy volume. The provider of cloud-based software for financial services firms beat profit and revenue expectations late Monday.

  

But **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) bounced back nicely after selling off the prior day on the company's mixed quarterly results. Shares of the credit card company surged 3.5% Tuesday and climbed back above the 77.02 buy point of a breakout more than two weeks ago.

  

**Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) broke out of a six-week base in heavy trading.

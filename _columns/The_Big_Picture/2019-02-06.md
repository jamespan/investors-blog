  Bulls Still Confident Despite Moderate Losses

U.S. stock indexes dropped Wednesday, but the market's overall bias over the past six or seven weeks remains bullish.




The Nasdaq composite sliced off 0.4% Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 lost 0.2%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. That prevented a [day of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the market.


Distribution points to institutional selling. So far, there has not been much, and Wednesday's would-be  violation seemed minor.


Nasdaq's Pattern
----------------


The Nasdaq's pattern since the Christmas Eve's closing low has been several up days in a row followed by a day or two of rest.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MP_1x0_020619-227x300.jpg)For instance, the Nasdaq has sported several win streaks of four to five sessions in recent weeks. But the intermittent down days have been brief and routine.


There was nothing in Wednesday's action that broke that bullish tilt.


Pockets of strength are the more common reality than bouts of selling.


Chip Stocks
-----------


On Wednesday, semiconductors led the way. The Philadelphia semiconductor index leapt 2.6%.


The problem with chip stocks is that many are far off their highs. **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) gapped up 11.5% Wednesday but is still 26% off its high. **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) jumped 4% and is 20% off its high. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) logged its sixth straight daily advance but remains 47% off its high.


IBD-style investors do not buy stocks far off their highs because overhead supply can kill an advance.


[Overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-overhead-supply-threat-in-a-stocks-new-base-expires-over-time/) refers to long and deep selling on the left side of a consolidation. Investors who bought shares on the left side are often anxious to sell as the stock advances. This makes it difficult for a breakout to work.


The good news is that investors are finding breakouts that are working. Chip designer **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) broke out Jan. 24 and is now 20% above its 95.28 [buy point](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/).


Change In Character
-------------------


The market has rather consistently been focused on earnings, which represents a change in character from the news-driven market.


President Donald Trump's standoff with China on trade could reassert its influence on the market in early March. That's when the delay in U.S. tariff increases is lifted.


The government shutdown also could become a news factor if nothing is solved before Feb. 15.


Bulls much prefer a stock market focused on earnings season rather than politics. But if the rally does leave the rails, news is likely to be one of the usual suspects.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) reported after the close Wednesday. The company [beat the Street's estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q4-2018-chipotle-stock-buy-point/) on the top and bottom lines. Shares jumped about 9% in after-hours trade.

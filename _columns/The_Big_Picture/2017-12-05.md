Stocks Fall As Tech Sell-Off Faces A Critical Test
===================================================

Stocks faded into the close Tuesday, while battered technology shares tried to bounce from a sell-off that has dented the market's uptrend.




 The major indexes opened higher but selling worked its way through the rest of the session. Indexes closed at session lows for the second day in a row. That's bearish action, and contrasts with the past couple of weeks, when several times the indexes closed high in the day's range.


The Nasdaq composite was up as much as 0.9% in late-morning trading, but closed 0.2% lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 1% and has erased most gains from a rally that began with the Nov. 28 jump to new highs.


Volume was considerably lower than Monday's pace, which spared the market from a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). All the same, Tuesday's weak performance in the indexes and many leading stocks was reason to cede the day to the bears.


The five distribution days on the Nasdaq are more than normal, and only a little more distribution could throw the market off its uptrend. More concerning is the condition of leading stocks, particularly the techs that have been selling off for nearly a week.


Technology is the largest market sector, and its influence on the overall market cannot be overestimated.

Dozens of top-rated leaders in software, chips, internet, networking and other industries have fallen swiftly to their 50-day moving averages in heavy volume and sometimes below that key level, which often attracts buyers on the dip.


On Tuesday, some gave a good fight at the 50-day line. **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) andÂ **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) held fast at the 50-day line.


But others remain below the line, leaving the outlook for the tech leaders far from settled. **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) are significantly below their 50-day averages. There are more.


It wasn't a great day for leading stocks in general. The IBD 50 is now below its 50-day line for the first time since August and about 8% below its prior high. Tech-sector representation in IBD 50 is quickly diminishing. Now there are about a dozen techs on the list, vs. some 20 on Nov. 27.


Retail and financial stocks, which had emerged as new leaders, did not follow through Tuesday. Even news that a [Senate panel took up the repeal of Dodd-Frank](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/42010-senate-banking-committee-introduces-repeal-of-dodd-frank-act) banking regulations could not help financials. The SPDR Financial ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) fell 0.5%. Solar, data storage, oil and internet were among the top industry groups.


Homebuilders, the [No. 2 industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-dec-04-2017/), took a blow after **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) gapped down on [disappointing results and a soft outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/toll-bros-dives-on-earnings-sales-miss-weak-guidance/). The group fell 1.7%.


As The Big Picture has pointed out, the Nasdaq has had a tendency to pull back as soon as it climbs 4% above its 50-day moving average, and that happened again with last week's peak.


But throughout the year, the market's pullbacks have been modest. The market still has couple of tailwinds, namely an improving economy and strong corporate profits. If Congress can finalize the tax reform package, corporations stand to see a big cut in taxes.


Meanwhile, sector rotation has forced investors out of some top stocks, while creating new opportunities in others.

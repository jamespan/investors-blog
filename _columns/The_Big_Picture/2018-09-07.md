The Big Picture: Stocks Hang Tight Despite Tariff Noise
========================================================

U.S. stock indexes sketched a saw-toothed pattern Friday as the market staged positive and negative reversals.




Blue chips and small caps trimmed the day's losses to 0.3% on the Dow and the S&P 600. The Nasdaq fell almost 0.3%, after being up 0.5% in late morning action. The large-cap S&P 500 dropped 0.2%.


Volume dropped on both major exchanges, protecting the major indexes from distribution.


The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed with a 1% gain. The retail sector also did well.

President Trump threatened to up the tariff ante on China to essentially everything they export to the U.S.


Business magazine Fortune reported that Trump also was hinting at slapping Japan with tariffs.


The stock market has done a good job avoiding panic despite the trade uncertainties this year, but the S&P 500 chart tells a less congratulatory story.


Since late January, the S&P 500 has declined as much as 11.8% in choppy action.


While recent new highs have excited the mainstream media, stock analysts are less sanguine. If this stock market could talk, a lot of throat clearing is what most investors would hear.


Put another way, the S&P 500 recently rose only 1.5% above its January high before starting a timid retreat.

Earnings Season Largely Done
----------------------------


Q2 earnings season is mostly over and it went well. Yet, while individual stocks had their fair share of price gains on beats, this didn't seem to help the indexes.


Q2 was not the tailwind that filled all sails, but more like the tricky crosswind that required good judgment.


For example, last year's market-leading FANG stocks enjoyed no automatic passes.


Stocks that found punishment in the earnings season included **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), down about 25% since the earnings report; **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), off 13%; and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), down 3%. All three stocks beat the Street's consensus earnings estimate, but still they lost or could not sustain gains.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) gained 8% since its earnings report. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rose 16%. Apple and Amazon topped the Street's estimates.


The August jobs report showed a rise in wage growth that elevated expectations of more interest-rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury yield popped seven basis points to 2.94%, according to Bloomberg News.


The CME FedWatch Tool puts the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate hike later this month at 99.8%. For December, the likelihood of an additional hike — after the presumed September hike — is set at 77.6%.

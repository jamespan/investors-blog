Stock Indexes Sag, Unable To Find Clear Direction
==================================================

Stocks sagged Friday, unable to shake the indecisiveness that has hung over the stock market for more than two months.


The Nasdaq dropped 0.4%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The IBD 50 eased 0.1%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE, adding a distribution day to the S&P 500.


In recent months, dividend-oriented plays have outperformed the major indexes. But on Friday, the Dow Jones utility average dived 4%. Property real estate investment trusts, which recently have been hot gainers, also took a hard hit Friday.

The strong industry groups Friday included homebuilders and the regional banks.


Right now, neither Friday's action nor the weekly action is nearly as important as the overall trend since early December. The major indexes are stuck in a trading range. Until the range is broken to the down or the up side, bulls and bears will find it difficult to make money.


Unlike sports witticisms where the tough get going when the going gets tough, savvy investors avoid new buys and may even go to cash in frustrating markets. This is no time to play action-hero games.


With the market under pressure, stocks can be bought but discretion is advisable. The 'M' for market is the most important element in investing. And breakouts are doing exactly what the textbook suggests is likely in iffy markets: Breakouts are having trouble finding strong follow-up gains. Consider the breakouts since December that have been "working." Where are they at this point?


**Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)) cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern Dec. 19 and is up 7% but edged under the buy point twice in its choppy follow-up.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) popped out of a flat base Jan. 23 and is 5% above the 84.30 buy point. The big qualifier: It is up only 1% from its gap-up day close.


Homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) broke out in January, clearing a 26.04 buy point. The wild-acting stock triggered the 8% sell rule five sessions later. On Friday, D.R. Horton retook the buy point in strong volume.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) danced over an early entry at 114.87 in late January. The stock has behaved relatively well, but is only 3.5% above the entry and remains below a more conventional buy point at 119.85.


India-based bank **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) rose 13% above a 54.84 buy point and then fell. The stock is back in the 5% buy zone, less than 4% above the entry. When a fleeting 13% gain is probably the best follow-up action around, individual investors know it's a tough atmosphere.


In economic news, nonfarm payrolls for January were stronger than expected. The jobless rate moved up a tick from 5.6% to 5.7%, perhaps affected by a small rise in the participation rate.


For the week, the small cap S&P 600 rose 3.9%, its best gain since late October. The S&P 500 added 3%; the Nasdaq, 2.4%; and the IBD 50, 2.3%. Fear and defensive plays lagged with iShares **Gold Trust** ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)), down 3.8% for the week, and the Utility-Electric industry group losing 3.9%.


The coming week will feature a full roster of company quarterly reports. On Monday, reports include toymaker **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)), China-based online gamer **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and cloud security provider **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)).

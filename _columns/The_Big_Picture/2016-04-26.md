Stock indexes closed narrowly mixed Tuesday as the market continued to feel its way around a treacherous path.


The Nasdaq fell less than 0.2%. Some Nasdaq-heavy industry groups, such as biotech, Internet and software stocks, were among the weakest of the day.


![MP041716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP041716-183x300.jpg)The S&P 500 edged up 0.2%. Its 50-day moving average has now climbed above the 200-day line. Known in technical analysis parlance as a "golden cross," this action is a positive sign, although it's no guarantee of continued improvement. A similar crossover occurred in late December, just ahead of the January sell-off.


Volume rose, considerably more on the Nasdaq.


The S&P 500 has been the mildly better index this year, thanks in part to rebounding oil and other commodity-type stocks. Crude oil reached its highest level of 2016 Tuesday.


But small caps curried favor among institutional investors on Tuesday. The Russell 2000 jumped 1.1% to its highest level since Dec. 30. Regional banks -- the minnows of the financial sector -- have been re-emerging on the new highs list and are part of the small-cap trend.


The transportation sector also outperformed thanks to some glowing earnings reports. **Paccar** ([PCAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCAR)), the maker of Kenworth, Peterbilt and other heavy trucks, surged 5% after it beat earnings expectations. **Ryder System** ([R](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=R)) rallied on better-than-expected earnings as well. Rail equipment company **Wabtec** ([WAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAB)) leaped nearly 5% on its latest results. The transports' performance was all the more remarkable given that airlines were mainly weaker and **Canadian National Railway** ([CNI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNI)) gapped down to a 4.5% loss after it reported results.


Advancers beat decliners by about 10-to-3 on the NYSE and by 12-to-7 on the Nasdaq. Thus breadth was more bullish than the indexes suggested, and it reflected the relative weakness of some major stocks such as **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


The market is navigating a tricky path in which it faces a double risk: The Fed announces its latest policy decision Wednesday afternoon, and earnings season is still in full force. While the central bank is not expected to move on rates, its new overview of the economy is certain to have some hints about the future of interest rates.


First-quarter results have been gloomy for many top companies. The latest was **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which tumbled as much as 8% in extended trading Tuesday. The company's results after the close [missed expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-misses-q2-views-posts-first-ever-drop-in-iphone-sales/), and its iPhone sales fell for the first time ever.


Apple accounts for the largest single-stock weighting (6.7% as of Tuesday's IBD) in the Nasdaq and is a key component of the S&P 500 and Dow industrials, so its price decline figures to spill over into Wednesday's market open. Several Apple suppliers also were sharply lower in after-hours trading.


Poor earnings are only adding to the risk that the market has already incurred from several distribution days in the past few weeks. That many days can unmask institutional selling even when the indexes are near highs, as the S&P 500 is today.


The IBD 50 climbed 0.1% Tuesday. **Whirlpool** ([WHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHR)), which is on today's IBD 50, gapped down nearly 4% after its results missed expectations.


In a quiet day for economic reports, orders for U.S. durable goods climbed less than forecast in March as demand for capital equipment remained weak.

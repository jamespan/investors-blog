The stock market rallied broadly after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave specific guidance on interest rates as he testified in Congress Wednesday.




There were strong gains across all indexes, with jumps high enough to justify a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). The fly in the ointment was volume, which was lower on both the Nasdaq and, according to early data, also on the New York Stock Exchange. This missing vital ingredient means it did not qualify as a rally confirmation.


The Nasdaq composite made the slimmest gain of the major indexes as it jumped 1.6%. It remains well below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) but is now within striking distance of its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It remains about 15% below its record high.


The S&P 500 also remains shy of its major moving averages despite rising 1.9% Wednesday. It did manage to close in on its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) as it clambered past its 10-day line. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 600 points as it popped 1.8%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP030222--213x300.jpg)One key bullish sign is the fact gainers outnumbered decliners by more than 2-to-1 on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq. The fact volatility rescinded somewhat, with the [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, closing down nearly 8% was also a positive.


Remember that one bullish day does not erase all the damage that has been done. At the moment, indexes are just roughly back to where they started the week.


For now the [IBD market outlook remains at "market in correction.](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx)" Investors should still be avoiding all stock purchases, though experienced traders could test the waters with pilot positions in exceptional stocks that are passing buy points.


Growth Stocks, Small Caps Shine
-------------------------------


While the major indexes turned in strong gains, small caps and growth stocks outperformed.


The Russell 2000 was the star of the day as it muscled 2.5% higher. Growth stocks ran virtually neck and neck, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) popping 2.6%.


Both remain rooted firmly below the 50-day moving averages.



Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose about 17 basis points to 1.88%. Oil continued to spike amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with West Texas Intermediate crude rising 7.6% to $111.26 late Wednesday.


Stock Market Whisperer Powell Touts 'Soft Landing'
--------------------------------------------------


Once again, the Fed's Powell acted as a market whisperer, this time as he testified before Congress on Wednesday.


While he acknowledged that more interest-rate hikes may be necessary as the year weighs on to tame inflation, he said he is "inclined to propose and support" a 25-basis point rate hike at the next Fed meeting. This equates to a quarter of a percentage point, and less than the half-point hike that many investors feared.


Powell also struck a confident tone that central bankers will be able to safely guide America out of its worrisome economic position.


"I think it's more likely than not that we can achieve what we call a soft landing," he said.


However, Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya warned investors that the time will eventually come to pay the piper on the inflation front.


"The problem is that eventually all these skyrocketing commodity price moves with grains, energy and metals will have a crippling inflation impact that could lead to aggressive tightening later this summer," he told Investor's Business Daily.


These Areas Shine Brightest As Bulls Charge
-------------------------------------------


On bullish days, it is crucial to keep an eye on the top-performing industry groups.


Wednesday, it was department stores that shined brightest, with **Nordstom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) popping 37.8% on results, lifting the whole group.


Media periodicals and coal stocks also impressed. A strong day for data storage stocks was underlined by the fact **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) joined [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Wednesday.


Solar stocks, educational software plays, dairy products companies and integrated telecom services stocks were the worst performing.

These Stocks Pass Buy Points Amid Bounce
----------------------------------------


A number of noteworthy stocks staged breakouts amid the broadly positive action. All were in sectors related to defense or rising commodities.


Aerospace play **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) ended the session just below its buy zone after passing a flat-base entry of 152.59, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).



The component parts replacement specialist offers exposure to both commercial aerospace and defense categories. It boasts good all-around performance, while big money has been snapping up the stock in recent weeks. This is an important consideration for [CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


**United States Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) ended the day in a buy zone after breaking out of a double-bottom base. The ideal entry here is 28.46, although 26.27 was an alternative entry.


It is a member of an industry group that is currently in favor. Institutional purchasing has been only mildly higher lately, though.


Natural gas play **Oneok** ([OKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKE)) is also offering an opportunity for those keen to jump on the current energy bull market.


Earnings growth has been strong of late, [rising by an average of 63%](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-oneok-inc-oke.aspx) over the past three quarters. This is well in excess of CAN SLIM requirements.


With the stock market currently in a correction, investors should remember any buys carry extra risk.

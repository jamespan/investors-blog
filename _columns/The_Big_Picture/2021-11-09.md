title: Stock Market Indexes Retreat En Masse; What This Bitcoin Play Teaches Traders

After a five-week run that sent the Nasdaq composite up 13% from an Oct. 4 low of 14,181 to Friday's peak of 16,053, it probably surprised no one to see the stock market indexes catch their breath.




Meantime, the reactions in some stocks following their latest quarterly results? Breathtaking. **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)), **Roblox** ([RBLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBLX)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) offer the latest examples.


Tuesday's losses appeared evenly distributed, relatively speaking, among the major indexes.


While the Nasdaq composite led the way, down 0.6%, it wasn't that much more than losses of 0.3% for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Small-cap indexes matched the Nasdaq's decline; the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) slipped nearly 0.6%. But midcap stocks held their ground, as SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) edged down less than 0.1%.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond sank 6 basis points to 1.43%.


Stock Market Today: Time To Cool Off?
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP110921_3-211x300.jpg)Volume came in nearly even vs. the prior day. But on the Nasdaq, the difference was razor-thin: 5,481,965,000 shares exchanged hands on Tuesday, down just 225,000 shares from the 5,482,190,000 on Monday.


So, technically, the Nasdaq dodged a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


NYSE turnover cooled.


As the Market Pulse table shows, evidence of widespread professional selling remains sparse. A tradable uptrend, confirmed by the [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on the Nasdaq composite on Oct. 14, can handle several distribution days over a 25-trading-day stretch and still keep bullish composure.


But as this column has noted for days now, the supercharged run by the stock market has gotten a few equity indexes into territories that usually spell some kind of normal pullback.


Watch The 50-Day
----------------


Take the Nasdaq composite. At Monday's close of 15,982, the tech-enriched benchmark stood a sprightly 6.1% above its 50-day moving average. IBD research over decades of bull and bear market cycles has found that the Nasdaq tends to get vulnerable when it reaches that height above this key intermediate-term technical level.

Back on Sept. 2, 2020, the Nasdaq sprinted higher for 11 of its prior 13 sessions. The slope of its ascent steepened quickly as the index reached a then-high of 12,074 — a remarkable 11.6% above its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq sold off hard in the next three weeks, undercutting the 50-day line on Sept. 11, just six sessions later.


Lately, the Nasdaq is seeing some resistance at 16,000. The Nasdaq 100, covering the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on its exchange, snapped its own 10-day winning streak with a 0.7% decline.


Recent gains by tech, retail and consumer-oriented issues seemed to have helped the Nasdaq cut its gap with the S&P 500 in terms of year-to-date performance. Through Tuesday, the Nasdaq now boasts a 23.3% advance since Jan. 1 — roughly 140 basis points behind a 24.7% gain by the S&P 500. The Russell 2000 is up 22.9%.


Bitcoin-Palooza
---------------


Bitcoin has captured the global investing audience's attention for real. And in the stock market, companies and exchange traded funds that act as a direct or indirect way to play the digital currency phenomenon are growing in number and size. IBD readers can still invest successfully in related stocks and ETFs by adhering to a few time-tested rules of buying and selling.


Buying right is key.


This means waiting for a [proper buy point](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) to emerge. When bases are forming, a [well-drawn trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) can offer an early entry that may lead to more lucrative gains. But losses can quickly pile up if you chase a stock well after it's gotten extended.



**Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) has gone on a tremendous short-term run. The investment platform for cryptocurrencies offered a very aggressive buy point near 270 as it crossed a narrow trendline that could be drawn from the stock's Aug. 11 high of 294. Since the stock crossed this buy point on Oct. 15, the large cap has risen as much as 36%. Not once has it even touched the short-term 10-day moving average, let alone the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Shares, however, [fell more than 10% after hours on third-quarter results that missed Wall Street's consensus view](https://www.investors.com/news/bitcoin-stocks-coinbase-jumps-with-earnings-due-price-of-bitcoin-near-highs/). Coinbase earned $1.62 a share, up 295% vs. a year earlier.


Indeed, the extreme depth of Coinbase's base, from its debut-session high of 429 to a May 19 low of 208, affirms the extremely volatile nature of newer issues and Bitcoin-related stocks.



Elsewhere in the stock market, **Freshpet** ([FRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRPT)) dove 16% in massive volume following its third quarter results (a net loss of 5 cents per share, with sales up 28% to $107.6 million). The pet care play's sell-off serves as a vital reminder of how trendline buy points — in this case, likely around 152 — do not guarantee a safe entry.


**Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) surged out of a [new cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a 408.08 entry on Tuesday, one day ahead of its third-quarter results.


[The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) in this expert in software application development and work management tools goes up to 428.48. But buying right before earnings is risky.

Stocks Finish Strongly Friday But In Lackluster Volume
=======================================================

Stocks finished high in the day's range Friday as the indexes held above key support lines.


The Nasdaq scored a 0.5% gain after being down 0.6% in the morning. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, and the IBD 50 0.6%.


Volume fell across the board.


The S&P 500 again held above its 50-day moving average, an area which the big-cap index has closed above since mid-April.


The Nasdaq is holding above its 200-day line, but hasn't made a serious run at retaking the 50-day moving average since knifing below the line five weeks ago. Its 50-day line is fading south, which isn't a good sign.


The S&P 500's 50-day line continues to point north.


Overall, the S&P 500 dropped as much as 4% in this correction and is now 1% off its high. The Nasdaq fell almost 10% and is 3% off its April 15 low.


A contrarian investor, looking at all this, would have a hard time deciding what contrarian means in this market. Other signals illustrate the mixed situation:


•The NYSE advance-decline line continues to advance, while the IBD Mutual Fund Index is steadily declining.


•While market leadership shifted to oil and gas stocks in recent weeks, the past two sessions have seen those stocks take hard hits. Elsewhere, few breakouts have made progress. And most of the big one-day moves have been on the downside.


•Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears ratio shows bulls at 55.8% and bears at 19.7%, which would suggest a market prepped to break south. However, the American Association of Individual Investors' sentiment gauge shows bulls at 28.3%, bears at 28.7% and those neutral at 43%.


Granted, the bulls vs. bears ratio reflects the stance of advisers, not individual investors. Pros and individual investors often are out of step. However, neutrality among individual investors isn't associated with major market tops.


What should investors make of this situation?


For IBD-style investors, the tie always goes to the defense. The idea is to buy the best stocks at the best time. No one would argue that an indefinite market is the best time to buy stocks.


Cash remains the best place to be until this market sorts itself out.


For the week, the IBD 50 fell 2.7%, the Nasdaq 1.3% and the S&P 500 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average — which made a record closing high Friday — rose 0.4%, boosted by weekly gains of 3% and 2% in **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), respectively.

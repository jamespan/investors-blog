Nasdaq Drops In Higher Volume, Sinks Market Into Correction
============================================================

Sellers held the upper hand again Wednesday. While a late rebound cut the day's losses, the decline was big enough to warrant a change in the market's outlook.

  

The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both fell 0.4%. On the Nasdaq, the loss reached as high as 1% and the tech-rich index notched a four-week low. Volume lifted a bit on the Nasdaq and edged lower on the NYSE.

  

With the Nasdaq marking another distribution day, including four in the past eight sessions, IBD's Market Pulse shows a current outlook downgrade to "Market in correction."

  

In a correction, the proper strategy is to quickly get off margin, raise cash, cut losses fast in your poor performers and let go of other stocks that threaten to wipe away recent gains.

  

Those who hold big profit cushions in a given stock can decide to hold out, especially if the stock is still in the early to middle stage of its rally cycle. But at some point, one must draw a line in the sand.

  

Judging by the way some leading stocks, including **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)), have struggled following recent breakouts, readers who follow IBD's trading rules have likely already built up some cash in their portfolios.

  

In such a case, cash is not deadweight. If the decline intensifies, the cash is a useful shield.

  

No one can predict the length of size of the new correction. And it's useless to try. But the certain thing is this: The stocks that hold up well amid the current selling pressure should be added to a regular watch list.

  

Some premium-quality stocks, including **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) (No. 9 in this week's Big Cap 20), **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) and **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)), have not fallen much from their highs. Mild declines may lead to new bases and future breakouts.

  

Watch the IBD 50, the Big Cap 20, and the daily Stocks on the Move table for stocks that show unusual strength and light corrections.

  

It would not be surprising to see current and new leaders to spring off base-on-base formations to new highs once the uptrend resumes.

  

Janet Yellen is certainly not the first Federal Reserve chief to voice concern about high equity valuations, as she did Wednesday. Ultimately, the market will go into a deep freeze if the economy does so or if equity prices hit bubble levels.

  

Today, the current pullback feels more like the result of a chorus of disappointing sales outlooks for the next quarter. Blame the soaring dollar in part for that.

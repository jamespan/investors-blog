The stock market played a tenacious game of tug of war Friday, but in the end the bulls prevailed.




The Nasdaq threatened to give back all of its early gains but rallied to close up 0.8%. The large-cap S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 raked in 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Blue chips lagged as the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled for a 0.4% advance.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume.


For the week, the major indexes had a lackluster performance, especially if the results are broken down day by day. Neither the Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 gained more than 0.4% in any single day. And daily losses didn't sink by more than 0.3% on any given day.

Breakouts In The Stock Market
-----------------------------


Breakouts during the week included stocks in groups that mostly said technology: financial software provider **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)); semiconductor equipment maker **Cabot Microelectronics** ([CCMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCMP)); security software firm **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)); photonics maker **Novanta** ([NOVT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOVT)); device visibility and control provider **ForeScout** ([FSCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSCT)); and online jobs platform **Upwork** ([UPWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPWK)).


Upwork is an Oct. 3 initial public offering that is not yet profitable. The stock tried to clear a 23.59 buy point in a first-stage consolidation, but reversed sharply lower Friday following earnings. However, top fund T. Rowe Price New Horizons holds a stake.


Four breakouts during the week were from more prosaic groups: soft drink maker **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)); media company **Gray Television** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)); real estate information provider **CoStar** ([CSGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSGP)); and entertainment tour organizer **Live Nation Entertainment** ([LYV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYV)).


News During The Week
--------------------


News played a role in the stock market last week but it was mostly what didn't happen rather than what did. President Donald Trump abruptly ended talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That left tariff issues with China as the big worry.


On Friday a fair number of stock groups and exchange traded funds staged negative reversals. The Invesco KBW Bank ETF ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)) popped 1.6% in the first 20 minutes of trade but then retreated to a 0.5% gain for the day. But so far this year, the bank ETF is up 18%, outperforming the major indexes.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite powered higher Thursday, even after New York extended its coronavirus shutdown until at least May 15. The Nasdaq closed with a 1.7% gain after advancing as much as 2%, as the current stock market rally continues.




The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged about 0.1% higher, or 33 points. Leading growth stocks traded more in line with the Nasdaq: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) gained 1.6%. Volume on the two main exchanges was mixed vs. Wednesday's session. Nasdaq volume was much higher, while preliminary numbers showed NYSE volume was barely lower. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 lagged badly with a 0.5% fall.


Stock Market Rally Continues
----------------------------


With the new stock market uptrend now two weeks long (IBD [upgraded the outlook into a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) on April 2), investors have seen a tentative uptrend strengthen, as more and more top stocks move up and break out past buy points. Bullishly, the Nasdaq is leading the current stock market rally with tech giants **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) surging to all-time highs Thursday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP041619-227x300.jpg)But discipline is still key. Don't chase extended stocks, but keep an eye on them. Stocks can easily pull back to their recent buy points and support levels for a second buying opportunity. Meanwhile, potential leaders continue to form new bases and approach new entries. If this current stock market rally is real, there will be plenty of time and opportunity to make money.

The coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the U.S., with confirmed cases topping 674,000, along with 34,000 deaths by Thursday, according to [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) data tracker. But the pace of growth continues to slow, creating optimism that the worst of the outbreak has passed. Meanwhile, global Covid-19 cases topped 2.1 million, with over 144,000 deaths.

Breakout Stocks To Watch: Abbott Labs, AMD, Microsoft,
------------------------------------------------------



Top stocks at or near buy points in the current stock market rally include **Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Coronavirus stock leader Abbott Laboratories broke out past a 92.55 buy point in a cup base in heavy volume Thursday after [the company's strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/abt-stock-abbott-earnings-q1-2010-stock-of-the-day/). The 5% buy zone runs up to 97.18. Abbott stock [was featured](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/abt-stock-abbott-earnings-q1-2010-stock-of-the-day/) as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


Chip leader Advanced Micro Devices is moving up the right side of a [cup base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) 59.37 buy point, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). AMD stock is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock idea. Shares gained 3.6% Thursday.


According to Leaderboard commentary, "Advanced Micro Devices is above its 50-day moving average as it forms a cup base. An early entry in this stock could arise as the stock potentially cools off after a torrid run off the 200-day line."


[Dow Jones leader](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) Microsoft stock broke out past a 175.10 buy point in a lopsided double bottom amid a 3% advance. Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line hit a new high](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) Thursday. Microsoft [ranks No. 8](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) on the IBD 50 list. It is also on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) list.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Microsoft stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-microsoft-corp-msft.aspx) has a 98 out of a highest-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the top echelon of growth stocks.


Stock Market Earnings: Intuitive Surgical Higher Late
-----------------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, earnings season is once again upon us. Investors will be focusing on how badly the ongoing coronavirus outbreak is impacting companies' core operations. Others, like Abbott Laboratories, are using the outbreak to expand core businesses.


After the close Thursday, medical stock leader **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) reported [better-than-expected](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/isrg-stock-intuitive-surgical-earnings-q1-2020/) earnings and sales results. The stock moved up less than 1% in the after-hours session to about 514. Intuitive Surgical closed at 510.44, down 0.1% during the normal trading session. The RS line is just off new highs, as the stock trades just below its 50-day moving average line.

The stock market ended higher but well off session highs Thursday, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen established that the U.S. government is ready to take "additional action if warranted" to stabilize the banking sector.




Even as the stock market correction lingers, there are a number of leading stocks that are breaking out and moving higher, including **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), Dow Jones tech titan **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) cybersecurity leader **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)).


Economic Data, Earnings
-----------------------


Ahead of Thursday's opening bell, the Labor Department's weekly first-time unemployment claims fell to 191,000 vs. 192,000 in the previous week. They were expected to rise to 195,000, according to Econoday estimates.


Further, the Commerce Department said February new home sales fell more than expected to 640,000 vs. January's 670,000. Economists had forecast a drop to 645,000.


**Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)), **Darden Restaurants** ([DRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRI)), **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)) and **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) were earnings movers Thursday.


Chewy shares dropped 7.5%. Darden stock cut losses to 0.4%, holding just below a 152.18 flat-base entry. General Mills shares rallied 2.9%. And KBH stock advanced 7.5%, moving closer to a 41.02 buy point. Homebuilders displayed relative strength, although many pared gains.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP032323-274x300.jpg)On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rallied as much as 1.5% and 1.8%, respectively, before closing with modest gains of 0.2% and 0.3%. Both briefly turned lower in afternoon trade before a late-day bounce. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shrank an early 2.5% gain into a 1% rise. The small-cap Russell 2000 was a laggard, reversing 0.4% lower.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 1.2%, closing right at its 50-day moving average. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **On** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) surged another 12%. Shares are now more than 25% above a cup-with-handle's 24.21 buy point following the [March 21 breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/news/nke-stock-nike-earnings-q3-consumer-demand-inflation/).


Despite Thursday's rebound, IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains "market in correction." Insufficient gains Thursday prevented a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). So investors are still waiting for that key signal to indicate the market trend has shifted.


Even though the general market in still in a correction, the action in individual growth stocks is still improving. So there are some opportunities to increase exposure, especially if market conditions continue to improve. Until the market proves itself more, exposure should be kept between 0% and 20%.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Fortinet, Meta, Microsoft, Palo Alto
-------------------------------------------------------------------



Fortinet shares climbed 3.3% Thursday, breaking out past a 63.12 buy point in a flat base. The 5% buy zone goes up to 66.28.


The stock's continued rise comes after shares gapped up in reaction to [fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ftnt-stock-fortinet-earnings-fortinet-stock-q42022/) on Feb. 7. During the quarter, revenue climbed 33% from the year-ago quarter to $1.28 billion, just below analyst views. Adjusted earnings came in at 44 cents a share, up 76%. That beat estimates, as did billings.


Fortinet is a [major provider of cybersecurity software](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ftnt-stock-fortinet-cybersecurity-software-near-buy-point/) used by businesses to build firewalls, intrusion detection systems and antivirus programs.


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Meta Platforms rose 2.2% Thursday, closing near the top of the 5% buy area that runs up to 207.12, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Like social media rivals, Meta is struggling due to a sharp reduction in advertising revenue as clients squirm over recession fears and higher interest rates. This is happening as it spends billions of dollars on a risky bet to build the "metaverse," a virtual reality world that has yet to take hold.


[Dow Jones giant Microsoft](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/msft-stock-flirts-with-buy-point-on-ai-news/) is trying to break out past a flat base's 276.86 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), but is having some trouble decisively clearing the entry. The RS line spiked to a new high last week, a bullish signal. Microsoft shares were up 2% Thursday, closing just above the entry.


Microsoft shares surged last week after the company announced that it is [adding artificial intelligence tools](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-fueled-by-artificial-intelligence-in-office-apps/) to its popular Office productivity applications. That follows the company's investments in AI startup OpenAI, the firm behind the buzzy ChatGPT application.

IBD Leaderboard Stock Retakes Entry
-----------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock Palo Alto Networks gave up its cup-with-handle's 192.94 buy point during Wednesday's decline. But the stock recovered that entry Thursday, so the 5% buy area runs up to 202.59. The RS line is at new highs.


Through acquisitions, Palo Alto Networks has expanded into endpoint security and vulnerability management. Endpoint tools detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.


In addition, Palo Alto Networks has pushed into a market called Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE. The security tools support distributed workers and branch offices.

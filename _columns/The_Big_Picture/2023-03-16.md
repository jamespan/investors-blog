Stock Market Surges On First Republic Rescue Plan; AMD, Meta, Nvidia Above Buy Points
======================================================================================

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the stock market higher Thursday, as [big U.S. banks deposited $30 billion in a joint rescue](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-morgan-stanley-and-others-in-talks-to-bolster-first-republic-4f9eeb76) of regional bank **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)), which closed 10% higher after crashing as much as 36% at the opening bell.




The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) reversed 3.5% higher, rebounding from Wednesday's 1.6% loss. It's still on pace for a weekly loss of nearly 9%. **Western Alliance** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) advanced 14%, while **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) was up 4.5%.


Further, **Credit Suisse** ([CS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CS)), which sparked early stock market losses Wednesday, ended the volatile session unchanged after [receiving a $53 billion lifeline](https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-shares-plunge-as-bank-storm-spreads-to-europe-7251349d) from the Swiss central bank.


As the stock market correction lingers over banking fears, there are a few leading stocks that are showing resilience, including **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) heavyweight **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).



Economic Data
-------------


Ahead of Thursday's opening bell, the Labor Department's weekly first-time unemployment claims fell to 192,000, much lower than the expected decrease to 205,000 vs. 211,000 in the previous week. Low weekly jobless claims continue to reflect sustained strength in the labor market, which is fueling market fears that the Federal Reserve will keep hiking interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher, at 3.58% Thursday.


Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's housing starts rose more than expected, to 1.450 million in February vs. 1.309 million in January. Housing permits, a measure of upcoming construction activity, also rose more than anticipated, to 1.524 million in February vs. January's 1.339 million.


Finally, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Index remained in contraction, with a -23.2 reading, slightly up from February's -24.3.


Earnings Results
----------------


On the earnings front,Â **Academy Sports & Outdoors** ([ASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASO)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) were key earnings movers Thursday.


Academy surged more than 8%, breaking out past a flat base's 63.99 buy point after mixed Q4 results. Adobe jumped 5.9% after beating [Wall Street's sales and earnings targets](http://investors.com/news/technology/adbe-stock-adobe-beats-fiscal-first-quarter-targets/) for its fiscal first quarter and guiding higher for the full year.



On the downside, Dollar General slipped 3% after its [Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/five-below-stock-pulls-back-ahead-of-earnings-dollar-general-on-deck/), while Five Below sank 1.4% after reporting a [disappointing full-year outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/five-below-stock-pulls-back-ahead-of-earnings-dollar-general-on-deck/).


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2% and the S&P 500 advanced 1.8%. The Nasdaq composite surged 2.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 shed recent weakness, climbing 1.4%.


Volume contracted on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. the prior session, raising a red flag on the up day.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed 2.7% but is still below its 50-day line. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Lantheus** ([LNTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNTH)) broke out past a 75.20 buy point in a cup with handle. The stock was [Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/lnth-stock-the-small-player-making-a-big-impact-in-prostate-cancer/)


Despite short-term gains, IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains "market in correction." Lower volume prevented the Day 4 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), so investors are still waiting for that key signal to indicate the market trend has shifted.


Thursday's action was bullish despite the lack of decisive volume, as a number of leading stocks continue to set up and break out past correct buy points. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq moved above a trendline that connects a few highs going back to Feb. 2, another sign of strengthening market conditions.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: AMD, Meta, Nvidia
------------------------------------------------



Advanced Micro broke out past an 89.04 buy point in a flat base during this week's gains, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares closed Thursday out of the buy range that topped out at 93.49. [AMD was featured](https://www.investors.com/research/amd-stock-nears-latest-buy-point-chipotle-boasts-rising-profit-estimates/) in Wednesday's IBD Screen Of The Day column.


In early February, the [chipmaker reported stronger-than-expected Q4](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-chipmaker-beats-q4-targets/) data-center chip sales. But AMD tempered that news with soft guidance for the current period.



[Facebook parent Meta Platforms](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/meta-stock-gets-boost-from-layoffs-efficiency/) broke out above a flat base's 197.26 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) during Wednesday's 1.9% rise. Meta shares were up 3.6% Thursday, in the buy range that runs up to 207.12.

Like social media rivals, Meta is struggling due to a sharp reduction in advertising revenue as clients squirm over macroeconomic concerns, recession fears and higher interest rates. This is happening as it spends billions of dollars on a risky bet to build the "metaverse," a virtual reality world that has yet to take hold.

[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Nvidia finished Thursday above the 5% buy zone of a 230.59 buy point. The buy zone went up to 242.12.


Nvidia has long served as a leader in computer graphics processors (GPUs) used in video games and other applications, but it is also making inroads in the virtualization, data-center, AI, supercomputing and automotive markets. Analysts expect Nvidia to play a key role in powering the metaverse.


NVDA shares surged 14% on Feb. 23 after Q4 earnings beat views and the chip giant guided slightly higher on Q1 revenue.

Stocks Slide, Face A Key Test As 2021 Starts On A Bad Note
===========================================================

The stock market got a lousy start to 2021, as indexes dripped with losses and were left facing a technical test that could determine the market's direction.




Indexes broke the gentle uptrends they carried into the end of 2020 with sharp declines Monday. Main indexes slid more than 1% and some sector indexes fared much worse.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 tumbled 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 1.3%. The Dow Jones transportation average skidded 2.2%, the S&P industrial sector lost more than 2%, and the S&P real estate sector lost more than 3%.


Three sectors that are moving on expectations that the economy will eventually recover from coronavirus did relatively better: Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 0.2% while consumer discretionary and health care fell less than 1%.


![MP010421](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP010421-185x300.jpg)The S&P 500 and Dow actually made new highs early Monday before sellers arrived in droves. The three major indexes sank to their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). That's important, because indexes found support at that level in December.


Critical Test For Stock Market
------------------------------


That line now becomes a critical test for the stock market. If indexes can rebound from their 21-day lines, Monday's sell-off might be nothing more than a transitory drop. The market showed an ability to bounce back from single-day sell-offs multiple times as it climbed to record highs.


But a drop below the 21-day lines would require investors to take more precautions. Sharp declines in a number of leading stocks added to the bearish tone on Wall Street.


In a positive sign, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow all closed above their 21-day averages and pared some losses starting around midday.


Distribution For Stock Market
-----------------------------


Volume swelled Monday on the NYSE and Nasdaq. That's to be expected after a New Year's preholiday session last Thursday. Still, higher volume caused a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The S&P 500 now has five such days of higher-volume declines, which is making market risk increase.


Declining stocks led advancers by 12-to-5 on the NYSE and by 9-to-7 on the Nasdaq.


At 0.64, the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) was surprisingly low for a day of widespread losses. You would have expected options players to be making more bearish bets than bullish ones, but call (bullish) volume prevailed. The market was quite optimistic in the final weeks of 2020, and [speculative froth is a danger for investors](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-2021-could-be-bumpier-than-you-think/).


Testing A Key Support Level
---------------------------



The IBD 50 fell 1.7%, underperforming a weak market. A number of stocks in the index slid to their 50-day moving average, including **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers** ([RBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBA)). **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) closed below its 50-day line, extending last week's selling.


[In IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) dropped to the 50-day line. Just like the major indexes face a test at their 21-day lines, these stocks need to hold at their own [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) suffered a [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/) after it erased a 15% gain from its breakout at 1,112.51.


Although it wasn't clear what cause the stock market to sell off, the two Georgia Senate runoff election Tuesday are now considered a tossup. If Democrats win, it would give the party control of the House and the Senate. The stock market had expected Republicans to hold a slim majority in the Senate, and a divided government was considered a positive for stocks.

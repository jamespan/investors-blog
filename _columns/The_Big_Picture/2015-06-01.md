Major averages scored modest gains Monday but ended off session highs as sellers came into the market during the last hour of trading. The Nasdaq added close to 0.3%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The IBD 50 outperformed, rising 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Friday's levels.

  

On the NYSE, advancing stocks had a tiny edge over decliners. For the Nasdaq, it was the opposite, with losers holding a slight edge over winners.

  

Market breadth has deteriorated in recent days for the Nasdaq and NYSE. The NYSE advance/decline line (see S&P 500 chart on Page B2) has been trending lower in recent days, but don't get too bearish because of it. Keep in mind that the Nasdaq's advance/decline line hit a new high in mid-May. It was a sign of strength at the time and still helps the bull case.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffered a mild distribution day Friday â€” mild in that volume was below average and damage was limited. The Nasdaq shows one other higher-volume decline (on May 26) and a stalling day (on May 20), but that's not enough to cause serious problems for a rally that was confirmed on May 14.

  

So why is it such a challenging environment to make money in top-rated growth stocks? For starters, fresh institutional money isn't exactly rolling in from the sidelines. That's not a surprise, since we're several years into a bull market.

  

Because of generally slack buying demand, several recent breakouts have been lackluster. After modest gains, many names have pulled back close to their buy points. Low-volume pullbacks to buy points are constructive, but when big volume is behind the selling, a pullback can get problematic.

  

**Martin Marietta**'s ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) breakout looked good for a while, but big sellers have been in the stock lately. Meanwhile, **Mallinckrodt** ([MNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNK)) has been trying to clear a cup-with-handle buy point of 130.35, but price and volume have been lackluster. This is typical price action when institutional investors are hesitant to put money to work.

  

In this type of environment, it's OK to have some exposure to stocks. Just don't be overly aggressive.

  

A look inside the IBD 50 reveals at least one compelling setup. A three-weeks-tight pattern is in place for **Zebra Technologies** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)). The buy point is 111.55.

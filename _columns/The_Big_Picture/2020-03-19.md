Stock Market Rally Attempt Kicks Off With Nasdaq's Strong Gains; Stock Market Leaders Amazon, Netflix Lead

The Nasdaq composite snapped back from Wednesday's sharp losses in a volatile trading session Thursday, as the coronavirus stock market correction again tried to find a bottom. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed with a 2.3% gain after rising as much as 5%, kicking off a new rally attempt after the stock market correction hit fresh lows on Wednesday.




Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rallied 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ascended 0.9%, or 188 points. The small-cap Russell 2000 led the way with a 6.8% gain, but remained more than 40% off its 52-week high. Leading growth stocks lagged, showing modest gains: The IBD 50 rose 0.8%. Volume on both main exchanges was lower than Wednesday's session.


New Rally Attempt Despite Worsening Stock Market Correction
-----------------------------------------------------------


On Feb. 25, IBD [downgraded the stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) to a market in correction and the Nasdaq tumbled as much as 25% to Wednesday's low price from the closing price on Feb. 25. Obviously, no market observers knew how far the stock market would drop, or how long it would last, which is the point of remaining out of the market until a follow-through signals a potential bottom.


It can be alluring to try to buy a stock on the way down, but more often than not, the stock continues lower. Wait for a follow-through day and only buy the top growth stocks breaking out past proper buy points to help mitigate risk.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP031920-262x300.jpg)On Wednesday, the major indexes plunged to new correction lows, ending the previous one-day rally attempt that began on Tuesday.


Thursday serves as Day 1 of a new rally attempt. [Follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) typically occur on Day 4 or later, so the confirmation of a new uptrend could be as soon as Tuesday.


Follow-through days don't always work, but they've been seen at every [stock market bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) in the past. If there is a follow-though day next week, make sure to slowly wade in and out of the market. If the uptrend proves to be a real, then there will be plenty of time to make progress. If the uptrend is short-lived, then you won't get too hurt as you gradually scale into the market.


Until a follow-through happens, investors should be on the sidelines and in cash. But don't tune out. Instead, focus on updating your watchlists of potential stock market leaders. Currently, there aren't very many constructive formations among top growth stocks due to the sharp market weakness, but that can change very quickly.

Amazon reclaimed its long-term 200-day line Thursday with a nearly 3% advance. This week, the [company boosted](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-plans-to-hire-100000-raise-wages-to-address-coronavirus-impact/) hiring to help with the surging demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Amazon stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) displays a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/)


Netflix Thursday surged more than 5% as it regained its 200-day line. Shares remain about 6.5% below their 50-day line, a key resistance level. [Netflix stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netflix-inc-nflx.aspx) also has a 99 IBD Composite Rating.


Software leader Veeva Systems extended a win streak to three sessions Thursday with a 5.1% gain. Shares closed just above their 50-day line, but remain below the 200-day moving average.


Remember, all new buys are considered very risky during stock market corrections, but these leaders are exhibiting tremendous strength in a tumultuous market environment.

Indexes Pare Losses; 3 Places Where The Stock Market May Pause
===============================================================

The stock market erased most losses Monday to close modestly lower, as indexes find themselves within eyeball distance of record highs.




The Nasdaq was down as much as 0.6% and the S&P 500 0.4%. But steady gains in the afternoon reduced losses to 0.1% for both indexes.


In doing so, the indexes closed near session highs. That's become a favorable trend this month, as sellers work the early part of the session but often yield to buyers later in the day. That's the classic form of a bull market.


3 Possible Stopping Points
--------------------------


Whenever indexes reach new highs, sellers could emerge. Market milestones sometimes cause big-money investors to sell into strength. Prior highs often act as natural levels of resistance.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP051519-261x300.jpg)Investors also should watch a couple of important numbers on the indexes. The Nasdaq is testing 8,000, and crossing that major number also could bring some selling.


The S&P 500 is near 2900, from where it has a short stroll to a record high. Consider 2900 as a third possible stopping point for the market's advance.


Even if the market pauses, there's little reason to believe a major top is at hand. Distribution in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq is at acceptable levels. The March employment report gave Wall Street more faith in the U.S. economy. Multiple asset classes are rallying. Commodities are up 19.5%, global equities up 14.7% and high-yield bonds up 7.8% this year, Wells Fargo Investment Institute President Darrell Cronk said in a report Wednesday.


Leading stocks are largely acting well, too. The IBD 50 topped the general market Monday with a 0.3% increase. **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) was the most interesting member, after it broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in heavy volume.


Few leading stocks show any fatigue. Even a stock like **Gray Television** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)), which is in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), is retreating normally after a strong breakout. It remains above its buy point.


Only a few stocks are struggling to break out. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) could not find traction above a 371.59 buy point and is now below the 50-day moving average. The video streaming company — which now faces a big rival in **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) — will announce earnings Tuesday after the close.


The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, closed a fraction higher. Part of that was because of relative strength in major Nasdaq stocks such as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) — all of which closed slightly higher.


Other Stock Market Metrics
--------------------------


Volume fell from Friday's totals. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell nearly 0.4% and continues to underperform the main indexes.


Financials were one of Monday' weakest sectors, with [earnings reports coming in mixed](https://www.investors.com/news/goldman-sachs-earnings-q1-2019-goldman-sachs-stock-citigroup-stock/) for the major banks. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) fell 3.8% and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) was nearly flat after both companies missed revenue expectations.


The [earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) remains light, but expect it to get busy in the next few weeks. Expectations are generally low for first-quarter results, and the question is how well companies can beat the lower bar. Even in the best circumstances there's risk with earnings reports, but investors can take controlled risks using options.


Basically, investors buy call options on companies before their earnings reports. If the stock surges, the option becomes profitable. If the stock flops, the risk is limited to the cost of the option. [IBD's Earnings Preview column](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/netflix-stock-sets-up-ahead-of-quarterly-earnings-report/) has more on this strategy.

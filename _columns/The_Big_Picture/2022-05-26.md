Stock Market Makes This Bullish Shift; 3 Top Stocks That Look Intriguing
=========================================================================

The stock market finished sharply higher Thursday in bullish action that left the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite on track to finally end seven-week losing streaks.




Three stocks to buy and watch after Thursday's positive action are [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)), [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)) and **ZIM Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)).


The 10-year Treasury yield closed at 2.75%, snapping a two-day losing streak, as it attempts to find support around its 50-day moving average. On Wednesday, the 10-year yield hit its lowest level since mid-April.


On the earnings front, chip giant **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) sold off sharply Thursday morning after [reporting a weak sales outlook in the current quarter.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-chipmaker-guides-low-on-sales/) But Nvidia shares quickly recovered, reversing up 5.2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP052622-273x300.jpg)Elsewhere, **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)), **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) were key earnings movers Thursday.


[SNOW shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snowflake-stock-snowflake-earnings-q12022/) cut their losses to 4.5%. Williams-Sonoma jumped 13.1%. [Discount retailers Dollar General and Dollar Tree surged](https://www.investors.com/news/dollar-tree-earnings-discounters-after-walmart-target/) 13.7% and 21.9%, respectively. Macy's soared more than 19% after its [strong first-quarter results and raised guidance.](https://www.investors.com/news/macys-stock-retailer-bucks-trend-with-higher-guidance-stock-surges/) The favorable retail reports marked a shift from last week's dour reports from a number of major retailers.


New Stock Market Uptrend
------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.6%, extending a win streak to five sessions. The S&P 500 advanced 2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 2.7%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 2.2%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be slightly lower on the NYSE.


Just four days after the [Nasdaq undercut its May 12 low](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-nasdaq-close-mixed-amid-late-reversal-is-the-correction-in-bitcoin-over/) — which sent IBD's market outlook back into "market in correction" — the Nasdaq staged a bullish [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) Thursday with its big gain in higher volume. This means our current outlook goes to a confirmed uptrend, ending the market correction.


Investors have the green light to start buying leading stocks breaking out past correct [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It should put your portfolio and mindset in sync with the stock market action by gradually committing capital to leading stocks.


Use each purchase as feedback on the current strength of the market rally. Don't panic if you miss the first couple of breakouts. If the stock market uptrend is real, there will be plenty of time to buy stocks and make money. This is an important strategy because prior follow-throughs have failed this year.

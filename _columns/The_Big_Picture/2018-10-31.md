Stock Market News: Indexes Up Solidly Again As Growth Stocks Lead The Charge
=============================================================================

The stock market raced higher again Wednesday after bullish gains Tuesday, but sellers knocked indexes off highs during the final hour of trading. Stock market news was abundant as earnings reports stayed on the front burner. Earnings winners included FANG stock **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)), **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)) and **FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE)).




After Tuesday's 1.6% gain, the Nasdaq composite jumped 2% Wednesday. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 1%. Nasdaq volume came in higher than Tuesday. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume lower.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was a nice gainer in the Dow, up 2.6%, ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. Its latest pullback has been relatively tame as the stock sits just below its 50-day moving average. Apple was featured as a possible call-option trade, along with **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-starbucks-corp-sbux.htm)), in IBD's latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/option-trading-starbucks-apple-earnings/) column.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MP103118-233x300.jpg)It certainly was a spooky October for the indexes. The Nasdaq composite slumped 9.2%, the S&P 500 lost 6.9% and the Dow gave back 5%. Indeed, it's hard to look at monthly charts of the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq and be confident that the indexes could be close to confirming a new uptrend. But it's not out of the question, especially when follow-through days tend to come when they're least expected.


Crude oil also had a dismal October. U.S. crude oil futures fell 1.3% Wednesday to settle at $65.31 a barrel, capping a monthly decline of around 11%.


Is A New Bull Nigh?
-------------------


Stock market bulls are encouraged by two days of strong gains. But in the end, Wednesday was only the second day of a rally attempt. That means the stock market still has to prove itself more. It's likely that some shorts are still covering their positions after the S&P 500 slumped 3.9% last week. A good game plan now is to wait for the short-covering to run its course, then look for another big percentage gain for the indexes in higher volume.


Keep in mind, it's best to see a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) occur on the fourth day or later of a rally attempt, but if indexes rally powerfully again Thursday in higher volume, it could be enough to spur a change in outlook.


It's important to note that even if a new uptrend is confirmed sooner rather than later, actionable stock charts remain in short supply. This begs the question: If indexes do confirm a new rally sooner rather than later, what's out there to buy?


Stock Market News
-----------------


Wednesday's session yielded plenty of big movers, but the gains did little to help the charts. There were two exceptions, though.


**FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE)), which gapped up powerfully on earnings, broke out over an 18.16 handle entry. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) component **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)), meanwhile, gapped above its 50-day line, also on strong earnings.


Twenty-one IBD 50 components rose 2% or more Wednesday, but damaged charts are still the norm. Top gainers included **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) with gains of at least 7%, but all three are still below their 50-day moving averages.


Outside the IBD 50, earnings reports fueled nice gains for **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), but both stocks remain far off their highs with significant overhead resistance. Overhead resistance is selling pressure that's seen when a stock tries to rally back after a sharp decline. As a stocks tries to rally back, it's met with selling pressure from those who bought at higher prices looking to break even on their investment.


In economic news, private payrolls increased by 227,000 in October, according to ADP, well above the consensus estimate of 178,000. The data come ahead of Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up by around 190,000.

title: Bear Market Is Now A Reality For Growth Stocks

U.S. stock indexes pushed further south Friday, as awareness grew that the bears and bulls were approaching the battle much differently.




Bulls have brought a roll of duct tape to the fight, hoping to hold things together. Bears meanwhile are taking a chainsaw to formerly tall-standing stocks.


Take a look at the wreckage.


**Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) is 42% off its high; **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), 41%; **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), 33%; **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)), 30%; **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), 32%; **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), 29%; **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), 19%; and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), 18%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MP102618-262x300.jpg)Granted, there also are some stocks holding together fairly well. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is only 7% off its high. **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) is 5% off its high and basing.


A few stocks have even made new highs in the past few weeks. They include **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)), **McCormick** ([MKC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKC)) and **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)).


But those 20%-plus corrections for quality stocks do not bode well for the market.


On the growth-stocks side, the Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) has declined as much as 22% since Oct. 1.


That's bear market territory, though the major indexes haven't declined that much yet. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have fallen as much as 13% and 10.6%, respectively.


New Uptrend Looks Unlikely For Now
----------------------------------


If the story were stock rotation, investors could expect some sharp gains in the indexes. That hasn't happened in a convincing fashion yet.


New money in new places might eventually happen. But for now, individual investors should look for opportunities to raise more cash and let the money remain on the sidelines.


The chance for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), signaling a new uptrend is underway, looks nearly impossible before this month is wrapped up.


In the meantime, the world has its own challenges, but they could spell opportunities.


Brazil's Election Sunday
------------------------


Brazil will conduct a runoff election Sunday. Right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro is expected to defeat leftist Fernando Haddad.


If Bolsonaro wins, he is expected to support pro-business policies, though his orientation is more populist than free market and free trade.


Brazil's stock market has gained about 10% this year. The Bovespa index has risen in three of the past four weeks, perhaps in anticipation of Bolsonaro's likely win.


Earnings season will continue in the coming week.

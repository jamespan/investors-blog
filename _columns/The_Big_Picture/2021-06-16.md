title: Stock Market Trims Losses After Fed Sizes Up Inflation; Watch These Strong Industry Groups

When the Federal Reserve talks, the stock market still listens. And for the bulls, Wednesday's broad decline could have hurt a lot more.




Yet the midafternoon sell-off in equities softened by day's end after the U.S. central bank indicated that [two rate hikes are getting more likely in 2023](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-taper-timing-interest-rate-hikessandp-500/), and that they could arrive at an earlier schedule than thought.


The Nasdaq composite fell a little more than 0.2%. Given that the tech-fortified index had dropped as much as 1.2% following the announcement at 2 p.m. ET, the way this index ended was comforting.


Other key indexes mostly followed suit. The S&P trimmed its early loss of just over 1% to 0.5%. Small caps outperformed. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF edged just 0.2% lower. Over the past three sessions, it's given up less than 0.8%.


Notice on a daily chart how both the S&P 500 and small-cap ETF held above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Ditto for the Nasdaq 100, down less than 0.4%.



With volume rising vs. Tuesday's level, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 chalked up a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). The total count over the past 25 trading sessions, however, remains manageable for a market that IBD returned to the status of "confirmed uptrend" on June 4. The May 11 distribution day on the S&P 500 fell off the count due to time lapsed.


One of the notable changes in the Fed's view on the economy? Inflation is definitely gearing higher. It now sees a key gauge showing core prices going up 3% this year, vs. a prior 2% forecast.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP_4x3_061621-261x300.jpg)"Of course, with a strong economy, recovering labor market and price pressures, although largely transitory, inflation will likely settle at a level above the last decade, and it shouldn't be a shock to see rate expectations move forward," Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, told IBD in an email note. "If anything, this should help anchor inflation expectations around 2%."


Government Bonds Still Affect The Stock Market
----------------------------------------------


Michael Reynolds, VP of investment strategy at wealth management firm Glenmede, thinks the Fed will "likely taper its bond purchases through 2022 and perhaps consider a gradual increase of the federal funds rate either in the back half of 2023 or early 2024."


"A measured and well-communicated deceleration (and ultimate removal) of monetary accommodation should not be disruptive to markets, as long as growth and inflation unfold as expected," he added.


The Fed also bumped up the interest it pays on required and excess reserve balances by 5 basis points to 0.15% effective Thursday. This action is likely to help lift the fed funds rate, or the cost of overnight loans by the central bank to major lenders.


The yield on long-dated government bonds spiked higher. Cboe data showed the key U.S. Treasury 10-year note rose 7 basis points to 1.57%.


That tops the current dividend yield on the S&P 500 of 1.36%.


In terms of market internals, keep an eye on the medical sector. Lately, IBD's [new highs list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jun-15-2021/) has seen this vast area of the economy lead the stock market in terms of stocks marking new 52-week or all-time highs. (You can see the list updated daily and separated into sectors at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has kept a solid upward trend for more than four weeks. A sudden drop would be bearish.

Meanwhile, bullishness among pundits is elevated, but not excessive.

[That level is still well below this year's peak](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/).

Top Stocks Outperform Market Indexes; How Will The Presidential Election Affect Future Returns?
================================================================================================

The stock market bears might have described Tuesday's action as milquetoast. Or meh.




But the bulls could rightfully differ — especially when you consider how top stocks are generally doing.


Either way you view the market, a budding rebound in equities, particularly in the growth areas of the market, is still in force. But investors may have to wait a while before a new uptrend gets confirmation.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), a useful weather vane for top stocks, struck a fourth straight gain. The ETF backed off its session high of 37.42, yet still gained 0.3%.


After Monday's spirited rebound, it felt like equity trading desks mostly skipped to the sidelines and rushed for shelter, ahead of a widely anticipated first evening of debates to determine the next U.S. president. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq chipped off only a small fraction of the prior day's 1.9% advance, down just 0.3%. Yet as the Market Pulse table shows, multiple Nasdaq-listed companies relished hearty institutional demand.


Why Top Stocks May Keep Thriving
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP_092920-203x300.jpg)Volume fell on both main exchanges from Monday's totals.


Weakness in the lagging sectors of the market — think fossil fuels, airline, steel, lodging, money center banks — certainly did not help the cause of the broader indexes. Yet the S&P 500 also enjoyed solid action in software, computer, telecom and select medical industry groups. The large-cap benchmark fell 0.5%. That's less than a third of the 1.6% rally seen Monday.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) edged 0.4% lower.


Certainly, from a technical point of view, it's disappointing to see the S&P 500 stumble in its attempt to retake the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). It gave up support at this key intermediate-term price level on Sept. 18, just three days before IBD downgraded the outlook for stocks to "[market in correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-another-hit-apple-amazon-netflix-slump/)."


Yet it makes sense to see the important index take a break after going on a roughly 3.5% advance over the prior three sessions. Plus, other sector indexes fared worse on Tuesday. The Dow Jones transportation average surrendered 1.2%.


At 3335, the S&P 500 stands less than 7% below its all-time peak of 3588.


What Top Stocks Do
------------------


Companies such as [Leaderboard name](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), solar energy firm **JinkoSolar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) are now trading well past a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Yet many others on key lists including the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) are triggering [follow-on entry points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Or they're forming [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


True, in a market in correction, new buys should be avoided. But small or tiny new positions can give you very important feedback on how top stocks are doing right now.



Meanwhile, small-cap **Axonics Modulation** ([AXNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXNX)) staged a [fresh breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past 46.25 and commanded early attention in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A). The company represents new technologies to help those suffering from an overactive bladder. [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) identified the stock's relative strength line as hitting a new high, earning a spot on the [Blue Dot list](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/).


Meanwhile, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), coronavirus vaccine developer **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) and **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) are making efforts to build new patterns that could set up new breakouts. Watch the slope of their [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/). A rising line means a stock is doing better than the S&P 500, even on down days.


How Do Elections Impact Stock Returns?
--------------------------------------


As President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden square off at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland at 9 p.m. ET, you've likely seen numerous opinions on how a president may have a certain effect on certain sectors. That could very well be true.


But Glenmede, which manages more than $41 billion in assets for high-net-worth clients, endowments and other large investors, concluded that the overall stock market return from election results to the next election actually show that it does not matter who gets a seat in the Oval Office. The investment firm looked at large-cap stock returns going back to 1872. It found that returns for four-year presidential cycles are generally within one percentage point of the long-term average.


"What really matters is the fundamentals. The election is a nonevent for long-term investors," Michael Reynolds, Glenmede's investment strategy officer, told IBD. "Equities are going to be your best bet for risk adjusted returns in the long term."


Reynolds and his team sliced the data based on winning political party and who controlled Congress. They found no meaningful difference.


Glenmede, using data obtained from various sources including location data on Android-based smartphones, also notes that using early March as a starting point, the U.S. economy has recovered roughly 75% of its lost activity. The "Glenmede Reopening Index" shows an even bigger recovery in spending (95% of lost activity regained), while moving from home to shops or other commercial venues is at 60%.


Seek This In Election Results
-----------------------------


Veteran Wall Street economist Ed Yardeni told clients in a recent note that the stock market will likely do better "if the election delivers two more years of gridlock no matter who wins the White House."


The Economist, banking on research from a pair of U.S. professors on past election data, notes that debates have far less an impact on voters since televised debates began in 1960. Why? TV and the internet have allowed voters to get to know candidates a lot more, well before debates begin.


"We estimate, from past contests, that the chances of an eight-point swing to the incumbent after the debates have been roughly one in 20. In other words, there is only a 5% chance that the debates could erase Mr. Biden's lead," the U.K.-based magazine wrote recently.

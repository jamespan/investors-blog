When the Federal Reserve talks, the stock market always listens.




The Fed concluded its two-day meeting Wednesday, but the Nasdaq didn't like what it heard and reversed lower after getting resistance at its 21-day exponential moving average again.


Fed Chairman Jerome Powell didn't sway much from his recent dovish script, acknowledging an uncertain path ahead for the U.S. economy. He also said that the federal funds rate will stay at a range of 0% to 0.25% through 2023. Inflation is seen rising to 2% and unemployment falling to 4% by the end of 2023.


Oil and gas-related groups outperformed as U.S. crude oil futures settled at $40.16 a barrel, up 4.9%. Oil was strong after U.S. government data showed a larger-than-expected weekly drop in supplies.


Transportation stocks, homebuilders and financial stocks also outperformed. There's not much to like in the energy sector and financial sector, but homebuilders continue to look strong, with **MDC Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)), **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), among others, making solid first tests of their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/).


Indexes Fade After Fed Statement
--------------------------------

The Nasdaq lost 1.25% and closed at its session low. Volume came in lower than Tuesday, so the index avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). The S&P 500 fell 0.5% in higher volume, giving the index its sixth distribution day since Aug. 27 and fourth since Sept. 3. The Dow Jones eked out a 0.1% gain, and the Russell 2000 added 0.9%. The small-cap index is up 3.7% for the week.


The Nasdaq composite is holding support at the 50-day moving average. That's the good news. But the leading index is still having trouble at its 21-day exponential moving average, which is nearly converged with the 10-day line. For the Nasdaq, a strong move above its Sept. 10 intraday high would strengthen its technical picture. The S&P 500 briefly topped its Sept. 10 intraday high, but it also reversed lower, closing below its 21-day line.

The stock market uptrend remains under pressure. It's still OK to buy stocks, but new buys should be small to start, and with tighter stops. Buying breakouts is also getting trickier. Just look at the price action of **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), which broke out powerfully Tuesday over an 84.10 buy point. TSM stock slumped 3% Wednesday, closing below the buy point.


Stock market bulls were encouraged to see a big drop in bullish sentiment among newsletter writers surveyed by Investors Intelligence. The bulls dropped to 54.8% from 59% the prior week and 61.5% the week before that. The 61.5% came just ahead of a sharp pullback for the indexes that saw the Nasdaq plunge 10% in three sessions. The Investors Intelligence survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms. Excessive bullishness has been seen at market tops and excessive bearishness has been seen at market bottoms.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


In other stock market news, two widely anticipated [IPOs](https://www.investors.com/iponews) debuted Wednesday with some euphoric buying. Warren Buffett-backed **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) more than doubled after pricing last night at 120. Shares closed at 253.93, up 112%. Snowflake shows big sales growth in recent quarters amid strong demand for its cloud-based, data warehousing platform.


Israeli software firm **JFrog** ([FROG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FROG)) also soared after pricing last night at 44. Shares closed at 64.79, up 47%.

Rather than chase an IPO, it's best to wait for an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) to form. China-based real estate firm **KE Holdings** ([BEKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEKE)) was added to [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Wednesday when it soared out of an IPO base. Shares jumped 12% to 60.72, good for a breakout over a 54.70 buy point. KE is very liquid with a market capitalization of more than $60 billion and a 50-day average volume of around 6.9 million shares.


When it comes to action in market-leading growth stocks, it's a mixed picture at best. Big stock market leaders like **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) are below their 10-week lines.


But weakness in these four names doesn't mean the stock market is about to roll over, especially since there's a big crop of leaders that are holding above buy points and their 10-week lines. They include **West Pharmaceuticals** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)). Alibaba and Salesforce are [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/).


Meanwhile, FAANG stocks like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) are testing support at their 10-week lines. but only a conviction bounce off the support level would put both stocks in an alternate buy zone.

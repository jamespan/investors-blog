  Stock Market Bears Arrive In Force As Investors Beat Bigger Retreat Out Of U.S. Treasuries

A decline on Monday that seemed harmless worsened in a big way Tuesday. And the sharp moves in the long end of the U.S. Treasury bond markets likely powered intense selling across the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).




Another big day for crude oil futures and natural gas prices, at least for part of the session, also seemed to justify Wall Street's mind to nail down profits. At one point, [Brent crude oil futures raced above $80 a barrel](https://www.investors.com/news/crude-oil-prices-hit-80-dont-expect-us-drilling-boom/).


On Tuesday, West Texas Intermediate crude hit as high as $76.60 a barrel before reversing for a 1.5% loss to $75.29, according to Oilprice.com.


The S&P 500, coming off a positive reversal last week, edged just 0.3% lower on Monday amid a rise in turnover on the NYSE. As Monday's Big Picture noted, that session met the definition of a [mild distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). The S&P 500 also finished well in the upper half of the day's price range Monday. Finally, the index closed just a whisker beneath the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


All of those technical pleasantries got chucked through the window on Tuesday.


The large-cap benchmark fell 2% and closed almost at session lows. At 4352, the S&P 500 has now slipped 4.2% from its Sept. 2 all-time peak of 4545.



Notice on a daily chart how the S&P 500 would need only a further decline of 1.1% to undercut the low of 4305 set on Sept. 20, more than a week ago. Fears about how the potential bankruptcy of China's real estate firm Evergrande would hit the country's economy sparked that day's big drop.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP092821-183x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite, losing 2.8% on Tuesday, looks almost certain to take out its own low of 14,530 set on Sept. 20. At 14,546, the tech-heavy index has now fallen 5.6% from its all-time high of 15,403. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund took out its near-term low.


Volume jumped on both main exchanges, bumping up the distribution totals for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Without question, Tuesday's [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) marks as the worst among the six tracked over a trailing 25-session period.


The Russell 2000 backtracked nearly 2.3%, but is trading much closer to its own 50-day line. Utilities got smacked hard again. SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) slid for a 14th day in a row, down 1.2%. The ETF also fell deeper beneath its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


Stock Market Today: What To Do Now
----------------------------------


The gap-down at the open, a poor finish, and general malaise among highly rated growth stocks justifies a move in IBD's market outlook to "uptrend under pressure" from "confirmed uptrend." This means new buys carry much higher risk. Raising capital by exiting the biggest losers in your portfolio and taking gains in your winners helps shield your portfolio from further damage.


IBD upgraded the outlook to "confirmed uptrend" on Sept. 23, just four sessions after the outlook was at "under pressure" on Sept. 17, the day when quadruple witching sent volume soaring on both main exchanges.


QQQ actually harbors a small gain for the quarter, up 1.5%. However, September has truly lived up to its billing as a challenging month for equities.


The active investor no doubt is seeing dismal action by most breakouts lately. Many stocks that had been gliding higher for months suddenly look like they've lost a wing. Just see the big drops through the 50-day moving average — as well as the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) on a weekly chart — by the likes of **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), Dutch integrated circuit lithography systems giant **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) in the tech and fintech fields.


Why Selling Is Harder
---------------------


At 780, ASML still boasts a 60% gain since Jan. 1. That almost quadruples the S&P 500's 15.9% advance. But remember this: Most [CAN SLIM leaders](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) take an escalator on the way up and an elevator on the way down.

Members of the [Long-Term Leaders list](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) are also facing perhaps the strongest selling pressure in months. They include **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)), MSCI and **West Pharmaceutical** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)), whose business has boomed due to the global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.


West, for sure, did not see heavy turnover during Tuesday's 3.2% drop. However, the stock has seen numerous instances of declines in well-above-average volume.


Don't use the [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) as your chief sell signal. This rating incorporates 12 months' worth of action. The RS Rating applies fully to the job of stock selection.


For many of these current stock market leaders, the next test of institutional buying support may emerge around the long-term 200-day moving average.


When the current outlook changes this often, treat it as a sign to stick to the sidelines and wait for the storm to pass. It's not clear yet whether yield-hungry investors will immediately return to long-dated Treasuries.

Escape From 10-Year Bonds
-------------------------


According to Cboe data, the yield on the benchmark U.S. government 10-year bond hit a 3-1/2 month high of 1.56%. That's a 30 basis-point swing — or just over a quarter of one percentage point — in just 10 trading sessions.


At one point on March 30, the 10-year bond yielded as much as 1.76%.


Headed into Tuesday's trade, Internet, Chips, Banks, Electronics and Finance topped [IBD's stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-sep-27-2021/) in terms of winning sectors on a medium and long-term price-performance basis. Keep abreast of changes in both the sector rankings and the 197 industry group rankings at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


How much will that lineup of sectors change in the stock market?


Energy is lurking just behind. Ranked No. 7, the large sector showed a 37% gain year to date.


As the Market Pulse shows, very few leaders rose meaningfully in above-average turnover. They both hail from the oil and gas sector.

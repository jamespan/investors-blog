Stocks Sketch Murky Picture; Ollie's Bargain In Profit Zone

Stocks delivered a diverging verdict for the third time in four days as the Nasdaq took the harder hit Friday.


The Nasdaq swung 0.8% lower, while the S&P 500 was fractionally up. Small caps outperformed as the S&P 600 rose 1%. The IBD 50 slid 0.9%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE.


Divergence was the name of the game for much of the week.


On Tuesday, the Nasdaq fell moderately, while the S&P 500 rose.


On Wednesday both major indexes suffered stalling, a form of distribution involving an up day. However, without the slaughter of utility stocks, the S&P 500 might have dodged distribution.


On Thursday, utilities dived again, slapping the S&P 500 with a moderate loss while the Nasdaq remained flat.


![MP042216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP042216-485x1024.jpg)On Friday, the Nasdaq took the hard hit while the S&P 500 skated. The composite's loss in higher volume added a sixth distribution day.


The Nasdaq's problems were tied mainly to the seven biggest weightings in the composite.


Six stocks account for a large share of the Nasdaq's weighting were lower:


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) reported weak Q1 results late Thursday. The stocks skidded 7%, 5%, respectively. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) fell roughly 2%, while **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) stepped back 1%.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) trimmed 0.3%. The small loss was an achievement, considering the news from China. Bloomberg News reported late Thursday that China shut iMovies and iBooks services. It wasn't clear why, but China has an erratic history involving censorship, meddling and trying to protect their own industries.


What are individual investors to make of the indexes' divergence? Well, if an investor is confused, that's kind of like being in step with this market.


Unfortunately confusion isn’t the best grounding for an uptrend.


The daily charts of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 look positive -- steady gains with minimal retreats. Yet leadership hasn't been dazzling.


The indexes have gained roughly 15% since the Feb. 11 lows, but few breakouts have done as much.


**Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) broke out March 11 and is now 18% above a 34.08 buy point.


IPO **Ollie’s Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) cleared a 22.63 buy point March 18 and is now 20% extended.


Gains of 20% to 25% should be considered enough to take profits. Most stocks will begin to consolidate after such a sizable gain. If an individual investor does take a profit in that neighborhood, he or she should also consider selling a laggard.


You don’t want to let profit-taking moves reduce your portfolio to a collection of so-so performers.


For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.6%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The IBD 50 retreated 0.9%.


In the coming week, the first take on Q1 GDP is expected before the market’s open Thursday. Freddie Mac analysts are expecting growth to come in at 1.1%, down from a previous estimate of 1.8%. Estimates elsewhere have been as low as 0.5% and 0.2%.


Divisia M4, the broadest gauge of the money supply, though, has picked up smartly in recent months. At some juncture, monetarists would expect that to boost economic growth.


The Federal Reserve holds a two-day meeting starting Tuesday, and the market will surely have its ear on the latest policy statement.

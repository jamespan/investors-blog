U.S. stock indexes shadowboxed Friday, neither landing nor suffering hard shots.


The Nasdaq advanced 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was flat. The Dow Jones industrial average inched down 0.1%.


Small caps edged to the front with an 0.5% pop in the Russell 2000.


The IBD 50 rose 0.8%.


Volume fell on the NYSE and the Nasdaq despite options expirations.


![2MP022216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2MP022216-240x300.jpg)Five words could describe the current market: It's beginning to get interesting.


After dropping nearly 16% for the year, the Nasdaq on Wednesday confirmed that a new uptrend is underway.


While the past two follow-through days (Dec. 16 and Jan. 26) led to nothing, the recent green light has more to recommend it.


For starters, the 2.2% gain on the Nasdaq was more emphatic than the previous two follow-through days.


Second, stocks have had more time to consolidate. This could lead to more bases and breakouts.


Third, the 19.5% haircut in the Nasdaq since July probably did a good job of shaking out weak holders.


Does this mean the market is ready to rock?


Not necessarily. There are some things to watch for, clues that could signal that this uptrend might be for real or might be another dud.


Clue No. 1: The market itself must avoid triggering pressure signals. Last year, IBD's market outlook spent 109 days wearing the "under pressure" label, the most by far in at least seven years.


A market under pressure is harder to play because it is less definite than either an uptrend or a correction.


Clue No. 2: Watch the new highs list. You want to see a return to normal. New highs should outnumber new lows, not the other way around.


Clue No. 3: As of Wednesday's IBD, defensive names accounted for about a quarter of the IBD 50. In the Big Cap 20, it's even more conservative.


Watch to see if more true growth stocks can make one or more of IBD's stock screens and bump out the conservative plays.


On Friday, **Consolidated Edison** ([ED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ED)) dropped for the fifth time in seven days. This stock might be the king of the conservative stocks. Con Ed rose as much as 12% from its Jan. 7 breakout before pulling back 4%.


Volume was heavy on the pullback, which could be a sign of money moving out of the slow lane.


Clue No. 4: Quality breakouts. Study the stocks expected to grow earnings sharply, say 25%. Some such as **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) are well off the high (23%). Others are fairly close, such as **Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)) (6%).


Longer term, two factors are worth watching -- the presidential campaign and the broadest gauge of the money supply.


Will the next president add more burdens to business or lighten the drag? Will the Divisia M4 money supply continue to grow vigorously, as it has been since July, or will it tighten up?


Economist Anna Schwartz, a Milton Friedman collaborator, noted that the money supply "has a powerful effect on economic activity."


And economic activity ultimately affects the stock market.


The market will figure out the answers to those two questions before the prognosticators will.


So, for better or worse, things are getting interesting.


For the week, the IBD 50 rose 4%; the Nasdaq, 3.8%; and the S&P 500, 2.8%.

Stocks Keep Confirmed Uptrend; What Apple, Target Tell Us Today
================================================================

Large caps led a mild rally in stocks Friday. But small caps succumbed to a bout of profit-taking.




Expiring options likely helped boost volume. Yet overall, the weekly action on Wall Street reaffirmed the status of the market right now: [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). That status, the best time to buy leading stocks, has now stretched for a 14th straight week.


Solid institutional buying in the internet, software and financial sectors boosted the Nasdaq composite up 0.3% Friday. The premier index for growth stocks ended the week up 2.3%. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% on Friday and muscled 2% higher for the week. The large-cap benchmark rose enough to snuff out the significance of the Dec. 30 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). Thus, the distribution-day count for that index fell to one.


U.S. housing starts vaulted in December and offset an expected 0.3% drop in industrial production. The factory utilization rate remains robust even if the 77% figure just missed [the Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).

While the small-cap S&P 600 slipped 0.2% for the day, at 1039 it still romped 2.8% higher for the week.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP011720-252x300.jpg)Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF edged 0.2% higher for a nearly 1.8% weekly advance. Its 5% year-to-date gain, for now, blows the S&P 500's 3.1% rally out of the water.


Given that this market uptrend has lasted this long, an IBD reader would benefit from holding the biggest winners in the portfolio. Don't hold your laggards and pull out your winners. Do the opposite. Clearly, numerous [CAN SLIM](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/)-quality issues have shown the ability to power more than 20%-25% past a buy point. Such action usually triggers a [key sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


With the wave of quarterly results coming in the next two weeks, don't forget these key rules. One, don't let a double-digit-gain turn into a loss. Two, at least sell some shares when a stock plunges below the 10-week moving average in massive volume. And three, watch out for climax runs.



**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has been a head-turner for even the most battle-worn investors. A 40% gain since the breakout past 221.47 is darn impressive. The stock is 40% above its long-term 200-day moving average. That's not extreme. [Some highfliers get 70% to 100% above their 200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-stock-how-far-does-it-rise-above-the-200-day-line/), or more, before they slam on the brakes. Watch for fiscal Q1 results by the iPhone, Macbook, Apple TV and digital services giant on Jan. 28 after the close.


**Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) holders face a different challenge. The gap-down this past week on lackluster holiday-season sales sent the megacap discount retailer barreling below the 10-week moving average. Turnover surged 106% above its 10-week average. Those who bought recently need to cut losses or avoid a round trip.


**CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)), a [Big Cap 20 inhabitant](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) that also ranked [No. 9 in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) early Friday, fell 3.9% for the week while slicing through its 10-week line.

Stock Market Bounce Fades Late; Why This Could Become A Deeper Decline
=======================================================================

A day after the biggest jolt since May 12, the U.S. stock market tried to steady itself. The results left much to be desired.




The major indexes opened higher but could not hold most gains, which at one point reached nearly 1%. After a late dive, the stock market closed mixed and near session lows.


The S&P 500 transformed a 0.9% gain to a 0.1% loss. The Nasdaq composite ended with a 0.2% increase.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost less than 0.2%. Dow component **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) rose 0.4% after the company reported that a trial showed a [booster shot of its Covid-19 vaccine increased protection](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-johnson-and-johnson-shows-off-covid-boosters-but-can-it-catch-moderna-pfizer/) against severe or moderate illness. J&J is fighting to hold at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP092121-226x300.jpg)The Russell 2000 recovered 0.2% Tuesday, but fell short of regaining the 200-day moving average. The [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of its tracking iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) is only 62, which reflects the lag in small caps.


Stock Market Breaks Key Levels
------------------------------


The stock market violated important chart levels this week, and the change in character increases risk for investors. For now, it's difficult to carry out any trades. Growth stocks need a good market in which to flourish, and that element is missing right now.


It's also difficult to [sell stocks short](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-short-side/) because bargain hunters are busy and the market is by some measures oversold. The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) Monday hit a high that often marks market lows.


Profits can be elusive in an uncertain stock market. Instead, it's more important to study each day's action in the major indexes and leading stocks.


The current signals are mainly negative. Indexes are fatigued, falling below their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). That's normally a bad sign, and it's especially bad after the S&P 500 found support at that level multiple times this year. This could turn into a deeper market decline.


For the Nasdaq — which failed support at the 15,000 level — watch for the Aug. 19 low of 14,423 to act as a bulwark against sellers. The S&P 500 already broke below its August low and now looks to the July low of 4233 for some protection.


Leaders Outperform Stock Market
-------------------------------


Leading stocks are another important stock market gauge and they brilliantly outperformed Tuesday. The IBD 50 rose 1%.



So, what's working? The top IBD 50 stock Tuesday included some hot IPOs and some that are volatile. The problem is that few are near [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


**Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) rallied 5.4% after bouncing off the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) surged 9.3% to a new high. **DLocal** ([DLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLO)) and **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) added more than 3%; **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), a position in [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), jumped 5.8%.


But **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), today's [IBD 50 Stock To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/growth-stocks-actionable-now-covid-19-drives-growth-for-hubspot-and-75-rise-in-2021/), is rising from support at the 10-week moving average.


In Asia, where Monday's global sell-off originated, the Hong Kong Hang Seng reversed higher to close up 0.5% Tuesday. Tokyo's Nikkei index climbed 2.2%, its best day since June 21. The Shanghai stock market remained closed.


The iShares China Big Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) climbed 1.2%. Invesco China Technology ETF ([CQQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CQQQ)) rose 1%.


European stocks also rebounded. The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 1%. London's FTSE 100 index climbed 1.1% higher, while the German DAX rose 1.4% and the CAC 40 in Paris added 1.5%.


Wall Street Awaits Fed Announcement
-----------------------------------


On Wednesday, the stock market will have a close eye on the Federal Reserve, which concludes a two-day meeting. While no one expects a change in interest rates, there's a growing possibility that [the Fed will set a start date for the reduction of asset purchases](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-sandp-500-impact-bond-taper-rate-hike-2022/). Also important will be the Fed's new economic projections.


In economic reports Tuesday, the August housing starts came in much better than expected. Starts jumped 6% to 1.615 million units at an annualized rate.


Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, noted in a report the increase came despite labor and supply shortages. All the gains were in condos and apartments while single-family units fell for the second month in a row, she added.


"The future looks better. Building permits unexpectedly increased for the second consecutive month, with a 6.0% jump in August alone," the biggest since January. But IBD's homebuilding industry group was slightly lower and is no longer a leader.

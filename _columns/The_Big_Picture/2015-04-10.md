Stock Indexes Tack On Gains, Though Volume Remains Light
=========================================================

Stocks coasted to nice gains Friday in volume that suggested not everybody was pedaling.

  

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. The Dow Jones industrial average popped 0.6%. The IBD 50 added 0.7%.

  

Volume sagged on both major exchanges.

  

Yet something could be about to change. The Nasdaq is waging a quiet battle around the 5,000 level, an area where it encountered resistance twice before.

  

Back on March 27, the Big Picture noted a pattern of the Nasdaq breaking key resistance on the third try. It happened at least three times in 2014.

  

Currently, the Nasdaq is testing the 5,000 area for the third time since early March. Patterns are no guarantee of future action, but individual investors should be aware of what sort of pattern the market appears to be stuck in.

  

How useful that knowledge might be is another question.

  

For example, there are some differences and some similarities between the 2014 market and the current market.

  

The differences: None of those 2014 breaks above resistance came with an uptrend under pressure. None came with seven distribution days, which is where the current market is.

  

What's similar? Well, among the 2014 breakthroughs, none advanced more than 3% to 4% above the resistance level.

  

In other words, success here and now might not lead to a dramatic improvement. If the resistance around 5,000 is broken, consider playing it with a light hand. As long as the distribution-day count is high, risks linger.

  

On Friday, two dormant growth stocks perked up.

  

**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), which had been slouching sideways to south since its 11% gap up on Feb. 6, rose almost 4% in volume 58% above average. The stock appears to be delivering follow-up gains after Thursday morning's announcement that it would buy lynda.com, an online educational company.

  

**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is another growth stock that has been stuck in a channel since a 12% gap up July 22. On Friday, the stock gapped up 5% in volume 172% above average. While Chipotle retook its 50-day line, the current consolidation includes about two months of action under the 50-day line.

  

The best patterns generally aren't sketched under the 50-day line. Chipotle began the day with an 88 Composite Rating, not quite top-notch. For now, it might be a better candidate for a lunch than for a launch.

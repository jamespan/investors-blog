title: Bulls Score Big On Inside Day; What To Watch For Now

Bulls finally lit up the stock market's scoreboard Thursday, but skepticism lingered.




The stock market has seen this before — and very recently. For instance, on Oct. 16, the Nasdaq advanced 2.9% but couldn't find follow-through power in the days after.


So, the next few sessions are critical if the market is to signal that a new uptrend is underway. After Thursday's close, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) fell sharply on earnings reports, sending index futures lower. [Amazon's sales and outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-earnings-report/) disappointed; [Alphabet also missed revenue estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-alphabet-stock-earnings-googl/).


On Thursday, the Nasdaq pushed 3% higher, while the S&P 500 added 1.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.6%. Small caps, gauged in the S&P 600, rose 2.2%. Volume ran higher most of the day but then faded.

Oddly, Thursday was an inside day, containing its action within Wednesday's high and low.


What are investors to make of this?


At times this year, market watchers have described the 2018 market as one comprised of FIBs: fully invested bears. They were in the market but without much conviction.


Now the DIBs — decreasingly invested bulls — have taken over. They had been wishing, at least until Thursday, that they had reduced more of their exposure.


Neither group has done much for the market's confidence this year.


Bears Own The Debate
--------------------


Despite Thursday's bullish move, the bears have most of the convincing talking points in their favor. The bearish ideas can be summed up in a few words: tariffs, interest rates and midterm elections.


**Elections** are hard to predict, but history has its own take. "Normally the stock market corrects ... in front of the election by an average of nearly 10%," says Randy Watts, chief investment strategist at William O'Neil & Co., a sister company of IBD.


Then the stock market "rallies an average of 7%," according to Watts and Kenley Scott, research analyst at William O'Neil & Co.


Apparently, the market has more trouble dealing with the uncertainty leading up to the election than dealing with the outcome itself. So, the midterm election results could ultimately be a nonevent for the market.


**Tariffs** are counterproductive, according to most economists, but bulls argue that they are only a negotiating ploy. That might yet prove true, but it looks doubtful for now.


**Rising interest rates** were supposed to represent a return to normalcy. Banks would see their net margins increase and would have an incentive to make more loans. Savers would get better returns. Prospective homebuyers would see no point in delaying purchases. Stocks could forget rates and trade on earnings.


For the most part, none of that happened, and the bulls are out of intellectual ammunition.


Yet the stock market is not an intellectual endeavor, and therein resides hope for the bulls.


What To Watch For
-----------------


Individual investors should be watching the market to see if [a follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) can confirm a new uptrend.


Conditions that accompany the follow-through day can be important.


IBD research going back to 2000 offers four insights.


**No. 1, October:** Follow-through days that occur in October are more likely to work than those that arise in, say, June or July. This may or may not be chance.


**No. 2, the put/call volume ratio:** This secondary indicator can help identify a bottom — when the gauge reaches 1.15 and higher. The level was reached Oct. 11, Oct. 18 and Wednesday.


**No. 3, the indexes' Accumulation/Distribution Rating:** Follow-through days work best when the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at E on the rating. The low reading apparently points to a market that has chased out most of the sellers. (Middle readings like C are the least bullish.)


**No. 4, bulls vs. bears:** Investors Intelligence's mood gauge measures the percentage of bullish advisors vs. bearish advisors. Rallies work best when bearish advisors outnumber bullish advisors. This isn't the case now.


IBD-style investors won't let these secondary items keep them from buying on a follow-through day. But the items can help calibrate expectations.


Another Key? Apple
------------------


The market itself remains an investor's primary gauge. It holds within itself the ability to create its own reality apart from earnings season, news and logic.


Another thing to watch is **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which carries more weight in the Nasdaq (7.8%) than any other stock. During this market pullback, Apple has held up well. The stock is battling near its 50-day line and is only 5% off its high.


Also, watch to see which part of the inside day fails first. Does the market surge above Wednesday's high or drop below its low? Or does it stay inside again Friday?


Financial Data
--------------


Durable goods orders in September rolled in at 0.8%. The range of estimates varied wildly — from down 3% to up 1.8%. So, the moderately bullish level was more than acceptable.


First-time jobless claims came in at 215,000, about 1.5% more than expected but essentially in line with expectations.


On Friday, before the open, the first reading on third-quarter GDP will be released. The Street expects 3.3% growth. Estimates range from 2.6% to 3.8%.

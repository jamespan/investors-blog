  Stock Market Indexes Hold Trends, But Small Caps Tumble; Nasdaq Shows These Soft Spots

The stock market wavered Monday, but while indexes held in a familiar trend, small caps showed why they've been a frustrating trade this year.




In an indecisive session, the Nasdaq edged up 0.1%. The S&P 500 edged down 0.2% as the second quarter of 2024 got underway.


But the small-cap Russell 2000 slid 1%. After it topped resistance at 2,100 last week, Monday's retracement indicates the index may have a fight on its hands to stay above it.


Trading the Russell 2000 can be tricky, with price swings of more than 1% in 25 out of 62 sessions so far this year. Despite that, the small-cap index is still making a series of higher highs and higher lows. Yet for all that volatility, small-cap investors haven't gotten a better return. Year to date, the Russell is up less than 4%, compared with gains of more than 9% for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


For their part, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are near the top of price channels. In the past several months, both stock market indexes have eased when they climb to the upper regions of those channels. At the same time, both are holding above the [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The line has proved to be a dependable support level for both since the confirmed uptrend began in early November.


Although both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain in uptrends, the Nasdaq shows some soft spots that are not found in the S&P.


The Nasdaq [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) has weakened to D-, while the S&P's rating is at B-. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has gone basically sideways this year, while the S&P 500's A-D line is trending higher. Often, the NYSE A-D line performs better, and this divergence is nearly threeÂ  months in the making.


Much of the weakness lies in some of the largest Nasdaq stocks. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.2% Monday. But its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) has underperformed since late January. Some of that can be traced to slumping **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and some smaller Nasdaq 100 components such as **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)).


S&P 500, Nasdaq Diverge
-----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP040124-209x300.jpg)The shifting trend among the S&P and the Nasdaq derives from a rotation among major sectors. In the first two months of the year, Communications Services Select Sector SPDR ([XLC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLC)) (which is largely **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))) led with a 9.2% increase. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) had rallied 7.5%. Both are well represented in the Nasdaq.


But since the start of March, tech leadership has given way to energy, materials and even the stodgy utilities sector. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) is up more than 9% since March 1, while utilities and materials are up more than 5%.


The tech sector, by comparison, is down more than 1% and communications services is up about 2.5%. The rotation, thus, favors the S&P 500 more than the Nasdaq.


Market tops sometimes happen insidiously, as institutional investors quietly take profits. With the Nasdaq now laden with eight [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) and the S&P with six, there's reason to believe big players are taking money off the table.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% Monday, as it faces resistance around 39,900 after a 240.52 loss for the day. **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) accounted for 102.29 of those points. The home improvement retailer slid more than 4% and is testing the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


Stock Market Back From Holiday Break
------------------------------------


The stock market closed for Good Friday, so Monday was its first chance to react to Friday's [inflation data and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-inflation-rate-feb-chair-jerome-powell/) on monetary policy. While policy doves and hawks could find some favorable takeaways, Monday's trading was on the hawks' side.


On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose nearly 14 basis points to 4.329%. It marked the largest single-day rise in the benchmark yield since Feb. 13, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It's also at the highest level since March 18.


The jolt in yields appeared to chill the stock market. Indexes opened higher but started rolling over after the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI came out with a 22-month high in March. The gauge of U.S. factory activity was above the 50.0 mark for the third straight month, although slightly below the February reading.

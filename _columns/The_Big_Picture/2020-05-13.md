Stock Market Slumps On Economic Worries, But Nasdaq Holds Key Support Level
============================================================================

A back-and-forth session for the stock market early Wednesday ended up being another win for the bears by the close. [Retail stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news) bore the brunt of the selling, with eight subgroups in the sector falling 3.5% or more. Financial stocks also lagged.




The stock market was volatile in early trading after Wall Street digested comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at a Peterson Institute for International Economics online forum.


"While the economic response (to the coronavirus outbreak) has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks," Powell said. Wall Street took that to mean that an economic recovery could be drawn out, and that unleashed another wave of selling.


Small caps took the biggest hit, with the Russell 2000 down 3.3%. But the index held support at its 50-day moving average, just like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell 2.2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MP_3x1_051320-248x300.jpg)The S&P 500 breached its exponential 21-day moving average, falling 1.75%. It closed near its session low for the fifth time in seven trading sessions. The Nasdaq composite gave back 1.5% and held support at its 21-day line. It also claimed a small victory by avoiding a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/).


Volume on the NYSE was higher than Tuesday, giving the S&P 500 its third distribution day. Nasdaq volume was slightly lower.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) held up better than the broad market, falling 1%. The exchange traded fund was helped by strong performances from [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)).


Stock Market Leaders Look Fine
------------------------------


The Nasdaq's price action is the most important to watch at this point because it's the leading index. Indeed, a look at Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, provides good perspective. The exchange traded fund fell 1.25% Wednesday, but it's still holding above its 21-day average, which happens to correspond to its last breakout area. QQQ edged higher in after-hours trading, helped in part by better-than-expected [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-earnings-csco-stock-q12020/) from **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)).


QQQ houses plenty of stock market leaders like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)). Despite two days of selling in the major stock indexes, all four stocks look fine as they hold above their 10-day lines.



Meanwhile, stocks that recently triggered IBD's eight-week hold rule are holding up well, including Chegg, **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Livongo Health** ([LVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVGO)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) and **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)).


Assess Current Holdings
-----------------------


The bottom line? With leading growth stocks showing little signs of wear and tear, it's too early to give up on the [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/).

But it is a good time to take stock of your current holdings. Some might not be acting as well as the aforementioned leaders. If you own some big winners, consider taking partial profits on a break of the 10-day line. Or you could wait for a break of the 21-day line. Playing defense in this type of environment is fine. But it's also important to give your leaders room to work.


In the retail sector, stocks like **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) should be handled with care. Both fall under the category of "not acting right" after a breakout. In cases like this, keeping losses small is often a good strategy.

The Nasdaq composite climbed to a new high Thursday and the S&P 500 made a new closing high, signs that the stock market is still not ready for a summer break.




Indexes made a push in the final half-hour to lock in the Nasdaq's fourth consecutive gain, an increase of 0.8%. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, missing out on a record high by less than a point. Still, the index made a record closing high.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.8%. **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) tried to break out of a 333.55 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) but closed just below it.


Small caps led the stock market. The Russell 2000 rallied 1.8%. A rebound that started on July 20 appears to have resumed. Still, the Russell is about 5% from prior highs and below the 50-day moving average for more than three weeks.


Winners had a 2-to-1 advantage over losers in the NYSE and were 13-to-5 on the Nasdaq. Most S&P sectors rose, except for health care and materials.


![MP080521](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP080521-208x300.jpg)After rising 14.6% to 17.9% so far this year, the major stock market indexes refuse to budge from their uptrends. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are up in the first week of August. If the S&P 500 is to make it seven straight monthly gains, it will need to do it carrying the weight of seven distribution days. Plus, [August is historically a down month for stocks](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/indexes-reverse-higher-4-curious-statistics-about-the-stock-market-in-august/).


2 Stock Market Guides: 21-Day Line, Leaders
-------------------------------------------


Summer often makes for a sluggish stock market. And despite a pile-up of distribution days in the S&P 500, the market is trying to break out of a two-week horizontal pattern.


At least in the short term, investors can use certain indicators to judge their exposure to the stock market. One is the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). As long as the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow can hold above that line, consider it a positive.


One force that can keep the stock market on track is its leading stocks. The IBD 50 made a new closing high after rising 0.9% Thursday. New stocks with solid charts are keeping the IBD 50 refreshed and the growth pipeline filled with opportunities.


On Thursday, business services providers **Sprout Social** ([SPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPT)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Lightspeed** ([LSPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSPD)) and **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) led with gains of 5% to 11%.


**Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) rose above the 222.18 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a 24-week base but closed below it in a negative price reversal. Shares finished up 1.4%.


Leading Stocks Help Stock Market Stay Upright
---------------------------------------------


In general, leading stocks are acting well. Most of the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) stocks that topped [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in the past several weeks are making progress, or at least not flopping.


The best advances from buy points are in technology and health care. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) rallied as much as 28% from its 95.54 buy point, though it gave back more than 5% Thursday. Chip designer **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) and **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) are up more than 14% from breakouts. In health care, **Maravai LifeSciences** ([MRVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVI)) and **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) are standouts.


But **Upwork** ([UPWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPWK)), **Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)), **Smart Global Holdings** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)) and **Fair Issac** ([FICO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FICO)) are some of the summer duds.


Add to that list **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), which gapped below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) in heavy trading after the video streaming device company posted Q2 [user growth that lagged expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/roku-stock-drops-as-streaming-video-platform-misses-user-target/). Roku's drop from the 463.09 buy point exceeds 8%, resulting in a [sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Datadog, McAfee Among Stock Market Winners
------------------------------------------


**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) jumped on its second-quarter earnings report as [profit and revenue topped estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/datadog-stock-datadog-earnings-q2-2021/), and September-quarter guidance came in above views. The stock topped a 110.34 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) July 22, but today's gap-up to new highs leaves Datadog [extended from that buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/).


**McAfee** ([MCFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCFE)) rose past the 29.46 buy point of a six-week cuplike pattern in heavy trading. Thinly traded **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)) jumped past the 244.82 buy point of a 24-week pattern that perhaps could be called a [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).


**United Microelectronics** ([UMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UMC)) gapped above the 11.35 buy point of a cup base. UMC has grabbed space within the [IBD Stock Screener](https://www.investors.com/research/cheap-stocks-to-buy/).


The stock market applauded economic data. First-time [jobless claims fell to 385,000 last week](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-08-05-2021-11628113581?mod=hp_lead_pos3) from a revised 399,000 the previous week, although filings for new unemployment benefits remained nearly double the pre-pandemic average. Continuing claims for regular state programs dropped by 366,000 to 2.9 million in the week ended July 24, the U.S. Labor Department said.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed 3 basis points to 1.22%.

The Nasdaq composite led a mixed session Tuesday that survived a steep politics-related slide but still could not see its way to a clear path.




The Nasdaq climbed 0.3% and held above the 50-day moving average, an important signal as the market tries to find its way. The Nasdaq 100 closed just below its 50-day line. Arguably, the Nasdaq 100 is a more important index now because so much of this year's market has rested on the shoulders of big-cap tech stocks.


The S&P 500 fell 0.1% while the Dow Jones industrial average was practically flat. Both remain above their 50-day averages. The Russell 2000 added 0.3% as sentiment shifted toward smaller stocks. The midcap S&P 400 rose 0.1%.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Winners and losers were about even across the board.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP071117.png)The market came down sharply starting about 11 a.m. ET, right as Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, released a batch of emails supporting the notion that Russia wanted to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. That raises concerns that the campaign may have violated laws restricting foreign influence on U.S. elections. For Wall Street, it added to worries that the Trump administration is getting bogged down on Russia issues and is struggling to get its agenda moving.


But after a rapid descent, the indexes started paring losses. The indexes, in fact, closed near session highs.


The emails rang alarm bells for investors who have grown extra sensitive about a potential market top and often sell rapidly at the first sign of trouble.


Indeed, for investors who've been aboard since the market low of 2009, today's uncertain direction is like climbing a hill in the fog: You can't see the peak, but you sense it's getting closer. So any minor dip on the ground can feel like the beginning of the downslope, even if that peak is still miles away.


Speaking of alarms, some potentially big ones lie ahead this week. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen [testifies in Congress](https://www.investors.com/research/investing-action-plan/yellen-may-trigger-stocks-banks-amazon-reviews-investing-action-plan/) Wednesday and Thursday. Second-quarter earnings reports start to come in with banks **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) announcing on Friday.


This comes at a time when market risk is already higher than normal. Distribution has piled up in the broad indexes the past few weeks. A modest downward trend has developed on the Nasdaq since its peak June 9, when worries about tech-stock valuations sparked selling.


In the four weeks since that high, retail, oil and food industry groups have been down the most, off 10% or more. On the opposite end, pharmaceuticals (namely biotech and generics), homebuilders, medical products, media software, medical services and a few other groups have risen 3% to 6%. Solar stocks have been an outlier, up nearly 14%.



Leading stocks had a decent day. The IBD 50 rose 0.6%. Semiconductor, networking, software and internet components gave the index a tech-heavy flavor. Chip stocks showed again they are the muscular choices at the moment.


**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) after an analyst suggested that a merger with **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), another payment processing company, would make sense. Square rallied 6% to close above a 25.07 buy point. PayPal eased 0.3% and faces resistance around 55.


Homebuilders were mainly lower Tuesday after Barclays downgraded industry leaders **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) and **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)). Barclays also reiterated a bearish view on other homebuilders, citing valuations it deems too lofty.

Stocks on Friday curbed the week's gains as the indexes retreated in slower volume.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average sawed off 0.7%.


The IBD 50 dipped 0.3%.


Volume fell across the board.


Losses were broad, but **Amazon.com's** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) 10% plunge on Q2 results sharpened the indexes' decline. Amazon accounts for 1.9% of the Nasdaq's weighting and also is a component in the S&P 500.


Despite Friday's low-volume losses, overall the week had some positive developments.


Ponder this partial list of the week's big winners day by day:


•Monday: **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)), up 4% for the session; **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), 3%.


•Tuesday: **Green Plains** ([GPRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRE)) up 3%; **500.com** ([WBAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBAI)), 12%; **Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)), 5%; **Knight Transportation** ([KNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNX)), 5%; and **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), 3%.


•Wednesday: **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), 3%; **FMC Technologies** ([FTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTI)), 3%; **Dow Chemical** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)), 3%; **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), 3%; **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), 11%.


•Thursday: **KapStone Paper** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)), 10%; **Graphic Packaging** ([GPK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPK)), 7%; **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), 5%; **Wabtec** ([WAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAB)), 6%; **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), 15%; **Asbury Automotive** ([ABG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABG)), 2%; **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)), 8%; and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), 2%.


•Friday: **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), 9%; and **Lazard** ([LAZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAZ)), 2%.


The tally suggests the market is undergoing a subtle shift that could bode well for individual investors.


Note the broadness of the players. The winners include China-based stocks, and stocks from the retail, transportation, Internet, chemical, alternative energy, computer and apparel sectors.


This is a much broader leadership lineup than the energy, medical and chip dominance of not too long ago.


Also, a number of these movers are 2013-14 IPOs, which points to an increased risk appetite.


Baidu is interesting because it is a former leader that skipped a market cycle or two. Another former leader potentially in that category is **Bancolombia** ([CIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIB)). The foreign bank has been in a long consolidation since February 2013.


Although the stock doesn't have great ratings (Composite Rating of 80), a turnaround appears to be underway. The Street expects earnings to jump 114% in Q2, the first quarter of 25% or better growth since mid-2011.


In economic news, durable-goods orders for June topped expectations.


For the week, the IBD 50 rose 3.2%, the Nasdaq 0.4% and the S&P 500 was fractionally up.


The coming week features a heavy load of companies reporting quarterly results, including **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) Tuesday and **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) Thursday.

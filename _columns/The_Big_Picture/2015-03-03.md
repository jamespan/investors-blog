The Nasdaq showed Tuesday it's not just going to keep breezing to record highs.


The composite fell 0.6%, its largest loss since Jan. 30. It closed back below 5,000, the last major milestone before the Nasdaq can top a record high that has stood for nearly 15 years.


The S&P 500 fell nearly 0.5%. Both broad indexes trimmed losses and closed in the upper half of their intraday ranges.


Volume fell on the NYSE but rose on the Nasdaq. That gave the Nasdaq a new distribution day â€” a loss in higher volume that indicates institutional investors sold shares heavily.


Despite the setback, a longer-term perspective shows the market uptrend has been deepening its roots.


Even after counting Tuesday's results, few distribution days remain in the market's current picture.


The indexes' ascent has left some of those too far down to matter any longer, and the January distribution days have become too old to matter also.


Boosting the case for bulls, dozens of stock with high IBD Composite Ratings have broken out the past few weeks. Nearly all have held up above buy points, and some have become profitable leaders.


On Tuesday, the IBD 50 fell 0.9%, hurt mainly by two components.


**Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)) plunged 10% in heavy volume and closed nearly 7% below the 22.33 buy point of its double-bottom base. 


**Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) dived 8% in big trading. The drugmaker said it will be late filing its 10-K report with the SEC because of delays getting financial data from two businesses it acquired.


Such implosions should remind investors that stocks shouldn't be left unattended.


Tuesday's market loss wasn't so surprising after the heady advance of late. This was the second distribution day in three sessions, including Friday's on the S&P 500. It's important now to watch whether more distribution creeps into the market as the Nasdaq tests 5,000.


The breadth of the Nasdaq has been a worry for some market watchers because the advance-decline line has lagged the index. But the A/D line has now risen above its December prior high. The NYSE's A/D line (plotted on the S&P 500 chart) has been stronger.


This year's breakouts include a raft of consumer stocks, which seems to reflect an improving financial situation for Americans.


**Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) was the most recent example, as the retailer broke out of a long cup-with-handle base after the earnings report.


Since the February market low, travel booking and lodging stocks have been two of the three best-performing IBD industry groups.


To be sure, the news last month of **Expedia**'s ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) buyout of rival **Orbitz** ([OWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OWW)) was a key factor in the booking industry's rally.


Other industries that have led this leg up are pharmaceuticals, security software and cement and concrete companies. All those are up more than 10% in the past four weeks.


The biotech, soft drink, chip design, Internet content, electronics stores, managed health care and meat-product industry groups have risen more than 8%.

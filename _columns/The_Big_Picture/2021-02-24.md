  Stock Market Rallies On Dovish Fed; Is The Pullback Really Over?

The stock market turned in a second straight bullish performance Wednesday, helped by two days of dovish testimony on Capitol Hill by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.




Nasdaq 100 futures were down close to 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, when the 10-year Treasury yield was up 8 basis points to 1.42%. But the 10-year yield backed off highs, and that's when the stock market started to rally. Rising yields is the bond market's way of saying it's optimistic about a stronger-than-expected economic recovery and the prospects for higher inflation. Once again, the bond market seems to be at odds with the Fed.


After making a bullish stand at its 21-day exponential moving average Tuesday, the Russell 2000 small-cap index surged 2.3%, helped by another rally in financial stocks. Financial services is the fourth highest-weighted sector in the iShares Russell 2ooo ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) at around 13.5%. Health care gets the top weighting at 20.5%

Dow Jones stocks **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) scored new highs Wednesday. **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), which joined [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) last week when it cleared a 35.20 buy point, picked up another 3% Wednesday.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to an all-time high and crossed the 32,000 level, ending with a gain of 1.3%. The S&P 500 added 1.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday.


The Nasdaq composite rallied 1%. Support at the 50-day line and a close above Tuesday's high for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq raise the probability that the latest pullback could be short-lived like the one in late January.


An early plunge for the Nasdaq Tuesday had all the makings of a [vertical violation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/), but the index pared a 3.9% loss to 0.5%.


Chip-equipment stocks did some serious lifting in the Nasdaq, with the group up more than 5%. But finding actionable stocks in the group is tough right now because they've made big moves already.


The bulls got another piece of good news Wednesday from a contrarian market indicator. The Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a drop in bullish sentiment to 56.3% from 59.1%. It was the fourth straight reading below 60% after nine straight weeks above it. Readings above 60% are considered excessively bullish and have come ahead of several market tops in the past. Bullish sentiment declined to 53.6% on Nov. 3 just ahead of the Nasdaq's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) on Nov. 5.


Advancing stocks topped decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1. The ratio was about the same on the NYSE.


Slim Pickings
-------------


Despite two days of constructive price action, it's still not an easy environment to make money in stocks. After a big run for the stock market, there's no shortage of extended stocks. Actionable setups seem to be the exception, not the rule at this point. But it's always good to keep track of stocks showing relative strength, and there's still a lot of that going on. Also, there are some leading stocks that are getting support at their 10-week moving averages, such as **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)).



**Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) surged 13% after reporting bullish earnings and sales. The stock got attention on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) just after the market open, when it was still in buy range from an 86.77 buy point. The biotech reported its second straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth. Revenue growth accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, soaring 105% to $745.3 million.


Meanwhile, **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) is trading tightly near highs after soaring more than 25% during the week ended Feb. 12. A bullish earnings report was the catalyst. When a stock holds gains after an explosive move, it can be a precursor to even more price strength. Group peer **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is also showing tight action as it holds above the 2,000 level.

Oil and gas-related groups also outperformed Wednesday. The Energy Select SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) jumped 3.5%. **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) added 6% to 22.27. It's trying to clear a short consolidation with a 22.33 buy point. April U.S. crude oil futures settled at $63.22 a barrel, up 2.5%.



Most oil and gas stocks have weak ratings from IBD, partly hurt by earnings and sales declines in recent quarters. But with oil back above $60 a barrel, Wall Street is betting on brighter fundamentals ahead. Last year, Halliburton reported annual profit of 65 cents a share, down 48% from 2019. This year, though, annual earnings are expected to rise 32%, with growth accelerating in 2022, up 45%.

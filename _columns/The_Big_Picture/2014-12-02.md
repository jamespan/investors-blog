Stocks Bounce; Small Caps, Transport Stocks Lead Upside
========================================================

The stock market bounced back some Tuesday as it tried to keep its seven-week uptrend going further.

  

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 climbed 0.6%. Both closed near session highs. The S&P 500 erased practically all of Monday's drop, but the Nasdaq made up less than half of its loss.

  

Small caps rebounded with more energy: The Russell 2000 jumped 1.2%. The transportation sector regained momentum, with the Dow transports adding 1.2% as well.

  

Rail, air freight and other transportation industry groups were among the leaders. Oil prices resumed their descent, which is aiding transportation and consumer stocks.

  

Biotechs also led.

  

**Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), encouraged by test results on an Alzheimer's drug, said it's speeding up testing. Shares surged 6% as they form the right side of a base.

  

Chip stocks were another sector that fared well. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 0.7%.

  

Breadth was bullish, with winning stocks topping losers by about 2-to-1 across the board. But volume scaled back.

  

Whenever the market suffers a sell-off, as it did Monday, it's important to see how it reacts the next few days.

  

Since the market most recently bottomed, any time there's been significant selling buyers have stepped right up to stanch losses.

  

On Tuesday there was a similar reaction, although the lighter volume suggested that institutional investors were not that eager to buy shares.

  

Not that anyone should blame institutions for being cautious. After all, the Nasdaq has rallied more than 16% from the October low and is currently up 7.6% from the Oct. 21 follow-through.

  

Relatively few stocks have been able to beat that. Indeed, investors had to be good stock pickers to outpace the market's performance. Small investors might have been better off buying index ETFs to ride the rally.

  

Even in the IBD 50, only about 15 stocks have done better from their buy points than the Nasdaq has done from the follow-through.

  

Those winners include **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), which is up 27% since regaining a 90.60 buy point.

  

**NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) has climbed 15% from its 91.16 buy point. **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)) has risen 16% from its 79.23 entry.

  

**Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and several others have had smaller gains that nonetheless have topped the market.

  

The IBD 50 rose 0.7% â€” not enough to make up for Monday's 1.7% slide.

  

Few of the IBD 50 components made noteworthy moves.**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), which is on IBD Sector Leaders, cleared a follow-on pattern.

  

Meanwhile, many other leading stocks are forming bases. That's where the next buying opportunities exist, provided the market doesn't fall apart.

  

In a slow day for economic news, monthly sales reports from automakers mainly beat expectations.

  

IBD's automakers industry group was little changed, but the replacement auto parts group rose nearly 3%, ranking among the day's best.

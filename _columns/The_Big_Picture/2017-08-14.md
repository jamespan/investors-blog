The bulls weren't a happy bunch at the end of last week — not with seven distribution days in the Nasdaq since July 26 and leading growth stocks teetering.


But the bull camp was in a much better mood Monday as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 gapped up above their 50-day moving averages, rising 1.3% and 1%, respectively. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6%, but the summer doldrums took their toll on volume again according to preliminary data that showed turnover on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in below Friday's levels in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today).


NYSE indexes were helped by strength in financials, which rebounded after a tough week.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP081417.png)Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares ([FAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAS)), a leveraged financial ETF, gapped above the 50-day line after a tough last week that saw shares drop 7%. Shares ended at 51.70, up 4%. The stock is in the 5% buy zone from a 49.60 cup-with-handle buy point.


The session was solid overall, but the market outlook is staying right where it is due to a recent clustering of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) on the Nasdaq.


Through Monday's action, the index showed seven distribution days in 14 trading sessions, although it's important to note that many of them didn't have the feel of outright distribution. Of the seven, five showed declines ranging from 0.2% to 0.6%. Another was a stalling session that showed higher volume but no meaningful price progress.


There was some fear in the stock market Friday. Friday's [put/call ratio](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) closed at 1.14, the highest close since Jan. 18's 1.18 reading. The ratio measures fear among options traders, and a reading of 1.15 or higher is sometimes associated with a short-term market low. If the reading proves accurate this time around, then the Nasdaq's mini-pullback will have reached only 3.8%. So far this year, the deepest pullback in the Nasdaq is 4.1%.


The bottom line is that it's still a volatile market with elevated risk. Breadth improved Monday, with gainers topping losers on both exchanges by a more than 3-1 ratio, but the advance/decline line for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 has been trending lower since the Nasdaq suffered a bearish outside day on July 27. If you've been buying lately and don't have much to show for it, take it as a cue to slow down new purchases. Having some cash on hand is a sensible approach in light of recent market action.


Chinese stocks did a lot of the heavy lifting Monday, but there's not many actionable names in the space at this point. **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) jumped 6% to 39.28 ahead of its earnings report Tuesday before the open, but it's well-extended from a 32.43 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point; **Yirendai** ([YRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YRD)) soared 6% to 41.11, but it's extended from a 31.74 entry; and **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) gained 6% after recently triggering the [8%-loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 46.05 buy point.



Inside the Dow, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was one of 10 stocks that rose 1% or more. Shares gained 1.5% to 159.85 after CNBC reported the company had talks with **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)) recently about bringing Apple Watch to the insurer's 23 million members. Apple recently gapped up over a 156.75 flat-base entry after reporting its third straight quarter of accelerating sales growth, but the breakout has been slow to get going. Apple closed Monday 2% above the buy point.


In the chip space, small-cap **FormFactor** ([FORM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FORM)) added nearly 3% to 14 as it works on a cup-with-handle base with a 14.80 buy point. The chip equipment firm has strung together four straight quarters of impressive sales growth, but fund ownership of the stock has started to flatten out in recent quarters. The company has several analyst presentations coming up, including one Tuesday at the D.A. Davidson 9th Annual Technology Forum in New York.


**VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) had a solid day, up nearly 7% to 98.02, after the provider of cloud computing and platform virtualization software preannounced strong second-quarter results. VMware closed right at the top of an 11-week flat base with a 98.10 buy point.  **Dell Technologies** ([DVMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVMT)), which acquired VMware as a result of its acquisition of EMC last year, soared 7.5%.


It's a busy week of economic data, with July retail sales data due Tuesday, housing starts for July and the minutes from the most recent Fed meeting due Wednesday, and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index due Thursday.

Is it too early to snicker, "Brexit, Shmexit"?


Perhaps. While Wednesday's second straight sharp rebound in stocks was encouraging, after the shocking results last week from the U.K.'s referendum to leave the EU, it in no way signals a change in the rickety course of the market.


However, there are reasons enough for traders to keep a sharp eye out for new buying opportunities in the relatively light fallout seen in the major equity indexes, and in the way some stock market leaders behaved -- be it online game play **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) of China or domestic-focused property REITs in the U.S.


It's still a good market for stock pickers.


The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.9%, adding to Tuesday's 2.1% catapult. Combined, the rebound took back nearly two-thirds of its sharp losses seen on Friday and Monday. The S&P 500 was not far behind, up 1.7%; the Dow Jones industrials rose 1.6%. But none of these three indexes rallied heartily enough to take back their respective 50-day moving averages.

Volume was mixed, up on the Nasdaq but roughly 2% lower on the Big Board.


The media-hyped issue of global trade is no longer the realm of Donald Trump's rants. EU leaders gave the impression of solidarity and a unified stance toward making Brexit as smooth and as rapid as politically possible. Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, President Obama met with the leaders of America's key neighbors north and south to talk about strengthening economic ties and send a message to the world that there will be no "Mexit" or "Canexit" anytime soon.


It's far too early to conclude that the era of economic globalization is over, or even that the pace of commerce across borders is going to shift into a lower gear and get stuck at a slower speed for years, if not decades. The best approach that a savvy investor can take is to see what impact today's economic data is having on the financial markets, and to keep a sound watch list of growth companies that have the potential to lead any further market upside.


This week so far has actually shone a light on the slow yet steady growth of the U.S. economy. While Q1 GDP was slightly revised higher to a still paltry 1.1%, Tuesday's news included a big jump in the Conference Board's survey of consumer confidence (up to 98 in June vs. 92.6 in May). On Wednesday, traders digested another solid reading on the American consumer, as spending rose 0.4% in May, meeting the Econoday consensus view, to follow an unusually strong 1.1% gain in April.


Meanwhile, the core PCE inflation gauge, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, showed a solid 0.2% monthly increase, meeting the Street's view.


It may be surprising to some, but the size of the market's correction over the past few days hardly matches the size of declines that investors saw in late summer last year or at the start of 2016.


In August, the Nasdaq slipped 18% from an all-time high of 5231 to 4292; that decline included the Aug. 24 flash crash and was in reaction to a meltdown in mainland China equities. At the start of 2016, the tech-rich index tumbled from 5007 on Jan. 1 to 4209 on Feb. 11, a 16% roasting in less than six weeks' time.


The damage caused by the U.K. referendum so far: an 8% drop from the highest point in June near 4980 to Friday's low of 4574.


That's certainly enough to justify the recent change in the Market Pulse to "market in correction," because a correction can range from the mild (5% or more) to intermediate (10% plus) to the bear variety (20% minimum).


The IBD 50 saw many of its components rise sharply. The biggest decliner in the bunch, **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)), fell a measly 0.4% and is in need of a breather. The Denver-based operator of data centers is up a remarkable 54% year-to-date and up nearly that same amount from a breakout past a 60.20 base entry. Wall Street expects full-year funds from operations (the REIT industry's equivalent of earnings per share) rising 25% this year to $3.58 a share.


The list is also chock-full of high-quality stocks in the consumer goods, housing, tech and medical sectors. Due to poor EPS Ratings among most stocks in the energy sector, it's highly unlikely that you'll see many oil and gas stocks make the IBD 50. Yet this huge sector can still make an impact on stock market returns, especially with the rebound in crude oil still intact.

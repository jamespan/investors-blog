Nasdaq Regains Its 50-Day Line; Uptrend Resumes
================================================

The stock market continued to firm up Tuesday with just two more sessions left in the calendar year. And it was no surprise that the leading major index of the year once again took charge.


The Nasdaq composite gapped higher at the open and largely kept its solid gains throughout the session. The tech-filled index drove ahead 1.3% to end at 5107, notching a three-week high.

An index that tends to trade above a key support line, such as the 50-day or the 200-day, is signaling upward strength, raising the prospects that investors can make money going long.


A better than expected reading on consumer confidence and a solid rise in metropolitan housing prices in October likely emboldened buyers. The data reaffirmed positive economic data on U.S. personal income and spending last week.


In the prior two weeks of trading, the Nasdaq reflected investor nervousness, swinging sharply above and below the key support level.


However, as this column noted in Tuesday's IBD, the Monday decline was minimal, and the close was just a hair beneath the intraday high.


It was evidence that equity trading desks across the land were eager to support stocks.


With the Nasdaq back above the 5071 closing price of the rare Day 3 follow-through notched on Dec. 16 and a number of high-profile market leaders acting well, the current outlook in the daily Market Pulse now shifts from "Uptrend under pressure" to "Uptrend resumes."


Yet such a shift does not necessarily mean that one has to make dramatic changes in the portfolio. This was a year in which modest expectations for breakouts, highly disciplined loss-cutting and supreme stock selection mattered big.


On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 1.1%, taking back its 50-day line.


A wide swath of nontech-related names joined the rally, including oil explorers, hospitals and department stores.


There remains no doubt that the Nasdaq still represents many of the best growth stocks in the U.S. marketplace. As a market value-weighted index, it benefits from moves from its biggest members, including **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). The Google and YouTube operator has a market cap of $546 billion and continues to benefit from a worldwide embrace of the Internet and digital advertising.


The stock has done well since clearing two buy points this year (584.80 on July 14, 713.43 on Oct. 23). As the top of the Nasdaq's daily chart shows on page B4, Alphabet makes up 5.9% of the Nasdaq's total market valuation. The stock, up 50% since Jan. 1, has a lot to do with the Nasdaq's 7.9% year-to-date gain.


The big-cap techs, however, cannot hoist a market higher alone. The indexes are certainly getting a lot of help from defensive names. As Tuesday's Big Cap 20 column (see A14) observed, **Hormel Foods** ([HRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRL)), **Clorox** ([CLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLX)) and **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) have all joined the leadership.


Investors' thirst for yield has not gone away, either.


Big-cap REITs **AvalonBay Communities** ([AVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVB)) (2.7% yield, 186.99 buy point) and **Essex Property** ([ESS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESS)) (2.4% yield, 235.89 entry) rose sharply Tuesday.

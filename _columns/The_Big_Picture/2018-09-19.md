  Small Caps, Leading Stocks Sink; Is Wall Street Hinting At A New Sector Rotation?

Canadian cannabis play Tilray may have scored one of the biggest single-session gains on Wall Street in a very long while. Yet for those who avoid pot stocks, Wednesday's session still featured plenty of heart-pumping action across many sectors of securities — including oil and U.S. Treasuries.




Looking at the way the major indexes ended, however, it would have been pretty hard to tell.


Nasdaq-listed **Tilray** ([TLRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLRY)) gyrated from a gain of as much as 93.6% from Tuesday's close to an all-time high of 300. But it also briefly went negative in the final hour of trading before finishing with a still hefty rise of 41%. Trading was halted several times amid big volatility.

Meanwhile, the tech-, retail- and finance-focused composite index posted a ho-hum loss of less than 0.1%. Volume declined.


The S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher as rallies in banking, mining, oil, steel, auto and truck stocks offset a sell-off among utility, homebuilding and software shares.


The Dow Jones industrial average is not a leading index. Nevertheless, the Dow scored the day's biggest advance, up 0.6%, and is within an arm's grasp of challenging its record peak of 26,616, set on Jan. 26.


The Dow's action suggested that fund managers are moving more into large-cap stocks while taking profits in smaller companies. There was a shift across different sectors, too.


Wall Street And Industry Group Movement
---------------------------------------


It's worth noting that in the [current list of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-sep-19-2018/), ranked by six-month relative performance, the top 20 rungs today are stuffed with medical, retail, software and consumer-spending names. Will this vanguard of the market change dramatically? No one knows right now. Trends can last quite a while on the Street. Yet it's always worthwhile to watch for industry groups that catapult from the bottom half of the rankings to the top half.


Also watch for those who bust into the top quintile, or roughly the top 40 among 197 industry groups.


One big mover lately: Retail and wholesale auto parts. Through Wednesday's trade, the group has shifted from No. 91 six weeks ago to No. 20. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group has sprung to 46th place from 111th over the same time frame.


Will Bank, Insurance Stocks Rejoin The Leadership?
--------------------------------------------------


Banking, manufacturing and energy components enjoyed solid gains. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) is setting up a [potential breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



As seen on a weekly chart, the money-center bank has traded in an ultratight fashion for more than six weeks, resulting in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).


Money centers weren't the only financial stocks to shine on Wednesday. Insurance and superregional stocks rose 1% to 1.2% as groups. IBD's Insurance-Brokers group, No. 47 out of IBD's 197 groups, rallied 1%. Use [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com) and [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) to spot the leading stocks in this and other industry groups. Thinly traded [IBD 50 name](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Health Insurance Innovations** ([HIIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIIQ)) leads the insurance brokers group with a 97 Composite Rating.


Credit the sharp two-day rise in long-dated government bond yields for the rally in the financials on Wednesday. The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note is now at 3.08%, hitting levels not seen since May and rising 22 basis points since the start of September.


The sharp rise in the yield on the long end improves the overall shape of the yield curve, benefiting lenders. Higher yields in the debt arena also help insurance companies as they reinvest the proceeds of old debt with new bonds.


Small Caps Lag
--------------


As if to accentuate the strength in megacaps, companies with market caps in the range of $10 billion or less underperformed. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 0.7% and came within 1 point of touching its 50-day moving average. Yet at 1070, the S&P 600 continues to beat the S&P 500 with a year-to-date gain of 14%. The 500 is up 8.8% since Jan. 1.


The Russell 2000 lost 0.5%. The S&P MidCap 400 edged 0.3% lower.


The broad decline among smaller companies likely led to negative breadth on Wall Street on Wednesday. Losers beat winners by a nearly 6-5 ratio on the NYSE, 8 to 7 on the Nasdaq.


As the accompanying Market Pulse table shows, Wednesday also served as a profit-taking session for numerous leaders. This may come as no surprise, given the stunning advance that many high-growth stocks enjoyed in August.


Wall Street And IBD 50 Stocks
-----------------------------


Consider the [Innovator IBD 50](http://www.innovatoretfs.com/etf/?ticker=ffty) ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund. FFTY sold off hard on Wednesday, dropping 2%. Like the S&P 600, it too came within a whisker's width of touching the 50-day moving average.


Yet here's a case when a monthly chart can actually offer perspective as well.


FFTY rallied 9.9% in August. That marked its biggest monthly gain since the ETF started trading in April 2015. At 37.05, the fund is still up a handsome 11.5% since Jan. 1. It shot up 34% in 2017.



Medical stocks also seem to be heating up.


**Pacira Pharmaceuticals** ([PCRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCRX)) rallied 7% to 51.35, busting past a 48.50 [valid buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [deep bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/). It's formed a [large cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) that stretches back to at least late November.


The Street sees the innovator in drug delivery technology growing earnings 157% to 54 cents a share this year and 122% in 2019.


Look at the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrials, and three pharmaceutical giants — **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) — through Wednesday's close sport an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A or A+. The only other Dow Jones stock with an A Accumulation grade? **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) with an A-. (See the Acc/Dis scores for all 30 components via the General Market Indicators PDF link below.)


Leaders In The Energy Sector
----------------------------



Crude oil continues to lead in 2018. WTI near-term futures are trading at $71.67 a barrel, up more than 18% year to date.


**Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)), another [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), rallied more than 2% to notch new highs. Shares have now jumped 58% since breaking out of a nine-week [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) at 26.29 on April 5 in massive volume.

Tech Stocks Lead Stock Market Despite Big Jump In 10-Year Yield; Amazon Surges On Cloud Growth
===============================================================================================

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) fueled a big rally for the Nasdaq composite Friday, although the stock market wasn't sure how to react initially to the January employment report, which came in much better than expected and prompted more selling in the bond market.




The economy added 467,000 jobs in January, well above the 150,000 Econoday consensus. [November and December job growth](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-defies-omicron-as-wage-growth-surges-stock-market-doesnt-like-it/) was revised sharply higher by a combined 709,000. Wages increased 0.7% from December and were up 5.7% year over year. The data spooked Wall Street at first because it means the Fed might have to be more aggressive with rate hikes this year to combat persistently high inflation.

The Nasdaq shrugged off a big jump in the 10-year Treasury yield, which gapped up over its recent high of 1.87% and spiked 10 basis points to 1.93%. The yield hit its highest level in a little more than two years.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Some sellers came into the market during the final 15 minutes of trading, but the Nasdaq still ended with a gain of 1.6% in lower volume. The index climbed back above the 14,000 level.


The Nasdaq 100 picked up 1.3%, helped by a 13.5% gain for Amazon. Revenue growth slowed again at Amazon, up 9% to $137 billion, but the company's cloud division, Amazon Web Services, showed good growth, up nearly 40% to $17.78 billion.

Amazon is in a position like most other technology stocks at the moment, stuck below key moving averages and not actionable. New leaders in the tech sector will emerge at some point, but they need to form [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/) first.


**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) also rose sharply in the Nasdaq 100. All three appear to be forming bases.


Winners beat losers on the Nasdaq and NYSE by less than 2-to-1.


The S&P 500 rose nearly 1.4% in afternoon trading, but the gain faded to 0.5% by the close. Volume rose from Thursday. The Russell 2000 small-cap index rose 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged lower. Nasdaq volume fell, and preliminary data showed NYSE volume was higher.


Oil and gas stocks dominated the upside in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) as oil prices rose again. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $92.31 a barrel, up 2.3%, after hitting a seven-year high. For the week, oil rose more than 6%.


[Oil stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) have been running higher for a while, resulting in a lot of extended stocks in the sector. But several names are still near buy points, including **Civitas Resources** ([CIVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIVI)), **SM Energy** ([SM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SM)), **PBF Energy** ([PBF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBF)), **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)) and **Weatherford** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)).


[Financial stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansach/) and insurance stocks are showing relative strength. **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) is still in range from its 10-week moving average after a recent breakout, while insurance stocks like **Prudential Financial** ([PRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRU)), **American International Group** ([AIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIG)), **W.R. Berkley** ([WRB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WRB)) and **Brighthouse Financial** ([BHF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHF)) have [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) at or near highs.

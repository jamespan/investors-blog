The Nasdaq scored a fourth straight day of gains on Wednesday, rising almost 0.7% to lead a pretty broad advance ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.




The S&P 500 and the S&P SmallCap 600 both trailed with gains of 0.4% apiece. Volume fell on both main exchanges.


Strength in internet, chip, software and retail names (think the likes of **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), [a half position in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders)) helped boost the Nasdaq composite to an all-time high and an 8.8% gain for the quarter that began on Oct. 1.


That comes well short of an unusual 16.5% rebound in Q1 this year, which came on the heels of a swift bear market in the fourth quarter of 2018. But this quarter's gains smash a 3.6% rise in Q2 and a less-than 0.1% cooling in Q3.

Trailing The Nasdaq, Big Time
-----------------------------


The Dow utility average inched up less than 1 point. At 852, the index of electric, gas and water suppliers enjoys a 19.6% year-to-date advance. Thus, income investors can certainly count their blessings. Yet utilities have lagged in the current quarter, down 3% since Oct. 1.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 0.7% on Wednesday and marked its highest levels since Aug. 1. At 35.42, the growth stock-heavy ETF now shows a 28.2% advance since Jan. 1.


It seems like Black Friday has become a misnomer, with retailers already touting their biggest discounts of the year for weeks. And judging by the action in stocks lately, it feels like the Santa Claus rally has arrived early as well. While no one can perfectly predict the future, four factors may help keep the market's bullish momentum strong in the remaining weeks of 2019.


Reason 1: Breakouts Are Gaining Traction
----------------------------------------


The market keeps furnishing breakouts.


On Wednesday, **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) cleared a 175.38 early buy point in a large cup base that also loosely carries [the elements of a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). (The regular buy point is at 179.05.) Autodesk [beat profit views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/autodesk-earnings-q3-2020-adsk-stock/). Watch for sharp and sudden pullbacks. During the [Wednesday IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=icmhpbrdcstmsg|cms|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|707596&src=A00387A), panelists noted that the industrial design software leader has a habit of testing growth investors' intestinal fortitude with dips right back to or below the breakout price.



Indian lending giant **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) (92 Composite Rating, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-h-d-f-c-bank-ltd-adr-hdb.aspx)) rose 1% and trotted past a 63.11 entry in a [large cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). It ranks No. 31 in the IBD 50. Volume was bone dry, not a surprise during a pre-Thanksgiving session. So, watch for potential further gains in heavy turnover.


Notice in HDFC's prior breakout, turnover in the week ended March 15 jumped sharply vs. the prior week and came in 22% above the 10-week average.


[Wednesday's Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/jabil-stock-13-year-high-contract-manufacturer-diversifies/), **Jabil** ([JBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBL)), has quietly smacked market bears with a 20% gain since its breakout at 32.50. Now, a three weeks tight has formed. And **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)), a huge winner in recent weeks, got the nod in today's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/growth-stocks-to-buy-planet-fitness-nears-buy-point-ibd-50/).

Reason 2: Market Internals Improve
----------------------------------


The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remains light. The market continues to chalk up more stocks making new 52-week or all-time highs vs. new lows.


Check out the [new highs list of Nov. 26](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-nov-26-2019/).


The total of Nasdaq and NYSE-listed issues marking a 52-week or all-time peak came one shy of 300, vs. 64 names making new lows. [Ditto performance for the Nov. 25 list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-nov-25-2019/). Stocks in the Banks, Medical, Finance and Software sectors have topped the list lately.


Keep track of the totals each day in [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


As seen in the daily chart linked at the bottom of every Big Picture column, the 50-day moving average of the S&P 500 has been ramping higher for more than five weeks. This is normal action after IBD upgraded the current outlook to "uptrend resumes" on Oct. 15.


Reasons 3 And 4
---------------


Finally, the market continues to make new highs amid a Goldilocks mix of low inflation and decent economic growth in the U.S. In addition, there are hopes for a return to growth in Europe, and acceptance that both the mega economies in China and India won't grow as rapidly as they did a decade ago.


Steady action in the U.S. Treasury markets, meanwhile, seems to indicate that both bond traders and the Federal Reserve are at peace with the current state of inflation and the economy. Too much inflation has proved to be a bull market killer. A sudden hike in short-term interest rates has stopped the U.S. economy dead in its tracks in the past. And you can bet that it can happen again in the future, too.


On Wednesday, the government revised its Q3 GDP gain to 2.1% from an initial 1.9% reading.


Weekly jobless claims fell by 15,000, to 213,000, well below the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Durable goods orders rose 0.6% last month, crushing views for a 0.7% drop.


The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note yielded 1.77% on Wednesday, up from 1.73% on Nov. 1.


Beyond Nasdaq: Stock Market Caveats
-----------------------------------


The market is certainly exercising patience over the actual delivery, not promises, of a phase-one trade deal between the U.S. and China. Reuters had reported earlier in the week that top U.S. government officials may fly to China to finalize decisions on not just tariffs but also thorny issues such as enforcement of intellectual property rights.


Second, watch for excessive optimism. It's true that after a long run-up, some bull markets die of euphoria, not old age.


The [bulls vs. bears survey by Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) shows a 58% bullish ratio for this week, up slightly from 57.2% last week. The market has in recent years tended to trip into a meaningful decline, if not full blown correction, when this ratio surpasses 60%. Why? Too much optimism implies that most if not all market participants are fully invested in equities and are wishing for further gains.

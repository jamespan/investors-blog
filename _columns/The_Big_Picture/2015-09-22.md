Stocks sold off broadly Tuesday, as the indexes started to swerve off a monthlong uptrend. The Nasdaq gapped down to a 1.5% loss, and the S&P 500 fell 1.2%. It was the second decline of more than 1% in the past three sessions for both.


Indexes trimmed losses in the afternoon, but their price charts were left with a distinct mark: Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have broken below trend lines touching the lows since August.


That's a sign of weakness, and it came three sessions after another bearish sign, when the Nasdaq met resistance at its 50-day moving average.


Volume rose on the main exchanges Tuesday. Decliners beat advancers by roughly 4-to-1.


With higher volume and index losses, the market added a distribution day. That's four instances of major institutional selling since the Sept. 8 follow-through.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are below their Sept. 8 closing prices.


A global sell-off overnight — its causes were not so clear — spread to Wall Street.


London's FTSE 100 plunged 2.8%, the German DAX 3.8% and the Stoxx Europe 600 3.1%. In Asia, the Shanghai composite rose 0.9%.


In U.S. exchanges, defensive industry groups such as auto parts, food, utilities and discount chains performed relatively better. Metals, transportation and building stocks lagged. The Dow transportation average skidded 2.5%.


Commodities struggled. Crude oil declined 1.8%, Comex gold 0.8% and copper 3.4%, while grains were broadly lower. Worries about China's economy are causing investors to flee those assets and are causing problems for equities too.


Biotech and other drug stocks got slammed for a second straight day.


**Sucampo** ([SCMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCMP)) (down 10%), **Valeant** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX))(5%) and**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN))(3.5%) were some of the medicals in the bottom of the IBD 50. The index fell 1.2%.


One day after a tweet attacking high drug costs, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan to control prices. It includes programs forcing the pharmaceutical industry to give up tens of billions of dollars a year in tax breaks and having the government negotiate prices directly with drug manufacturers, Bloomberg reported.


The day's weakness didn't do much harm to the bases taking shape among many leading stocks, notably some big caps.


**Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **Universal Health Services** ([UHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UHS)), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) are still on track with patterns.


But breakouts are a delicate matter these days.


**Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)), **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) and **Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)) illustrate how difficult it is for growth stocks to rise from buy areas when the market is wobbly. There's little reason for investors to stick their necks out much until conditions improve.


Economic news didn't help stocks. The Richmond Fed regional factory survey followed New York and Philadelphia with disappointing results. Richmond's September reading sank into contraction at -5. It was below expectations.

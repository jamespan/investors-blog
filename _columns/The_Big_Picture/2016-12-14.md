After getting the news it had been expecting for months, the stock market fell Wednesday.


The Federal Reserve increased the fed funds rate by a quarter point, to a range of 0.5% to 0.75%, only the second increase since it began a frenetic loosening during the financial crisis of 2008. The indexes were volatile in the moments following the 2 p.m. ET announcement, then went lower.


The Nasdaq closed with a loss of 0.5% and the S&P 500 down 0.8%. Both finished near session lows. Other corners of the market didn't fare much better. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1.3%. The Dow industrials — which have rallied since November like it was the 1990s Nasdaq — dropped 0.6%. The IBD 50 fell 0.5%.

That gave the S&P 500 a new [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). But the number of higher-volume declines had been easing as a cluster of distribution in October and early November expired.


The Dow utilities average was hammered 2.1%. With bond yields on a clear upward path, the dividends offered by utilities become less attractive to investors.


Real estate investment trusts also are vulnerable for the same reason. The Vanguard REIT ETF ([VNQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNQ)) fell 2.2%. The SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF ([RWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RWR)) shed 2.1%.


Banking stocks were down modestly. Banks are a primary beneficiary of higher lending rates, which was one reason the sector rallied the past five weeks. The 10-year Treasury yield surged to a two-year high of 2.5%. The fact that bank stocks were quiet suggests there was some of that "buy on the rumor, sell on the news."


If the rise in interest rates was no surprise on Wall Street, why did stocks fade?


For one, the Fed's outlook for its next monetary moves wasn't so dovish. The Fed signaled it will continue to rates next year, with perhaps three increases. Prior expectations were for only two more increases. Chairwoman Janet Yellen said a strengthening economy — a view that the November payrolls report backed — was a factor in the new rate policy.


A pullback in the indexes would not be a surprise at this point in the market's superb postelection climb, regardless of the Fed.


The S&P 500, Dow industrials and Russell 2000 have been motoring at steep rates and reaching record highs. Indexes topped long-held levels of resistance starting in July and are well above those watermarks.


The Nasdaq 100 took longer to top its prior peak from 2000, but is now at record highs. But its relative strength line has been lagging, reflecting some sluggish action in major techs such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


The end of the year usually brings the so-called Santa Claus rally, and that may help the market stretch its advance. The S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.4% since 1950 during the last five days of the year and the first two days of the new year, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.


The energy sector was weakest Wednesday. The Fed's move lifted the dollar against other currencies, which caused dollar-priced oil contracts to fall 3.7% to $51.04 a barrel. Crude already was under pressure from a persistent supply glut.

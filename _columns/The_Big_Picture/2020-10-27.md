You could perhaps describe Tuesday's stock market performance as a mini paradox.




The Nasdaq scored an up day. Bulls, of course, favor that. But it's one that didn't inspire a whole lot of confidence.


The S&P 500, meanwhile, scored a down day. Bears, naturally, favor that. But it's one that — at least viewed through the lens of the S&P 500's chart — doesn't exactly warrant a Halloween-like ghastly shriek, either.


Thirdly, growth stocks showed checkered action. That perhaps reaffirms just how mixed Wednesday's trading turned out to be.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP_4x2_102720-162x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite's 0.6% gain ate into Monday's sell-off. That's bullish. Yet it recouped well less than half of that day's 1.6% pounding. Volume lightened vs. the prior day. This suggested institutional investors bought cautiously. And the Nasdaq itself, while holding above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), is not far from testing that key technical level again.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500's 0.3% loss wasn't what an optimist would have liked to see after Monday's 1.9% shellacking. However, at 3390, the large-cap benchmark closed Tuesday's session just a 0.5% hop away from potentially returning above its own [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Volume fell on both exchanges.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), a good proxy for top growth stocks, rebounded 0.4%. It stopped short of crossing back above the 50-day moving average.


Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ([GBTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBTC)) surged 9% and cleared a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) and its 14.88 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Volume spiked 156% above the 50-day average of 5.6 million shares for the exchange traded fund.

Nasdaq Quiets Down, For A Day At Least
--------------------------------------


On another technical note, all three of the above indexes staged an [inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/).


Was that good or bad? It's too early to tell.


Economic news did not seem to sway the market much.


The Case-Shiller home prices index showed bigger-than-forecast increases for August, according to [Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Durable goods orders rose 1.9% in September vs. the prior month, arching well above [economists' expectation of a 0.4% increase](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). But consumer confidence weakened in October. Reuters noted that in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida, the confidence index plunged. All three states are critical to the fate of both candidates in the Nov. 3 presidential election.


Regular readers of The Big Picture column probably did not flinch an eye at Tuesday's market action. After all, [just as Monday's story highlighted](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-sells-off-these-signals-spark-doubts-about-market-direction/), the current outlook for stocks got a downgrade to "uptrend under pressure," as the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back all of its post-follow-through-day gains.


The Nasdaq's gain masked disappointing breadth. Losing issues actually beat winners on that all-electronic exchange by a 3-2 margin. New highs have fallen to a driplike pace. These numbers do not boost the odds for an individual stock picker to make money.


Still The No. 1 Word On Wall Street
-----------------------------------


On the other hand, the market leadership does not look that shabby at all. Why? Earnings, a word that remains No. 1 on Wall Street, have continued to exceed beaten-down expectations.


Analysts at wealth management firm Glenmede note that "consensus estimates ... now point to earnings reaching their previous high by the third quarter of 2021. The gradual climb back to normal reflects the ongoing reopening as well as attempts by businesses to control costs during the pandemic."


Meanwhile, Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, argues that the U.S. economy has "returned to a 2%-2.5% sustainable growth trajectory" even without a fourth rescue package that has failed to leave the floors of Congress.


"This baseline economic forecast rests on a number of factors including the improvement in household balance sheets, the aggressive restructuring of corporate balance sheets, and strong position of bank balance sheets," Ricchiuto wrote in a note to clients.

Stock Indexes End Win Streaks, But Bulls Find Cause For Hope
=============================================================

U.S. stock indexes ended their win streaks Thursday, but the losses were minor and in lighter volume.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each slipped 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average was up a fraction. Small caps took the hardest rap. The Russell 2000 lost 0.4%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were both gunning for an eighth up-day in a row. For the first 15 minutes of trade, the indexes stayed positive. But then they reversed and finished in the red. Still, both closed well off session lows.

Bulls had to expect an end to the win streak sooner rather than later, and they no doubt appreciated the lower volume. Rising, powerful volume would've suggested institutional selling. There were few hints of that.


The PowerShares KBW Bank ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)), an exchange-traded fund, had been setting a fast pace, rising 1.2%, 1.9% and 1% in the first three sessions this week. But Thursday, the bank ETF dropped 0.5%. Other bank ETFs fell modestly.


Bank stocks have played a big part in the so-called Trump rally, with the bank ETF gaining 29% since the Election Day close. Higher interest rates are expected to improve the banks' net interest margins.


Other catalysts, which have nothing to do with President Trump, emerged Thursday.


The Philadelphia Fed's business outlook survey trashed the pessimists on the Street. The gauge for February came in at 43.3 demolishing the consensus view for 19.3. Even more impressive, the reading was the highest since November 1983 and far above the highest estimate in the range, which was 24. The Philly survey reflects rates of change in manufacturing conditions.


Coupled with Wednesday's Empire State Manufacturing survey, which smashed the 7.5 consensus estimate with a 18.7 reading, and investors could be looking at signs of an improving economy.


Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims rolled in at 239,000 or about 3% fewer than expected.


Housing starts for January topped views by about 1%, and permits were about 4% above the consensus view. Permits, which are considered a sign of future homebuilding, topped the highest estimate in the range. Building permits in the South reached the highest level in almost 10 years. The South is the largest region in the U.S. for homebuilding.


Yet, the housing data failed to impress the major U.S. homebuilders. For example, **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) fell 0.33 to 30.43 in soft trade. That sort of action was fairly typical of the group Thursday.

Major stock indexes traded in a tight range Monday, ending moderately lower in light volume. On the surface, it had the appearance of a quiet session, but headline flow was quite busy.


The Dow and S&P 500 lost 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.2%. Small caps lagged a bit, with the Russell 2000 down 0.5%. The IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks fell 0.3%. Volume fell from Friday's levels, but volume was heavy Friday, mostly like due to end-of-quarter portfolio moves by fund managers.


The S&P 500 gapped down at the open but ended in the upper half of its intraday range, after the [ISM manufacturing index](https://www.investors.com/news/ism-manufacturing-index-signals-return-to-factory-growth/) came in better than expected, at 51.5. The index contracted slightly in August but moved back into expansion mode last month.


Meanwhile, the British pound was in focus again after Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to start pulling the U.K. out of the European Union by March. The pound shed 1% against the U.S. dollar, but the weakness fueled a 1.2% gain for London's FTSE 100 index.


The S&P 500, Dow and NYSE composite remain below their 50-day moving averages. The leading indexes at this point are the Nasdaq and Russell 2000. Go ahead and throw the IBD 50 in there, too, which continues to hold above its 50-day line.

Another deal made headlines Monday when Bass Pro Shops announced plans to acquire **Cabela's** ([CAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAB)) for around $5.5 billion, or 65.50 a share. Shares of Cabela's soared 15% to 63.18.


Meanwhile, M&A chatter was rampant again on the heels of last week's news that **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) might be close to a deal to acquire **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)). Shares of **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) rallied another 4% after **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) re-emerged as a potential buyer. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), meanwhile, jumped 4%. It's been mentioned as a takeover target in the past. Possible suitors include **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


![mp100316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP100316.jpg)So how healthy does the market look at this point? At first glance, seven distribution days for the S&P 500 might look alarming, but four of those higher-volume declines showed losses of 0.2% to 0.4%. Three showed declines ranging from 0.9% to 2.45%.


Translation? It's a market under mild distribution, which means the uptrend still must be respected. Another reason not to get too bearish is that leading growth stocks continue to hold up well.


M&A talk, a strengthening IPO market and Q3 earnings season could provide a cushion for the market in coming weeks.


Still, it's not an easy market by any means. Volatility is still out there, which makes it difficult to hold long positions with conviction. Any new positions should be small to start. If they work, great. If they don't, cut losses quickly.


Inside the IBD 50, **B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS)) is setting up in cup-with-handle base with a 50.91 buy point. **Macom Technology** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) is also in a cup-with-handle base with a 44.20 buy point.


**Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) is working on a flat base with a 44.64 buy point.


Also in the IBD 50, **Nautilus** ([NLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NLS)) and **Acacia** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) are testing their 50-day moving averages for the first time after recent breakouts.


IBD's Computer-Integrated Systems group was the day's top performer, helped by another big move by new issue **Nutanix** ([NTNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTNX)). Shares rose 20% after doubling in their debut Friday. It's the second "unicorn" to come public this year, i.e., a private company with a market capitalization of least $1 billion. **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) is the other.


Airlines outperformed Monday but only two stocks in the 21-member group are showing relative strength: **Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)) and Panama-based **Copa Holdings** ([CPA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPA)).

Nasdaq, S&P 500 Ease, But Uptrend Undisturbed
==============================================

The stock market closed mainly lower Tuesday, but its new uptrend remained undisturbed. The Nasdaq lost 0.2% while the S&P 500 eased 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average managed a 0.1% gain, its fourth straight win.

  

Volume rose, but the index declines were too small to be construed as distribution, or institutional-sized selling.

  

If the indexes had trouble finding direction Tuesday, they were merely displaying a symptom of a longer trend.

  

Investors normally talk about market direction in terms of trends lasting weeks or months. But this year, the market has had a tough time staying in one direction for very long.

  

So far in 2015, the longest winning and losing streaks have lasted no more than three weeks on the S&P 500 or Nasdaq.

  

Aside from a prolific February, moves measured in percentage points have been less than 5%.

  

Part of the problem is that the market seems to be recalibrating its interest-rate outlook. What seemed like a certain rate hike this spring now could be further off in the distance because of mixed economic reports. That's been a relief to Wall Street.

  

The market also may just be trying to adjust to altitude. Indexes are trying to stretch an advance that dates back to at least October 2011. The Nasdaq faces a psychological test as it climbs within reach of its all-time high at 5132.

  

The choppy environment means that investors must stay tuned to the latest market signals and be ready to adjust swiftly.

  

One ingredient that the market could use now is more upside volume. The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are languishing at around D.

  

Peel back the major averages, and you'll see another layer of the general market looking more firm: leading stocks.

  

In the past couple of weeks, several high-rated stocks have broken out of bases.

  

As we delve deeper, the market advance shows signs that it enjoys broad participation. The advance-decline lines of the NYSE and Nasdaq are trending higher. (The NYSE A/D line is plotted on the S&P 500 chart on Page B4.)

  

The IBD 50 rose 0.3%, easily outperforming the broad market. It managed that move despite sharp losses from Chinese companies **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)), which slid 4% and 5%, respectively.

  

Energy stocks were broadly weaker Tuesday as the price of crude oil fell nearly 4%.

  

Metals also struggled, while discount retailers lagged after **Wal-Mart Stores**' ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) first-quarter earnings and same-store sales missed analysts' estimates.

  

But housing starts rose 20.2% in April from March to an annual rate of 1.135 million. It was the highest level since November 2007 and above forecasts.

  

The rise helped homebuilders and other construction-related stocks lead the market. Yet a lot of building stocks gave up early gains.

  

Banking and other financials also outperformed. Rising bond yields are helping the sector. **The SPDR Financial** ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) ETF has broken out of a pattern.

U.S. stocks showed a gritty quality Friday, shrugging off bad news and refusing to give ground.


The Nasdaq added 0.1%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.1%. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 1.3% as chip stocks continued to rally.


Volume fell across the board.


A mark of a strong uptrend is the ability to handle negative news. The stock market suffered two hard knocks before the market's open, but shook them off.


![mp012717](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP012717-226x300.png)The first punch was a weak reading on fourth-quarter GDP. Growth came in at 1.9%, below the consensus target of 2.2% and just one tick higher than the lowest estimate in the range.


Bad numbers usually carry an excuse, and this time around it was soybeans. Soybeans? Yes, exports of soybeans plunged 4.3%, dragging down the GDP figure.


The bulls found this easy to ignore, partly because of good data elsewhere in the report. Business spending on equipment rose 3.1%, ending four quarterly declines. This item is a fairly good indicator of business confidence in future economic growth.


But the market had more to deal with than soft GDP growth.


Durable goods orders for December provided the second punch. The Street expected a 2.6% gain, but the gauge signaled a drop of 0.4%. This was far below the entire range of estimates, which pegged 1.5% as the most pessimistic guess and a loopy 7% from the most optimistic estimate.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Excessive complacency is bad news for individuals, and markets. [The CBOE Volatility Index hit a fresh two-and-a-half-year low](https://www.investors.com/news/the-only-thing-investors-have-to-fear-is-no-fear-itself/) on Friday, nearly reaching its lowest point since early 2007.*

At this junction, the market seems to be more about confidence than facts. In a way, this is appropriate. Confidence can have a long reach. Facts can mislead, especially if the investor is focused on the small stuff.


On Friday, the University of Michigan reported a 98.5 reading on its consumer confidence survey. The Street expected 98.2.


This, along with the business spending, is encouraging.


Many stocks are setting up and could deliver breakouts soon. They include some of the bank stocks in the Big Cap 20, and some high-rated chip stocks.


For example, chipmaker **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) is sketching a base that shows several weeks of net accumulation. Fidelity OTC Portfolio, a fund that carries an A+ IBD rating, expanded its stake 43% in the fourth quarter.


Qorvo's relative strength line is approaching a 52-week high. The company will report quarterly results Wednesday. The Street expects earnings to grow 22%.


**Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)), another chipmaker, is building a base-on-base pattern. Macom will report Tuesday after the close. The Street expects earnings to leap 47%.

Stocks coasted to a quiet outcome Thursday as the market awaited the second take on first-quarter GDP.


The Nasdaq crept up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was flat. The Dow Jones industrial average edged down 0.1%. The IBD 50 advanced 0.3%. Volume fell on both major exchanges.


From a chart perspective, a pause in the indexes was natural after a 5% pop off the lows.


Bulls and bears have been in an uneasy standoff. The recent 6% dip in the Nasdaq was well-contained, and the major indexes showed confidence as they climbed last week and rose further this week. However, the current high distribution-day count serves as a reminder that this market could easily get itself into trouble.


Part of the reason for the unease is that the bullish camp is divided. This isn't just bulls vs. bears -- it's also bulls vs. bulls.


![MP052616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP052616-207x300.jpg)The growth-focused bulls would prefer to see stronger economic growth. Faster growth would bury any lingering fears of recession and hopefully let the market return to a more historically normal environment.


The rates-focused bulls would prefer to see rates stay low, even at the price of puny economic growth.


Friday's GDP report could reveal just which camp is likely to control the market in the near term. The rates camp has prevailed for years, but it recently appears less certain that the Fed will continue to protect investors from a harsh world.


Watch the market's reaction Friday morning. The Street expects that the 0.5% GDP growth reported in late April will be revised to a consensus 0.9%. Estimates range from 0.5% to 1.1%.


Bears might be getting a laugh out of the divide among the bulls. From the perma-bears perspective, the growth bulls are foolishly optimistic and the rate-focused bulls are like overprotected children whose whining and sniffling for an accommodating Fed won't be tolerated forever.


Who's right? The market itself will eventually settle the argument. No other indicator is necessary.


On Thursday, economic news was mostly encouraging. Durable goods orders for April demolished expectations: 3.4% growth vs. 0.3% expected. First-time jobless claims were less than feared. Pending home sales in April smashed views, up 5.1% vs. the consensus estimate of  0.8%.


On the negative side, the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing gauge missed views, minus 5 in May vs. minus 4 in April.



Two discount retailers broke out Thursday after [solid earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/news/dollar-tree-dollar-general-shares-jump-on-excellent-q1-earnings/?ven=YahooCP&src=AURLLED&ven=yahoo). **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) lunged 3.88 to 88.01. The stock cleared a 87.52 buy point in a base-on-base pattern. **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) gapped up 10.04 to 88.40 in huge volume. The stock leapt over an 83.82 buy point.


Of the two stocks, Dollar General has the higher Composite Rating, 93 vs. Dollar Tree's 62. A rating of 93 means the stock is the top 7 percentile among all the stocks in IBD's database.

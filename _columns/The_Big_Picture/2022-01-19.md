title: Stock Market Keeps Falling As This Index Flashes 'Death Cross'

The stock market continued to search for an elusive bottom, while demolishing what's left of the market's stock leadership.




In general, the market remains volatile and discontent. A promising early bounce quickly vanished Wednesday.


The Nasdaq composite was up 1% and fluctuated the rest of the session. It closed 1.1% lower, spending a second consecutive day below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). The Nasdaq's drop of more than 10% is what most of Wall Street would consider a correction, which concurs with [IBD's new market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/sellers-wrench-nasdaq-small-caps-clues-that-reveal-a-coming-bear-market/).


The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1% after a poor afternoon of trading. All three major indexes closed near session lows for the third time in the past four days. That's a characteristic of a market correction.


After breaching multiple support levels, it's difficult to determine where the stock market indexes could find a bottom. The Nasdaq might test its October low near 14,180. The S&P might test its November and December lows around 4500. The Dow is nearing the 200-day moving average, where it found support twice in December.


'Death Cross' For Small Caps
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP01922-246x300.jpg)Small caps took a larger loss as the Russell 2000 slid 1.6% to its lowest point in one year. The Russell's 50-day moving average fell below the 200-day line.


Such a "death cross" is considered a bearish signal, although that's more folklore than fact. After each death cross in the Russell 2000's history, the index climbed 4.2% three months later and 7.7% in next six months, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Little is left standing from the market leadership that helped make 2021 such a good year on Wall Street.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index plunged 3.1% in a second straight steep drop. The chip index is now more than 6% below its 50-day moving average. IBD's chip-equipment industry tumbled 3.6%.


Automakers, which had rallied on a bullish EV outlook, have fallen more than 21% off highs as a group. Homebuilders' 13% December rally is practically wiped out. Even financials — beneficiaries of surging Treasury yields — have fallen nearly 4% so far this week.


The IBD 50 fell 2.7% Wednesday and is at the lowest level since March of 2021.


Stock Market Correction Means New Tactics
-----------------------------------------


With practically no place to invest in the stock market, investors need to be defensive. IBD's market outlook of "correction" requires a move to cash. Avoid buying more stocks, and be patient until the market improves.


Taking profits is a smart move, and certainly no one should be in margin.


Sell signals become even more important. Many leaders, including IBD 50 stocks, are making round trips back to their buy points. Others have fallen more than 7% below buy points.

There was strength in mining stocks Wednesday, as the group surged nearly 7%. Much of the movement was in low-price stocks, although **Pretium Resources** ([PVG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVG)) is nearing a 14.89 buy point.


Major Stock Market Movers
-------------------------


Dow component **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) jumped more than 3% after the consumer goods giant topped analysts' estimates with fourth-quarter earnings of $1.66 a share. Sales rose 6% as [price increases accounted for half the quarter's revenue growth](https://www.wsj.com/articles/procter-gamble-says-shoppers-are-unbowed-by-higher-prices-11642593626?mod=hp_lead_pos10).


**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) erased all gains from its 58.73 buy point, which is a [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/amazon-stock-amzn-triggered-key-profit-taking-rule-before-flashing-sell-signals/). It is now trying to hold at its 50-day line. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) closed below the 50-day line for the first time since Oct. 18. **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) reversed lower after the chip-equipment company reported [mixed fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/asml-stock-chip-gear-maker-posts-mixed-q4-report/).


But **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) closed higher despite trimming gains. Both reported fourth-quarter earnings.


Morgan Stanley regained its 200-day moving average after falling below that line Tuesday. The company [beat profit expectations with EPS of $2.01](https://www.investors.com/news/morgan-stanley-stock-morgan-stanley-earnings-q4-2021/), though revenue of $14.524 billion missed views.


BofA trimmed its gain to 0.4% and escaped a sell signal after the bank [beat Q4 profit expectations](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-americas-quarterly-profit-rises-28-11642593743?mod=hp_lead_pos3). Earnings climbed 39% to 82 cents a share.

The Nasdaq composite sold off Friday after reversing from strong gains, while New York became the latest U.S. state to issue a lockdown order and London announced its own lockdown measures. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed with a 3.8% loss after rising as much as 2.9%. With the indexes still above their [coronavirus stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) correction lows, the uptrend attempt remains intact, but in trouble.




The S&P 500 lost 4.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average descended 4.5%, or 913 points. Leading growth stocks also fell sharply: The IBD 50 fell 3.3%. Volume on both main exchanges was higher than Thursday's session, boosted by quadruple witching.


New Rally Attempt Continues, As U.S. Coronavirus Cases Mount
------------------------------------------------------------


On Feb. 25, IBD [downgraded the stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) to a market in correction and the Nasdaq tumbled as much as 25% to Wednesday's low price from the closing price on Feb. 25.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP031920-1-288x300.jpg)Despite Friday's bearish reversal, Thursday's bullish gains kicked off a new rally attempt. As long as the major indexes don't hit new correction lows, investors should be waiting for confirmation of a new potential uptrend, called a follow-through. [Follow-throughs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) typically occur on Day 4 or later of a rally attempt, so that [bullish signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) could be as soon as Tuesday.


While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 undercut Thursday's lows, it is more important for indexes to stay above the low of the market correction.


The coronavirus outbreak continues to spread rapidly in the U.S. with confirmed cases topping 18,000, along with 233 deaths Friday, according to [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) data. Meanwhile, global coronavirus cases topped 270,000.


While the current stock market is bleak, be prepared for a trend-change signal with a [watchlist of top stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) holding up the best amid the market turmoil. Stocks to watch include e-commerce giants **Amazon**.**com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), and graphics-chip maker **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Top Stocks To Watch: Alibaba, Amazon, Nvidia
--------------------------------------------



Stocks holding up the best amid the recent stock market sell-offs include e-commerce stocks Amazon and Alibaba. Meanwhile, chip leader Nvidia found much-needed support around its long-term 200-day line the past week. All three stocks have [relative strength lines at or near new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/), a very bullish technical indicator during periods of market weakness.

Alibaba stock has stabilized around its long-term 200-day moving average. Shares are still about 20% off their 52-week high and far from their 50-day line. According to China officials, there were no new local infections Thursday for the first time since the outbreak began. The Chinese government said all new cases came from outside the country. Shares edged higher Friday.


Amazon briefly reclaimed its 50-day line Friday before reversing sharply lower, ending with a 1.9% decline. The right side of a new base could be forming, but there is no [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) yet. [Amazon](http://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/amazon-stock-performs-well-in-coronavirus-bear-market/) was Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


Nvidia is just above its long-term 200-day line after testing the key level the past few days. The stock's RS line is near new highs. Shares dropped more than 3% Friday.


Remember, all new buys are considered very risky during stock market corrections. For example, Dow Jones retail giant **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) broke out past a buy point on Wednesday, but triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) Friday after two days of sharp losses. But these three leaders are exhibiting tremendous strength in a volatile environment.

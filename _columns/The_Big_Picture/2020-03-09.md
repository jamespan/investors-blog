Stock Indexes Suffer Worst Losses Of Correction As Damage Spreads
==================================================================

Indexes plummeted Monday, when the stock market correction saw a rare stoppage of Wall Street trading, a crash in oil prices and a 2,000-point drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. And those are just the highlights.




In the harshest day of the current market correction, the Nasdaq plunged 7.3%. The composite slid below its 200-day moving average, marking a new bearish phase for the market. The S&P 500 lost 7.6%, touching the lowest level since June 3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 7.8%, or 2,013 points. Volume rose.


Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down more than 19% from all-time highs — almost satisfying the 20% minimum decline that typically defines a bear market. Small caps are already in a bear market, with the Russell 2000 off 23% and the S&P 600 down 25% from prior highs.


With Monday's rout, the major indexes undercut their Feb. 28 lows. The rally attempt that was in place since that day is now finished. The market must try again.

Also, the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) surged to 1.44. That's the highest since a 1.48 reading in December 2018 that marked the bottom of that year's brief bear market.


Nasdaq Falls Below 200-Day Line
-------------------------------


Now that the Nasdaq has violated its 200-day average, the next level where it might get some support is around 7700. That's where the composite made lows in early August and in October. The S&P 500 is now testing its June lows. To make a bottom, the market will have to first put the brakes on the steep slide. Monday's index losses were the largest of the 13-day-old stock market correction.


The IBD 50 fared just as poorly. It lost 7.5% as dozens of top-rated stocks slid below 50-day moving averages or other key chart levels.


The price of crude oil crashed 25% Monday, after [Saudi Arabia and Russia started an oil-price war](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/chevron-stock-plunges-coronavirus-russia-pressure-oil-prices/). Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia cut its price on oil by $8 to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The collapse in oil prices may be good for many consumers, but it raises the possibility that some oil companies will go bankrupt. Certainly, their profits are getting smashed.


Crude fell to as low as $27.34 a barrel and was quoted at $30.96 late Monday. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) plunged 20.1% to the lowest price since September 2004.


With oil prices in free fall, the global stock market rout was on. Overnight, Seoul's Kospi and Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 4.2%, and the Tokyo Nikkei dropped 5.1%. In Europe, the London FTSE 100 plummeted 7.3%, the German DAX lost 7.9%, and the Paris CAC 40 crumbled 8.1%.


Stock Market Correction Triggers Halt
-------------------------------------


Shortly after the open on Wall Street, a [rare circuit breaker](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info) was triggered after the S&P 500 fell more than 7%. Selling subsided after the required 15-minute pause. But the key indexes dove again as institutions dumped more shares *en masse* in the afternoon.


Government bond prices rallied and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note extended its descent, falling to another record low. It was quoted down 20 basis points to 0.5% late Monday. The yield squeeze punished banking stocks.


Mortgage rates sank to record lows, yet homebuilding stocks were roiled. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF ([XHB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XHB)) was hammered for a 8.4% loss. In a volatile day for mortgage stocks, **PennyMac Financial Services** ([PFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFSI)) dived as much as 20.2% before closing with a 4.2% loss.


A bad stock market correction doesn't leave much standing, and investors should be in all cash by now. IBD lowered its outlook to "market in correction" Feb. 25, and losses have worsened since then. Investors must be patient. Remember, a [bottoming signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) could take just a matter of days.

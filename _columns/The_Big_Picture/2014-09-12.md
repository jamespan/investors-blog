Stock Indexes Lose Their Grip, Suffer Distribution

Stocks couldn't keep the lid on their losses Friday, as the indexes suffered distribution.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 retreated 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively, while the small cap S&P 600 skidded 1%.


The IBD 50 slid 1.2%.


Volume rose across the board.


The action led to a distribution day on the Nasdaq and S&P 500, reflecting institutional selling.


While Friday's action was discouraging, it didn't change the market's overall condition. The market remains in an uptrend, even if it's showing some wear.


A look under the hood points to strength and weakness.


• **Reversals**: For the sixth day in a row Friday, the S&P 500 lost ground in the first hour of trade. In most of those sessions, the 500 staged positive reversals and high closes. Friday was different.


The indexes started off badly and stayed in negative territory.


• **Pop or drop**: The S&P 500 is only 1% above its 50-day moving average line. A test could be shaping up. Will the 500 find a trampoline or a trapdoor there?


• **The wild card**: To get this uptrend to the next level, big gains in big volume are needed. Should that happen, the shorts could inject additional fuel as they rush to cover their positions. The NYSE short interest ratio is near its five-year high (see Page B17).


• **Contradictions**: While the short interest ratio shows a heap of bearishness, the Investors Intelligence bulls vs. bears gauge sees the opposite.


What explains this divergence?


Part of this may be that one is measuring actual positions while the other tracks advice.


• **The FIB factor**: For some time, fund managers have been described as "fully invested bears." The alternatives to stocks don't look all that great in a low-rate environment. Yet this makes for a jittery market.


• **Buybacks**: Some say corporate buybacks have been the fuel driving the long bull run.


In Q1, buybacks in the S&P 500 totaled $159 billion. In Q2, the total dropped to $120 billion. (The peak for annual buyback expenditures was 2007, coinciding with the market's last hurrah before the bear market.)


Where does this leave individual investors?


From fully invested bears to slowing buybacks in Q2, there are reasons to be nervous.


Keeping a tight leash on a portfolio is prudent.


For the week, the IBD 50 fell 1.8%, the S&P 500 1.1% and the Nasdaq 0.3%.

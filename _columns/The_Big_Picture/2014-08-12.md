Stocks ended moderately lower Tuesday, but a generally quiet session in the broad market didn't translate to small-cap stocks.


The Nasdaq gave up 0.3%, closing in the middle of its intraday range after falling 0.7% early. It closed slightly above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1%.


The small-cap Russell 2000 index lost 0.8%, finishing near its low for the day.


Volume on the Nasdaq rose a hair from Monday. NYSE volume fell.


Breadth weakened after showing some signs of life in recent days. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by more than 2-to-1. Losers beat winners on the NYSE by around 3-to-2.


Crude oil, which has been in a downtrend since late June, lost 71 cents to $97.37 a barrel after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said stocks were plentiful despite geopolitical strife.


Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said total oil production in the U.S. averaged an estimated 8.5 million barrels a day in July, the highest monthly level of production since April 1987.


Falling oil prices have made their way to the pump, good news for American consumers. According to the EIA, regular gasoline prices fell to an average volume $3.61 per gallon in July, 8 cents below the June average. The EIA expects gas prices to fall to an average of $3.30 a gallon in December.


The IBD 50 basically performed in-line with the Nasdaq Tuesday, falling 0.4%, despite continued strength in shares of China-based auto websites **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)).


BitAuto jumped another 6% after Monday's 10% gain. It's up 22% in the past six sessions after a breakout in late June from a late-stage base. For current longs, the stock isn't flashing sell signals yet, although it closed 92% above its 200-day moving average. Historical studies by IBD have shown that when a stock is 100% above its 200-day moving average following a long price run, it can often precede a top.


Autohome jumped 10% as it works on the right side of a deep, cup-shaped base. It's showing renewed signs of accumulation but is still 15% off its high.


Other gainers included **Tata Motors** ([TTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTM)). One day after reclaiming its 50-day moving average and a 41.28 buy point in strong volume, the India-based carmaker extended gains, rising nearly 2%. Tata's acquisition of the Jaguar Land Rover brand from Ford in 2008 has been a growth driver for the company as demand for luxury cars remains strong in the U.S.


In its latest reported quarter, Tata reported a 209% surge in quarterly profit. Sales grew 36% to nearly $10.7 billion.

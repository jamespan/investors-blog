The stock market ended the week lower amid a sell-off in software stocks Friday fueled by a post-earnings plunge in **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)). Next week's Federal Reserve meeting now looms large.




The Nasdaq composite struggled most out of the major indexes as tech stocks came under pressure. It ended the session down 1% and closed right on its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), a key level to watch for the current uptrend. Its weekly loss of 0.7% was more moderate but it has now dipped for two weeks in a row for the first time since October. The composite remains up 6.4% for the year.


The S&P 500 closed off lows for the day but still fell 0.7% and looks as if it will test its own 21-day line. While it also fell for the second week in a row, the benchmark index is still up 7.2% this year.


Advancers held the edge on decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq exchange. Volume was higher on both, which caused the distribution day counts on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to rise to six.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best out of the major indexes on the stock market, but still fell 0.5%. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were the worst laggards.


Small caps rose, though the Russell 2000's lift of 0.4% was not enough to stave off a stout weekly decline. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) saw some gains fade but ended the session up 0.4%.


Key Fed Meeting Due, Dow Jones Stock Report Due
-----------------------------------------------


Some hotter-than-expected inflation readings along with weak retail sales data helped tip the scales in favor of the bears on the stock market this week.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP031524_2.jpg)Now investors will be tuning in to the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which kicks off Tuesday and ends Wednesday. Just as importantly, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will also deliver his post-FOMC press conference. His remarks always have the potential to help or hinder the broader market.


With the downward trajectory of inflation showing signs of a slowdown, his guidance on the future path of rates could be key.


There will also be some housing market readings in the shape of the homebuilder confidence index on Monday and housing starts and permits data Tuesday. The Composite Purchasing Managers' Index and the latest Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey both come Thursday.


Meanwhile, earnings season may be on the downswing but some [notable names are reporting](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/nike-stock-downtrend-earnings/) in the coming week. Dow Jones giant **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) are all set to give quarterly reports.


Â Adobe Earnings Hit Stock Market
--------------------------------


A majority of the [S&P 500 sectors closed higher Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Utilities and energy were the best-performing areas while technology and communication services lagged.



The relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's industry groups offered more insight into what happened on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Steel producers, metal ores miners, tire companies and truck parts makers were among the strongest performers.


In contrast, contract electronics manufacturers, specialty retailers, and education and enterprise software stocks were among the biggest laggards on the stock market. The desktop software group lagged the most though amid a post-earnings sell-off for group giant Adobe.

If there were doubts that Wednesday's post-Fed stock rally wouldn't stick, the stock market did its best to convince the doubters Thursday.




The stock market kept climbing, soaking in buyers and regaining key levels on the main index charts. Leading stocks outperformed.


Thursday's solid and broad gains — winners outnumbered losers by 13 to 5 on the Nasdaq, a 9-5 ratio on the NYSE — marked a change in [IBD's market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/). After nearly a week in which the outlook softened to "uptrend under pressure," a confirmed uptrend has resumed. IBD lowered its outlook just before Monday's rout.


The new market direction means investors should look for opportunities to add exposure, perhaps in the handful of stocks that are now topping [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). The stronger market also means you can give your current holdings more latitude.


Stock Market Indexes Above 50-Day Lines
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP092321-226x300.jpg)The S&P 500 added 1.2% and closed above the 50-day moving average after spending three days below it.


The Nasdaq composite jumped 1% for a second straight close above its 50-day line. Either day's gain was the Nasdaq's best day in nearly a month.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5%. It came short of its 50-day line, though it was its best two-day rally since March 5-8, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Even with strong index gains, small caps and the IBD 50 outperformed.


The Russell 2000 vaulted 1.8% as it too climbed back above the 50-day average.


The IBD 50 gave an early sign that the stock market's slide may be brief. The index gapped down in Monday's global sell-off but found support at the 50-day moving average. It rebounded quickly, rising the next two days. On Thursday, the IBD 50's outperformance shined even brighter, as the index roared 1.5% and came close to a new high.


Wall Street Overcomes China, Fed Worries
----------------------------------------


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq from Wednesday's totals, and appeared to be lower on the NYSE. Ideally, the big gains should have come in higher volume.


Certainly, the stock market had reasons to sell off this week, and its quick recovery wasn't lost on the bulls.


In China, government officials and corporate executives are [trying to manage the potential collapse of China Evergrande](https://www.barrons.com/articles/asian-markets-evergrande-deadline-51632391315?mod=hp_LEAD_2), prioritizing payments and projects. The real estate giant is listing under the weight of $300 billion in debt. Asian stocks rose on hopes that Chinese authorities may take steps to keep the crisis from spreading to global investors.


On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve signaled it will start tapering asset purchases as early as November. In a bit of surprise, it also indicated a willingness to start raising interest rates next year, earlier than the 2023 target it initially set.


September tends to be a poor month for the stock market, but investors need to follow the signals. Those are showing the risk-on trade is back.


Defensive sectors — namely real estate, utilities and consumer staples — underperformed. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) rose 0.4% while Utility Select Sector SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) and Real Estate Sector SPDR ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) fell 0.5%.

Energy Sector Leads Stock Market
--------------------------------


The energy sector led Thursday's market and remains one to watch.



**Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)), an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) pick earlier this month, broke out of a base in heavy trading. Shares topped the 30.65 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a handle. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is also at new highs, strengthening the case for Devon. Volume rose 41%, and Devon was the best performer on the S&P 500.


**Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)) rose 5%, clearing its prior September high at 75.20. The chart could be interpreted as a [cup base with a slightly low handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Both Denbury and Devon are oil & gas explorers and producers.


Natural gas network operator **Oneok** ([OKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKE)) jumped more than 4% and broke out past the 56.17 of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), according to [MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).



**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) accounted for 123 of the Dow's 507 points Thursday, says Dow Jones Market Data. The enterprise software company [raised its revenue forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-climbs-on-raised-revenue-outlook-as-analysts-focus-on-slack-integration/) ahead of its analyst day. Shares broke out past the 275.32 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/).

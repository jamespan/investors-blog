U.S. stock indexes kept to their recent sideways trend Thursday, but utilities outperformed for a fifth session in a row.




The Nasdaq ended just under flat, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The indexes closed high in the day's range, which is bullish.


The Dow Jones utility average rose 0.7%. The utility index has either lost less or gained more than the major indexes in each of the past five sessions.


Volume rose a bit on the Nasdaq but slipped on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.

Threat Of Tariffs
-----------------


In world news, President Trump said he is canceling a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, citing inflammatory remarks in recent days. But the market shook off the selling and recovered most of its losses by the close.


Trump also raised the possibility of 25% tariffs on imported cars, trucks and vehicle parts.


Trump told the Commerce Department late Wednesday to investigate the issue on national security grounds.


The Washington Post reported that some trade analysts regard Trump's move as a negotiating tactic in trade talks with Mexico.


Whatever the true situation is, the stock market has had trouble making progress ever since the tariff issue emerged in late January.


The Trump Slump
---------------


The weekly charts of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 show the advance was smooth from September to late January. The indexes consistently held above their 10-week moving averages.


After Trump started wielding the tariffs tool in late January, the market action turned wide, loose and ugly.


The stock market that enjoyed the so-called Trump Rally after his 2016 election now is struggling with the Trump Slump.


If the market has shown unease with Trump's trade policies, economists and historians are even more disturbed.


Earlier this month, 1,140 economists signed a letter to Trump and Congress warning against tariffs. The letter pointed to the Smoot-Hawley Act in 1930, which is often blamed for deepening the Great Depression.


In 1930, 1,028 economists sent a letter to President Herbert Hoover, advising against tariffs.Â Trump, like Hoover, is not taking the advice.


Anything can happen in the stock market, but until the market gets clarity on trade policy, it's hard to imagine the stock market making consistent progress.


Q1 earnings season was supposed to pull the market out of its lethargy but since reports started coming out in mid-April, the market has been uneven in direction. Now some market watchers have turned their hopes to Q2 but those reports won't start rolling in until July.


Breakouts
---------


Breakouts were scarce Thursday.

Trucker **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) cleared a consolidation in moderate volume.


Coming Up Friday
----------------


Durable goods orders for April will be reported before the stock market's open.


Estimates for new orders range from minus 2.5% to plus 1.7%. The consensus view is for minus 1.2%.

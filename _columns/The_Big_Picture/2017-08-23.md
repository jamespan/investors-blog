Stocks Drop, But Breakouts Hold Up; Why This August Isn't So Bad So Far

Stocks fell mildly on Wednesday as an apparent rift already emerging between President Trump and Congress on the issue of having enough money to keep the lights on in Washington seemed to take center stage.




The Nasdaq composite sank 0.3%, giving back less than a quarter of Tuesday's stout 1.4% advance. Volume edged lower. That's just what you want to see during market declines, especially given that just a day ago, the current outlook for the market got upgraded to "Uptrend resumes" from "Uptrend under pressure."


The S&P 500 slipped more than 0.3%, and volume also appeared to decline. The index closed slightly below the 50-day moving average, a level it had recaptured just Tuesday. A 1.1% rally in U.S. crude oil futures helped attract buyers in energy stocks.


Strength in semiconductor, automaker, steel, ship transport and fiber-optic telecom equipment firms also helped blunt the decline.


At a rally in Phoenix late Tuesday, Trump said, "If we have to close down our government, we're building that wall." Building a wall to slow down the illegal immigration into the U.S. was one of Trump's major policy platforms during the 2016 presidential election campaign.

With a Sept. 29 deadline looming for the House of Representatives and the Senate to decide on whether or not the legal borrowing limit should be raised above the current mandate of $19.81 trillion, it's no wonder that some politicians took the opportunity to admonish against such a potential move.


The market is the sum of real-money decisions made by millions of investment professionals and individual players. Judging by how the indexes acted, the widely reported news did not seem to spark much of a reaction. In fact, given that both the Nasdaq and the S&P both rallied decently off their intraday lows, one may surmise that some institutions capitalized on the early-morning weakness to grab shares.


Meanwhile, as seen by the best stocks in the IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Sector Leaders and Leaderboard, recent breakouts over the past few weeks are generally holding up pretty well, though most aren't exactly rocketing. That is the ultimate litmus test of a healthy market.


No doubt, all eyes on Wall Street will be on Janet Yellen's speech Friday at the annual retreat at a ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyo., sponsored by the Kansas City Federal Reserve. Big changes in the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates definitely move financial markets across the globe.


And given the day's drop in yield to 2.17% for the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond, there appeared to be more conviction that the U.S. central bank will act very slowly in raising the cost of money.


The Dow utility average, which tracks rate-sensitive electricity and gas providers, inched 0.1% higher on Wednesday. At 777, the Dow utilities are up 12.8% year to date, much better than the S&P 500.


The federal funds rate has been raised just four times since the end of 2015 and is currently in an abnormally low target range of 1%-1.25%. Chances of another quarter-point hike in December are reasonable, but it's still not a sure thing given that neither the economy nor inflation are running higher like gangbusters.



Wednesday's report of July U.S. new home sales drove home that point. The annualized rate of 571,000 badly missed the Econoday consensus view of 610,000, or unchanged from the June figure. Yet the PMI Composite Flash index of 56.0 in August beat the 54.3 consensus forecast and signaled that manufacturing industries are chugging along.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are both down in August, but it could be a lot worse. According to the writers of the 2016 Stock Trader's Almanac, August is the worst month for both the Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500, and the second worst for the Nasdaq.


A big sell-off among airlines helped punch the Dow transports down more than 1.2%. **Southwest Air** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) and **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) are all caving below their 200-day moving averages.


Be sure not to catch a falling knife, no matter in what sector of the stock market you dabble.

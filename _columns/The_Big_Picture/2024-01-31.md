  Stocks Today Battered As Powell Hints Rate Cuts Won't Arrive Early; These Stocks Trigger Golden Rule

[Stocks today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) suffered one of their deepest losses in months after the Federal Reserve, as expected, held steady on interest rates Wednesday.




The sharpest moment of the day's sell-off? It came after Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented during a news conference that the U.S. central bank is unlikely to begin lowering the cost of money in March. Yet in reality, the bond market wasn't really convinced, either, that the fed funds rate would get lowered from its current range of 5.25%-5.5% at the Fed's next meeting two months from now.


At one point during Powell's talk with reporters in the afternoon, the Nasdaq composite rebounded in healthy form, trimming losses to just under 0.7%. But after his rather blunt answer to a blunt question about whether the Fed would make its first cut in the fed funds rate in years, sellers grabbed control.


The Fed has now left the cost of money unchanged for four straight meetings since September. At the start of its monetary tightening campaign in March 2022, the fed funds rate stood at 0%-0.25%.


The tech-heavy composite closed at session lows, down 2.2%. The sharp losses cut the Nasdaq's advance in January to 1%. At 15,164, the index also stands more than 6% below the all-time high of 16,212.


On Wednesday, the S&P 500 lost 1.6%; the Russell 2000 slipped nearly 2.5%. Banking, computer and retail stocks led the downside. Northeast and Midwest banks as well as investment banks fell more than 4% on a price-weighted basis.


Stocks Today
------------


The S&P 500 actually performed better for the month than the Nasdaq, holding a 1.6% gain in January. The large-cap benchmark also finished easily in the upper half of its monthly range. [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) notes the index as finishing with a "closing range" of 66%.


In general, you'd like to see both key stocks today and major indexes finish in the upper half of their daily, weekly and monthly ranges, not in the lower half.


The Russell 2000, in contrast, did not post a bullish finish in January. After blissful gains ofÂ  8.8% in November and nearly 12.1% in December, the small-cap gauge ended down 3.9%. It also showed a closing range of 37%; a 50% closing range denotes the midpoint from the high and low of a range.


Mark Minervini, two-time winner of the U.S. Investing Championships, noted in the beginning of [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) that the future decline in interest rates should bode well for small-cap and midcap companies. He thinks a strong rally could emerge later in the year.

Distribution, Again
-------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP013124-168x300.jpg)


Volume gushed higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. Tuesday. Clearly, institutional investors sold stocks intensely, resulting in a [new distribution of stocks today](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) by big players on Wall Street.


This means the S&P 500 now counts seven such days of heavy professional selling within a rolling 25-session period. However, keep in mind that two such days were stalling, an unusual form of distribution. A number of the S&P 500's distribution days are set to fall off the count next week due to time.


The Nasdaq added only a second distribution day. But like the ones that occurred on Dec. 20 (a 1.5% drop) and Jan. 2 (a 1.6% slide), Wednesday's sell-off surely showed some teeth. Both the Dec. 20 and Jan. 2 distribution days, however, have actually fallen off the count due to price progress in the Nasdaq itself.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed on the day, yet joined the downside with a 0.8% loss. Beaten down aerospace giant **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) rebounded with a 5.3% gain, blunting the slide by the Dow. Headed into Wednesday's session, BA stock held a paltry 46 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/). It is nowhere near an [IBD-style buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The Dow Jones industrials rallied for a third straight month. But January's 1.2% gain was much smaller than rises of 8.8% and 4.8% in the two prior months.


Volatility rose in stocks today and for the month.


The Cboe Volatility Index jumped 15% for the month. Yet at 14.35, it's still miles below the Covid pandemic peak of 85.47 seen in March 2020. You can track the daily movement of the VIX and other sentiment indicators on IBD's [psychological market indicators page](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/).


More earnings news coming up will also likely push volatility higher.


Key Sell Rules To Watch In Stocks Today
---------------------------------------


During Wednesday's session, some breakouts proved highly disappointing. Perhaps this helps justify the reasoning behind maintaining a 60%-80% exposure to equities in the portfolio for now.



For instance, **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) on Wednesday fell 3.2% to follow a bad reversal the prior day. The member of IBD's specialty enterprise software group also fell more than 7% after breaking out of an unusual cup with handle and its 44.57 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). That bearish move triggered the [golden rule of investing: keep losses small](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


**Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **SharkNinja** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)), meanwhile, warranted defensive selling too. Both stocks undercut their 50-day moving averages in accelerating volume. High-quality growth stocks in powerful uptrends tend to bounce off their 50-day lines, not fall sharply through them.


Beyond stocks today, bond investors rushed back into long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note dropped 9 basis points to 3.96%, a two-week low. This was perhaps in reaction to a much smaller than expected rise in private-sector payrolls for January reported by ADP. Watch for the nonfarm payrolls report on Friday before the open.

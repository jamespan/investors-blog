Not all down days in the market are bad. Tuesday qualified as such a session.




Given that the Nasdaq composite, down as much as 1% in the first hour of trading, actually ended the day off just 0.1%, the analytical investor could treat such action as good. It suggests the sellers didn't flood Wall Street in droves.


The S&P 500 more or less mimicked the tech-heavy index. The large-cap benchmark trimmed early losses of almost 0.7% to 0.3% by day's end. It wasn't as impressive a rebound as the Nasdaq. Yet the S&P 500's trading range of 0.6% also gave a subtle clue: Large caps avoided a volatile session.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also bounced around in a fairly tight band before closing down 0.3%. At 33,071, the 30-stock blue chip index lies just 0.6% beneath its all-time highs.


The Feb. 23 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the Nasdaq expired due to time, taking the total to five distribution days on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.

The Price Of Money
------------------


An everyday reader of this column knows that institutional investors are watching interest rates, particularly on the long end, like a hawk. And so it's interesting to see sellers of equities tire on Tuesday, even as the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond climbed again, this time to as high as 1.76% — the highest level since late January 2020.


U.S. Treasury data showed the 10-year bond yield end flat at 1.73% vs. 0.02% for 3-month T-bills.


The increasing steepness of the U.S. government bond yield curve certainly benefits lenders. And so it may come as no surprise that regional banks fared well on Tuesday. Their big presence on the Russell 2000 helped boost iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) to a 1.7% rebound. This followed Monday's 2.8% shellacking in heavier volume.


Notice on a daily chart how the Russell 2000 ETF has now rallied in three of the past four sessions. Yet, the exchange traded fund is still looking up at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).



A rally back above the 50-day line would add another feather in the bulls' cap.


**Truist Financial** ([TFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TFC)), **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)), **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)) and [IBD Sector Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) **Jefferies** ([JEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JEF)) all gained 2% to 4%, outperforming the S&P 500.


SPDR S&P Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)), discussed in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), romped 2.5% higher. The fund has a sporty cushion above its 50-day moving average.


Four Months Since The Follow-Through Day
----------------------------------------


On Nov. 4, the Dow industrials [followed through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). That is, the Dow gained 1.3% as NYSE turnover increased vs. the prior day. This Day 4 rally confirmation following the October sell-off served as a good-enough signal that a new uptrend may be in play. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq made [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) also in early November.


The Dow industrials have since gained more than 19%, even as the U.S. struggled to reopen the economy amid another surge in coronavirus cases during the winter holiday.



In addition to banks, commodity and retailing stocks have shone.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), earlier this month moving past a 107.85 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), has also risen more than 31% since clearing an 83.72 buy point in a [narrow cup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in August. **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) is setting up. **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)), also currently in a base, has driven the bears out of town with a gain of as much as 82% following a breakout past 75.52 during the week ended Nov. 13.


[The IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) on Tuesday highlighted bullish moves in **Academy Sports & Outdoor** ([ASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASO)), **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) and [former Leaderboard position](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) **Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)).


Can you get any more diverse, industry-wise, than for a trio of stocks like that?


In short, more industries and more sectors are humming a bullish tune.


The General Market Indicators page (found as a link at the end of every Big Picture story, as well as on the [Market Trend landing page](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx)) illustrates improving breadth within the NYSE. As drawn on the S&P 500's daily chart, the NYSE advance-decline line has shown a milder upward slope lately. It's still posting higher highs and higher lows.


On Tuesday, winners topped losers by a 3-2 ratio on both the NYSE and Nasdaq.


The 2021 Wall Of Worry
----------------------



Giddy optimism has certainly fallen since the highflying days of **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)), **BlackBerry** ([BB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BB)) and other beaten-down names that became the rallying cry of WallStreetBets on Reddit. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) has recently jumped to 0.76 from its year-to-date low of 0.46. This means for every 100 buyers of bullish calls, 76 bearish puts got traded. Some observers believe call option buying has subsided, pushing up this ratio.


At the bottom of the October pullback, the put-call ratio jumped to 0.92.


Less speculative froth is bullish for the market. Vertical-like gains suggest that investors are buying with abandon. Well, after they buy, who will prop stock prices higher?


It will no doubt take time for the mega-winners of 2020 to set up [brand-new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) and stage breakouts again. Many observers have expressed a dour view on tech companies this year. And no wonder: Many achieved incredible returns last year as coronavirus accelerated digital business, online shopping and gaming, virtual doctor visits and more. Anecdotally, you can tell that many individuals are gaining an interest in short selling.


No doubt, some companies have taken a big fall from their all-time peaks. But this is good for investors. The strongest companies will emerge from the tech correction and build new bases. Some will eventually [break out to new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), giving astute chart readers new opportunities to make money.


Will the White House add a few more bricks to Wall Street's wall of worry? Some stock experts believe [the market could see an adjustment](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/sp-500-us-economy-face-joe-biden-federal-reserve-seismic-shifts/) if President Joe Biden carries out a plan to raise corporate taxes.


Sell Short Now?
---------------


The severe slides seen by the likes of **Teladoc** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) do not by any means qualify them necessarily as [great short sale candidates](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-short-side/) today.



Consider **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)). The stock gained 5.7% on Tuesday and is fighting to bottom out while staying abreast of its long-term 200-day moving average. No doubt, the EV maker was one of 2020's biggest market winners. The huge drop from a 66.99 all-time high, however, does not mean it's time to sell short. In fact, the right time arrived in February, when Nio fell 8% below a 57.30 buy point in a late-stage cup without handle.


At the same time, Nio triggered a sell signal when it [crashed through its 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) in the week ended Feb. 26.


Covering just two weeks later could have yielded a profit of as much as 65% from the short-sale entry point near 52.71. (That price marked an 8% drop from Nio's buy point at 57.30.)


In Other Markets
----------------


Meanwhile, keep an eye on the U.S. dollar.


A 0.4% drop in the euro to $1.1717, and a 0.5% rise in the greenback to 110.35 Japanese yen indicate growing confidence in the American economic recovery. That's not all. Crude oil, gold and silver all fell as these assets get priced in the U.S. dollar. In other words, they become more expensive for overseas investors.

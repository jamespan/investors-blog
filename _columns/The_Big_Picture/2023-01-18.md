Stock market investors saw some fears realized Wednesday when the S&P 500 hit resistance right where chart readers had pinpointed.




For the second straight day, the S&P got turned away around 4,000. On Tuesday, the index fell mildly. But Wednesday, sellers didn't hold back. The index closed 1.6% lower and at session lows.


Wednesday's bearish reversal also sent the S&P 500 right back below its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/) — a pesky resistance level of its own.


Just 33 points separate Wednesday's close from the Jan. 6 close, when a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) signaled the new market uptrend. In other words, little is left from that bullish demarcation, and the market can ill-afford another downward drift.


The reversal also followed a reading below 20 in the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), better known as the VIX. The stock market has shown a tendency to peak when the fear index sinks into that floor.


The Nasdaq composite lost 1.2%, losing a battle for now with the 11,000 level. The composite ended a seven-day win streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.8% and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Jan. 5.


Stock Indexes Add Distribution
------------------------------


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. That means the Nasdaq picked up a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) and the S&P 500 added a second-straight day of higher institutional selling.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP011823_2-230x300.jpg)Tuesday's innocent-looking distribution day in the S&P 500 now takes on greater significance. A clustering of distribution days, if it continues, would add to a bearish profile for the stock market.


With indexes meeting resistance and distribution surfacing in the stock market, what should investors do?


On a practical level, it's time to throttle back on stocks. Exposure should remain 20% to 40%, although much depends on the success of breakouts. While dozens of quality stocks have made it out of bases, MarketSmith's list of recent breakouts shows fewer than 10 still up more than 5% from [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).


Some of the most recent — including **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)), **Oneok** ([OKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKE)), **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)) and **Timken** ([TKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TKR)) — are already struggling.


Breakout attempts Wednesday for **BP** ([BP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BP)), **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) and **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) fizzled amid the weakening stock market.


But **Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)) held up well.


How Stock Market Reversed Wednesday
-----------------------------------


Wednesday's trading started well enough.


Stock market indexes opened higher after the [producer price index (PPI)](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for December came in cooler than expected, up 6.2% on an annual basis and down 0.5% from November. Prices excluding food and energy were basically in line with views, up 5.5% yearly and 0.1% month to month.


U.S. [retail sales fell 1.1% in December](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559413&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top), and dropped an equal amount excluding auto sales. The holiday-season numbers were weaker than expected.


But St. Louis Fed President James Bullard continued to strike a hawkish tone. He [told The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-bullard-sees-need-to-keep-up-rapid-pace-of-rate-increases-11674058442) he expects inflation will still be elevated by year's end, with rates between 5.25% and 5.5%. His comments appeared to spark or at least aid the wave of selling.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid 16 basis points to 3.37%.

United Air, Schwab Fall After Earnings
--------------------------------------


Earnings reports caused some of the bigger drops in Wednesday's stock market.


**United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) fell 4.6% in a wide price bar for the session. The company [beat fourth-quarter sales and profit expectations](https://www.investors.com/research/united-airlines-soars-on-earnings-beat-strong-demand-carrier-makes-huge-boeing-dreamliner-purchase/). The stock is up nearly 30% so far this month as airlines gain altitude.


**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) fell 2.5% in heavy volume, although it bounced back above its 50-day line. The brokerage firm [missed fourth-quarter estimates](https://www.barrons.com/articles/charles-schwab-stock-earnings-miss-51674050502?mod=hp_DAY_0).


In Asia, the Tokyo Nikkei 225 index surged 2.5% after the Bank of Japan [kept interest rates unchanged](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-japan-governor-digs-in-for-standoff-with-markets-11674045125?mod=hp_lead_pos4), defying market expectations. In December, the central bank raised the cap for the yield on 10-year government bonds to 0.5% from 0.25%.

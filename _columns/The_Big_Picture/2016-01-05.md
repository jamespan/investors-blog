Â 


The stock market made a feeble attempt to rebound Tuesday as it remained woozy from the prior day's beating. The Nasdaq fell 0.2% while the S&P 500 climbed 0.2% on a day when the market had trouble finding direction. The two indexes went from gains to losses about a dozen times each.


Volume fell across the board.


If institutional investors were reluctant to buy on the dip, they had good reason: The market is far from settled and displaying a bearish bias.


Defensive industry groups performed best Tuesday. Real estate investment trusts, tobacco, discount retail and foreign telecom industry groups rose 1% to 2%.

That's a downtrend, whether you're talking about stocks, crude oil or rice.


The S&P 500, however, has held above 2000. Twice in the past three weeks, the index has dipped below that milestone, only to bounce right back.


The Nasdaq has no clear floor at the moment, although it is trying to settle itself above 4850. The composite's advance-decline line has hit a new low. That suggests that any index gain is occurring with fewer stocks also rising.


The put-call volume ratio has signaled market lows in the past when it reached elevated levels. But it hasn't gotten to a panic stage so far. It spiked to 1.09 Monday and 0.93 Tuesday. Normally, the ratio has to hit at least 1.15 to signal a truly frightened market.


Tuesday's uncertain session did not bring bargain-hunters the way previous sell-offs have.


On Dec. 11, when the Nasdaq slid 2.2%, the composite reversed sharply higher in the next session and made substantial gains the next two days.


On Dec. 3, a 1.7% Nasdaq drop was more than covered in the next session. On Nov. 12-13, the next three days saw strong gains.


The Sept. 25-29 tumble was wiped away in four days.


To be sure, the Nasdaq did not sustain its advance after every one of those lows. Still, it would be nice to see some buyers show up and try to shore up the market.


The IBD 50 rose 0.2%.


**Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) was the star, soaring 11% in huge volume to a record high. President Obama unveiled new restrictions on gun purchases, and the stock tends to rally whenever gun control rises in the public discourse.


The IBD 50 is down 2.4% this week, but some pockets of relative strength do exist.


**Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **Public Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)), **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)), **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)), **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **Equifax** ([EFX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EFX)) have given the IBD 50 something to cheer.


Independent electricity transmission provider **ITC Holdings** ([ITC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITC)) broke out of a long cup with handle, although volume was weak.


While the market remains in a correction, look for stocks that can buck the selling. Those can end up being the next market leaders. But be patient. Market risk is too high right now to buy shares.


Some solar stocks jumped on bullish comments from Goldman Sachs. It put **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) on its conviction buy list and raised the target price to 41 from 32. Goldman upgraded **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) to buy from neutral and raised its target price to 100 from 61.

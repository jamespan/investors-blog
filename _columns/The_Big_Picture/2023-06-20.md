Although it closed lower for a second straight session, the stock market looked resilient Tuesday, closing well off session lows.




The tireless Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.2% — a positive outcome after dropping as much as 0.9% early in the day. The S&P 500 reduced its loss to 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a 0.7% decline.


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq. That's no surprise at all, after Friday's quadruple witching options and futures expirations caused trading to surge.


Even when excluding Friday and comparing with Thursday's volume, Tuesday's totals were smaller. (The stock market was closed Monday for the Juneteenth federal holiday.)


The IBD 50 outperformed with a 0.1% increase Tuesday. A mix of technology, health care and consumer stocks rose more than 3% to give the IBD 50 a boost.


The so-called Magnificent Seven — the present-day version of the FANGs — performed well as a group. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) led with a 5.3% jump to the highest point since September 2022.


Stock Market Gets Another Powell Appearance
-------------------------------------------


Tuesday's drop was at least in part due to the stock market's tendency to stiffen before a Federal Reserve event.

Several other Fed officials are scheduled to give public remarks during the week.


A look at market indicators shows breadth still trending in a positive direction.


The NYSE advance-decline line is at the highest level since early February.


The 10-day moving average of Nasdaq new highs to new lows turned in favor of new highs the past week. The 10-day average of Nasdaq stocks up in volume has widened its gap over stocks down in volume. Similar trends can be seen in the NYSE.


Professional money managers no doubt have become more confident. The [National Association of Active Investment Managers](https://www.naaim.org/programs/naaim-exposure-index/)' stock exposure index is near the highest level since November 2021.


Stock Market Still Extended
---------------------------


While those numbers favor a continued stock market uptrend, the main indexes still look extended. The Nasdaq 100 — arguably the market's leader with a 37% advance year to date — is 10% above its 50-day moving average. And it topped 11% Thursday. The last time the gap topped 11% was when the index peaked on Feb. 2.


Investors would do well to prepare for a larger pullback. Remember, the Nasdaq just finished its eighth consecutive weekly gain. That's [the longest weekly win streak in four years](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-reverses-lower-could-be-in-for-pullback-after-longest-win-streak-in-4-years/).


Homebuilding stocks were a bright spot in Wednesday's stock market thanks to a bullish housing report.


May starts of new home construction jumped to 1.631 million units at an annual rate — well above the prior month's 1.34 million and the [1.4 million economists had forecast](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559334&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top). Building permits, an indicator of future starts, climbed to 1.491 million. That was also above views and the previous month's total.


The jump in housing starts was the largest since 2016, while permits also ramped up, says Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. Also, the NAHB Housing Market Index showed builders' sentiment at a 11-month high.


"Limited inventory in the resale market and easing materials costs continue to hoist confidence," the economist added. In short, residential construction is improving despite higher mortgage rates.


The IShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) rose 1%, outperforming the broad market with a move to the highest level since January 2022.


**NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) tried to break out of a flat base but closed below the 5,986.96 buy point. And **MDC Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)) reversed lower to end 2.5% down in heavy trading.

Investors Begin Accumulating Stocks Again; This Index Beats The Nasdaq
=======================================================================

In the space of two trading sessions straddling two calendar years, investors went from taking profits to accumulating shares again.




 On Friday, institutional investors decided to take profits en masse. The Nasdaq composite, down 0.7% in higher volume than the prior session, racked up its fourth distribution day, or session of unusually intense selling.


But on Tuesday, buyers returned in full force.


The Nasdaq led the major indexes with a 1.5% advance and volume surged nearly 15% higher, according to early figures. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%. Dull action by banks and a sharp slide by **Travelers Cos.** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) helped lead to an underwhelming day for the Dow Jones industrials, up just 0.4%.


NYSE volume rose sharply and was the highest since at least Dec. 19.


Travelers fell nearly 3% and chopped through its 50-day moving average for the second time in nearly three weeks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP010218-183x300.png)Sure, volume is still relatively quiet in comparison with the 50-day moving averages. Yet an increase in trading is still critical information.


You want to see stocks rise in higher volume, not lower. And when stocks fall, you prefer to see turnover contract, not expand.


The Dow transports did even better than the Nasdaq, up 1.9% vs. a 1.5% advance for the latter.


Small caps did better than large caps as the Russell 2000 marched ahead 0.9% and the S&P SmallCap 600 0.7%.


While the Nasdaq still has a fairly high number of distribution days over the past 25 sessions, the Accumulation/Distribution rating actually improved on Tuesday to a B- vs. C+ on Friday. As seen in the General Market Indicators page, accessible through the PDF link at the bottom of this article, the S&P 500 has an even better Accumulation grade at B+. That's partially a reflection of its low distribution count, just one significant decline in higher turnover (Dec. 29) in recent weeks.


Within the stock market as a whole, Tuesday's biggest advancers were hardly the domain of techland. At one point, at least 35 of IBD's [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-jan-02-2018/) rose 2% or more.


Only three groups fell 2% or more, and two came from the defensive food sector. Breadth was solid on the Nasdaq, as winners led losers by a 2-1 ratio. The ratio on the NYSE was slightly less than the Nasdaq's.


Chinese internet and consumer issues rallied fiercely following a 2% rise overnight in the Hang Seng benchmark of Hong Kong. Steel, oil and gas exploration, and some medical names also led nicely. Natural gas futures rose sharply amid a severe winter freeze across much of the U.S. and prices jumped back above $3 per million BTU.


**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) became the latest new Chinese consumer play to join [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/) as shares raced past a 67.79 buy point in a relatively shallow new base and gained nearly 11%. Volume came in triple usual levels to 2.3 million shares.



 


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF rallied 1.9% on Tuesday, following a gain of 37% in 2017.


Was today a reflection of U.S. stocks feeding on the positive vibes coming from the Chinese equity markets, with the Hang Seng racing to multiyear highs? No one can know for sure. But a global rise in equities and indications that North Korea may be willing to talk with its southern neighbor likely helped fund managers keep confident about equities in general.


Stocks went up even as the yield on the U.S. Treasury benchmark 10-year bond rose sharply to 2.47%, ready to take out last month's near-term high of 2.49%. The Dow utilities sank 1.1%.


This week is a busy one for fresh [economic news](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Wednesday sees the December reading on U.S. manufacturing via the ISM survey. According to Econoday, the consensus estimate is 58.0, down slightly from 58.2 in November yet still bullish. A reading above 50.0 denotes expanding factory activity.


The ADP private sector jobs report comes out Thursday (current estimate: a 188,000 gain in payrolls), while the ISM non-manufacturing survey arrives on Friday (December estimate of 57.6, up slightly from 57.4 in the prior month).


Later in the month, keep a close eye on the earnings calendar. Quarterly results will heat up the financial markets starting in the Week of Jan. 22.

  Stock Market Falls Again, Triggers This Switch As Inflation Data, Big Tech Earnings Loom

The stock market continued to sell off Friday, with the bears clearly controlling the day's action. Now investors have to worry about a slew of Big Tech earnings and key inflation data in the week ahead.




The Nasdaq composite was hit hardest out of the major indexes, tumbling 1.5%. The tech-heavy index lost more ground on its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and if current trends prevail, it could soon test the 200-day line. While it has surrendered a hefty slice of its gains, it remains up about 25% so far in 2023.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP102023_3.jpg)The S&P 500 also had a painful session, dipping 1.3%. It undercut the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) but remains close enough to the technical threshold for it still to be seen as a test of the level. The benchmark index remains up more than 10% this year.


Decliners outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to hold up better than other indexes, falling 0.9%. Nevertheless, it could soon test recent lows. **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) was the top performer while **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) turned in the worst declines.


Small caps also suffered, with the Russell 2000 sliding 1.3%. The index made a new low for the year and still sits well below its 200-day line. And growth stocks were crushed by the bears, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) plunged 2%.


With the Nasdaq now below its Oct. 6 follow-through day low, the market outlook has switched to "market in correction." The recommended exposure level remains at the 0% to 20% level. Current oversold conditions mean a technical rebound could come next week, but risks remain high regardless.


Inflation Data, Big Tech Earnings Lie Ahead
-------------------------------------------


The week ahead contains a number of risks for the stock market, though there is of course upside potential if developments are encouraging.


A slew of economic data is due to be released. While third-quarter GDP will be one to watch on Thursday, with some economists expecting 4.5% growth, some key inflation data is also due.


More importantly, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is set for a Friday release. Core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is seen rising 3.7% year over year.


As if that wasn't enough, there is a packed slate of Big Tech earnings due. Heavy hitters expected to report include **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), Facebook-parent **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). These reports could play a crucial role in whether the stock market is able to shake off its current malaise.

The Elon Musk-led firm dropped nearly 16% for the week and is now below its 200-day line.


In contrast, the media periodicals group, telecom infrastructure stocks, long-term care plays and mobile home makers all had strong sessions.

Stock Indexes In Pause Mode, But That Can Do Uptrend Good
==========================================================

Stocks traded in a narrow range Friday, settling for puny, mixed results.


The Nasdaq eased 0.1%, while the S&P 500 barely rose. The IBD 50 slid 1.5%, hurt by **Salix Pharmaceuticals'** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) 34% plunge.


Volume fell across the board.


Breakouts were scarce among stocks with high ratings.


While the uptrend remains intact, the market clearly switched to pause mode during the week. Pauses can come in at least three varieties. The indexes can move sideways. They can advance in smaller steps than they had been making. Or, the indexes can suffer distribution, which is a sign of intense institutional selling.


Last week, the indexes did a bit of all three.


The Nasdaq spent the week sketching sideways action. The Dow mostly took small steps up. The S&P 500 suffered a distribution day Tuesday.


Yet there were mitigating factors in Tuesday's distribution day. The S&P 500 closed high in the day's range, which reflects support. And crude oil struck a new low that day, pulling down oil stocks, which make up one of every 12 stocks in the index.


Without the drag of the oil stocks, the loss might not have been enough to qualify as a distribution day. In fact, the S&P 500 closed near a new high.


Overall, individual investors can regard the week's pause as generally constructive. An uptrend has to rest on occasion, and this one did so in a confident, nonchalant fashion. However, for an uptrend to do bulls any good, it must go up. So the coming week could provide an interesting test, especially since many of the previous market drivers are either gone or dwindling.


Earnings season is winding down. The Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program is over, and the Fed isn't scheduled to meet until December.


The midterm elections are over. Results were pro-business but pro-business campaign rhetoric doesn't always lead to action.


This means the uptrend might have to live off optimism and perhaps corporate buybacks.


How far can the uptrend go?


In each of the past five years, a Q4 rally has developed and in each case the gains continued into the new year. There's no guarantee that will happen again, but bulls would like to see this page of history copied.


For the week, the IBD 50 lost 1.4%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 0.7% and less than 0.1%, respectively.

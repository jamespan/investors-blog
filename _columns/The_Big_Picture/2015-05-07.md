Stocks tried to patch over recent losses but got only part of the job done Thursday.

  

The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average each rose 0.5%, while the S&P 500 added 0.4%. The IBD 50, though, declined 0.5%.

  

Volume fell narrowly on both major exchanges.

  

Going into Thursday's session, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had lost about 3% and 2%, respectively, since April 24, the day of a closing high for the Nasdaq.

  

So Thursday's action only succeeded in erasing a small part of recent losses.

  

The S&P 500 retook its 50-day moving average but couldn't hold above it. The Nasdaq also found resistance at the 50-day line.

  

With the market outlook at correction and the index charts looking like a series of speed bumps, individual investors should reduce exposure. The odds don't favor buying stocks at this juncture, even when they do break out. In recent weeks, top-rated stocks have cleared buy points only to sag.

  

The saggers include **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)).

  

Other leaders have turned downright ugly. The gap-down moves include **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Harman International** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)).

  

To be fair, some stocks are still consolidating constructively. Check the charts of **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)).

  

After the close, **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) [topped the Street's numbers](http://news.investors.com/technology/050715-751534-tableau-data-analytics-business-continues-to-grow.htm)on earnings and sales. The stock was up 8% after hours, [enough](http://news.investors.com/investing-ipo-analysis/050615-751344-stocks-worth-buying.htm)to regain its 99.39 buy point if it holds firm Friday.

  

Oil-related stocks were among the worst performers Thursday as the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil retreated 3% to under $59 a barrel. Stocks that benefit from low oil prices reacted accordingly.

  

Airlines, truckers, RVs and air freight industry groups did well. The cruise stocks also sailed ahead, with **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) leading with a 7% pop following its earnings report.

  

Economic news included an upbeat note and a downbeat note.

  

The upbeat note was first-time jobless claims. The number was about 5% less than expected and hovered not far above the previous week's 15-year low.

  

The downbeat note was Challenger, Gray & Christmas' layoff numbers for April. The total was 61,582, the highest in three years. Challenger said a third of the layoffs were tied to the oil industry.

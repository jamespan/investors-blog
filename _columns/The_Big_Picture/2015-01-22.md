The bulls got their wish Thursday as the European Central Bank embraced quantitative easing and U.S. stocks turned in their best gains in two weeks.

  

The Nasdaq leapt 1.8% and the S&P 500 1.5%. The small-cap S&P 600 rushed 2.1% higher.

  

The IBD 50 added 1.1%, highlighting a lagging performance by many leading stocks lately.

  

Volume was higher on both major exchanges.

  

Although the indexes rose in the past four sessions, gains had been moderate and trade slow â€” until Thursday.

  

The action removed the uptrend's caution light: IBD's market outlook moved from uptrend under pressure to confirmed uptrend. If individual investors have cash on the sidelines, they can look for something to buy.

  

On Thursday, the indexes initially found resistance near their 50-day lines for three hours in the middle of the session.

  

After that bout with hesitation, the market broke things open, resulting in a clear thrust through the 50-day lines.

  

The next test for the indexes involves resistance around 4815 on the Nasdaq and 2100 for the S&P 500. Twice before, the Nasdaq has stalled at its resistance level.

  

U.S. economic news was mixed Thursday. Jobless claims were higher than expected, and the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing survey for January fell short of views. But the Federal Housing Finance Agency's house price index for November was much stronger than expected.

  

Yet all this news took a back seat to the news from Europe. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi announced a roughly $70 billion monthly bond-buying program. The buys will begin in March and run through September 2016.

  

With the eurozone's economy struggling, U.S. stock market bulls are hoping that quantitative easing will ease the eurozone's pain. Although QE hasn't been a rousing success in the States (the economic recovery is among the weakest in U.S. history), QE has coincided with stock rallies.

  

The low interest rates and a sluggish economy make corporate buybacks a prudent use of cash. And share repurchases have been a major driver of the bull market.

  

A handful of leading stocks stirred Thursday.**Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **Tata Motors** ([TTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTM)) broke out.

title: Stock Market Ends Quarter With Bull Charge; These Stocks Shine As Inflation Cools

The stock market ended the week, month and quarter with a bullish flourish on Friday. And with encouraging data emboldening the bulls, the stage looks set for further gains in the second quarter.




The Nasdaq composite surged 1.7% on the day, with its weekly lift an impressive 3.4%. The Nasdaq is now up almost 18% in 2023, its finest quarter since 2020.


The blue-chip S&P 500 was not far behind as it posted a 1.4% daily gain, rising more than 3% for the week. It ended the month in positive territory and is up more than 7% for the year. It is now pulling away from its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), a bullish sign.


Gainers outnumbered decliners by around 5-to-1 on the NYSE, an impressive result. The margin on the Nasdaq was also impressive, coming in at just under 3-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was no slouch, rising 1.3%. It is now positive for the year, but just a bit. **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD))Â  and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) were closely watched among index's top performers.


Small caps stood out on the stock market Friday, with the Russell 2000 climbing an impressive 1.9%. However, growth stocks had the mightiest session of all, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) vaulting 2.2%.


Inflation Data Boosts Stock Market
----------------------------------


Any signs that inflation is beginning to cool is welcome among investors. So when the Commerce Department reported that key personal consumption expenditures index had risen less than expected, albeit slightly, it gave stocks a boost.

Core prices, minus food and energy, were up 0.3%, with an annual core inflation rate of 4.6%. Both readings were slightly cooler than estimates. This is important as it is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge.


Cautious investors may point to portfolio window dressing in the bullish close to the quarter, but it was still a strong week for stocks.


Earnings season now looms, though bulls would argue that the stock market has already priced in weak results for bank stocks following recent industry travails. Nevertheless, revised guidance could have a big impact on the market's fortunes in coming months.


With the stock market back in a confirmed uptrend, we recommended exposure at 40% to 60%. A bias to the higher end seems appropriate, due to bullish action and encouraging trends.

Software Shines As Gold Miners Lag
----------------------------------


All S&P 500 sectors ended the day positive. Consumer discretionary and real estate fared best, while energy and defensive utilities sector posted the smallest gains.



As ever, the performance of IBD industry groups offered a more granular view of stock market action.


Educational software plays and car companies were top performers. Database, enterprise and security software stocks also excelled.


**PagerDuty** ([PD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PD)), in the desktop software group, joined Leaderboard Friday and ended the day 6.7% higher.


Foreign banks, oil & gas realty trusts, gold miners and drugstores suffered the most.


There were also breakouts galore, though some were in light volume. The likes of **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Monster** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) and **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) were among stocks passing buy points.

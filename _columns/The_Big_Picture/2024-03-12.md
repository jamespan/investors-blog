  Stock Market Takes Inflation Data In Stride; Nasdaq Pops 1.5%, Helped By Oracle Earnings

Buyers dictated the action again in the stock market Tuesday even as [consumer prices in February](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-feb-fed-rate-cut-sp-500/) came in slightly above expectations. Small caps sat out the rally.




Tech investors were in a good mood early after **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) [reported strong results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oracle-stock-orcl-jumps-earnings-beat/) late Monday. The software giant gapped out of a lengthy consolidation, helped by strength in its cloud infrastructure business, which saw revenue jump 49% to $1.9 billion. That accounted for about 14% of total revenue.


The consumer price index showed [core prices up 3.8% year over year](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-feb-fed-rate-cut-sp-500/), but Wall Street found solace in medical care services prices, which slipped 0.1% after a 0.7% increase in January. Health care services prices are the biggest component of the core PCE price index, a closely watched inflation gauge by the Fed. It's found every month inside the Personal Income & Spending report.


The 10-year Treasury yield rallied on the hotter-than-expected inflation data and was trading near 4.15%, up 5 basis points, just after the stock market close. The Federal Reserve meets next week, but the first interest rate cut isn't expected until the June meeting, with two more quarter-point cuts expected by the end of the year. That would bring the fed funds rate down to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%.


Small caps watched from the sidelines as the Russell 2000 closed fractionally lower but off session lows.


Stock Market Today: Boeing Down 4.3%
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP031224-229x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial added 0.6%, shrugging off a 4.3% decline for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) that deducted 54 points off the Dow. Shares were weak after the New York Times reported that Boeing failed nearly 40% of Federal Aviation Administration audits of its 737 manufacturing process. Boeing's manufacturing partner, **Spirit AeroSystems** ([SPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPR)), fared even worse.


**3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were top gainers in the blue-chip index, adding a combined 140 points to the Dow's 235-point gain.


The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.5% in higher volume. But breadth was disappointing again, with decliners having a slight edge over advancers. The Nasdaq continues to hold above its 21-day exponential average, which has been a support level since the Nov. 1 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/).


**Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) moved well in the Nasdaq 100, up nearly 2%. The maker of continuous glucose monitoring systems for diabetics reversed higher and reclaimed a 132.03 entry, resulting in its addition to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio as a new half position. The portfolio is currently around 70% invested, in line with IBD's current recommended exposure level of 60%-80%.


The S&P 500 marked another all-time closing high, rising 1.1% in higher volume. Inside the S&P 500, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) rallied 4% and cleared a short trendline, resulting in an increase in position size in Leaderboard. The enterprise software giant first joined the Leaders list on Oct. 31, 2023.


What To Do Now
--------------


The confirmed uptrend continues to show signs of strength. But there's no shortage of yellow flags, including three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the Nasdaq last week. When distribution days start to cluster, it almost always causes problems for an uptrend. That said, the distribution-day count is still manageable, with four on the Nasdaq and four on the S&P 500. The S&P 500's Feb. 5 distribution day fell off the count Tuesday due to time.


Another yellow flag is that two big stock market leaders — **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) — are showing signs they could be near a top.


Super Micro closed Tuesday nearly 80% above its 50-day moving average. Nvidia is only 34% above its 50-day line, but Friday's reversal in huge volume was a sign to take profits. Volume was the heaviest for a down session in many months, a sign that Nvidia could be ready to consolidate gains and take a breather after a torrid run.


Another challenging aspect in the current stock market is that there's just not much out there to buy. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are starting to get extended again from their 50-day lines. Not surprisingly, that's resulted in a large number of extended stocks. Also be wary of buying laggard stocks in a hot group.


A good example is **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) in the homebuilder group. While leaders in the group have already emerged like **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), D.R. Horton is near the top of a shallow base. A breakout could work, but the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is lagging.


The session served up a couple of breakouts from the likes of coffee chain **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) and Korean internet retailer **Coupang** ([CPNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPNG)).


Dutch Bros cleared a 32.31 entry Tuesday in heavy volume. But a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 66 is lackluster. Coupang, meanwhile, cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) and closed just above a 19.27 buy point. Coupang's RS Rating is a little better at 77 but still not the mark of a true leader.

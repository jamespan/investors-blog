Is the bear market coming?




Judging by some ways to view the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), the pessimists could certainly sing resounding choruses that it is. Yet while many indexes look less than healthy lately, perhaps the real way to view stocks is this way: Parts of it look weak, like parts of the economy today, yet others don't appear so bad.


Bear Market? Not Yet
--------------------


On Wednesday, small caps led the decline. That's quite normal when fund managers try to look out six, 12 months ahead and determine whether equities are worth the risk. The Russell 2000 paced the day's drop, down almost 1.2%.

This marked the third down day in four sessions.


Midcaps had a bad day at the office, too.


The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund lost nearly 1%. At 442.41, MDY has no gains to show so far in 2023. And like the Russell 2000, it's waddling below one of the most important technical levels in stock market analysis, the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP052423-210x300.jpg)Meanwhile, a last-hour mini rally helped other indexes trim their losses some. The Nasdaq composite initially lost 1.1%, but whittled that down to 0.6% by day's end. The S&P 500 etched its third decline in four sessions. Yet the large-cap benchmark, off 1% intraday, ended 0.7% lower.


The rebound followed the release of minutes from the Fed's May 3 meeting, in which the U.S. central bank hiked rates to the current range of 5%-5.25% in an ongoing bid to permanently quell inflation.


Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at Charlotte, N.C.-based financial advisory giant LPL Financial, noted that the Fed minutes "reflected what Federal Reserve officials have been signaling in their most recent speeches — that the cumulative effect of 500 basis points (of rate hikes) are still flowing into the broader economy."


James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, focused on a potential rift of views within the interest rate committee. He thinks that a greater number of Fed governors are currently leaning toward the view that further policy firming after the June meeting may not be necessary. "But the key take-away is that many participants focused on the need to retain optionality after the June 13-14 decision," Knightley said.


Back To The S&P 500
-------------------



For now, Wednesday's sell-off did not force the S&P 500 to a test of institutional buying support of its 50-day line.


Go to equal-weighted views of the large caps, and of course the bear market argument may seem to gain more clout.


Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) sank 1.1% on Wednesday. It's totally failed in trying to rise back above its converged 50- and 200-day moving averages.



At 140.01, RSP is down almost 1% year to date. First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) lost 0.6% on Wednesday. It's been more or less swimming sideways since early February.


What Still Looks Bullish?
-------------------------


In contrast, the Nasdaq has now traded 10 weeks in a row above the 50-day moving average. That's the longest streak in more than a year.


Volume fell mildly on both exchanges. So the [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) did not change from its unusually lopsided levels.


The astute IBD reader would likely wonder: How can IBD maintain a positive outlook on the stock market when the distribution count is in bear market territory — at least as far as the S&P 500 is concerned.


A vital step? Look at each individual bout of professional selling.


Unlike what was witnessed in 2022, the magnitude of the declines in the S&P 500 has been smaller. Only three of the seven distribution days on the books — a 1.6% rip lower on April 25, a 1.2% cut on May 2 and 1.1% drop Tuesday — actually exceeded 1%.


Meanwhile, the average decline of the other four distribution days, on April 20, May 4, May 9 and May 16, averaged 0.6%.


A fledgling bull market fails quickly when, after you see a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-leads-bullish-turn-in-stock-market-but-still-must-clear-these-potential-pitfalls/), you see indexes get totally battered. Here, think slides in the 1.5%, 2% or 2.5% range. That simply has not yet occurred.


Not Rising, Despite Bear Market Fears
-------------------------------------


In the meantime, defensive issues have not served as a safe haven. **Hershey** ([HSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSY)) (94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), 95 EPS Rating, 87 Relative Strength) seems the exception. Yet normally you might see utilities, for instance, become the sturdy ship that sails through dark and stormy seas. Not this year so far. The Dow Jones Utility Average, off 0.6% on Wednesday to 907.70, has fallen 7% since Jan. 1.



Higher interest rates, of course, matter for the providers of natural gas, water and electricity. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged up 2 basis points to 3.71%. That's up from a year-to-date low of 3.25% but also well shy of the 52-week peak of 4.33%.


According to the CME FedWatch tool, the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will make a fourth straight quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates to a target range of 5.25%-5% at its June 13-14 meeting grew to 35.9%.


At an industry group level, for sure, Wednesday's session carried some defensive, bear market undertones. Only five of IBD's 197 industry groups rose 1% or more. They included wholesale food sellers, up 3.3%; dairy products, up 2.6%, and movies, up 2%.


The only true growth industry that shined? The security software makers. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) got plenty of airtime in Wednesday's IBD Live show for active investors.


Palo Alto earned a spot in [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as well.


The X Date Factor
-----------------


Judith Ranieri, senior portfolio manager of the Gabelli U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (GUSTO), noted that the U.S. has raised the debt limit 78 times since 1960. So, what makes 2023 different?


"Specific maturities that fall around the X date, specifically June 1 through June 13, have dramatically changed," Ranieri said in an email sent to IBD. They are "trading anywhere between 5.6%-5.8%, approximately 120 basis points (or 1.2 percentage points) cheap relative to T-bills maturing early July. Outside of that sector, we really haven't seen much signs of distress." The X date refers to the day in which the U.S. government could not pay interest on outstanding bonds to holders.


Ranieri adds that she sees three potential near-term outcomes:


* Debt ceiling gets raised "without associated spending cuts."
* The debt limit rises alongside modest cuts to government spending.
* Congress temporarily suspends the debt ceiling until a later date in the year.


Ranieri believes that "in any of these scenarios, it's likely the process will draw out to the eleventh hour."

The major indexes all closed higher Wednesday as the current stock market comeback maintained its momentum. Meanwhile, the bulls finally caught up to the bears in a key investor sentiment gauge.




The Nasdaq composite fared best as it moved 1.6% higher. It has now posted a gain in four out of the last five sessions.


Also on Wednesday, the Nasdaq managed to wipe out two [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) due to the 5% advance rule and now carries none. While it remains down almost 24% for the year, investors will look for it to turn the corner.


The S&P 500 closed off session highs but still rose 0.6%. This allowed it to pull further clear of the [key 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). It remains stuck on four distribution days for now.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was mixed. Consumer discretionary and technology were the best areas while health and utilities lagged the most.


Blue chips struggled to make the same progress. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session up almost 0.2%. Disappointingly, [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) lagged, dropping 2.7% following **Elevance Health**'s ([ELV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELV)) earnings report. But UNH remains in its buy zone above a 518.80 entry.


The Russell 2000 ended the day up 1.6% while the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) underwhelmed with a 0.2% gain.

Exposure Can Be Raised, But Remember This
-----------------------------------------


While the current uptrend remains under pressure for now, the encouraging action means investors can raise their exposure somewhat.


Nevertheless, it is key for growth investors to manage risk carefully. This fact remains: A lack of buying opportunities at the moment is a hard-to-ignore flaw of the current confirmed uptrend.


Put another way, it is still not the time to be aggressively chasing gains.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said investors still need to be on their guard.


"Today's price action was constructive for U.S. stocks, but that could all change tomorrow," he said. "This week had two big risk events on the calendar, the European Central Bank rate hike decision and the restart of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which are both tomorrow."


Netflix Stock Move Lifts This Group
-----------------------------------


With the stock market action looking increasingly positive, it is essential to keep track of top-performing industry groups.


On Wednesday, food wholesalers as well as computer database software and enterprise software firms were among the standouts.



The Leisure-Movies group was also given a lift [after Netflix surged on better-than-expected earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-video-streamer-loses-just-1-million-subscribers/) and subscription figures.


Given NFLX's outsize market cap, its gain of more than 7% helped the industry group make a solid gain for the day of 5.5%. It is now surging further above its 50-day moving average.


On the downside, it was a bad session for managed care stocks, gold miners and utility plays.

Bulls Catch Up To Bears In This Key Stock Market Gauge
------------------------------------------------------


The latest advisors sentiment weekly report from [Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) saw the bulls finally catch up to the bears.


The bull-bear spread is now flat after narrowing from -4.2% last week. This ends an 11-week streak of negative spreads.


The ratio of bears in the stock market fell to 35.2% from 36.6% the previous week. Meanwhile, the bulls inched higher, rising from 32.4% to 35.2%. The ratio of newsletter editors now projecting a correction — an intermediate-level decline in the range of 10% to 19% — fell from 31% to 29.6%.


Remember, this is a contrarian indicator. The fact that the bull-bear spread is now flat underlines the current uncertainty in the broader stock market. So, managing risk is still of paramount importance.


As ever, it is key that investors use daily action of the major indexes and performance of the current stock market leaders as their main guide.

The stock market Friday called a merciful halt to a week of annoying action. Even the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average failed to find stability.




During the week, the market's biggest price decline came in fading volume. The biggest price gain also came in falling volume.


Neither the bulls nor the bears found much satisfaction.


On Friday, the Nasdaq dropped less than 0.2%, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average led the market with a 0.5% pop. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE despite an options expiration day.

A positive sign was Friday's price ranges. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed near session highs after a second straight positive reversal. Even at Friday's worst levels, the indexes remained far from wiping out Thursday's gains.


Dow Jones Stocks
----------------


The Dow had its own letdowns for the week.


Dow member **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fell 5.3% for the week despite news that Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) added a modest amount to its Apple holdings in Q3. (Apple is Berkshire's No. 1 holding by percentage of assets.)


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) dropped 9% for the week even after Berkshire upped its stake by 38%.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) shaved off 1.2% for the week despite Buffett's new position opened in the third quarter. JPMorgan is now Berkshire's 10th biggest holding.


A market that can't find joy on news of Buffett's bullishness is a strange beast.


Still, Friday's session had its bright spots.


Stocks breaking out in strong volume included **Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage** ([NGVC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NGVC)), up 35%, and home nursing provider **Amedisys** ([AMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMED)), up 3%.


Other stocks are near buy points. As of Friday, they included Big Cap 20 member **T-Mobile U.S.** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)), 2% off a new high; railroad operator **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)), 4% off; **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)), 5% off; and hamburger chain **Wendy's** ([WEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEN)), 4% off a new high.


Turnaround For Wendy's
----------------------


Wendy's has staged a turnaround. In 2014-2017, revenue declined each year while earnings growth averaged 12%.


The Street expects revenue to jump 30% in 2018, while earnings rise 33%.


In Q3, Wendy's opened 37 new restaurants, including 14 in the international space. International stores account for only 1.2% of total revenue. So the chance for growth exists. New unit additions are expected to grow about 10 times faster internationally than in the U.S. and Canada.


Another area of growth is deliveries via mobile app. The average check size is 1.5 to 2 times greater in Wendy's delivery orders than in stores.


Wendy's has marked $250 million for share buybacks.


Wendy's is No. 3 in the restaurant group in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-wendys-company-wen.aspx) at Investors.com. As of September, Wendy's had 6,669 restaurants including 350 owned and operated by the company.

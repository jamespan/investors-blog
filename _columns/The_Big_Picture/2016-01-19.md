Stocks ended mixed and mostly unchanged Tuesday, a disappointing performance after a strong start. The Nasdaq lost 0.3%, erasing a 1.4% early gain. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%, and the S&P 500 rose less than 0.1%. Volume fell from Friday's lofty levels.


Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 1.3%. The IBD 50 hung in there, rising 0.2%.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by 2 to 1 on both main exchanges. Weak breadth has been a problem for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 for a while now. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line started to trend lower in mid-2015. It took a little longer for breadth to deteriorate on the S&P 500. Its advance-decline line (see chart on Page B4) started to weaken in early November.

The data raised some eyebrows, considering that electricity consumption climbed just 0.5% last year. The 6.9% growth was lower than the 7.3% growth of 2014, leading some to believe that more stimulus could be on the way for the world's No. 2 economy.


Once again, U.S. stocks followed the oil market lower. Benchmark West Texas intermediate crude oil settled at $28.46 a barrel, down 96 cents, or 3.3%.


Price action in the main indexes Tuesday was typical of a market in a correction, in which strong opens fade by the close.


The selling has been so pronounced that the market is having a tough time mustering up the first day of a rally attempt. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 tried to rally two times last week, only to be met by stiff selling the very next session.


To be sure, the most recent pullback has a different feel from others in recent months, mostly because of the damage done to leading growth stocks this time around. Not that long ago, distribution day counts were high in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, yet both indexes were able to hold near highs, and damage to institutional-quality growth names was limited.


At one point Tuesday, more than 80% of IBD 50 components were trading below their 50-day moving averages. It doesn't mean that Armageddon is upon us, but it does mean that growth stocks have started the base-building process.


Institutional investors taking profits in high-flying growth stocks and moving into defensive areas of the market is nothing new.


Defensive names like **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) and **Clorox** ([CLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLX)) continue to hold up well; the same with many high-yielding real estate investment trusts.


IBD 50 component **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) is among a select group of institutional stocks holding above their 50-day moving averages. A cup-with-handle base is still intact with a 55.74 entry.


After the close, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) rallied 7% in extended trading, after quarterly profit topped expectations thanks to strong international subscriber growth. The company added 4.04 million international subscribers, above its estimate of 3.5 million.

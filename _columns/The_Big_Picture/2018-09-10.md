Nasdaq, S&P 500 Lead Quiet Session; Transports Explode Higher
==============================================================

The Rosh Hashana holiday spawned a lackluster session on Wall Street Monday as major stock indexes ended mixed in lower volume. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 led the way, up 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. The S&P 500 ended near its session low.




The Dow Jones industrial average lagged, falling 0.2%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in lower than Friday's levels.


The Dow Jones might've lagged Monday, but that didn't stop the blue-chip index from delivering some strong performers. Shares of **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) gained just over 2%. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was a drag on the Dow, falling 3%.


Semiconductor stocks buoyed the Nasdaq as the Philadelphia Semiconductor index rallied 1.1%. But it's too early to say that chip stocks can provide sustained leadership. The index found support at the 50-day moving average, although resistance looks strong around the 1,400 level.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MP091018.jpg)Among fabless semiconductor firms, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) have been standout performers. But a look inside the chipmaker group doesn't stir much excitement. Only one stock in the group has a Composite Rating higher than 80. That would be **CTS Corp**. ([CTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTS)), a thinly traded small-cap stock.


Shares of **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) surged 8.5% to 285.50, helped by positive comments from R.W. Baird. The analyst maintained an overweight rating with a 411 price target. Tesla did well Monday, but it's still damaged goods from a technical perspective after a flurry of [negative headlines](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-staff-reorganization-musk/) around the company. Shares plunged nearly 13% last week.


Market In Confirmed Uptrend
---------------------------


The confirmed uptrend is still intact as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 hold above their 50-day moving averages. The Dow is also holding above its 50-day line, but the 26,000 level has proved to be a tough nut to crack for the blue-chip index.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have five distribution days each. That's an elevated count, but each index continues to show generally sound price action. The Nasdaq flashed two distribution days last week, but only one, the 1.2% drop on Sept. 5, had the feel of harsh institutional selling.


For now, the price action of leading growth stocks trumps sporadic signs of institutional selling in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.


Transports Surge
----------------


The Dow Jones Transportation index was a big winner Monday, helped by strength in trucking and logistics stocks. The index rose 1.8% to an all-time high. With the U.S. economy firing on all cylinders, it's not surprising to see transportation stocks doing well. A booming economy should translate into bigger profits.


In the logistics group, small cap **Echo Global Logistics** ([ECHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ECHO)) [cleared a flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 34.93 buy point. Shares closed at 36.65, up 7%. Two other stocks in the group — **Expeditors International** ([EXPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPD)) and **C.H. Robinson** ([CHRW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHRW)) — are near the top of consolidations, making them [breakout candidates](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/).



In the trucking group, **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) and **Landstar System** ([LSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSTR)) hit new highs. **ArcBest** ([ARCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCB)), **J.B. Hunt Transport Services** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) and **Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)) are closing in quickly on buy points.


Old Dominion Freight Line was featured in a recent [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-old-dominion-freight-line-odfl/) column.


Hurricane Florence Winners
--------------------------


As Hurricane Florence gathered steam in the Atlantic, a couple of hurricane-related stocks rose. **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 56.74 entry. Shares jumped 5.6% to 58.83. Generac makes power generators. Meanwhile, **PGT Innovations** ([PGTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGTI)), a maker of impact resistant doors and windows, hit a new high with a 3.3% gain to 26.20. It was featured earlier this month in the [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-pgt-innovations/) column.



PGT was a top gainer in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), along with **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)), **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Control4** ([CTRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRL)). The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed, rising 0.8%.


Six names on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) gained 1% or more Monday. **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) was the big winner, up more than 5%, after [William Blair reiterated an outperform rating](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/control4-roku-bullish-analyst-reports/).

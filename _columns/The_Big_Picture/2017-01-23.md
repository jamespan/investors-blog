Major stock indexes ended with modest losses Monday, but it was a positive session as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fought back after early weakness, ending near session highs.


Wall Street's focus was, at least in part, on a few executive orders out of the Trump White House, including one that withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal that was negotiated by President Obama but never ratified by Congress.


![mp012317](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP012317.png)The S&P 500 lagged, falling 0.3%, weighed down by weakness in **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)). Last week, shares of the chip giant slumped 6% after the Federal Trade Commission raised antitrust concerns. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) on Friday sued Qualcomm, saying it overcharged for chips and failed to deliver on a promise of $1 billion in rebates.


The Dow lost 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.1%. The Russell 2000 gave up 0.3% as it seeks support at the 50-day moving average. If the index breaks below this support level, the next stop for the small-cap index could be around 1300, nearly 4% below where it is now.


The IBD 50 ended fractionally lower as names like **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) outperformed.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *FANG+ stocks were out of favor after Election Day. But Netflix, Alphabet and Apple are in buy range, while Faceb[ook and Amazon have formed proper handles](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-facebook-amazon-form-handles-as-alphabet-hits-high/) in sound patterns.*

Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Friday's levels. Options expired Friday, resulting in higher volume on the NYSE but lower volume on the Nasdaq.


Gold settled at its highest level since mid-November, rising $10.70, or 0.9%, to $1,215.60 an ounce.


Highly liquid gold miners like **Barrick Gold** ([ABX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABX)) and **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) outperformed, but both are still below their 200-day moving average lines, which have been recent resistance levels. With the market in a confirmed uptrend, it's a bit curious to see gold miners — which often act as defensive plays — doing so well.


Auto parts retailers lagged after the New York Post reported that **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is getting into the auto parts business. **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)), **Genuine Parts** ([GPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPC)) and **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) lost 3% to 4%.


It's a busy week of earnings, with infrastructure play **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) set to report Tuesday before the open. It's been building a flat base around the 100 level for several weeks now.


Meanwhile, **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) is setting up in a cup-with-handle base with 16.04 buy point ahead of an earnings report Wednesday before the open.


**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is working on shallow, cup-shaped base ahead of earnings Thursday after the close. It's holding above its 10-week moving average despite a poor Relative Price Strength Rating of 50.


It's never easy to make consistent money in the stock market, especially when the market's been sending mixed signals. And that's been the case for a while now.


There are plenty of interesting chart setups out there in individual growth names, which is encouraging.


While high-quality names like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) in position to break out, the question is whether or not growth-fund managers are willing to supply the buying power to fuel the breakouts.


Meanwhile, bullishness among newsletter writers remains at extreme levels. Last week, bullish sentiment hit an 18-month high at 60.6%, the second reading above 60% among eight straight weekly readings in the danger zone above 55%, according to Investors Intelligence.


The distribution-day count for the Nasdaq remains stubbornly high, with eight on the Nasdaq and four on the S&P 500. The S&P 500's Dec. 14 distribution day fell off the count at Monday's close due to time.

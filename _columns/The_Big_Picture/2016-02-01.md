A new week of trading Monday followed an old script, at least for a while, as major averages tracked the oil market lower.


But stocks ended near session highs, recovering most or all of their early losses. The Nasdaq added 0.1% after dropping just over 1% earlier. The Dow eased 0.1% and the S&P 500 fell a fraction. The IBD 50 outperformed, rising nearly 0.8%.

Volume fell from Friday’s above-average levels. Declining stocks had a small edge over advancers on both major exchanges.


The market’s recovery came even though oil couldn’t get out of its own way. At the York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for March delivery slumped $2, or 6%, to $31.62 a barrel.


Oil was weak after China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index contracted for the sixth-straight month to 49.4. China is among the world’s largest oil importers. Another reason for oil weakness could have been profit taking after a strong showing last week.


The market also interpreted comments from Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer to be mostly dovish. Among other things, he noted that continued sluggishness in global economies could result in slowing growth in the U.S. Translation: More rate hikes from the Fed this year aren’t a slam dunk.


The market went back into a confirmed uptrend Jan. 26, when the S&P 500 gained 1.4% in higher volume. It wasn’t a powerful follow-through day, but it was a sign of strength nonetheless that couldn’t be ignored. The index got smacked with a distribution day the very next day. Two sessions later, the benchmark index soared 2.4% in higher volume.


When it comes to overall market health, Friday’s solid showing for the S&P 500 had a much different feel than its initial follow-through day. Why? Because the strength was more broad, with several top stocks acting well.


On Friday, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) cleared a 110.75 buy point, following through after Thursday’s bullish gap up. **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) cleared a 55.74 entry in above-average trade, and **Intercontinental Exchange** ([ICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICE)) cleared a 260.28 buy point in solid volume. All three turned in solid showings Monday.


Airlines outperformed Monday, helped by strength in **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)). Shares rose 4% after the European low-cost carrier reported earnings and announced a big share buyback, citing “rising profitability and improving cash flow.”

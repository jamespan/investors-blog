  Stock Market Bides Time After Nasdaq's Sign Of Strength; Leading Stocks Hold Up

Sellers were in the stock market for the third straight session Wednesday after the Nasdaq's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on Friday. But it's been a tame pullback so far, and it's still too early to give up on the nascent uptrend — even as the Nasdaq gets resistance at its 50-day moving average.




Why? Because the number of leading growth stocks with sounds charts is too large to ignore. In the [software sector](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), for example, **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) and **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) continue to hold comfortably near highs and well above their rising 50-day moving averages.


**Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)), however, proved itself a weak link in the group Wednesday. It triggered [a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) Wednesday by falling more than 7% below a 50.74 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But overall, damage in the enterprise software group has been limited.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP061219-274x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite ended with a loss of 0.4%, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 0.2%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index ended mostly flat. Volume fell on the Nadaq, and preliminary data showed NYSE volume coming in lower than Tuesday. The bulls like the fact that distribution, or institutional selling, has not appeared since the Nasdaq's sign of strength last week.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed with a 0.3% gain. The exchange traded fund was helped by solid gains for **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The Nasdaq showed [stalling-type](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) action Tuesday, closing near its intraday low in higher volume. Sellers were around Tuesday, and they were also around Monday when the Nasdaq halved a 2% intraday gain. But the uptrend is still very much intact with plenty of healthy stock charts out there. That said, the bulls want to see a conviction move for the Nasdaq above its 50-day moving average sooner rather than later.


The safe-haven trade was alive and well Wednesday in areas like utilities and gold, but oil and gas-related groups faced another round of selling.


Crude oil lost another 4% to $51.14 a barrel, a five-month low, after U.S. supply data revealed a second straight weekly climb in inventories. New market leadership isn't likely to come from oil and gas names — not with most far off 52-week highs amid cloudy fundamental outlooks.


Crude oil started to drop in late April, around the time the 10-year Treasury yield started its descent. The oil market and the bond market continue to fret about a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown.


Stock Market Today: Chips Lag
-----------------------------


[Semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) lagged, with VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) down 2.2%. After seven straight gains, chipmaker **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) slumped 2.3%, giving up support at its 50-day moving average. **Broadcom**'s ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) seven-session win streak also came to end as shares fell 1.3%. Earnings are due Thursday after the close.



But it's been an orderly pullback so far for [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)). After a breakout last week over a 30.05 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), it's still above the buy point.


IPO Soars In Debut
------------------


In [IPO news](https://www.investors.com/iponews), **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) soared around 70% on its first day of trading. The security software stock priced at 34, nicely above its upwardly revised range of 28-30. CrowdStrike opened at 63.50 and closed at 58.


CrowdStrike is among a group of IPOs with big sales growth but no profits. Other top-performing new issues in this boat with bullish charts include **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)), **Silk Road Medical** ([SILK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SILK)) and **PagerDuty** ([PD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PD)).


In related news, new issue **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) rebounded strongly after Tuesday's 6% decline. The stock on Tuesday came close to erasing a double-digit gain from a 91.56 buy point. Headed into Wednesday, Zoom Video was back inside the 5% buy zone, but after Wednesday's strong gain, it's extended again.

With the market tide still flowing positive, it makes sense to look for actionable buys. **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) gave a buy signal Wednesday and joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) with a breakout over a trend line. But if you've been looking at favorite growth screens lately, you know that the market has been stingy with actionable setups, with no shortage of low-volume moves. Keep in mind that a successful first test of the 10-week moving average can be just as profitable as buying a [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) breakout.


New issue **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) also showed impressive price action after a rough showing Tuesday. Shares jumped more than 12% in higher volume, but the stock isn't buyable now. At this point, it's best to wait for the stock to pause and consolidate gains. If it does, a new entry could be seen.

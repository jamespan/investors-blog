The stock market lost its footing Wednesday, but the slide was mild. The same couldn't be said, however, for certain companies that are suffering a dive in earnings or posting operating losses.


Just look at names such as **Myriad Genetics** ([MYGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYGN)) (down 33% in the highest volume in more than a year) and solar play **SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) (down 30%), which reported results that sharply missed Wall Street views. Both companies deal with cutting-edge technologies and were once true market leaders. No more.


The Nasdaq composite, one day after posting a record closing price of 5225, fell as much as 0.6% before afternoon bargain-hunting likely helped cut the loss to 0.4% by day's end. The S&P 500 fell 0.3%. Volume cooled mildly on both main exchanges.


Small caps took bigger bruises. The Russell 2000 slipped 0.7%.


While a sharp drop in crude oil prices and poor results in the solar sector caused some heavy selling in energy stocks, they weren't alone. Generic drug, biotech, steel, regional bank, data storage and semiconductor equipment stocks also dropped hard. On the Nasdaq, losing stocks outmatched winners by nearly a 2-to-1 ratio; in the NYSE, the ratio was less extreme as losers beat winners 16-to-13.


![MP081016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP081016-181x300.jpg)As seen in the Market Pulse table, the distribution count for both key indexes is slightly elevated at four each. Why care?


IBD's study of market tops going back to 1900 shows that distribution days tend to cluster just as stocks peak and are turning lower. A drop of 0.2% or more in heavier trade signifies distribution, and the S&P 500 has now marked four such instances of intense professional selling over the past 25 trading sessions. Most of these sessions have lacked intensity, though.


The biggest decline among these four distribution days? A 0.6% drop on Aug. 2. Three other distribution days fell within the range of 0.2% to 0.3%. Then there's Tuesday's rare stalling day, in which the large-cap index actually gained ground, up a fraction, but spun its wheels in doing so.


On the Nasdaq, the biggest distribution day was a 0.9% decline on Aug. 2.


So while the slightly elevated distribution count may not favor the bulls, we really haven't yet seen the kind of powerful selling that normally sends the indexes barreling lower -- as was the case on June 24 following Britain's surprise referendum in favor of departing the European Union.


Overall, the action of the leading stocks is sound. That's another plus for short- and midterm traders as well as longer-term investors. A quick scan of the IBD 50 also shows that companies with consistently outstanding increases in earnings and sales still look to be under institutional accumulation. They include **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)), **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)). The average age of these stocks: 4.5 years.


Will stocks have the energy to scale new price highs? Various factors indicate the probability is high.


The earnings picture continues to improve. S&P 500 earnings are now seen falling just 2.1% in the second quarter, and that's largely due to another plunge in oil company profits. Excluding the energy sector, the S&P 500 would likely see a 2.8% lift in earnings. In the consumer discretionary sector, earnings are on pace to rise 13.8%; industrial sector profits are likely to jump 13%. Positive earnings surprises are just slightly below the historical average, according to Lindsey Bell, senior analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.


The economy is growing, as perhaps best seen by last week's stronger-than-expected jobs report. Yet the slow pace is likely to continue. As reported on Tuesday, U.S. productivity sank 0.5% in Q2, missing views. Higher productivity is certainly better for overall economic growth. While unit labor costs rose 2%, the overall inflation picture is currently unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve's ultracautious stance on interest rates.


Finally, raging optimism is absent. The latest Investors Intelligence survey pegged bullishness among stock market newsletter editors at 54.3% and bearishness at 20.9%. While the bulls' figure may seem high, it still pales with the 60%-plus figures seen in both January and June of 2014.


However, keep an eye on the CBOE Volatility Index, or the VIX. At 12.05 on Wednesday, it's back near very low levels seen back in July and early August of 2015, right before that big China-inspired sell-off. With the market up big since its key bottoms in 2009 and 2011, it still seems fair to say that external events still have the power to shock U.S. financial markets.

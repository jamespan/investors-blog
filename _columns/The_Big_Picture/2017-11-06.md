  Stocks Rise, But Is Nasdaq Signaling A Pullback?

The stock market closed higher Monday, another day of record highs that might make investors wonder if a pullback is near.




Strength in the semiconductor sector caused the Nasdaq to lead with an increase of 0.3%. **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) confirmed a buyout bid for **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) valued at  up to $130 billion, which sent other chip stocks higher.


IBD's chipmaking industry group climbed 2.3% and the chip-design group jumped 2.6%. The chip-equipment group was flat, however. **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) and **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)), two more companies reported to be in buyout talks, rose sharply.


Cavium surged 9% to the highest level since January 2011, while broke out past the 70.18 [buy point](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of a [cup-with-handle base](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) in heavy volume.

The S&P 500 added 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average inched up a fraction, weighed by **Verizon**'s ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) 4% slide in 2-1/2 times average volume. News that **Sprint** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) and **T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) ended merger talks sparked worries that [wireless competition will heat up](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tower-firms-up-telecoms-fall-on-failed-t-mobile-sprint-merger/).


Small caps are again lagging. The Russell 2000, which rose 0.2% Monday, has not made a new high since Oct. 5. Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


After solid gains in October, the major indexes this month are extending what is already an impressive performance for 2017. The Nasdaq is up about 26%, the S&P 500 nearly 16%, and the Dow 19%.


A cluster of [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in late October resulted in minor losses, and a rally Oct. 27 reinvigorated investors. That's left the indexes with no clear signs of fatigue.


While distribution days are for the most part at normal levels, another positive development is this: For more than a week now, the Nasdaq and S&P have risen several times in higher or above-average volume. That indicates heavy buying of shares at the nation's institutional trading desks.


The Nasdaq and S&P now have B or B- Accumulation/Distribution ratings, which also reflects net buying.


But indexes do pull back to the mean, which means investors cannot assume an unimpeded advance. The Nasdaq on Monday closed 4% above its 50-day moving average for the third time in the past five sessions. The last time a similar pattern occurred was in early June. The composite pulled back 4.1% from June 9 to July 6.


One characteristic of 2017 is how sector rotation has kept the broad market motoring higher. Today, the energy sector is emerging and was the leader on Monday.


Drilling, exploration, production, field services, solar, machinery were in the top 10 of 197 groups Monday.


Oil prices jumped to two-year high, topping $57 a barrel. A couple of events over the weekend heated up the oil market. In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered some members of royal family arrested, and the Saudis said they shot down a missile fired by rebels in Yemen.


Moreover, an agreement to extend production curbs is expected, while demand for crude appears to be rising.


**Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base ahead of its earnings report scheduled for late Monday. The stock climbed above the 27.98 buy point in 33% more volume than usual.

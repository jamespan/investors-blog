Stocks advanced in quiet volume Friday, as the Nasdaq closed above its 50-day line for the first time since late September.

  

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 0.7% each. The IBD 50 led with a 1.2% gain.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

The Nasdaq retook its 50-day moving average, but further testing is likely. The S&P 500 remains just under its 50-day line.

  

Meanwhile, top-rated stocks continue to show strong price-and-volume action.

  

On Friday, stocks adding to post-breakout gains in vigorous volume included **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) and **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)). All three have risen above their 5% buy zones.

  

Individual investors should closely watch the early breakouts. Elite leaders often emerge early in an uptrend.

  

For example, three days after an uptrend resumed Jan. 14, **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) gapped up out of a consolidation and then gained 94% in eight months.

  

A day before the follow-through day of Feb. 11, **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) broke out. The stock gained 42% in less than a month.

  

Two days after the May 27 follow-through, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) broke out of a double-bottom base. As of Friday's close, the stock was 49% above the 72.60 entry.

  

How does an investor identify the elite leader?

  

There's no easy way, but the above three stocks held some characteristics in common. Each had a Composite Rating of 91 or better. Each broke out from a first- or second-stage base. And two of the three broke out with triple-digit volume spikes.

  

The current uptrend is young enough that the elite leaders might not have broken out yet.

  

So far, those stocks that broke out with a high Composite Rating and an early base count include Celgene, Boise Cascade, O'Reilly Automotive, **AmTrust Financial Services** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)), **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), **C.R. Bard** ([BCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCR)), **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) and **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)).

  

Triple-digit volume on the breakout was there for Illumina and Alexion.

  

One factor to consider is Brazil's presidential election Sunday. While Brazil might not seem relevant to the U.S. stock market, a victory by pro-growth challenger AÃ©cio Neves could be a sign that a new trend is under way. In May, for instance, pro-business candidate Narendra Modi became India's prime minister.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 leapt 6.3%, the Nasdaq 5.3% and the S&P 500 4.1%.

  

Earnings season continues in the coming week with a long lineup that includes **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)).

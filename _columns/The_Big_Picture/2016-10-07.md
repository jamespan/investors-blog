U.S. stock indexes spent the week posting minor gains and minor losses, adding to the conviction that this market has no conviction.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each sawed off 0.3% Friday, while the Dow Jones industrial average sanded off less than 0.2%. Small caps hurt the most as the S&P 600 severed 0.8%. The IBD 50 dropped 0.6%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE.


![mp100716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP100716.png)The action on the S&P 500 -- a sizable loss in rising volume -- was just enough to trigger a new distribution day.


For the week, the Nasdaq and IBD 50 lost 0.4%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.7%. The losses ended a mild three-week win streak on both major exchanges.


With the recent week signifying little to the bulls and bears alike, a step back might give individual investors a better sense of what's going on.


Let's look at the winning and losing stock groups over the past four weeks. Why four weeks? Two reasons: The four-week period offers a look at action since the Nasdaq's closing low on Sept. 9. Also, four weeks covers most of the five weeks that make up the market's current condition. (In the Market Pulse, the current outlook is defined by the past five weeks.)


The top 20 performers over the past four weeks include oil and natural gas plays, semiconductors and a couple of retail groups.


The No. 1 performer was the oil and gas drillers group, which led with a 14% gain over the four weeks. This is no surprise, considering the recent rally in the price of crude oil.


Specialty steel was No. 2, jumping 11%. This group has no stocks that are of elite quality, but the group could provide some turnaround candidates.


On the negative side, the gold and silver mining group dropped 13%. Other groups suffering were building stocks, including homebuilders, and retail, including restaurants.


The trouble in the restaurant group is not a good sign. A rebounding economy should spur consumer spending, and restaurants are a natural place for that to occur.


The restaurant group provides 15 stocks with EPS Ratings of 90 or higher. A rating of 90 means the stock is in the top 10 percentile among all stocks in IBD's database. Yet those 15 stocks generally have low Relative Price Strength ratings.


One area where the restaurants are weak is sales. In the most recently reported quarter, less than half of the 15 stocks delivered revenue growth in double digits.


That's something to watch when restaurants report Q3 results later in this earnings season.

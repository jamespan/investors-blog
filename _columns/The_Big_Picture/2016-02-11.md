Stocks Lose More Ground; Bulls Hope For Bottom
===============================================

Bears toyed with the bulls Thursday, slapping them around most of the day and then allowing them to trim the losses.


The Nasdaq settled for a 0.4% loss after being down 1.7% in morning trade. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial fell 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively.


The IBD 50 slipped 0.5%.


Volume rose across the board.


**O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) was one of the day's better performers, gaining 5% and retaking its 50-day line as it works on a base.

The Nasdaq's low of the day took it 19.5% off its July high, barely above the 20% decline that traditionally defines a bear market. The NYSE composite and Russell 2000 hit the minus-20% level Jan. 20 and Jan. 11, respectively.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has kept its decline to a little more than 15%.


At this juncture, there appears to be little conviction that the market has found a firm bottom. Yet old investors know that sometimes the lack of conviction is one of the preconditions that can lead to a rebound.


The stock market itself is the most important indicator. Individual investors should resist the temptation to try and outsmart the market.


Wait for a follow-through day to confirm that a new uptrend is underway.


Other secondary and anecdotal indicators are mostly negative.


--The IBD Mutual Fund has been looking sicker than the major indexes.


--New lows are slaughtering new highs in IBD's quality-filtered tally.


--The put-call ratio has crossed the 1.15 level four times this year without pegging a solid market bottom.


--Less than 20% of NYSE stocks are above the 200-day line.


--Bearish advisers outnumber bullish ones 39.2% to 24.7%, which often happens before a rally. However, this has been the case for five straight weeks.


One bright spot is gold. The iShares Gold Trust ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)) exchange-traded fund is up 18% year to date, including a 4% gain Thursday.


While that's a nice feast for the permabears, the gold ETF is 35% off its 2011 high.


Crude oil futures rebounded some after a report that OPEC was ready to participate in a production cut. However, a similar rumor that Russia initiated in late January proved false.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims were about 4% fewer than expected.

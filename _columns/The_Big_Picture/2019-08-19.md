  Stocks Extend Rally, But Market Shows A Few Soft Spots As Big Test Looms

After rallying two days, the stock market is quickly getting over last week's recession scare, but now comes a key test.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 are making a fresh attempt to reclaim their 50-day moving averages. Sellers emerged twice this month when indexes tried to climb above their averages, so these lines are the next key test for the market's rebound.


If the market maintains the rhythm of the past two sessions, indexes could soon shove aside that obstacle. But if indexes again fade from their 50-day lines, there's reason to be more guarded. A sudden turn downward would not be surprising in a month of August that has been quite volatile.


The Nasdaq climbed 1.4%, adding to its 1.7% burst on Friday. The S&P 500 rose 1.2% on top of Friday's 1.4% surge. Both indexes have wiped away the losses from Wednesday's sell-off, when a brief [inversion of the two-year and 10-year Treasury yields](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/inverted-yield-curve/) sparked a recession warning.

CLOSE




Monday's advance was broad. Rising stocks beat decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE. Nasdaq winners beat losers by about 13-to-5.


Bullish breadth helps correct a divergence in the Nasdaq's advance-decline line. Last week, the line undercut an Aug. 5 low, even while the Nasdaq held above its Aug. 5 low. The A-D line did not make a new high when the Nasdaq made new highs in late July, before the index tumbled. But the NYSE A-D line is near highs, acting much better.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP_081919-277x300.jpg)Every S&P sector rose, with energy, communications services, retail and technology up the most. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1%, and has more ground to make up before it can reach its 50-day average.


Volume declined on the NYSE and Nasdaq. With institutions not opening their wallets so much, the market showed a soft spot. Volume was also not so hearty in Friday's rally, even with the tailwind of an options expiration day.


Leaders Don't Keep Up With Stock Market
---------------------------------------


There were a couple of other suspicious signs in Monday's rally.


Leading stocks curiously lagged. The IBD 50 rose 0.5%, less than half the major indexes' gains.


The once-formidable software stocks are showing some wear, which is hitting the leaders.


**Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) were [in the bottom 10 of the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Trade Desk slipped below its 50-day line. The others remained in their current chart patterns, and Veeva was added to the [IBD Leaderboard watch list](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as it forms a new base.


Cybersecurity stocks in particular are struggling. The industry was a top-10 group just three weeks ago, and [now it's ranked No. 45](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-aug-16-2019/).


**Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) plunged 11% Monday after [an analyst downgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zscaler-stock-plunges-zs-downgrade-otr/). The stock triggered the [7%-8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), and its break of the 50-day line in heavy volume was another sell signal. Zscaler was kicked off Leaderboard.


**CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) flashed similar sell signals earlier this month. **Fortinet**'s ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) breakout attempt after its Aug. 1 earnings report quickly dissolved. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) slid below its converged 50-day and 200-day moving averages on Friday, on news that [a top executive is leaving](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palo-alto-stock-falls-management-changes/).


Software Stocks Wobble
----------------------


The party indeed may be over for this industry group. Enterprise software remains a top-10 group, although **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) has been weakening since July. **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) technically is forming a base, but shares are living below the 10-week line.


Two Chinese stocks — **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) and **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)) — had the best performance on the IBD 50. Both are recovering from corrections.


Monday's breakout list was lackluster. Many closed below their buy points, and volume was mainly weak. Part of the reason is that earnings season is winding down, so there are fewer headlines to spark breakouts.


One earnings breakout could be in store for **Sea Ltd.** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)). The Singapore-based e-commerce and digital entertainment company reports earnings Tuesday before the open. With support at the 10-week line and 10% of the stock's float being shorted, there's potential for a fast move higher.

Stock Correction Continues, But A Few Signs Of A Low Emerge
============================================================

What a terrible week.


The stock market correction left more leading stocks thrashed and brought echoes of the 2008 financial crisis. Yet, indexes erased steep losses, and the Nasdaq 100 gave a glimmer of hope for a bottom.




The S&P 500 slid 0.8% on Friday and 11.5% for the week. That made it the worst week since it plummeted 18.2% the week of Oct. 3, 2008. The Nasdaq — off 10.6% the past week — recorded its seventh worst week in history and the worst since October 2008.


Yet after a late rebound, the Nasdaq eliminated a 3.5% early-Friday loss and closed with a minimal gain. The composite found support around the 200-day moving average. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), the ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100, bounced right at its 200-day line, ending 0.1% higher.


The reversal at a key price level was a sign of a possible bottom, as pressure grew on the Federal Reserve to [act to prevent a coronavirus-induced recession](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-cut-coming-will-it-help-dow-jones-buck-coronavirus/). Also, the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) spiked to 1.26, an elevated level of fear that has marked index lows many times. Indeed, it's now the highest since May 28, just a few days before a June 3 market low.

But a bounce from current oversold levels would not be a surprise. Just don't treat any rebound as a green light to buy shares; investors must wait for a [follow-through signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).


An Unusual Stock Market Correction
----------------------------------


After months of gratifying gains, the stock market correction came swiftly and harshly. With Friday's losses, the S&P 500 wiped away everything it gained from the [Aug. 13 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bulls-get-third-major-buy-signal-this-year-why/) that confirmed a nearly five-month rally. The Nasdaq was left with less than 7% from that follow-through.


The IBD 50 rose 0.3% but was [still strewn with stocks making sell signals](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/best-growth-stocks-in-ibd-50-sees-multiple-sell-signals/). **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), for example, saw its breakout fail. **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) plummeted below its 10-week moving average.



If the stock market correction ends soon, the early leaders could be in technology. Several semiconductor stocks rebounded, though most are not in proper patterns yet.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) had fallen about 20% from its prior high, but it is [finding support around the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Software leader **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is also finding support near its 50-day line.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4% and remains below its 200-day line.

The Nasdaq composite reversed slightly lower Wednesday after hitting an all-time high, but it was still a constructive session for the bulls. Top stocks in the Nasdaq today included several semiconductor stocks, helped by strong earnings from **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) and **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)).




The Philadelphia Semiconductor index added nearly 1%. After jumping 4.1% last week, the index is up another 2% this week. Big chip gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)), **KLA Corp.** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)), but Xilinx shares plunged in after-hours trading [following the company's earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/xilinx-earnings-q4-2019-xilinx-stock/).


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials lost 0.2%. After jumping 1.5% Tuesday, iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) picked up 0.3% Wednesday to 158.06. The small-cap ETF is just below a 159.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP_1x6_042419-239x300.jpg)Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE from Tuesday's totals. Despite an elevated distribution-day count for the S&P 500, heavy institutional selling has been the exception, not the rule. Of the S&P 500's six distribution days, three showed declines of 0.2% to 0.5%. Two were [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) sessions. Only the March 22 distribution day, where the S&P 500 fell 1.9% in higher volume, had the feel of unequivocal institutional.


Transports Lead Again
---------------------


The Dow Jones Transportation Average outperformed again, up 0.9%, helped by another strong showing from railroad stocks. **Canadian Pacific Railway** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)) was a big winner in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com). Strong earnings from the railroad operator fueled a breakout over a 224.29 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)) also gapped up on earnings.


IBD's railroad group rose about 1%. It's up 1.7% so far this week, helped by strength in other railroad stocks like **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)). **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)) and **CSX Corp**. ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) are steady after last week's solid gains. Stock market bears expecting a recession aren't paying attention to the price action of railroad stocks. If the U.S. economy were headed for a recession, railroad stocks would be pricing in a slowdown.


General Market Health
---------------------


The stock market's overall technical picture is sound, and the bull thesis remains strong. First-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a good start, and a low-interest rate environment should be a boon to earnings going forward. Fears of a recession for the U.S. economy have eased. For proof, just look at recent strength in the U.S. dollar. But the greenback's strength has come at the expense of the euro. Earlier this month, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi warned that risks to the eurozone economy remained to the downside.


Top Stocks Act Well
-------------------


The argument that the market has priced in a lot of good news certainly holds water, but the fact that [leading growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) continue to show strength bodes well for the bulls. **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) and **Q2 Holdings** ([QTWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QTWO)) have followed through nicely after breakouts this week.


Stocks building sound bases aren't hard to find; it's the same with stocks finding support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout. ServiceNow was doing both ahead of [its earnings report after the close Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/servicenow-earnings-now-stock-q12019/). Shares were up 2.5% in late trading to around 248.72, just below a 251.75 flat base entry.


**E****Bay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) and **Brinks** ([BCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCO)) also gapped up on earnings. EBay gapped up over a trend line, presenting an early entry, but it's still below a conventional entry of 39.24. Brinks' buy point was 81.22.


In the software sector, **Mimecast** ([MIME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIME)) and **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) are setting up in new bases. The buy point for Mimecast is 51.76, and Coupa's entry is 100.10, but Coupa's base is later stage.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures eased 0.6% to $65.89 a barrel. Many oil and gas stocks have been recovering but most remain far off highs. One of the healthier names in the sector is oil and gas producer **Cabot Oil & Gas** ([COG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COG)). It's near a 26.22 buy point ahead of its earnings report Friday before the open. But its relative strength line has been trending lower since late January. It's good to see the relative strength at or near highs when a stock is trying to break out.

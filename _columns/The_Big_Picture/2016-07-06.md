Stocks staged a positive rebound Wednesday and the major indexes took back almost all of the prior day's losses. Is it a good omen for the rest of the year for stock pickers?


Perhaps. Yet the market's choppiness has made it clear that stock investors still have a bad case of the jitters. You'd have to look at other asset classes to see where the money is truly flowing.


While it's nothing more than a prediction, it appears that commodities are going to have their best year since silver futures eclipsed the $20-an-ounce barrier with ease. The CRB Reuters [commodity index](https://www.investors.com/category/research/futures/) is up 7.8% year-to-date, outstripping the S&P 500's 2.7% gain. **Randgold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)), a U.K.-based miner with operations mainly in Africa, gapped up 6.6% in heavy volume on June 24, clearing an eight-week base. On Wednesday, the stock finished at 125.41, up 23% from the 101.70 buy point.


Bond prices keep spearheading higher. A day after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield dug out an all-time low on Tuesday, the yield on the Japan 20-year long-term government bond dipped briefly below 0%. Message: The June 23 Brexit decision is still casting a foggy pall over world financial markets and the prospects of global economic growth.


The Nasdaq composite, buoyed by healthy buying overall in the megacap tech space, led with a gain of nearly 0.8% in higher volume. It was down nearly 0.8% in the early going, yet climbed back decisively above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages by day's end.


The S&P 500 rallied in similar fashion, going from a 0.7% early-morning loss to rise 0.5% as NYSE turnover also climbed. The S&P SmallCap 600 rebounded 0.6%. Big caps lagged a bit, as the Dow Jones industrials rose just 0.4%.


Due to a data error, IBD incorrectly stated in Tuesday's Big Picture column that the Nasdaq saw a distribution day (defined simply as a decline of at least 0.2% in higher volume than the prior day), when in fact Nasdaq turnover on Tuesday shrank to 1.68 billion shares from 1.73 billion on Friday (Monday was the July Fourth national holiday). The S&P 500 saw higher NYSE turnover during Tuesday's decline, so it's tagged with a single distribution day.


When the major indexes rise in higher volume, think of it as evidence of institutional accumulation. Every market rally needs the support of big funds, pensions, banks and other large investors. Such action seemed to drive three straight days of gains in healthy volume from June 28 to 30, the last day of which counted as a rare Day 3 follow-through that signaled a new tradable rally may be in motion.


![MP070616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP070616-1.jpg)In a tradable rally, good breakouts should appear. They might not appear in bunches right away, but expect the offerings to expand as a confirmed uptrend lengthens it legs.


The accompanying Market Pulse table reflected how it's not been easy to find winners. They have tended to come from a wide range of industries, from homebuilding and construction to business services and financial transactions. The IBD 50 reflects this diversity as well. On a positive note, the [Sector Leaders screen](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) in recent days has shown as many as eight stocks, the most exhibited this year so far. Following Wednesday's market action, five of the seven Sector Leaders went public in 2010 or later, including **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) (2012), **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) (2013) and **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) (2014).


Wednesday's session also featured positive market internals overall. Winners beat losers by a 3-to-2 margin on the Nasdaq and roughly 4 to 3 on the NYSE. However, the new-high list still reflects a strong hunt for yield. REITs and utilities have dominated IBD's filtered new-high list, but the medical, retail and business services sectors have contributed good names as well.

  Stock Indexes Drop, But This Group Is Outperforming

Small-cap stocks kept their losses minor Thursday, but the major indexes retreated rapidly in the final two hours of trading.




The Nasdaq ended down 0.5%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2%, ending its win streak at nine days.


The small-cap Russell 2000 lost just under 0.1%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The technical picture improved for the market as the Aug. 16 distribution day expired, leaving the Nasdaq and S&P 500 with two and three distribution days, respectively. As recently as Sept. 7, the count was at seven days each.


Meanwhile, the small caps have outperformed recently, a good sign for three reasons.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MP092117-217x300.png)First, the traditional interpretation is that strength in small caps points to a healthy appetite for risk.


Second, small companies are more flexible than large-cap companies, allowing them to adjust to change more rapidly than their bigger brothers.


Third, small caps have a tie to manufacturing, and manufacturing in the U.S. is strengthening. (The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing gauge rose to 23.8 in September, topping the highest estimate in the range. Last week, the Empire State manufacturing survey rose to 24.4, also the highest estimate in the range.)


Manufacturing accounts for about 12% of GDP, but 98.5% of the manufacturing firms have fewer than 500 employees, according to government statistics.


Here's another consideration: Although the Russell 2000 lags the major indexes badly this year, the trend in the current rally is much different. Since the market's Aug. 21 close, which marked the last day with IBD's outlook at uptrend under pressure, the Russell 2000 is up 7% vs. 3% each for the Nasdaq, Dow and the S&P 500.


Small Caps To Consider
----------------------


Going into this week's action, IBD's quality-based screens featured 15 small caps.


In the IBD 50, the small caps are: electronics parts maker **Kemet** ([KEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEM)), which is testing its 50-day line; software maker for the connected home **Control4** ([CTRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRL)), which is extended; computer security provider **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)), also extended; mountain bike parts maker **Fox Factory** ([FOXF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXF)), extended; Argentine bank **Grupo Supervielle** ([SUPV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPV)), extended; motor home maker **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)), extended; weight-loss products marketer **Nutrisystem** ([NTRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRI)), which is consolidating; and homebuilder **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), which is working on a base-on-base pattern.


In the Stock Spotlight screen, small caps include: biotech **Supernus Pharmaceuticals** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)), which is trying to recover after triggering sell signals; medical-products developer **Lemaitre Vascular** ([LMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMAT)), extended; and chip equipment maker **Ultra Clean Holdings** ([UCTT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UCTT)), which is in the 5% buy zone.


In IBD's IPO Leaders screen, four stocks are small caps: pet medication maker **PetIQ** ([PETQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETQ)), which is consolidating; coal producer **Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)), which is testing its 50-day line; **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), which is in its 5% buy zone; and **TPG Real Estate Finance** ([TRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRTX)), which is correcting.


Financials and small banks also have climbed recently, and are another reason for the Russell's outperformance, but many are thinly traded.



**Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)), another small cap, broke out Thursday, clearing a 32.65 buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern. Volume was only 18% above average. But weekly volume is running 50% above average.


Boise Cascade's recent history is positive. The stock broke out in July 2016 and advanced 26%. A breakout in April led to a 16% gain and a resetting of the base count. So the current breakout is first stage.


Big Cap Action
--------------


Big-cap stock **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) rushed above a 140.31 buy point in volume 52% above average. The stock's Composite Rating is 70, which means 30% of the stocks in IBD's database have better ratings. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.


Other big caps approaching or crossing buy points include: financial asset manager **State Street** ([STT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STT)), insurer **MetLife** ([MET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MET)), rail operator **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)) and defense stocks **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) and **General Dynamics** ([GD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GD)).

Leading indicators for August rolled in at 0.4%.


After Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's comments Wednesday, the CME Group's FedWatch Tool now puts the odds for a December rate hike at 75.3%. A week ago, the odds were 51.5%.

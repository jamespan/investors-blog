The rally in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) likely cannot be pinned on one reason.




Bargain hunters swooping in after ogling weeks of sharp losses? Hedge funds covering a lot of their short-sale positions? Fund managers, seeing yields on long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds cool off, breathing some relief and thus not selling as hard? Who knows.


But the careful IBD-style investor can see this truth: Growth stocks, especially outside the oil and agriculture sectors, are still showing an absence of true breakouts. Few numbers of leaders are rebounding off key technical levels, such as the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Stocks Today: Why It's Still A Tough Environment
------------------------------------------------


So even though the Nasdaq catapulted 3.8% Friday while other indexes clocked gains well north of 1%, one may conclude it's still best to simply watch the market's behavior and keep most of the portfolio's powder dry.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP051322-300x269.jpg)The Nasdaq's gain cut its weekly loss to 2.8%, which is still steep. Yet at one point, the composite sank as much as 8.5% midweek. Friday's rebound failed to stop what is now a six-week slide. The S&P 500, up 2.4% on Friday, got support around 4000, perhaps a key psychological level. Yet at 4023, the large-cap benchmark still fell 2.4% for the week. It too registered a sixth weekly drop in a row.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 1.5% on Friday, still lost 2.1% for the week for its seventh down week in a row.


Looking at IBD's 197 industry groups, mostly laggards shot ahead the strongest.


They include solar energy, a 10.4% gain on a price-weighted basis. The group ranks 175th among 197 for six-month relative performance, [according to MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).


The database software and enterprise software industries rolled 10% and 7.7% higher, respectively. They both rank in the bottom 10 of IBD's group rankings. Losses year to date still top 40%.


Fabless semiconductor stocks gained 6.6% as a group, while gaming rallied 6.4%, automakers 6.2%, internet retail 5.5% and security software 5.2%.

Fundamentals And Profits In Q2
------------------------------


The challenge facing stocks today remains immense. The market is still digesting news of large inflation numbers (see the [report on April CPI data](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-is-finally-falling-but-its-still-too-hot-dow-jones-falls/), released Wednesday). Yes, institutions bought back U.S. government bonds; Cboe data showed the yield on the key 10-year note slid 18 basis points for the week to 2.93%. That's the biggest weekly drop since a 26-basis-point plunge in the week ended March 4. Yet a rise in the cost of money has been relentless since January.


Some investment pros are already thinking hard about how profitability among corporations will fare in the current quarter.


"Margins held up very well in Q1 — hovering at historic highs, 13.4%. But Q2 will be the test," Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, wrote in a comment emailed to IBD. "We think that companies will work hard to maintain margins — a combination of price increases... and cuts to employment. We are seeing the beginning of this trend but obviously have a long way to go."


Beyond Stocks Today: Investor Pessimism Still On The Rise
---------------------------------------------------------



[Bearishness among market pundits](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) polled each week by Investors Intelligence has soared. A 40.8% reading almost eclipses the 41.7% peak seen during the thick of 2020's coronavirus-driven bear market.


Bitcoin traders, meanwhile, are licking deep wounds. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ([BITO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITO)) debuted on the NYSE with gains in three of its first four weeks. Despite a 5.5% rebound Friday, the ETF still fell 16.6% for the week and notched all-time lows.


So while many investors have likely raised quite a lot of cash and are afraid to touch equities, the market still needs a new host of excellent companies that show the key elements of CAN SLIM investing: rising fundamentals, outperformance vs. most stocks today, and evidence of rising fund ownership.


As the [latest Inside The IBD 50 column notes](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), few such companies, meanwhile, are ready to complete good bases and deliver mouth-watering breakouts. So the key move today may be this: [Keep screening for stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). And stay patient.

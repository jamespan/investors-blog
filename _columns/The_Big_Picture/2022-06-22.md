Gyrations continued on Wednesday, but less so in the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) and more so in adjacent markets.




Stock Market Today: Quiet Compared To Oil's Massacre
----------------------------------------------------


U.S. crude oil futures slumped as much as 7.3% before closing the session off 4.8% at $104.30 a barrel. Meanwhile, [testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to Congress](https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-says-fed-needs-compelling-evidence-of-inflation-slowdown-to-alter-rate-rise-path-11655904616?mod=hp_lead_pos1) appeared to set off a wave of buying in long-dated Treasuries. That sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond falling 15 basis points to 3.15%.


Yet technically speaking, if you look at the long-term action in the 10-year Treasury bond, you'll likely notice that buyers from somewhere around the world get an appetite when the yield rises above 3%. (To see that action, please type in zero-TNX in [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and see a monthly chart.)


Yet overall, the mild declines among major indexes inflicted minimal damage amid a still-broken environment for growth investing.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP062222-289x300.jpg)While the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all finished with losses of less than 0.2%, small-cap and midcap names only did a touch worse for the day. The Russell 2000 slipped 0.2%; SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) eased just 0.3%.


Volume rose less than 1% on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and sank on the NYSE.


That small drop in the Nasdaq composite actually masks a relatively wide range of trading. The swing, in fact, from the day's low to high surpassed 2.5%.


Put another way, at the day's peak of 11,216, the tech-heavy index actually scored a 1.3% gain intraday.


Why The Nasdaq, Other Indexes Still Look Frail
----------------------------------------------


At the day's close of 11,053, the Nasdaq, up 21.4% in 2021, still lies more than 8% below its 50-day moving average and 21% beneath its long-term 200-day line. This fact alone affirms the weakness in stocks. In general, investors only should be deploying capital into stocks when the key equity indexes are rising above key technical levels, not struggling beneath them.


The S&P 500 squandered a 1% intraday advance. Nonetheless, it has not given back much of its prior two-day rebound of more than 2.6%.


Yet below the surface of these key benchmarks, investors in recent days clearly nailed down more gains in the best sector of 2022 so far: oil and gas.


Consider the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com/growth250/?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=WP_G_SRCH_BRAND_AMT_MARKETSMITH_BRAND&campaignid=644414309&utm_content=Marketsmith_Growth_250&adgroupid=11440878332&utm_keyword=marketsmith%20growth%20250&matchtype=e&device=c&placement=&network=g&creative=552548118610&utm_name=trafficado&pdsch=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrlTHfmqNdszEGA1lJ5b8P8sT_frKESCT8kzxfNpnHvMEACsuFVnxmBoCn6IQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), which has contracted to an emaciated 132 stocks amid the bear market. A total 16 companies saw the day's volume exceed their respective average over the past 50 sessions by 50% or more. Among these 16, at least nine companies hailed from the oil and gas fields.


As noted in [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://get.investors.com/ibd-live/), **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) gave another clue on its chart that institutions are rushing to lock in gains.


When To Take Profits
--------------------



The daily chart shows the stock losing ground in eight of the past 10 trading sessions. As a result, the stock market leader has given up support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), a key sell signal.


A further decline through the [200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) would hint that sellers are now in control.


On a weekly chart, the 40-week moving average acts as a good proxy for the 200-day moving average on the daily chart. And, it may be worth looking at Diamondback's action in the fourth quarter of 2018.


After months of mostly sideways action, the Midland, Texas, firm slid 10% in above-average weekly turnover during the week ended Oct. 26, 2018. At 113.76, shares finished the week more than 9% below the 40-week line.



That ushered an 87% plunge over the next 17 months to the stock's coronavirus bear market low of 14.55.


Diamondback isn't expected to report Q2 results until 40 days from now. Obviously, due to strong energy prices, the company's fundamentals have been soaring. In just the past three quarters, earnings drove 374%, 343% and 126% higher vs. year-ago levels. For the year, analysts think full-year profit will jump 125% to $25.32 a share.


But do 2022 earnings estimates for the oil and gas sector hint that inflation will cool, at least next year? The Street's estimate for FANG's bottom line in 2023: down 8% to $23.18 a share.

  Stock Market Ends Mixed, Small Caps Fall; This Factor May Hurt Equities In July

The new market uptrend is still wobbling, but at least on Wednesday some parts of the stock market showed some grit.




The day's major headlines highlighted that the Federal Reserve remains devoutly committed to taming the inflationary beast — be it Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester's declaration that another 75-basis-point hike in interest rates in July makes total sense, or Jerome Powell's comments at a monetary policy conference in Portugal that he's now more worried about the risk of inflation staying too high than the risk of an economic recession.


So after the stock market opened, it looked like investors were poised to sell stocks across the board.


Stock Market Today: Good Reversal For Some Indexes
--------------------------------------------------


But the Nasdaq composite, losing 3% on Tuesday, nearly wiped away all of Wednesday's early-morning loss of 1%. It finished off just 3 points, less than 0.1%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP062922--264x300.jpg)The S&P 500, down 2% on Tuesday, edged 2 points lower. In contrast, gains of 2 points or more by at least eight of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 30 components — including [Leaderboard position](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and [IBD Long Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) [Microsoft](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) — helped hoist the blue-chip average to a nearly 0.3% gain.


Volume rose mildly on the Nasdaq vs. Tuesday. But the tiny size of the composite's decline, plus its close well off the day's lows, meant that it avoided a second straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). NYSE volume was virtually flat.


However, small caps suffered deeper declines amid a sharp sell-off in oil and gas firms and **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)).


While the Russell 2000 slipped 1.1%, the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund lost nearly 0.7%.


Bed Bath & Beyond saw its stock market value shrink to $399 million after shares cratered 23% in giant volume.



The online and brick-and-mortal home goods retailer posted a shocking loss of $2.83 a share in the May-ended quarter. A year ago, the company earned a nickel a share. Sales slumped 25% to $1.46 billion. Shares have now plunged 91% from the January 2021 peak of 53.90 — a level reached during the heady meme-stock buying craze. Understandably, BBBY shows a Relative Strength Rating of 1.


The retailer's report got followed by a diminished sales outlook from luxury home furnishings chain **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) after the market close. The news perhaps underscores what Steve Wyett is very concerned about regarding the stock market in July.


Biggest Concern For July
------------------------


"The earnings estimates for the second quarter have come down slowly, but I think this will change," Wyett, chief investment strategist at **BOK Financial** ([BOKF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOKF)), told IBD. The Tulsa, Okla.-based financial services giant has $100 billion in assets under management and advisement.


The main reason, in Wyett's view, has to do with a fundamental shift in how the Federal Reserve views its mandate regarding maintaining a long-term target of 2% annual inflation. "A recommitment to the 2% target means that the Fed is less likely to pivot (on monetary policy) if the economic numbers slow down, or even if we go into a recession," Wyett said. "Over the past 10 to 12 years, it took a long time just to get to 2%. Now it's harder to bring the inflation rate down to 2%. So the Fed is willing to accept lower economic activity. This skews risk to the economy to the downside."


In accordance with that view, Wyett's team has reduced its recommended allocation to equities in a balanced portfolio to 45% from 50%. "That's as low as we've been in a very long time," Wyett said.


RH, already down 11% for the week ahead of its sales warning after the close, has dropped 68% from its all-time peak.


Beyond The Stock Market: Oil And Bonds
--------------------------------------



On Wednesday, a 1.9% slide in crude oil futures sparked more selling in the oil and gas patch. **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) gave back nearly all of a two-day rebound after sinking 8.5%. The West Texas-focused oil and gas play has a market value of $2.5 billion. **Earthstone Energy** ([ESTE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESTE)), which produces oil and gas in North Dakota, whipsawed traders with an 8% drop in heavy volume. Shares closed back below the 50-day moving average.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond dropped 11 basis points to 3.09%. That reversed a three-day streak of gains. When the yield falls, it means investors are bidding bond prices up. Higher prices for the bond reduces the investment return, or yield, since the coupon of regular interest payments is fixed.


Look at a daily chart of the Cboe 10-year note's yield since June 9, when the yield began to go upward in nearly vertical fashion, and you get the feeling that institutional investors are viewing bond prices favorably at current levels.


Direxion 20 Year + Treasury Bear 3X ([TMV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMV)) fell 4.7%. The triple-levered fund, which falls when long-term interest rates go down, looks poised for a new test of the 50-day moving average.


The fed funds rate for overnight loans to banks looks poised to hit at least 2.5% by July. Wyett, who began his 40-year-plus career as a bond salesperson in 1982, thinks the majority of damage in the bond markets has actually been done. But that could change if inflation expectations among consumers rocket higher.

Will Powell Do This?
--------------------


"I can still see the 10-year bond at 3.5% by the end of the year," Wyett said. "The Fed wants to make sure it's aggressive enough so that inflation begins to fall (in the second half of the year). As long as headline inflation is down, the Fed will think it's on the right path. But what they're really thinking is this: It does not want to have a Volcker moment," referring to former U.S. central bank chief Paul Volcker, who raised interest rates so severely that long-term interest rates approached 20% in the early 1980s.


Wyett explains that back in the 1970s, the Fed had eased monetary policy too soon and let inflation reignite too quickly. It then realized that inflation would be around a long time. So, if inflation does not begin to fall and inflation expectations keep going up, then the Fed would be forced to raise short-term rates to a level of 4%-5%. That would be close to creating a positive interest rate in real (or inflation-adjusted) terms.


"The market has not modeled for this to happen," Wyett added.


Back to the stock market, a handful of [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) bucked the general decline with gains of 1% or more. They included auto parts retailing, managed care and ethical drugs. Money-center banks rose 0.5% as a group.


On the other end of the spectrum, solar, automaker, travel booking, metal ores, semiconductor equipment and mining machinery paced the downside. These groups lost 2% or more.

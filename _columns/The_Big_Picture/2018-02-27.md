Stocks Jolted By Inflation Fears, But Here's The Silver Lining
===============================================================

So much for Monday's bullish session for the stock market.


Major stock indexes ended with sharp losses Tuesday as Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified on Capitol Hill about the health of the economy and the path of interest rates. Wall Street seemed to focus on Powell's outlook for stronger growth, which put inflation fears on the front burner again. But overall, Powell's remarks suggested the Fed isn't ready for a faster pace of rate hikes and is willing to give the economy more room to run.




 The S&P 500 slumped 1.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite gave back 1.2% each. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and preliminary data showed volume climbed on the NYSE too. That marks a second [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the indexes since the Feb. 14 [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) day.


Mild signs of distribution are not a reason to start raising cash aggressively, but whiffs of institutional selling are always worth monitoring. It's not a major issue for the market for now because all three major stock indexes sit near highs and above their 50-day moving averages.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index lagged, falling 1.5%. It had been getting some resistance at the 50-day line, but reclaimed it Monday. It went back below the line Tuesday. The broad-based NYSE Composite slipped 1.4%, ending below the 50-day line after barely reclaiming it Monday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP022718.png)In prepared testimony, Powell said, "In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation to 2% on a sustained basis." The PCE deflator was recently around 1.5%.


Meanwhile, the market looked past another bullish reading on consumer confidence from the Conference Board. The index hit 130.8 in February, above the consensus estimate of 126.4, and a 17-year high. Early Wednesday, Wall Street will get a look at the second estimate to Q4 gross domestic product. The consensus estimate is for growth of 2.5%, down slightly from the first estimate of 2.6%. The market will look for signs of inflation in the data, no doubt.


The 10-year Treasury yield was trading late Tuesday around 2.90%, up 4 basis points, after hitting a four-year high last week of around 2.95%.


A reminder: Just because the market remains in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) doesn't mean it's an easy environment to make consistent money on the long side. As always, keep new buys on a tight leash. If a newer position turns negative, cutting losses at 3% to 4% often makes sense rather than waiting for [the 7% to 8% stop-loss](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/) to trigger.


Among the day's movers, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was a solid performer in the Dow, up 1.6% to 49.91, after a Citibank analyst named it a top pick for 2018. The semiconductor giant is back near highs after a recent sharp pullback that saw shares drop more than 17% in a 10-day period. The pullback started just after Intel gapped up in price Jan. 26 on strong earnings.


The silver lining to Tuesday session was that damage to market-leading growth stocks was minimal. The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund was down only 0.3%.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) was  a nice gainer in the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), up more than 2% to 173.24, but the stock ended near its session low after gapping higher on strong earnings. Palo Alto competes with **Check Point** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) in the firewall security market. Headed into earnings, Palo Alto was already extended past a 156.95 point.


Elsewhere, IBD 50 name **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) continued its impressive rebound, rising more than 2% to 56.25. After flashing a sell signal from a 55.41 buy point, the health savings account custodian reclaimed the buy point Tuesday. It's three-session gain now stands at nearly 11%.


New issue **SendGrid** ([SEND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEND)) tried to clear a cup-without-handle base with a 27.53 buy point but came up short. A gain of nearly 9% intraday faded to 0.8% by the close.

Morgan Stanley brought the company public in November at 16 a share, but SendGrid is a thinly traded name, with a low average daily dollar volume of just over $6 million. The company operates a cloud-based digital communication platform that's seeing strong demand. In the past four quarters, year-over-year sales growth has averaged between 37% and 45%.


Meanwhile, **Square**'s ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) numbers were impressive after the close and sales guidance was solid. But shares retreated in volatile action after falling more than 1% to 45.91 during the regular session.


Square had been setting up in a cup-with-handle base with a 47.60 entry, but it was a flawed base due to a couple of factors. For starters, just before its latest base started forming, it flashed signs of a climax run. Second, the handle area corrected 23%, much more than normal.

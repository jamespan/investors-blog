Stocks closed mixed in a half-session of trading Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a record high but the Nasdaq composite continuing to slack off.




Strength in financials and energy stocks helped the Dow and S&P 500 rise 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, even if both gave back much of their early gains by the time trading ended at 1 p.m. ET. The Dow's session high of 21,562 was good for an all-time high. The S&P 500 had climbed as much as 0.6% before paring gains.


Small caps were unusually buoyant as the Russell 2000 added 0.8%. The Dow transports also climbed 0.8%. Naturally, volume was lower than Friday's totals. Before the early close, volume was trending higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.


But the Nasdaq's weakening trend continued, and a new signal caused some concern. The composite fell 0.5% for its fifth loss in the past six sessions. More significantly, the index closed 1% below the 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq had closed below the 50-day average the previous two days. The closes were the first under the 50-day line since April 13.

The Nasdaq accumulated a big lead over the S&P 500 and Dow in the first half of the year, but the trend is reversing. The S&P and Dow are holding up better. The Nasdaq's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has weakened to D+ while the S&P 500's is still at B. The advance-decline lines also are diverging: The Nasdaq line has been flat since mid-February and the NYSE's is still trending moderately higher.


The half-dozen distribution days on the Nasdaq are a big reason why IBD's market outlook is mixed. Cautious investing, with an inclination to cash and taking profits, should be the predominant strategy when the market uptrend is under pressure.


As it's been the case lately, broad weakness in the technology and internet sectors hurt the Nasdaq. The internet retail industry group fell nearly 2%; several semiconductor and software industry groups were off 1% to 1.6% and finished in the bottom.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) closed below the 50-day line for the first time since early this year. Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) sank deeper below its 50-day line. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) had already been silenced as a tech-sector winner, now three weeks below its moving average.



By comparison, financial and energy stocks were strong Monday. Drilling, oilfield services, exploration, regional bank, life insurance and other groups accounted for most of the day's 16 most productive industry groups. The energy sector, though, remains in a downtrend.


Financials are shining brightest. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) is in buy range from a 24.69 buy point. Financials followed a moderate rise in Treasury yields, which have been surging for a week. Expectations are growing that the Fed and other central banks will raise rates or move away from easy-money policies.


The Nasdaq 100 — which has the double misfortune of being heavy in tech and barren of financials — fell 0.9%.


With a half-session Monday and the market closed Tuesday for the Fourth of July holiday, market signals will be hard to read. Investors can use the extra time to evaluate their holdings, and weigh which make sense to continue holding while the market feels its way around.

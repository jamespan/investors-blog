Buyers came back into the stock market Friday after a harsh downside reversal for the major stock indexes Thursday. Friday's gains were fueled by mostly in-line [inflation data](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-key-inflation-rate-fell-more-than-expected-in-june-sp-500-rises/) inside the Personal Income and Spending report, along with another round of solid earnings reports.




The Nasdaq composite closed near its session high, up 1.9%. Top gainers included chip-equipment firm **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), which soared to an all-time high after a strong earnings and revenue beat.


While it's true that [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) have started to cluster in the Nasdaq (four since July 19), only two of the days really had the feel of institutional selling. One was on July 20, when the index slumped 2% in higher volume. The other was Thursday when the Nasdaq jumped 1.6% intraday, but reversed lower in higher volume.


But with the Nasdaq still holding comfortably above its 21-day exponential moving average and leading growth stocks acting well, there's no reason yet to adopt a bearish stance. Still, there are a lot of extended stocks out there, with actionable setups in shorter supply.


Advancers beat decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The IShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) also had a good day, rising 1.3%. The small-cap exchange traded fund is getting into position for a possible breakout try above the 200 level.

The S&P 500 recovered well after Thursday's distribution day, up 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5%, helped by earnings-driven gains for **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)). **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) also outperformed in the blue-chip index, gaining 2.3%.


Winners beat losers on the NYSE by more than 2-to-1.


After slumping 16 basis points Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield eased 4 basis points to around 3.97%. The next Federal Reserve meeting is in September. For now, futures traders are expecting the Fed to sit tight, leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5%. But there will be plenty of economic data for the Fed to ponder between now and then.


The spread between the 2-year yield and 10-year yield has narrowed as bond investors grow more confident that the U.S. will be able to avoid a recession.


Growth Stocks On The Move
-------------------------


Growth stocks shined again in the stock market today as nine [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks closed with gains of at least 2%. **ON Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)), which joined the Leaders list in late June, reversed nicely higher after slumping 6% intraday.



Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), enterprise software firm **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)) made a stand at its 50-day moving average, rising 6.5% in light volume. It's setting up in a seven-week consolidation, but the weekly chart shows some erratic price swings.


After a breakout from an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), new issue **Cava Group** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) rebounded 6.1%. Watch for Cava to trade sideways below its recent high of 54.86. If it can do that, a new base could form and give a new entry.

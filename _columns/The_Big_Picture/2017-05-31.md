U.S. stocks finished Wednesday with soft losses, but another hard fall for Wall Street and superregional banks indicated that investors are shifting more money into other sectors.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite finished the month on top with a gain of almost 2.5%, reflecting the strong demand for tech companies, particularly among those with market values of $25 billion to $100 billion or higher.


The S&P 500 gained nearly 1.2% for the month, while the Dow Jones industrial average lagged with a 0.3% advance.


The Dow utility average rose 3.1% in May, beating all of the major averages. This may indicate a few things. One, the hunger for yield is still strong. Two, the market is not expecting interest rates to rise sharply this year.


Another important sector-specific index, the Dow transports, gained 0.7% for the month.

Despite the rise in volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE, the losses were too small to be significant. Thus, the distribution-day count remained low, with three for the Nasdaq and two for the S&P 500.


What's more, a rebound in the final 90 minutes of the session, likely spurred by hints from the Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book survey that some areas of regional economic activity appeared to accelerate while others were just "modest to moderate," pushed the major indexes easily into the upper half of the day's trading ranges. High closes within each day's trading range are a sign of support at current prices.


The S&P 500, meanwhile, ended the day at 2411, just points below its all-time high of 2418.


At 6198, the Nasdaq is now up 15% since Jan. 1, well ahead of the S&P 500's 7.7% advance.


Another key trend in 2017? At the broad index level, small caps continue to lag behind their larger brethren. The S&P SmallCap 600, down just a hair on Wednesday, is still down for the year as well, off nearly 0.7%. But the Russell 2000, finishing the day at 1370, holds a slim year-to-date gain of almost 1%.


Beneath the tranquil action by the key benchmarks, however, large fund managers appeared to hustle in cutting their exposure to large investment banks and large lenders. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) have all fallen more than 10% from their 52-week highs, enough to regard them in a correction.


Foreign banks, as a group, have been doing better with a top-40 ranking. No doubt, you might have seen more than one equities strategist at a mutual fund company sing the praises of investing outside the U.S., be it in the developed world (such as Europe) or in the developing one. Always be mindful, however, that stocks in many foreign countries carry extra risk. Government turmoil, regional conflict, burdensome regulations and other problems can stifle returns overseas.


**Banco Bradesco** ([BBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBD)) is part of IBD's foreign bank group, but two weeks ago shares plunged 19% to 8.13 in boulder-like trade amid a rout in Brazilian shares. The Brazilian banking giant on May 15 broke out of a 10-week flat base with a 10.32 buy point, but the breakout itself lasted just three days.


On Wednesday, Banco Bradesco edged 1.4% lower to 8.48, 18% below the proper entry of 10.32.


India's **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) and **Icici Bank** ([IBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBN)) have been doing better. The former cleared a cup with handle at 73.42 in March and has rallied nearly 20%. The latter moved in choppy fashion for more than a year, but a weekly chart shows the stock deftly clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern near 8.99 in boisterous turnover during the week ended May 5. It has since gained 10%.


The U.S. equity markets go into June with plenty of reasons for potential further upside.


Corporate earnings have been rising. Interest rates are going back up haltingly. Inflation is modest. Commodities are not flying out of control. And investor optimism remains far from excessive.


The level of bullishness among pundits polled by Investors Intelligence sank to 50% on Wednesday, down sharply from the year-to-date high of 63.1% seen in early March. This means that half of those surveyed expect either an intermediate correction or a roaring bear market.

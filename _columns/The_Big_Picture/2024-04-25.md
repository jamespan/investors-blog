The stock market slashed heavy losses Thursday after the early morning release of weak GDP data, hotter-than-expected inflation numbers and **Meta Platforms'** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) stock plunge sent the major stock indexes reeling.




Meanwhile, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) advanced in extended trading after their earnings reports, sending futures higher.


Early Thursday, the markets plunged after the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced first-quarter GDP slowed to a rate of 1.6%, much lower than the expected 2.3% rate.


[And the BEA said the Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-inflation-rate-core-pce-gdp-q1-sp-500/), the core Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, rose at a 3.7% annual rate in the first quarter, above expectations of 3.4%. The headline PCE price index, which includes food and energy prices, rose 3.4%.


Next up, Wall Street will shift its attention to March's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, due before the open Friday. The PCE price index is expected to rise 0.3% on the month, with a 2.6% year-over-year increase. Wall Street expects the core PCE price index to climb 0.3% on the month, with an annual increase of 2.7%.


After cutting losses throughout Thursday's session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1% lower, while the S&P 500 reduced its loss to 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 0.6% but closed near the highs of the day's price range. And the small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.7%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session.


Up Next: Google, Microsoft Earnings; Inflation Data
---------------------------------------------------


Late Thursday, [Alphabet shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-google-stock-news-q12024/) soared 16% in extended trade, while [Microsoft stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-msft-fiscal-q3-2024-earnings/) rallied almost 5%.


Alphabet Thursday closed the regular session in buy range from a 153.78 buy point. Microsoft was poised to regain its 50-day moving average with its after-hours rally.

Dow Jones components **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) were the big losers, tumbling 7% and 8%, respectively. **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) was the top performer, with a 2.9% gain. All three reported earnings ahead of Thursday's open.


[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) were the biggest winners, up 5% and 3.7%, respectively. Both stocks remain in disrepair. Meanwhile, Meta stock broke down below its 50-day moving average, causing a sell signal.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund gained 0.7%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) climbed 0.5%, nearly hitting a new high as it continues to rebound from its 50-day line.



What To Do In Today's Stock Market
----------------------------------


Monday was Day One of the new rally attempt. That makes Thursday Day 4, which means a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) could occur any day, as IBD's recommended exposure level sits at 0%-20%.


In response, investors should be creating and pruning watchlists in preparation for the potential new market advance.


During [Thursday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), the team remained adamant about respecting market rules before jumping back into the market after last week's violent sell-off. It's important to wait for a proper follow-through day before investing aggressively again. As long as the major indexes don't undercut recent lows, the rally attempt remains intact, and the next uptrend could be just around the corner.


It's a good time to watch for stocks that are holding up with relative strength, because they could form bases amid the pullback and become leaders in the next uptrend.


In [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list Thursday, **Ceco Environmental** ([CECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CECO)) moved past a 24.43 buy point from a lopsided pattern.


**Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)) is right at a 69.33 buy point in a cup with handle.

Stock Market Leaders Chipotle, Texas Roadhouse
----------------------------------------------



**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), along with **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)), **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) and **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)), are among the best stocks to watch.


Chipotle rallied 6.3% Thursday after the company's earnings were announced. Shares topped a 3,023.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a short consolidation, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).


Medpace is in a base with a 419.42 buy point. But shares gave up their [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) during Thursday's 2% drop.Â [Texas Roadhouse](https://www.investors.com/research/texas-roadhouse-txrh-stock/) is just below a flat base's 157.12 buy point.


And [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock [Novo Nordisk](https://www.investors.com/research/novo-nordisk-nvo-stock/) surpassed a trendline entry around 126.25 this week, but gave up that entry during Wednesday's loss.

title: Stock Market Extends Rebound Despite Ukraine War; This Industry Sees Multiple Breakouts

The stock market extended its dramatic rebound with robust gains Friday, defying the gloom of war in Ukraine and other worries.




The Nasdaq composite added 1.6% Friday and the S&P 500 2.2% as indexes closed at session highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.5%. The two-day rally took the Nasdaq out of a 7% hole earlier in the week to a weekly gain of 1.1%. The S&P 500 made a similar reversal.


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq, though that wasn't much of a surprise after Thursday's trading climbed to the highest volume since Jan. 24.


With Thursday's impressive rebound and Friday's additional gains, the stock market looks to have shaken out a great many sellers. Indexes undercut the January lows, another sign that selling may be exhausting itself.


The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) on Thursday jumped to the highest point since Jan. 24. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) — another sentiment gauge — topped 1.0 earlier in the week, only the second time this year. While those aren't extremes that might signal a market bottom, they suggest a possible washout of sellers.


Stock Market Climbing Wall Of Worry
-----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP022522-300x280.jpg)Investing veterans say the stock market climbs a wall of worry. Wall Street certainly got its share this week with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.


Although U.S. stocks initially sold off on the news, the rebound was as welcomed as it was puzzling. Even as Russian troops closed in on Kyiv, U.S. stocks rallied. Western nations imposed sanctions against Russia, although [they were carefully targeted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-allies-roll-out-fresh-sanctions-on-russia-amid-debate-over-how-hard-to-hit-11645742424?mod=article_inline) to minimize unintended damage.


In one positive aspect for investors, the odds for a half-point interest rate increase in March have been falling since the Russian invasion. The odds for a quarter-point hike [are now 79%](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html).


Can the stock market turn this rebound into a sustained uptrend? While it's technically possible for a [rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) to come in just a few days, indexes have been unusually volatile this year. Follow-throughs in December and January failed.


Market leadership is limited and sometimes shifty. Most of the stocks near buy points belong to natural resources and shipping stocks. Yet some consumer, tech and health care companies are in the mix.

Steel Emerging As A Market Leader
---------------------------------



Drybulk fleet operator **Navios Maritime Partners** ([NMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMM)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in heavy trading.


And steelmakers are an emerging group after four breakouts Friday. **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) topped the 26.27 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/). **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) also broke out of a double bottom and closed just above the 68.27 entry. **Reliance Steel** ([RS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RS)) closed above a 181.31 buy point. **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) topped a 126.77 buy point.

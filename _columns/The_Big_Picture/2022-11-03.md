The stock market ended squarely lower ahead of Friday's jobs report, as the major stock indexes continued to fall in the wake of Wednesday's Fed-fueled sell-off. Tech titans continue to bear the brunt of the market losses, with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) falling for a seventh straight session.




In other notable action, **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) are setting up near new buy points, while **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)) is one of the latest casualties of Q3 earnings season.


Jobs Report, Treasury Yields
----------------------------


[Friday's jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-weak-october-data-may-blunt-hawkish-fed-talk/) is already predicted to be the softest since December 2020, with the U.S. economy expected to add 210,000 jobs. Yet there's reason to think it may turn out far weaker — perhaps even bad enough to provoke some rethinking about Fed chief Jerome Powell's rally-killing rate-hike plans.


For now, traders place a 52% probability of another 75-basis-point rate hike at December's Fed meeting, according to the [CME FedWatch Tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html)


The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.12% Thursday, settling at the highest level since Oct. 24.


Q3 Earnings Season Continues
----------------------------


Key earnings movers Thursday were **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)), **APA** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)), [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) and **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)). Others on the move included **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)).


Albemarle shares reversed from big losses to gain 3%, while APA stock advanced nearly 7%. Cheniere dropped almost 1%, as CF Industries rose 2%. Etsy surged 14%, but [Fortinet tumbled](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ftnt-stock-fortinet-earnings-fortinet-stock-q32022/) 13.7%. [Qualcomm dived 7.8%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qcom-stock-qualcomm-warns-of-weak-smartphone-sales/). Roku slashed losses but still stumbled 4.6%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 1.7%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.5%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP110322-238x300.jpg)Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, and also appeared to be lower on the NYSE. Lower volume means the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both avoided another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) reversed from early losses and climbed 0.5%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), energy giant **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) rallied nearly 6%, hitting a new high and extending itself further above a 118.49 cup-with-handle buy point.


Tech titans continued to struggle. Amazon lost 3.1% Thursday in big volume. The e-commerce giant is down about 46.4% year to date, on pace for its worst year since 2000, when it crumbled 79.6%.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) tumbled 4.1%. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) declined 4.2%. **Meta****Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) fell 1.8%. And **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) sold off 2.7%. Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft hit new 52-week lows.


Stock Market Rally Struggles
----------------------------


The stock market trend was downgraded to "uptrend under pressure" in the wake of Wednesday's Federal Reserve-fueled selling.


Since the Oct. 21 follow-through day, IBD has been recommending limited exposure (no more than 40%) due to this year's market volatility and a pattern of failed follow-through days. And the recent action has validated that more cautious approach.


At this point, investors should be playing defense; don't let profitable trades turn negative. As The Big Picture reiterated Wednesday, it makes sense to keep exposure at or below 20% until the uptrend resumes.


But it's not time to step away completely. The uptrend is still intact, so investors can still buy breakouts, but should focus on stocks with top-notch fundamental and technical metrics.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Arista, Enphase
----------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Arista Networks is approaching a buy point at 132.97 but could be adding a handle to its asymmetrical formation, which would lower the entry to 130.23. Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [ANET stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-arista-networks-anet.aspx) boasts a perfect 99 IBD Composite Rating.


Arista makes cloud networking software and hardware used by internet service providers and data centers.


Enphase Energy is on pace to add a handle to a cup base, which would move the correct buy point from 324.94 to 316.97, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Meanwhile, the stock's relative strength line is just off new highs after the stock decisively regained its 50-day line. Enphase stock also has a [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-enphase-energy-enph.aspx).


Arista Networks is a leading provider of solar microinverters and battery systems. Microinverters boost solar energy production, improve reliability in solar energy systems and support intelligent energy management.



WWE Breakout Falters
--------------------


Quarterly earnings continue to make or break stocks during the ongoing stock market volatility. And World Wrestling Entertainment was one of the latest casualties.


WWE shares faltered 4.5% Thursday after the wrestling entertainment giant missed earnings estimates as revenue topped views. WWE said it ended a probe into alleged misconduct by founder and ex-CEO Vince McMahon. But the company did not provide details.


The stock fell as much as 4.4% below the entry before paring losses after finding much-needed support at the 50-day line.

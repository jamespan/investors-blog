The stock market looked poised for a rough close Friday, but some late-session buying lifted the major averages well off session lows. Buyers came in late as Congress continued to negotiate a $900 billion coronavirus stimulus package.




Options and futures expired Friday, a "witching" that often results in higher volume, and that was definitely the case on the NYSE. Volume surged from Thursday, resulting in a mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500.


The Nasdaq composite halted a four-session win streak Friday, falling less than 0.1% after being down as much as 0.9%. The S&P 500 pared a 1% loss to 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also lost 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index gave back 0.4%.


On the NYSE, declining stocks outnumbered advancers by about 2-to-1. The ratio was less than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Stock Market Pullback?
----------------------


![MP121820](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP121820-264x300.jpg)The stock market showed resilience again Friday, but it certainly has reasons to pause and consolidate. The Nasdaq is starting to look a little extended at 7% above its 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the past few readings from the Investor's Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers still shows bullishness at excessive levels. That's not a good thing because widespread bullishness has been seen at or near several market tops in the past.


And the [IPO](https://www.investors.com/iponews) market has certainly seen its share of froth. Take China-based **Wunong Net Technology** ([WNW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WNW)), which priced at 5 a share and hit a high of 160.68 on its third day of trading.


**DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) and **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) also opened well above their offer prices. DoorDash rallied Friday after six straight declines. Airbnb also pulled back sharply after it its debut, but it's back near highs after three straight gains. It could try to break out soon from a short [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). Recent IPO **C3.ai** ([AI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AI)) cleared a five-day pattern Friday.


Just keep in mind that the more the headlines talk about froth and euphoria, the stock market could do the opposite of what's expected and keep heading higher.


As always, monitor your current holdings and understand that the case for a market pullback holds water. When it comes to highly profitably positions, it's easy to sit through normal pullbacks. For newer purchases, identify key support levels and don't let small losses get worse.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) extended its winning streak to seven sessions. The design software closed near session highs and topped a 127.60 buy point. But a breakout attempt at 157.58 for **10x Genomics** ([TXG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXG)) faded badly.


Security software stocks were among the day's top performers, beneficiaries of news of a sophisticated cyberattack on the U.S. government earlier in the week.


Leading stocks like **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) have scored big gains, but both are too extended to consider buying. **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) has also been a top performer in the group. CrowdStrike and Zscaler were added to [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) on Dec. 3 when both stocks gapped out of [cup bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


Solar stocks also did well Friday, with the solar group up 1.7%. **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) triggered the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/) after a breakout over a 48.83 buy point.


Semiconductor stocks also continue to show strength and support, including Leaderboard stock **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), which just completed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/).

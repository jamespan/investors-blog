Stocks kept to a narrow but positive trading range Friday and closed high in the day's range.

  

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq added 0.5% and 0.4% respectively. The IBD 50 tacked on 0.4%.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges. Friday was a quadruple witching day of options and futures expirations, which tends to boost trading in stocks.

  

Bulls were hoping Friday would deliver a third strong up day in a row, but there was a nonchalant tone that settled over the market. If bulls didn't get what they wanted, they at least didn't get what they feared — an erasure of recent gains. The indexes showed no inclination Friday to give back gains.

  

Going into Friday's session, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had notched 2% gains in each of the previous two sessions.

  

Still, a new uptrend hasn't been confirmed. Individual investors should wait for a new or resumed uptrend.

  

Overall, the market has been showing some positive signs, though not enough to shake the correction. The signs:

  

• New highs totals are bullish again. For a time, new lows dominated the list. On some days this month, there were more new lows in the energy sector alone than there were new highs in the Nasdaq and NYSE combined.

  

On Thursday and Friday, that ended. New highs dwarfed new lows as the retail and real estate sectors garnered the most new highs Thursday and banks and real estate grabbed the top two slots Friday.

  

Real estate plays **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)) and **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)) posted 52-week highs in vigorous volume.

  

• Sector Leaders, IBD's most demanding screen, is turning up more candidates. At the start of the month, only eight stocks met the criteria. In Friday's IBD, 14 stocks appeared.

  

**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) are two near buy points. Linked-In broke out intraday Friday but settled under the entry. Facebook is in a shallow base and close to a new high.

  

• Chart action: For three of every five stocks in the IBD 50, the next base formed would be first or second stage. Those are lower-risk patterns than later-stage bases.

  

Many other top stocks are finding support at the 10-week line, including **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) and **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)).

  

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 3.4%; the IBD 50, 2.5%; and the Nasdaq, 2.4%.

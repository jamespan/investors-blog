Indexes Mark Follow-Through, Confirming Uptrend
================================================

Stocks soared Tuesday, signaling that the market correction has ended.


The Nasdaq surged 2.4% and the S&P 500 2%, their best gains so far this year.


Coupled with a solid increase in volume, the two major indexes made a follow-through signal, which changed the market outlook from bearish to bullish.


The magnitude of Tuesday's move was compelling, if not surprising. Gains were far stronger than in the previous four follow-throughs, which occurred on Aug. 13, May 27 and Feb. 11 this year and Oct. 16 last year. Indexes on those days rose 1% to 1.4% and led to decent gains each time.


So the year's worst correction has, for the time being, ended with a flurry of buying.


Including Tuesday's rally, the Nasdaq has vaulted more than 7% from its Oct. 15 low, while the S&P 500 has rebounded 6.6%.


Both climbed back above their 200-day moving averages, though they remain below 50-day lines that are curving slightly downward.


Still, the follow-through is the best signal that a market uptrend is underway. All other signals are secondary, even though they serve a purpose by helping investors gauge the market.


Growth stocks thrive when the indexes are in confirmed uptrends, and evidence of it is already surfacing. The IBD 50 jumped 3.1%, adding to 1%-plus gains the prior three days.


**Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)), **AmTrust Financial Services** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)) and **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY))broke out of bases. At least three real estate investment trusts — a leading sector lately — also broke out.


The small-cap Russell 2000 — a proxy for the more vibrant sectors of the market — rose 1.6%.


Transportation stocks stood out, as they have during much of the market's weeklong rally. The Dow transports catapulted 3.1%.


And it's no coincidence that the price of oil has been trading at more than two-year lows. For airlines, there was additional cheer thanks to reports of fare increases throughout the industry.


Chips also led, as the Philadelphia semiconductor index roared 3.6%. Some cyclical stocks got in the act, too, with chemical, steel and machinery stocks ending among the day's best.


Although clouds have lifted and the market outlook is sunnier now, that doesn't mean it's time to buy stocks with abandon. The risks of earnings season haven't gone away, as **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) has shown.


Start by buying the best few stocks on your watch list as they rise past proper buy points. They should be institutional-quality companies with outstanding growth. A look through the latest IBD 50, Sector Leaders and other screens should give you several fresh possibilities.


If the market continues rising and more leading stocks break out, use the opportunity to increase exposure.


Why have stocks rebounded so sharply? The reasons are less important than the fact that the charts have turned bullish.


But some of the good news includes **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) solid results late Monday. And there have been no new cases of Ebola in the U.S. since last week.


St. Louis Fed President James Bullard stoked Wall Street last week when he suggested extending bond purchases beyond their scheduled completion.

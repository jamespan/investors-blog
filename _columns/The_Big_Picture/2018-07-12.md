The Nasdaq on Thursday pegged a new high for the first time in three weeks, as bulls took back control of the stock market.




The Nasdaq sprinted ahead 1.4%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each advanced 0.9%.


Due to the strength of the Nasdaq composite's advance Thursday, the June 27 distribution gets removed. So the distribution count falls to five from six. (*Editor's Note: The Market Pulse showed an incorrect distribution count for the Nasdaq in an earlier version; the current table shows the correct number*.) The S&P 500's distribution count stays at a mild three.


The small cap S&P 600 inched up 0.2%.

The day's action was a reassuring follow-up after Wednesday's sharp losses.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), an exchange-traded fund that reflects the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), jumped 2%.


Industry groups either matching or exceeding that percentage gain included many software and semiconductor groups.


Bulls had to wonder if something greater than a one-day bounce was in store for the stock market, thanks to a news item.


How The Trade War Might End
---------------------------


News included a hint of how President Trump's trade war might be settled.


Â 


Trump's tariffs on China and other countries and his recent arguments with NATO allies have weighed on the stock market.


But on Thursday, Trump dropped the belligerence and declared victory in the NATO dispute over military spending. Trump said NATO was now "much stronger than it was two days ago."


He said NATO nations are paying more and are "happy to do it." Trump said, "Everybody in the room thanked me."


Some European leaders disagreed with Trump's take on reality, but in a way, that's off the point.


Important Clue
--------------


The important clue here is how a similar Trump maneuver might settle the trade war. If Trump becomes convinced he has won concessions, then the trade war could be wound down with no further damage for the stock market.


Such a development might leave the market free to focus on Q2 earnings and a strong U.S. economy.


Thursday's action didn't include many quality stocks moving in volume. But three of the four [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) rose.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) popped 2.2%, though in mildly below-average turnover. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) stabbed 2.4% higher in volume 25% above average. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), featured in the latest [IBD Stock Of The Day column](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), added 2.5% in volume 27% above average.

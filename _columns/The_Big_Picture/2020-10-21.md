  Stocks Fall Amid Washington Gridlock As Bitcoin Makes A Comeback

Stocks fell on Wednesday, with small caps suffering the brunt of the selling as jitters over the election and dithering over coronavirus aid clearly heightened.




The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF slid 0.8% while Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) topped that with a 1.1% decline.


Meanwhile, Bitcoin bulls stole the show.


The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ([GBTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBTC)) enjoyed a third straight gain, and on Wednesday it surged 7.4% to 14.29. That marked its highest close since Aug. 18. Volume tripled in the so-called open-ended grantor trust, which is designed to track the price of the all-digital alternative currency, to 16 million shares — the highest since July 28.


Stocks Today: This Financial Innovator Is OutperformingMP102120_2

[On IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) Wednesday, the topic of Bitcoin seeped into the show right from the start as **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) staged a breakout. The financial transactions giant will now handle transactions in this major cryptocurrency.


[The Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) got a position boost on Wednesday as it surpassed a new 209.12 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [narrow cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The 5% buy zone goes up to 219.58.


[MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) gave PayPal the [blue dot treatment](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/). Why? The megacap fintech firm's relative strength line rifled its way into new high ground.


The IBD 50 ETF still has a nifty gain for the quarter, up 3.1% since Oct. 1. Yet the exchange traded fund is now facing a key test of an important technical level, [the 21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


As IBD has reported in its [latest TIPP poll on the U.S. presidential election](https://www.investors.com/news/biden-vs-trump-poll-donald-trump-new-high-in-tight-race-ibd-tipp-presidential-poll/), the lead that Joe Biden has enjoyed over incumbent Donald Trump has thinned considerably. And while many Americans have cast their ballots via mail or drop-off boxes, Thursday's final debate will still likely gain the attention of Wall Street and Main Street. All that adds uncertainty.


As the S&P 500 dropped 0.2% and the Nasdaq fell a bit more, off 0.3%, it was really more the manner in which these key benchmarks fell that likely disappointed market bulls.



Volume edged just 1% lower on the Nasdaq. Turnover rose on the NYSE, which gave the S&P 500 a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) and the third such instance of pronounced institutional selling.


The other two distribution days came on Oct. 13 (a 0.7% drop by the 500) and Oct. 16, a rare [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/).


Keep in mind that bull markets do not die of stalling days.


The Stock Market's Mood Today
-----------------------------


As the Big Picture column observed in recent days, every trading session since Friday featured early gains that dissolved into something far less satisfying or into a loss for the day.


That's not how a [confirmed market uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) should act.



Monday's session marked the most dramatic example. Take the S&P 500. An early gain of 0.5% turned into a 1.6% bludgeoning.


Clearly, Tuesday and Wednesday's sessions reflected antsy feelings about the stalled efforts in Washington to pass another rescue package for a Covid-19-smashed economy, which sent U.S. GDP spiraling down at a 31% annualized rate in the second quarter.


Institutions sold U.S. Treasuries again, but not as heavily as on Tuesday.


The benchmark 10-year note's yield rose another 2 basis points to 0.83%, the highest level since June 9. (You can track daily yields for all bonds across the yield curve at the [U.S. Treasury website](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2020).)


Inside IBD 50, Other Key Lists Of Top Stocks Today
--------------------------------------------------


Cannabis facilities provider **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)), which ranked [No. 38 in the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) headed into Wednesday's trading, fell for a sixth straight session. But the stock is trying to make a stand at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).



**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which has been a stalwart on IBD Sector Leaders for months, tanked 6.9% in heavy volume. After the market close, the Los Gatos, Calif., firm departed the [most stringent computer-driven list for top stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders).


While its latest breakout turned out to be a shambles, long-term holders with big paper gains could watch and wait. The prospects of more base-building still look quite high.


Notice, too, how the longtime Nasdaq standout has traversed the north side of its 40-week moving average for months. On a daily chart, Netflix's 200-day moving average has been rising since early April.


**GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)) illustrated the cardinal rule of waiting for a stock to break out before buying — even after the deep cup with handle looks fully formed. Shares cratered 31% for their biggest single-day drop since a sterling breakout at 46.50 on June 15. Volume ballooned to 19 million shares, the highest in months.

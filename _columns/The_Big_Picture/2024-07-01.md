  Nasdaq, S&P 500 Rebound, But These Stock Market Indexes Struggle. Will This Commodity Break Out?

The stock market ended mixed Monday as a new quarter began. Investors continued to tilt funds toward large-cap technology, a huge driver of the confirmed uptrend. But weakness in a few sectors weighed on broader indexes.




Overall, the session's moves by broader indexes were mild. Day-to-day fluctuations might get limited by the fact that the stock market is set to close Thursday for the July Fourth holiday. Yet don't ignore key economic data coming later this week, including the [June nonfarm payrolls report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


The Nasdaq composite, which led other equity indexes during the first six months of 2024, delivered a new closing high of 17,879. Its gain of 0.8% on Monday recouped all of Friday's 0.7% loss. Powered in large part by strength in semiconductor, software and internet-related names, the Nasdaq remained close to an all-time peak of 18,035. A nearly 19% gain so far in 2024 following a 43% rebound last year? Quite impressive.


All the [Magnificent Seven megacap techs](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) saw buying demand increase on Monday, and four of the companies rallied 2% or more. Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — which is investing heavily in dynamic growth areas like cloud computing, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology — has gotten very close to achieving a 20% profit from a breakout point at 153.78. The stock is aiming for a fifth straight weekly gain. Its [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) is a perfect 99 on a scale of 1 to 99.


Yet a look at other popular stock market indexes continued to remind Investor's Business Daily readers that the overall advance is still uneven.

Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP_2x2_070124.jpg)The S&P 500 rose less than 0.3%. The large-cap index has stoutly held recent gains. After a bullish reversal back above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) that took place on May 31, the S&P 500 has rallied nearly 5%. Over a four-week period, it has fallen in seven separate sessions. The largest drop among those down days? Just 0.4%.


Such action in this key stock market benchmark reflects an unwillingness among large investors to forcefully sell shares.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1%. Volume fell on both exchanges due to a whirlwind of trading that took place late Friday ahead of a rebalance of the Russell equity indexes.


However, this positive action by both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 masks the fact that on Monday, no fewer than 24 of IBD's [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) actually slid 2% or more for the day.


Cyclicals, Leisure Stocks Slide
-------------------------------


The groups included cyclical industries such as heavy construction, down 2.3% on a price-weighted basis. Others were cement and concrete, off 2.4%, and plastics, also off 2.4%.


**Primoris Services** ([PRIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRIM)), which has done very well since breaking out of a saucer-style base with a 34.24 handle buy point in February, delivered a defensive sell signal Friday by sinking below the 50-day moving average in big volume. On Monday, shares fell an additional 4.6% to 47.60, underscoring a change in character.


Some retail industry groups also bled red ink. IBD's retail auto parts group was the third worst performer in the stock market, falling 4.2%. Department-store chains sank 2.6%. Plus, a slew of leisure-oriented industries started the third quarter of 2024 on the back foot.


Gaming and equipment stocks backtracked 2.5%. So did IBD's Leisure-Products industry group. And the travel booking industry group slipped 2.1%.



Keeping the weakness of these stock market areas in mind, it may then come as no surprise that the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund fell 0.8%. RSP marked its lowest close since May 29.

Keep Watching Stock Market Breadth
----------------------------------


Despite the Nasdaq and S&P 500's positive action, breadth in the stock market has not kept up with these indexes' solid uptrends since mid-May.


The New York Stock Exchange's advance-decline line peaked in the second week of May and has virtually gone sideways since then. On Monday, losers beat winners on the NYSE by a more than 2-1 margin, early data showed. On the Nasdaq, falling stocks exceeded risers by more than 1,000. Keep track of the NYSE and Nasdaq's advance-decline line via the General Market Indicators PDF page, found at the bottom of each day's Big Picture.


On the positive side, banks generally had a good day in the stock market, despite a jump in long-term interest rates. The yield on the key 10-year U.S. government bond rose 13 basis points to 4.47%. However, the results of last week's stress tests on the nation's largest banks seemed to fuel optimism.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), which late Friday announced plans to boost its dividend by 9% and buy back up to $30 billion in stock, rallied 1.6% to 205.45. That's just below the 205.88 entry point of a [new flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) built over the past six weeks. The money-center bank is slated to post second-quarter results on July 12.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), subject of a [new bull put spread options play](https://www.investors.com/research/options/gs-stock-today-bull-put-spread-goldman-sachs-22-percent-return/) Monday with a potential to return 22% by mid-July, rose 2.5% to 463.66.


Is This Commodity Heating Up Again?
-----------------------------------


Keep an eye on the energy sector, as well.


Crude oil futures jumped nearly 2.3%. At $83.38 a barrel, West Texas intermediate crude posted its highest close since April 26. Further gains could send oil above a trendline drawn from a Sept. 28, 2023, peak at $95.03. On Monday, the best stock market performer among IBD's 197 industries was coal, up more than 8%.


And in the oil-and-gas transport and pipeline group, **Kinetik** ([KNTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNTK)) outperformed in the stock market with a 0.6% gain to 41.67. It's etched a shallow flat base with a 41.77 entry. The Houston-based specialist in natural gas gathering and processing boasts a 7.2% annualized dividend yield, according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF).

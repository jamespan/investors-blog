The stock market correction continued to bare its teeth Thursday, as the major stock indexes sold off sharply on coronavirus fears. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to an all-time low, falling below 0.9% before recovering. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dropped 3.1%, closing off the day's lows.




Meanwhile, the S&P 500 stumbled 3.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average descended 3.6%, or 969 points. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 3.4%. Leading growth stocks were also hit hard; the IBD 50 fell 2.3%. Volume on both main exchanges was higher than Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Correction Continues
---------------------------------


Last week, IBD [downgraded the stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) from an uptrend under pressure to a market in correction. On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite found much-needed support at its long-term 200-day line. But this week's rally has been anything but graceful. On Monday, the Nasdaq rose nearly 4%, but fell nearly 2% Tuesday. On Wednesday, it again surged 4.5% before Thursday's big losses.

Thursday's sell-off took back a large portion of the Super Tuesday news-driven advance.


Wednesday was [nearly a follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-erases-prior-day-losses-cheers-biden-wins/), but volume came in well below Tuesday's totals. So the market correction continues.


Investors should be on the sidelines and in cash. But don't tune out. Instead, focus on updating your watchlists of potential stock market leaders. A [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), indicating that a potential new uptrend has begun, could happen any day regardless of the amount of negativity surrounding the market.


Top Stocks To Watch: Alibaba, PayPal, StoneCo, Vipshop
------------------------------------------------------


Unexpectedly, Chinese companies are among the top stocks to watch, considering the coronavirus outbreak originated in China. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) are among the top Chinese stocks. You never know exactly which companies are going to be potential leaders during the next uptrend, so tracking relative strength during market weakness can add unforeseen names to your watchlist.


Meanwhile, fintech stocks **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) are also outperforming during the market volatility.


E-commerce giant Alibaba is tracing a double bottom with a 226.80 buy point, but is still stuck under its 50-day line. The RS line made a new high last week.


[IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/vipshop-stock-breaks-out-buy-range/) Vipshop surged past a 15.07 buy point in a double bottom after reporting strong Q4 results. The [5% buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) extends to 15.82. Meanwhile, the stock's RS line spiked to new highs. The Chinese online retailer saw its earnings and sales grow 116% and 11%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period.


Shares of payment leader [PayPal](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/) are trying to get back above the 50-day moving average after triggering the [7%-8% loss-cutting rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) from a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) 119.70 buy point.


Lastly, [IPO Leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-warren-buffett-stoneco-stock-stock-market-correction/) StoneCo is fighting to hold its 50-day moving average line. The Brazilian payment stock hit a new high this week after the company's earnings results. But shares are now testing their 50-day support level. The stock's [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) also reached a new high, indicating sharp outperformance vs. the broad market.

All new buys are considered very risky during stock market corrections, but these leaders are still showing strength in a volatile market environment.

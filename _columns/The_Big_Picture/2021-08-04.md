Stocks Today End Mixed As Nasdaq Outperforms; Avoid These 3 Rookie Investor Mistakes
=====================================================================================

[Stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) repeated a common refrain that came into being in June.




Fresh economic data showed the recovery, at least in the U.S., may be souring. Persistent, growing worries about how the most contagious strains of Covid-19 will affect consumer spending and other major parts of the economy are weighing more heavily on cyclical and smaller stocks. And yet a blatant run by institutional investors for the exits has not happened yet.


Quantitatively, the divergence between the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq composite stood out on Wednesday. While the former suffered a 1.2% blow, the latter edged up 0.1%. The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial firms on the all-electronic exchange, also budged 0.1% higher. On average, the five FAANG companies rose 0.5% on the day.


**Stocks Today: Megacap Tech Leaders Firm**
-------------------------------------------



**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), a [Leaderboard half-size position](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and member of the [25-stock Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), ticked just 0.2% lower.


Mr. Softy is crafting a [tiny shelf pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-shelf-pattern-and-why-it-is-perfect-pyramiding-tool-in-growth-stocks/).


One could have expected a widespread sell-off on Wednesday. Why? The [monthly ADP private sector jobs report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) soundly disappointed. Perhaps the Street wants to see more confirmation through Friday's nonfarm payrolls report that growth in the greater economy has in fact taken a turn for the worse.


The S&P 500's drop of nearly 0.5% came in higher volume on the NYSE. So, the [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) rose to seven.


In the meantime, bullishness among Wall Street pundits inched up over the past week, yet has moderated from a near-term peak in mid-July. Good for investors going long. You don't want everyone rooting for stocks to go up. This usually means everyone's already invested.


[The latest survey by Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) shows bullishness among newsletter editors increased to 54.1% vs. 52.6% the prior week. A ratio exceeding 60% typically points to investor over-exuberance. Bearishness has ranged from 15% to 17% since April. See the graph of [bulls vs. bears](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) at the [Psychological Market Indicators section](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) at Investors.com.


Midcaps fell even more; SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) lost 1%. Yet Wednesday's action in the S&P 500 seems less unpleasant when you consider three factors.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP_7x4_080421-193x300.jpg)One, the S&P 500's daily chart marks Wednesday's decline as an [inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/) following Tuesday's positive reversal. Two, the large-cap benchmark has shown enough muscle to stay above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Since June 21, the S&P 500 has closed beneath this short-term technical level just once. And three, the index has made merry advances all year despite poking slightly beneath its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) no fewer than six times since January.


Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Los Angeles-based investment giant Cetera, which has $300 billion in assets under advisement among its 8,000 financial advisors, told IBD that retail investors have had a say in this year's rally. He thinks that buying on the dips by this investor class has helped the S&P 500 avoid a pullback in the 5% range or greater lately.


It's been nearly 10 months since the S&P 500 had a decline larger than 6%. The index corrected 8.9% over a three-week time span, from 3549 to 3233, in October.


Wall Street's View On The Second Half, China
--------------------------------------------


Earnings growth in Q2 has been "going gangbusters," Goldman notes. He thinks decent profit growth within the S&P 500 should continue for at least a few more quarters. But he's also focused on a slowing economy in China, the renewed threat of Covid-19 on business, weak breadth within the stock market, and the possibility that inflation is more permanent than what the Federal Reserve believes.


"We're cautiously optimistic," Goldman said, referring to the stock market in the next six to nine months. "I'm bullish on profit margins. Revenue growth will continue. Companies can raise prices easily, and that's good for margins."


He thinks technology-driven improvements in productivity also favor earnings growth.


Goldman's research team has taken a "barbell approach" regarding sector allocation in equities, emphasizing financial services and energy companies on one end and technology (specifically cloud computing and semiconductors) on the other end.


Watch The Breadth
-----------------


StockCharts.com notes that as of Wednesday, 41% of all stocks on the NYSE currently trade above their own 50-day moving averages. That's down from this year's peak of 87% in January. Meanwhile, take a look at the Nasdaq's advance-decline line in IBD's [General Market Indicators page](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DailyGMI080421.pdf). It's desperately trying to snap a clear downtrend since late June. (You can see the GMI page every day via the link at the bottom of this column.)


Goldman, however, thinks that growth stocks may outperform in 2022 vs. value. One reason: The banks have seen their earnings get a big boost from the lowering of loan loss reserves. He's also concerned about persistently low interest rate pinching the profit margin that banks make on each loan.

Meanwhile, Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab wrote in a note to clients that the China stock market is in bear territory, hurting investors in broad-based emerging-market indexes such as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ([EEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEM)). This popular exchange traded fund is up a trifling 1.5% year to date. The IBD Mutual Fund Index, meanwhile, headed into Wednesday's trading up 12%.


Yet Kleintop reminds investors that with sharp corrections in China come brilliant opportunities.


"This year's peak-to-trough drawdown of -27% is in line with the -28% average annual drawdown over the past 20 years since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001," he wrote. "Historically, investors have tended to be compensated for this heightened volatility with double-digit annualized total returns over the past 20 years."


Avoid These 3 Rookie Mistakes
-----------------------------



[**Moderna**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-buy-now/) ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) and **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) have already proved that the concept of focusing on new companies with new products, technologies and services — essentially the N in [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) — is still worth its weight in gold.


But to profit from these highfliers, avoid the mistake of chasing these biotechs and other big leaders in stocks today [well past a proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/).


Two more mistakes to sidestep? Not having a rational exit strategy. For instance, the half-size position in BioNTech, whose mRNA technology led to a fruitful vaccine partnership with [**Pfizer**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/) ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)), [got trimmed to a quarter size on Wednesday in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). Trimming a position on the way after a big move is one of the best ways to lock in gains, raise some cash and have the opportunity to invest in another future winner — all while staying invested in a hot leader.


Also avoid investing in a laggard stock. It's easy to think that money will eventually flow into it. But laggards tend to stay laggards a long time.


**Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) was a true [CAN SLIM model stock](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) in the 1990s as it transformed care for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Its growth profile has changed a lot since then. The Nasdaq stock sank 6% in heavy volume Wednesday following a 4% gain in earnings to $4.38 a share on a 5% pickup in sales.


Amgen's average top-line gain over the past eight quarters? Just 4.1%.

The major indexes pulled off a fine reversal to finish with modest gains on Friday. But the advance wasn't enough to erase the stock market's weekly decline.


The Nasdaq composite turned an early-morning loss of 0.7% into a 0.4% gain; the tech-weighted index also closed right at session highs. The Nasdaq 100 slightly outperformed, up 0.5%.


The S&P 500 rose 0.3% on Friday, erasing an early 0.5% sell-off. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.9%.


Technically, Friday's session was pivotal. Early on, it looked as though the S&P 500 would join the Nasdaq in slumping below the psychologically important 50-day moving average. After the market's follow-through on Feb. 17, which signified a new uptrend in place and a good environment to buy stocks, the two indexes had quickly ascended over this intermediate-term trend line and stayed above it for months.


Yet today, the Market Pulse table shows the current outlook remaining at "Uptrend under pressure" for a 12th consecutive session. The market's fast rebound off the February lows has stimulated plenty of eager selling by the institutional crowd. With nine distribution days still on the books for the Nasdaq and six for the S&P 500, these two facts alone should be enough to convince the regular reader of this column to be extra-cautious about making any new buys and to keep a healthy wad of cash in the portfolio.

That is not the case today.


Numerous utility stocks are boasting double-digit gains since Jan. 1. Gold is outperforming amid fear that central banks across the world are struggling to ignite growth. The SPDR Gold ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) ETF, which joined IBD Leaderboard on March 4, fell 0.4% for the week but is up 21.4% year-to-date. The Nasdaq, which at one point on Friday fell 10.5% below its 52-week high of 5231, is down 5.4% since Jan. 1. It dropped 0.8% for the week, adding to declines of nearly 0.7% and 2.7% in the prior two weeks.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line sloped lower for a second straight week. On Wednesday, the number of stocks making new highs on the Nasdaq and passing IBD's screen fell below new lows, a rare occurrence since March. That implies fewer stocks have the power to break out.


Early Friday, investors focused on a mixed U.S. jobs report. Payrolls increased by 160,000 in April, missing the Econoday forecast of 200,000 and falling well below the monthly average of 200,000 net new jobs during the first quarter. The workforce participation rate fell, which is bad for the economy. Yet average hourly wages boosted by 0.3%, which implies more purchasing power for consumers.


Wire reports noted that William Dudley, chief of the New York Federal Reserve bank, commented that the jobs data would not likely alter the central bank's view toward a pair of hikes in short-term interest rates sometime this year. The CME Group FedWatch site currently shows bond traders having a mixed view on the possibility of even just one 25-basis-point jump in the fed funds rate to 0.75% by December. Ultralow interest rates will likely stay for a long while.


Today's [Sector Leaders column](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) focuses on suppliers of various building materials. The wood products industry group, ranked among the top 20 in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance, led the upside with a gain of more than 5%. Metal ores, auto maker, biotech, international oil and gas explorer and solar stocks fell heavily for the week.

U.S. stocks rose Wednesday, although leading stocks took a rest. The results marked a break — at least for now — in the market leadership.




Indexes sought direction for much of the day, and buyers had to hold off some late selling.


The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.4%, with much of its strength in the upper crust: The Nasdaq 100 outperformed with a 0.7% increase. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased a fraction. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was indicated lower on the NYSE.


But the IBD 50 lagged, down 0.6% as some consumer and technology stocks in the index languished. Through Tuesday, the index was beating the major averages with a 2.5% increase since Jan. 1. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which has different weightings for the IBD 50 stocks, has been doing even better, up 7.1% since Jan. 1.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP011321-192x300.jpg)Small caps also underperformed Wednesday. The Russell 2000 fell nearly 0.8%. Small caps have been leading U.S. stocks. The Russell index is up nearly 7% for the year, vs. 1.4% for the S&P 500 and 1.9% for the Nasdaq.


Sector Rotation In U.S. Stocks
------------------------------


Some sector rotation was evident in U.S. stocks Wednesday. Cyclicals such as industrials, materials, transportation and energy were the worst performing. Those sectors had made some of the best gains since the start of the year.


Meantime, utilities and real estate — a couple of defensive sectors that had been underperforming — led Wednesday's market.


The leadership in U.S. stocks appears to be in flux, as investors weigh risks from the coronavirus and political turmoil. Despite that, the stock market maintains a positive posture. Many technical market indicators are positive, and [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is moderate.


This week's pause in the main indexes seems welcomed after a strong start to the new year. [Investor sentiment](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) remains too high for comfort, however.


Most leading stocks are above buy points. But a few hot leaders started to cool off rapidly. **Corsair Gaming** ([CRSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSR)) and **Upstart Holdings** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)), which are in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), made bearish moves. Corsair erased nearly all of a 6% early gain; Upstart reversed lower.


Unusual Chart Patterns Surface
------------------------------


The [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) and [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) are the most common patterns in today's market. But a couple of other patterns have been appearing more often. They are harder to spot.


One of them is the [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), a formation that works well to add shares to successful holdings. **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)), **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)), **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)) are all above those entries.


Also appearing more often is the seldom-seen [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/). In this pattern, stocks make three pullbacks of no more than 20% each, and at higher prices than the previous pullback.


**Rent-A-Center** ([RCII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCII)), **PerkinElmer** ([PKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKI)), **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and **Diodes** ([DIOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIOD)) have all cleared buy points for ascending bases. Still, they represent less than 1% of the more than 300 stocks that have broken out in the past several weeks.



U.S. stocks shrugged off the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. Late Wednesday, the House of Representatives cleared the measure and sent it to the Senate, where impeachment faces an uncertain outcome.


Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, says it's been surprising to see the market climb after last week's siege of Congress and the second Trump impeachment.


"Normally, we would expect risk assets to pull back during an event like this, but the market seems more focused on the next administration at this point," Price said in a research note.


A week away from Joe Biden being sworn into office, the market is more interested in the economic plan and what might come in terms of coronavirus relief measures, he said.

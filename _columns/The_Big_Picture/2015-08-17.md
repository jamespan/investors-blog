Stocks put in an upside reversal Monday. But the market still appears to be sticking to the same script of range-bound trading. Helped by strength in biotechs, software and Internet stocks, the Nasdaq rallied 0.9%. It bounced back after having been down as much as 0.5% intraday.

  

The S&P 500 rebounded from a 0.6% deficit to finish up 0.5%.

  

Both of the major indexes ended back above their 50-day moving average lines. The benchmark S&P 500 also returned back above the 2100 level, which it has had trouble staying above this month.

  

Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 1%. The popular index has been more volatile than the Nasdaq or S&P 500, but it has defended the 1200 level on a closing basis.

  

Leaders also had a nice day, as the IBD 50 climbed 1.1%, according to preliminary data.

  

Weak New York-area factory data put stocks on the defensive at Monday's start. The New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing index unexpectedly slumped to its lowest reading in six years. But the market liked news that homebuilder sentiment hit its highest since November 2005.

  

It's nice to see the market get some follow-on action after a huge upside reversal Wednesday. But the market is still stuck in a narrow range overall. Distribution is also still high on the S&P 500. Leading stocks are clearing bases, yet this market isn't giving breakouts much of a tailwind.

  

Volume rose from Friday's depressed levels. Nasdaq trade ended a bit higher after one of its slowest sessions of the year Friday. Overall, Monday's turnover didn't reflect a lot of conviction despite the solid upside reversal. The soft trade is a continuation of summer doldrums. Volume may pick up in September.

  

Winners beat decliners by more than 3-to-2 on both exchanges.

  

The Building-Residential/Commercial industry group nailed a 2.1% gain on top of last week's near 4% rise. The homebuilder group has been acting well despite prospects of higher interest rates ahead.

  

**Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) and thinly traded **M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) cleared buy points at 39.69 and 25.71, respectively. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) hit a nine-year high. Small cap **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), a new Sector Leader, reversed to a small loss. But it's still up almost 30% from a breakout past a 20.20 buy point in a flat base cleared Aug. 5.

  

Data on July housing starts will be out Tuesday. Minutes from the Fed's July meeting will be released Wednesday.

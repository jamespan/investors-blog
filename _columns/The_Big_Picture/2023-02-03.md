Stock market bears pounced late to end a strong week on a sour note. With continued labor market strength, traders mulled fears the Federal Reserve may keep hiking rates.


Earlier, it looked like the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite would hold up, but a midday bounce faded and it closed down 1.6%. Poor earnings reports from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) weighed.




Nevertheless, the Nasdaq booked a 3.3% gain for the week and the 5th week of higher prices, and closed within its upper range. [A power trend remains in force](https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-enters-rare-power-trend-here-are-3-ways-to-profit/?src=A00220), with the 21-day exponential moving average well above the 50-line.


The S&P 500 also ended near lows, skidding 1%, but still managed to rise 1.6% for the week. The benchmark index remains clear of its major moving averages, closing well within its upper range this week.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed in Friday's stock market but still lost 0.2% for the week. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) impressed despite an earnings miss, while **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) was the top performer.


Small caps also fell, dropping Russell 2000 0.7%. It still gained nearly 4% for the week. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fared worse, falling 1.3% but held above its 10-week moving average in a positive sign.


Jobs Report Raises Fed Fears But Market Strength Remains
--------------------------------------------------------


Indexes surged following the latest Fed meeting, with bulls latching on to some dovish speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

But indexes fell back Friday on news the economy created 517,000 jobs in January, well ahead of the 185,000 consensus. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%. Economists expected a slight increase to 3.6%. The Fed wants to see a softening jobs market to help bring inflation down.


"The disinflation process may have begun, but a strong labor market may prove troubling for bets for inflation to continue to drop quickly," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in note to clients. "Investors expecting that the Fed will cut rates at the end of the year might be in for a rude awakening."


Nevertheless, it is important to note overall action for the week was still strong. Investors should remain 60% to 80% exposed for now, given the resiliency of the latest stock market uptrend. As ever, it is key to let the stock market action be your guide.


Friday Stock Market: Defensive Plays Shine Brightest
----------------------------------------------------


All S&P 500 stock market indexes ended lower. Consumer discretionary, communication services and real estate were the weakest. The more defensive-oriented health sectors fared best.


Once again, the performance of the IBD industry groups gave investors deeper insight into the day's action.


Oil & gas REITs, soap stocks, paper products and department stores were among the best areas.


Mail order, fiber optics, financial and gaming software stocks, telecom infrastructure and database software were the weakest.

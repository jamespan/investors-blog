Big Picture: Stock Market Outlook Improves As Nasdaq Leads Sharp Gains
=======================================================================

With the Nasdaq composite spearheading a rally Tuesday, the stock market behaved well enough to cause a favorable shift in outlook.




The Nasdaq surged 1.4% while the S&P 500 added 1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and early tabulations showed lower NYSE volume. Both indexes closed back above the 50-day moving average, a sign that the institutional selling that had plagued the market has run its course.


The improvement in the index charts caused a change in IBD's market outlook, which now says the market uptrend has resumed. That's a better environment for investing in stocks than when the uptrend was under pressure, as it was the previous week and a half.


That uncertain outlook called for reducing some exposure to the market and to make only limited stock purchases. Despite that, there were signs the market's downside might be limited.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP_082217-184x300.png)The CBOE Market Volatility Index, or VIX for short, and the put-call volume ratio spiked to unusually high levels of investor fear last week. Those are contrarian signals that indicated a market low was in the offing.


Indeed, on Tuesday the indexes showed new vigor. Wall Street seemed encouraged by reports that the White House and Republican congressional leaders were making progress on a tax reform package. Those hopes filtered onto the market's charts. Strong gains backed by higher volume are the hallmark of institutional investors buying shares en masse.


Winning stocks led losers by 5-to-2 on the NYSE and by 12-to-5 on the Nasdaq. That certainly helps a Nasdaq advance-decline line that has been slumping.


While the market signals are better now, it's always smart to make careful, deliberate judgment in buying stocks. The market has trended upward for months, but it has been vulnerable to abrupt sell-offs.


And while the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average suffered only minor pullbacks, the small-cap Russell 2000 and S&P 600 were off about 7% from their highs. Those indexes lost more ground to recover.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 still need to detoxify themselves of the high number of [distribution days](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). The Nasdaq still has nine days of higher volume declines, and they occurred in worrisome spurts. If that number falls to, say, less than five on each index, it will be a positive.


Since late July both indexes have been in a trend of lower lows and lower highs. If they can rise above last week's highs, take that as another positive sign.


More important is the performance of leading stocks that break out. Since the July market highs, the majority of breakouts have sputtered or made minor progress. Breakouts that preceded the July peak have done much better.


Even though Tuesday's market was bullish, it wasn't matched by the day's few breakouts.


**New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) rose past a new buy point at 84.01 in big volume, but the Chinese education services provider closed below the entry.


**Charles River Labs** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) broke out of a flat base, with shares rising past the 102.42 buy point. But volume was 27% above average, a bit lackluster for such a pivotal moment on the chart. The relative strength line made a new high, which supports the breakout.



**Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) rose past a 15.37 buy point but closed below the entry. Volume was strong, so the mining stock may get another chance.


**VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) did better, gapping up past a 98.10 buy point in strong volume. The cloud computing company edged past the buy point Aug. 14 but stalled. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy from hold and raised the target price to 120 from 110.


Still, it was a strong day for leading stocks, with 20 of the IBD 50 stocks rising more than 2%. The IBD 50 stocks had been holding up well even while the market came under selling. The IBD 50 index leapt 1.5% Tuesday.

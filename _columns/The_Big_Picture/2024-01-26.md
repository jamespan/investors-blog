The stock market ended trading mixed on Friday, but booked more weekly gains amid benign inflation data. Now the latest Fed decision on interest rates and a deluge of Big Tech earnings loom.




The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.4% Friday but still managed to turn in a weekly gain of 0.9%. After rising 12 out of the past 13 weeks, the tech-heavy index sits more than 5% above its 50-day line and is clear of its short-term moving averages. Nasdaq stocks are up about 3% for January.


The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% but remains near all-time highs after turning in a creditable 1% lift for the week. Like the Nasdaq, this was the S&P's 12th weekly rise out of the past 13, and it too now sits beyond all its moving averages. The fact the benchmark index is up 2.6% so far this month augers well for the rest of 2024.


On Friday, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq snapped six-day win streaks. Nevertheless, advancers slightly outnumbered decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed the other major indexes on the stock market as it inched up 0.2%. Payments stock **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) led the upside after popping 7.1% on a sunny outlook. But **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) lagged, diving 11.9% on a disappointing outlook.

Small caps managed to squeeze out a gain, with the Russell 2000 closing the session up 0.1%. Growth stocks also ended in the green, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rose 0.1%.


Fed Decision, Big Tech Earnings Tsunami In Focus
------------------------------------------------


There was more encouraging inflation data Friday, which helped to boost stocks. The headline Personal Consumption Expenditures index for December climbed 0.2% for the month and 2.6% annually. Crucially, core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% for the month and 2.9% year over year. This was below economists' consensus expectation.


It came ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, where the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to hold rates steady Wednesday. As ever, the post-meeting comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could move the stock market. At the moment, [the CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) rates the chances of a cut in March as a near-50-50 proposition.


A second part of the puzzle when it comes to rate cuts is the jobs market, which has been robust despite the Fed's rate-hiking regime. There will be a flood of jobs data in the coming week, including the ADP employment report on Wednesday and the crunch U.S. nonfarm payrolls data coming Friday.


A [monster week of Big Tech earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-super-micro-computer-magnificent-7-stocks/) adds more spice to the mix. The likes of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) are among the heavy hitters posting quarterly results in the coming week.


These Stock Market Areas Impress
--------------------------------


A slight majority of the [S&P 500 sectors closed in positive territory Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Energy, health care and consumer staples were strongest while real estate and technology lagged.

Specialty enterprise software stocks, cable plays, integrated telecom firms, clothing makers and medical research equipment companies all outperformed.


In contrast, chip equipment stocks, chipmakers, financial software plays and oil & gas machinery firms were among the worst performers.

Stocks Rise, But End Well Off Day's Highs
==========================================

Stocks survived more volatility to end with gains Monday, but biotechs sold off. The Nasdaq ended up a fraction after falling about 0.6% intraday. But the tech-laden index was up as much as 1.1% about an hour into the session.

  

Biotechs, which include some market-leading stocks, got whacked as presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took to Twitter to criticize drug prices.

Four of the day's 10 worst-performing industry groups were medical.

  

The S&P 500 seesawed to a 0.5% gain. But it too was up more than 1% at Monday's high. The Dow Jones industrial average outperformed with a 0.8% gain. Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.2%, and the IBD 50 lost 0.5%. **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)), **Valeant** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) and **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)) were the biggest decliners in the IBD 50, slumping from 4% to nearly 7%.

  

Volume dropped off sharply across the board from Friday's busy pace, which swelled due to quadruple witching. Winners beat losers by about 3-to-2 on the NYSE Monday. Decliners edged advancers by about 9-to-8 on the Nasdaq.

  

The market on Monday digested lackluster housing data and comments from Fed officials. Existing-home sales slumped 4.8% in August to 5.31 million units, the first drop in four months.

  

Meanwhile, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, not a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee, told CNBC that he disagreed with last week's decision to leave rates unchanged. And Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, who is a voting member, said that he still expects a hike this year.

  

Monday's action didn't do much for the market, which remains under pressure. Last week's back-to-back distribution days, which are signs of professional selling, were not good. Also last week, the Nasdaq turned tail from resistance at its 50-day moving average.

  

For growth-stock investors, buying is still OK. But caution is warranted. There are opportunities out there, but it's much tougher to buy leading stocks without the tailwind of a strong uptrend.

  

Several leading stocks have had mediocre results. News of a stock offering sent **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) back below a 39.27 entry. Both **Motorola Solutions** ([MSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSI)) and **Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)) wavered after clearing bases. But **Post Holdings** ([POST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POST)) is still up modestly from a 67.50 entry in a three-weeks-tight pattern.

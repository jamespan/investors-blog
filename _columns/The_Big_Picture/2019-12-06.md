  Stock Market Ends Week With Strong Gains On Jobs Report; Chipotle Nears Buy Point

The stock market closed out the week with strong gains, fueled by a better-than-expected jobs report. On Friday, the government said the U.S. economy [added 266,000 jobs](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-us-adds-266000-jobs-dow-jones/) in November, well above the 180,000 estimate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced over 330 points for the day.




The Nasdaq composite surged 1%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.9%. The Dow industrials led the major stock indexes with a 1.2%, or 337-point, advance. Oddly the IBD 50, a list of top growth stocks, lagged with a gain of only 0.4%. Weakness in real estate, mining and other stocks diminished the IBD 50's performance.


Strength in [Dow Jones stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) helped power the index higher. [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Apple reached a [fresh record high](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-surges-record-high-holiday-sales-buzz/) amid a three-day win streak. Meanwhile, Nike stock added to Thursday's breakout above an early 95.22 buy point. Shares closed just above a flat base's 96.97 buy point.


Elsewhere in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, energy and financial stocks were some of the top performers. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) rose 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. OPEC agreed to tighten supply by [cutting production by an additional 500,000 barrels](https://www.investors.com/news/opec-meeting-saudi-arabia-iraq-russia-oil-production-quotas-2020/) per day.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP120619-274x300.jpg)Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) rallied 3.4% and 2%, respectively, as Treasury yields climbed in the wake of the strong jobs report.


Volume was mixed, higher on the NYSE, but lower on the Nasdaq relative to Thursday's turnover.


The week started on a down note with two straight days of sharp losses amid weak economic data and U.S.-China trade pessimism, resulting in two new [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). But the stock market shrugged off the weakness over the course of the week, capped off with Friday's bullish gains.


But the market isn't out of the woods yet. In less than two weeks, President Donald Trump faces a crucial decision in regards to the U.S.-China trade war. Dec. 15 was the previously imposed deadline to add $156 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods.


The market's technical picture improved slightly Friday because the S&P 500's Oct. 21 distribution day fell off the overall count due to time. After 25 trading sessions, distribution days are considered too far in the past to have an impact on the current trend of the stock market.


Top Stocks To Watch: Chipotle, Progyny
--------------------------------------



Top stocks to watch in the current stock market include today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/chipotle-stock-nears-buy-point/), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), and hot IPO stock **Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)).


Chipotle stock briefly topped a short handle's buy point at 825.70 — viewed on the daily chart. But the stock trimmed its gains by the close, ending the session below that questionable entry. The proper buy point at 858 still looms about 4% above the current price.


(Chipotle was featured in this week's [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stocks-to-watch-stock-market-rally-chipotle-nike-stock/) column and was Tuesday's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-burrito-maker-chipotle-stock-serves-up-new-buy-point/) pick.) According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), the stock [has a 90](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg.aspx) out of a highest-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/).

New issue Progyny [broke out](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/stocks-to-watch-ipo-progyny-breaks-out-of-base/) above a 29.39 buy point in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) amid a 9.4% surge. Friday's move was the stock's first entry since going public Oct. 25. Late Wednesday, the fertility-benefits management firm reported [better-than-expected Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/progyny-stock-progyny-earnings-q3-2019-ipo-base-buy-point/).


Remember that new issues trade with a high degree of volatility. If such stocks can rise more than 10% in one day, they can certainly fall just as fast.

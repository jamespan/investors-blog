A day after Tuesday's pitiful rebound attempt, which followed "World Black Monday," stocks blasted higher in rising volume. Wednesday's rebound did not usher a confirmation to wade back into the market waters. Rather, Wednesday's big gains reflected the moves of some bargain hunters who acted upon a deeply oversold situation.

  

The Nasdaq composite led the way, rising 4.2% and halting a six-session selling streak. The gain pulled the leading index to within 10% of its all-time peak of 5231.

  

On Monday morning, the fall had ballooned to as much as 18%.

  

Wednesday's gains were clearly tech-driven. The Nasdaq 100 and the Philadelphia semiconductor index both barreled 5.1% higher.

  

The S&P 500 rebounded 3.9%. Small caps lagged, as the S&P SmallCap 600 rose 2.3%.

  

An 8% jump by **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), which commands more than 5% of the Nasdaq's total market value (see the top of the Nasdaq chart on B2), contributed to the broad gain. [Goldman Sachs issued positive comments](http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-market-today/082615-768269-stock-market-climbs.htm) on the long-term prospects of the world's No. 1 search engine.

  

Google's price action is encouraging. The stock showed support at its 50-day moving average earlier in the week. Amid Monday's bloodbath, Google dropped 4% in surging volume yet finished just a whisker below its 50-day line.

  

That sort of strength underscores Google's [top Composite Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) . Google is also up 13% past a 584.80 early buy point.

  

It's been only days since the market's sell-off went nearly vertical, yet investor psychology has swung sharply toward the dark side.

  

The CBOE Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, had spiked on Monday to a five-year high at 53.29. Bullishness among newsletter writers (see the Bulls Vs. Bears graphs on Page B11) plunged this week to 31.6%, also the lowest level in five years.

  

That figure is still higher than the 22.5% of those surveyed by Investors Intelligence as bearish. A large contingent sees the market as simply being in an intermediate correction. Is investor complacency still high?

  

Strong gains by a large number of market leaders should give investors some encouragement to keep watching the market closely for the inevitable turn higher.

  

The [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/) provides a fast litmus test of the strength of the leadership. On Wednesday, 49 of 50 stocks rose. Two-thirds of the list traded in above-average volume. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) retook its 86.17 base entry. It had given back all of a 15% gain following its June 23 breakout.

It was another volatile session for the stock market Wednesday, but buyers had the upper hand by the close after Wall Street got some good news on the inflation front.


Inflation cooled in February, according to the latest reading from the Consumer Price index. Both the CPI and core CPI rose 0.2% month over month, below the 0.3% consensus of economists tallied by Econoday. On a year-over-year basis, the headline inflation rate eased to 2.8% from 3% in January, while core CPI inflation fell to 3.1% from 3.3%. The latter was the lowest since April 2021.




The Nasdaq composite initially soared 2.1% on the news, but gave most of that gain back in short order. The Nasdaq then found its footing again and ended the day 1.2% higher, but in lower volume. That marked the first day of its rally attempt. As long as the index holds above Tuesday's low, the rally will be intact.


Keep in mind that the first few days of a rally attempt usually see a fair amount of short covering. But if one or more indexes rally powerfully in higher volume on the fourth day or later of a rally attempt, that would raise the likelihood of a more sustained rally. For now, leadership is narrow and actionable setups among growth stocks are in short supply.


Stock Market Today
------------------


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) were among the strongest movers in the Nasdaq 100, with gains ranging from 6.5% to 7.5%. But the bullish gains didn't do anything to fix the technical damage that's been done to all three stocks.

Some will go on to form new bases, while others could stay on downtrends and be dead money for months.


The buying was less pronounced in the other major stock indexes. The S&P 500 added 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged lower by 0.2%. Breadth was positive by less than 2-to-1 on both exchanges.

After the CPI data, the 10-year Treasury yield rallied to a high of 4.33%, up about four basis points. But the yield pared gains and was trading around 4.31% just after the stock market close.


Futures traders over at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) now see a 31% chance of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve at the May 7 meeting. That's down slightly from 35% before the report.


Odds of a rate cut by the June 18 Fed meeting held around 80%. The chances for at least 75 basis points in rate cuts this year were stable around 60%.


Wednesday's session delivered plenty of strong gainers on the Nasdaq. But with the stock market still in a correction, it remains a challenging environment for new buys. Even stocks that are normally viewed as defensive during periods of stock market weakness are having problems.


Patience Is a Virtue
--------------------


Just look at a name like **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), which broke out powerfully on Friday but has fallen sharply for three straight sessions. There's also poultry producer **Pilgrim's Pride** ([PPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PPC)), which just flashed a sell signal after trying to clear a 13-week consolidation last month.


Another defensive stock, **Church & Dwight** ([CHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHD)), looked like it was ready to break out from a 14-week base on March 4, but it's down 2.9% so far this week


It might be tempting to buy a stock like **T-Mobile** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) that's showing some strength as it pulls back into a buy area. But with the stock market tide flowing negative, it's a difficult environment to make money on the long side. Indeed, sitting in cash isn't a bad place to be at all.


A New Member To Leaderboard Lineup
----------------------------------


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) on Tuesday raised its invested percentage to 21% from 16% by adding insurer **Aon** ([AON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AON)) to the model portfolio. After an orderly pullback to the 21-day exponential moving average, Aon is back in a buy zone from a 395.33 entry. Insurance stocks overall continue to be a nice area of outperformance.



Also, **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) is also showing strength and support as it retests a prior area. Berkshire has recovered off lows for six straight sessions. It is holding support at the 21-day line and staying in a buy zone off a 491.67 entry.


Among gold stocks, South African gold producer **AngloGold Ashanti** ([AU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AU)) is holding support at its 10-week moving average. It's back in a buy zone after reclaiming a 31.46 double-bottom entry.

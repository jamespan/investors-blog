Friday had all the makings of a sharp down session in the stock market as earnings sell-offs for **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) weighed on sentiment. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 ended with modest losses, the Nasdaq composite reversed slightly higher, and small caps enjoyed yet another day of outperformance.




[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Corsair Gaming** ([CRSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSR)) slumped 3.9% early in the stock market today after the company priced a 7.5 million share offering at 35. But the gaming leader closed near session highs and reclaimed its 50-day moving average with conviction, rising 4.5% to 38.38.


**Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) also turned in a strong performance, up 4.8%. The recent IPO is making a solid test of its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) for the first time since its September debut.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Sellers hit the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 in the final minutes of trading. The Dow Jones pared an intraday loss of 0.9% to 0.6%. The S&P 500 halved a 0.6% intraday loss to 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite turned a 0.5% early loss into a gain of 0.1%. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 1.3%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Thursday, resulting in a distribution day for the S&P 500.


But higher volume on the NYSE had a lot to do with **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), which soared 51% on volume of more than 193.5 million shares. Nasdaq volume was lower.

Five distribution days for the S&P 500 might seem like a high count, but four of those days showed losses ranging from 0.4% to 0.7%. It's not an index under meaningful distribution.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed, rising 0.2%. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) just completed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), while **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)) sets up in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) base. **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) ended the week still in buy range after a breakout from a base with a 212.65 buy point.


Market Health
-------------


When it comes to overall market health, major stock indexes aren't under meaningful distribution. That's a good thing, but bullish sentiment remains at extreme levels and more, and more people seem to be talking about how easy it is to make money in the stock market. Extreme bullishness is reason to trade cautiously.


It's not easy playing offense and defense at the same time with your portfolio. In some cases, trimming gains in your big winners makes sense. But it also makes sense nibbling at bullish pattern setups when they arise. And there's still some out there.


**JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) rebounded off lows and closed near its session high for the third straight session Friday. It's just below a 96.30 buy point.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) ended the week just above a 138.89 buy point. It's one of several Leaderboard stocks set to report earnings in the coming week, along with **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).

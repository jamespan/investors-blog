Stock indexes shuffled to modest gains Thursday in slow trading but ended high in the day's range.


The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.4% each. The IBD 50 rose 0.7%.


Volume faded across the board.


With the market in an uptrend, the odds favor the buyers. However, individual investors need to keep four realities in mind:


No. 1: Don't chase late-stage stocks when early-stage stocks are breaking out. Look at the length of a run, too, not just the base count.


Recent breakouts from first-stage patterns include **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), **Vistaprint** ([VPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VPRT)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).


These stocks have been off most growth investors' radar for a while, which can be good.


In general, investors are wise to look for institutional quality stocks that show a recent change in character for the better.


No. 2: Be aware of which sectors are scoring the most new highs. This can be useful because strength within the new highs list may appear before it shows up in the sector rankings or industry group rankings. Recently, the real estate sector has been delivering the most daily new highs.


No. 3: Be decisive. Many breakouts are not staying long in the 5% buy zone, becoming extended quickly. This is a change from previous market uptrends this year.


No. 4: Reasons to hold a stock involve a lower standard than reasons to buy. Some late-stage breakouts should not be bought, but investors who bought the earlier breakout might want to sit tight. If a stock shows no sell signs, holding the stock is reasonable.


Key action on Thursday involved some fresh names. **Sierra Wireless** ([SWIR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWIR)) broke out of a pattern in huge volume. The stock gapped up past a 30.65 buy point.


**American Tower** ([AMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMT)) powered past a 100 buy point in a first-stage pattern but then pulled back to close under the entry.


Economic news was mostly positive. Nonfarm productivity rose 2% in Q3, topping the entire range of estimates. First-time jobless claims were lower than expected.


On the negative side, Challenger, Gray & Christmas said planned layoffs in October jumped 68% from September. A 14-year low for layoffs was struck in September. CEO John Challenger said the job cuts were related to "regulatory pressures" â€” that is, companies using layoffs to compensate for increased regulatory costs.

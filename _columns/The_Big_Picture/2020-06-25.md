The stock market reversed from moderate losses to close with solid gains on news of [relaxed banking rules](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-regulators-ease-volcker-rule-fed-stress-tests-may-limit-payouts/) Thursday, offsetting negative sentiment from rising coronavirus cases and a worse-than-expected jobless claims report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied 1.1%, partially recovering from Wednesday's 2.2% sell-off.




The S&P 500 also rallied 1.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed the main indexes with a 1.2% rise despite losses in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)). Boeing was downgraded, while Disney delayed the reopening of Disneyland.


Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.7%. Leading growth stocks also outperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 1.6%. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.

Stock Market Rally Looks To Recover
-----------------------------------


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq's 2.2% decline snapped an eight-day win streak that saw the tech-heavy composite hit all-time highs. The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remains elevated on the S&P 500 with four. But the Nasdaq only has one distribution day. Low distribution-day counts indicate that positive sentiment outweighs the negative.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP062520-248x300.jpg)Thursday's action was indicative of that positive sentiment. The stock market opened sharply lower on rising coronavirus cases and a worse-than-expected jobless claims report. But stocks quickly reversed into the green on relaxed banking rules. For now, the stock market doesn't seem particularly concerned about the increasing number of coronavirus cases.


Keep a close eye on recent stock breakouts. They can clue you in on whether institutions are still willing to accumulate shares at new highs, or if their risk appetite is waning. Tuesday's high-profile breakout stocks included **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)). All three top growth stocks gave up their buy points during Wednesday's weak action.


Of the three, only Netflix reclaimed its buy point on Thursday. StoneCo is still about 1.5% below its 40.27 cup-with-handle buy point, while Vertex is slightly below its 295.65 entry in a flat base.


Stocks To Watch: Domino's, Wingstop
-----------------------------------


Breakout stocks to watch include [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)).


Domino's Pizza closed right at its 50-day moving average as it seeks support at that level. Shares are about 4% below a 387.95 entry in a flat base.


Wingstop advanced 4% in heavy volume to move out of the buy range past a 131.09 buy point in a consolidation after a strong breakout on June 19. The 5% buy zone runs up to 137.64.


Bullishly, the stock's RS line notched a record high to confirm the stock's strength.



Dow Jones Leader Reports Earnings
---------------------------------


Dow Jones retail leader Nike reported fiscal Q4 results after the stock market close. The company [posted a surprise loss](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-earnings-q4-2020-nike-stock-buy-point/) for the quarter as sales missed analyst targets. Shares tumbled 4% to about 97 in after-hours trading.


Nike stock ended Thursday about 3% away from a cup with handle's 104.79 buy point. During the coronavirus stock market crash, Nike shares declined as much as 43%. Normally, a depth of that magnitude would be a glaring flaw in a base structure, but deeper-than-expected bases are acceptable due to the extreme stock market weakness in March.


According to IBD Stock Checkup, [Nike stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-nike-inc-cl-b-nke.aspx) has a 90 out of a highest-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the upper tier of growth stocks. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.


IBD Stock Checkup says that Nike is the No. 2 stock in the shoes industry group, behind **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)). Deckers could be forming a new base after a breakout above a 203.29 entry in a cup base failed.


Bullishly, Nike stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) is near new highs, marking the stock as a potential winner in the current stock market rally. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the broad market.

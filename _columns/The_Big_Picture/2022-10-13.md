Stock Market Stages Dramatic Reversal After Hot Inflation Data; JPMorgan, UnitedHealth To Report
=================================================================================================

The stock market received another dose of hot inflation data Thursday, with the release of the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index. The major stock indexes hit new 2022 lows before rebounding sharply and ending with strong gains.




Amid a stock market that is trying to mount a sustained rebound after plumbing new depths, [recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/anet-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-tech-leader/) **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) is a potential stock market leader to watch, as it calmly constructs a new base formation.


CPI, Jobless Claims, Treasury Yields
------------------------------------


The [Labor Department's Consumer Price Index](https://www.investors.com/news/cpi-inflation-runs-hot-dow-jones-dives-treasury-yields-top-4/) showed consumer prices rose 0.4% in September from the previous month, hotter than the expected 0.2% rise. Inflation rose 8.2% from a year ago — also hotter than estimates and just below August's 8.3% reading.


Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims rose to 228,000 vs. 219,000 in the previous week, higher than the 225,000 Econoday estimate. September retail sales, which are expected to rise 0.2%, are out Friday.


The 10-year Treasury yield briefly topped 4% Thursday, trading as high as 4.08% before settling at 3.95%. The yield is tracking toward its 11th straight weekly advance.


Q3 Earnings Season Heats Up
---------------------------


Besides economic data, the stock market had some earnings reports to digest. Many were positive.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MP101322-289x300.jpg)BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)), **Delta Air** **Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) released their quarterly earnings results.


BlackRock stock climbed 6.6% after its [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/blackrock-earnings-ubs-shifts-blk-stock-outlook/), while Delta rose 4% despite missing third-quarter estimates, as the carrier posted an [upbeat forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/airline-stocks-mixed-after-this-leader-raises-guidance/). Domino's rallied 10.4%. Apple chip supplier Taiwan Semiconductor climbed 3.9% after issuing a [better-than-expected revenue outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-defies-chip-sector-weakness/) for the fourth quarter. And Walgreens jumped more than 5% after beating earnings and sales estimates.


Up next, **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) will report their results Friday morning.


[Earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-during-earnings-season/) cause many of the largest moves in stocks, and they require special care. Strong earnings can fuel top stocks to previously untouched levels — and above new buy points — while a less-than-impressive announcement can send shares tumbling.


The stock market's reaction to an earnings release can often tell you more than the earnings themselves. If the results seem strong but the stock slides anyway, investors may be concerned about the sustainability of growth, rising costs or other potential negatives.


With the market in correction mode, investors should be tracking companies that handily beat earnings results and have strong upside reactions. They could be among the stock market's leaders if the market is able to extend its rebound.

Stock Market Today: New Rally Attempt Begins
--------------------------------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off as much as 1.6% before closing with a 2.8% advance. The S&P 500 turned a 2.4% decline into a 2.6% rise. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite reversed a dive of more than 3% into a 2.2% climb. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 staged their best comebacks since Feb. 24, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The small-cap Russell 2000 slid 2.7%, but ended with a 2.4% gain.


It was unclear why stocks reversed so sharply higher in the wake of bad inflation data. It left investors searching for [potential explanations](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-2022-10-13-cpi-report/card/some-reasons-why-stocks-are-higher-again-5UKdXNWEM7rsrCnqR39N). Volume rose on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and also appeared to be higher on the NYSE.


Top growth stocks ended at session highs, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF advanced 2.5%. The ETF has held above Sept. 26's 52-week low, even as the major stock indexes notched fresh 2022 lows. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)) ended just above a 75.33 cup-base entry.


Thursday was Day 1 of the stock market's latest rally attempt, so investors are now patiently awaiting a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), which can occur as early as Tuesday of next week. A follow-through day confirms the beginning of a new uptrend. Be mindful that not all follow-throughs work, so it's important to raise exposure slowly and methodically, as the uptrend proves itself. (Check [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) for more on spotting market bottoms.)


In the meantime, continue to build watchlists of top-performing stocks, like Molina Healthcare and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)). Cardinal shares are tracing a flat base with a 72.38 buy point, as they find support at their 50-day line.

Molina Is A Stock Market Leader
-------------------------------


Molina Healthcare is a potential stock market leader to watch during the stock market's new rally attempt.


[The company provides health insurance](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/moh-stock-why-it-is-not-a-good-time-to-buy-this-ibd-stock-of-the-day-yet/) through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The company just wrapped its takeover of AgeWell New York and is in the process of buying My Choice Wisconsin. Both are Medicaid management services. Molina expects the duo to add nearly $2 billion in acquired revenue, beginning next year.


The company expects the two acquisitions to drive 10% growth over its current 2022 prediction. For the year, Molina expects $30 billion in sales, and adjusted earnings of at least $17.60 a share.


In the latest quarter, earnings and sales climbed 34% and 18%, respectively. The company's third-quarter results are due out Oct. 26 after the market closes. Molina is expected to earn $4.21 per share on sales of $7.8 billion.

MOH Stock Forms Flat Base
-------------------------


MOH stock rallied 1.8% Thursday, ending just shy of its new buy point. Shares are forming a flat base with a 361.35 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. An early entry at 360.35 is also in play, which is 10 cents above Tuesday's high price.


The stock is showing big stock market outperformance during an incredibly choppy and difficult environment. The best way to view this positive divergence is to use the relative strength line, which continues to hit new highs. An [RS line at new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) during a stock market correction is a key indicator of technical strength.


Wait for a decisive move above the entry, along with a new stock market uptrend, before purchasing shares in the health care leader.

U.S. stock indexes rode a strong jobs report to solid gains Friday. The Nasdaq advanced 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.9% and 1%, respectively.


The S&P SmallCap 600 led with a 1.3% pop. The IBD 50 trailed with a 0.6% gain.


Volume fell on the NYSE but picked up on the Nasdaq.


Friday's optimistic tone was set before the open, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls swelled by 255,000 in July, which was 38% above the consensus figure and 18% above the top of the estimates range. Meanwhile, the figure for June was revised up about 2%.

The Nasdaq popped above an old resistance level around 5200. The S&P 500 climbed above recent resistance around 2175. The battle at these areas could be retested in the days ahead, especially since the Nasdaq remains under its all-time high of 5231.


The S&P 500 has been making new, all-time highs and made a fresh one Friday. The Nasdaq made a new closing high.


Although the bulls welcomed Friday's action, there were two glitches.


First, most of the gains were achieved in the first 90 minutes of trade and then the indexes moved sideways. In a perfect bull world, the indexes would've built on the gains throughout the session. Still, the way the indexes held gains was constructive.


Second, there weren't all that many leaders making strong gains in strong volume. In the IBD 50, for example, 16 stocks rose 1% or more, but only three did so in heavy volume: Telecom infrastructure company **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) surged 10% in volume 300% above average; enterprise software firm **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) rolled 6% in volume 200% above average; and underground fiber installer **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) rose 4% in volume 41% above average.


Leading stocks lagged for the week as the IBD 50 inched up 0.1%. The Nasdaq gained 1.1% and the S&P 500 0.4% the past week.


Breakouts in strong volume Friday included floor covering provider **Mohawk Industries** ([MHK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHK)) and **China Biologic Products** ([CBPO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBPO)). **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) cleared a 96.60 buy point in a handle, but volume was sluggish.

![Polygon digital bear and bull market](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Stock-digitalbearbull-01-adobe.jpg)The stock market, including the Dow Jones, ended a wild week higher. Netflix earnings and retail sales data loom ahead of the Easter break.





Stocks ended the day and a historically wild week sharply higher amid ongoing Trump tariff uncertainty. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) earnings and new retail sales data are due in the shortened Easter holiday week ahead.


The Nasdaq composite fared best among the major indexes as it rallied 2.1% higher Friday. It ended the week 7.3% ahead and is back out of bear market territory. The tech-heavy index has seen its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) fall below its 200-day line though, still a bearish look. It is now holding a loss of 13.4% for 2025.




The S&P 500 turned in a strong daily gain of 1.8% and notched a weekly increase of 5.4%. This was the benchmark index's second weekly rise in the past three weeks and it gained significant ground on its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/). Still, it remains down 8.8% for the year so far.


Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 619 points, or 1.6%. However, it remains more than 10% down from its high for the year. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), the latter of which was boosted by an earnings beat, fared best here.


Small caps also bounced back some, with the Russell 2000 rising 1.6%. It remains more than 15% below its 200-day moving average. Growth stocks did even better, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund popping 2.8%.


The 10-year Treasury yield rose 50 basis points this week to 4.49%, its biggest one-week gain since November 2001. The spike has led to speculation that President Donald Trump's moves on trade have caused some investors to ditch U.S. Treasury notes in favor of other safe haven assets.


While the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 posted gains, lighter volume meant this was not a follow-through day. In addition, both indexes are rooted below the key 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish look that merits extra caution.


Given this was day five of a rally attempt, a bona fide follow-through day could still occur in coming days. However, Investor's Business Daily is holding recommended exposure at the 0%-20% level for now.


More Cool Inflation Data; Netflix Earnings Loom
-----------------------------------------------


Stocks opened higher after the producer price index came in cooler than expected across the board. Headline prices were down 0.4% in March vs. February and rose 2.7% year over year. Core PPI, which strips out food and energy, fell 0.1% vs. the prior month and was up 3.3% on an annualized basis.

But gains were trimmed somewhat after the University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index fell to 50.8 in April from its prior reading of 57. This was worse than expected. Respondents also said they expect inflation to hit 6.7% in the year ahead, the highest reading in 44 years.


However, Boston Fed president Susan Collins [told the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/0273371d-b90c-43e4-845a-e51982dd4fdf) that the Federal Reserve "does have tools to address concerns about market functioning or liquidity should they arise," which helped calm fears.


Collins, currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, also said that central bankers are "not seeing liquidity concerns overall" despite the recent volatility.


More economic data is set to drop in the coming week, including the Empire State manufacturing survey on Tuesday and the U.S. retail sales data for March on Wednesday. This latter reading should give a deeper insight into the health of the consumer. Also, the stock market will be closed on Good Friday.


Further developments on the Trump administration's trade agenda could also move the markets.


[Earnings season is also getting underway](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/netflix-stock-booming-subscriber-growth-q1-results/) with earnest in the coming week. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which should offer some insight into consumer discretionary spending, **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) are among the noteworthy names posting results.


This Stock Market Group Shines As Gold Rises
--------------------------------------------


All [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday in positive territory](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Materials, energy and technology fared best. Consumer discretionary turned in the slimmest gain.


Investors could parse a more granular view of the action [on the stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by examining the daily performance of IBD's 197 industry groups.


Coal stocks, oil and gas explorers, medical software stocks and fabless semiconductor firms were all strong Friday.



Gold stocks also shined, with precious metals miners the top performing group of the day. [Leaderboard stock](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) reached fresh heights after rallying 5.5% Friday. It is now well clear of its 25% profit goal from an 89 buy point. The price of gold is at record highs, rising 2.4% to $3,253.80 per ounce.


In contrast, trucking plays, home furnishings retailers, jewelry retailers, department stores, auto parts companies and automakers all lagged.


The so-called Magnificent Seven outperformed the broader stock market this week. But while the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) rose more than 8% for the week, it is still down almost 18% for the year.

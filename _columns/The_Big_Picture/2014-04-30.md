Stocks Rise As Dow Industrials, Utility Stocks Rule April

The major averages finished modestly higher Wednesday as investors took the Federal Reserve's decision to further reduce its massive bond-buying stimulus program in stride.

  

Leading stocks joined the month-end rally. But for every highly rated growth stock that is trading near or at a 52-week high, there seems to be at least two other stocks that are still dusting themselves off after plunging to or near their 200-day moving averages.

  

Dynamic companies such as **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)), **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) still trade in the lower half of their respective bases, even if barely so. The market's message: Stay patient.

  

The IBD 50 rose 0.6%.

  

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both edged 0.3% higher, wiping away small early losses. A poor initial report of 0.1% first-quarter U.S. GDP growth, influenced by unusually cold winter weather, did not rattle traders.

  

April proved a golden month for holders of defensive and megacap blue chip issues that pay dividends. Unlike the key indexes, the Dow industrials etched an all-time closing high Wednesday. The average rose 0.8% for the month. The dividend-rich Dow utilities gained 4% for the month, an unusually large gain. The Nasdaq slid 2%.

  

Energy-related industry groups dominated the list of top monthly performers. Oil & Gas-Integrated, Oil & Gas-Refining, Energy-Coal, Utility-Electric Power and Oil & Gas-Canadian Exploration all rose 3% or more.

  

It has been 11 trading sessions since the Nasdaq pulled off a good reversal on April 15, in which it kissed the 200-day moving average and turned an early 2% thrashing into a small gain. Yet the composite index has not yet produced a rally strong enough to conclude that top institutional money managers are eager to buy aggressively.

  

The reasons are understandable. Quantitative easing is shrinking. The Ukraine crisis is likely helping to push energy costs higher. The housing recovery is sputtering. And Q1 earnings growth has been threadbare, when assessing the S&P 500 companies' reports so far.

  

Robert Maltbie, founder of Singular Research and chief of Millennium Asset Management, notes that heavy new share issuances by companies have engulfed a modest inflow of new cash into equities. Yet, "while things look a little murky and earnings are back-end loaded, in places such as in Southern California, we can see stronger growth and so we think real GDP is running at 3%, not 2%. This boosts S&P 500 earnings by 5%," Maltbie told IBD ahead of the GDP report.

  

The latest Investors Intelligence survey of stock-market pundits shows that the bulls continue to run wild at 54.7%. Given that the Nasdaq composite has already fallen as much as 9.7% from a 4371 high, one has to wonder: How much more of a decline would it take for the optimism to dissipate?

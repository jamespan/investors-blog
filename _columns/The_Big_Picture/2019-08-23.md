  The Big Picture: Trump Shakes Up Stock Market With Anti-China Tweets

Stock market investors were braced Friday morning for what they might face from the Federal Reserve at Jackson Hole, Wyo. But it turned out investors were looking in the wrong direction.




Fed chief Jerome Powell was the focus, and his calm message found favor. But no one expected President Donald Trump to step in and smack China.


Trump tweeted that "We don't need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them." He added that "American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China."


While Trump doesn't have the constitutional power to order private companies to move, he can make trouble for them.


Aggressive Selling In Stock Market
----------------------------------


The stock market apparently decided that the threat alone was enough to justify aggressive selling.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP082319-248x300.jpg)The Nasdaq skidded 3% lower, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.6% and 2.4%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 3.1%.


Volume in Friday's stock market was up sharply on both major exchanges. The action [constituted distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.


China Started The Disturbance
-----------------------------


A trade announcement from China sparked Trump's reaction. Beijing said it would stick U.S. companies with tariffs on $75 billion in products.


Late Friday, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports that already were slapped with a 10% tariff to 15%, and he raised 25% tariffs to 30%.


For the stock market, a number of things have become clear.


Points Of Stock-Market Clarity
------------------------------


—The Nasdaq again faced resistance at its 10-week moving average, and the S&P 500 hasn't mounted a serious move to retake its 10-week line. Scorecard: bearish signs.


—Four straight down weeks have left the indexes not too far above their 40-week lines. The last time a major index closed under its 40-week line was three months ago. Scorecard: potentially bearish.


—Among IBD's 197 industry groups, gold miners and dairy were the rare areas of strength Friday as investors sought havens. On the weak side, toys, oil, semiconductors and retail suffered. Scorecard: bearish.


—The put-call volume ratio closed at 1.2, according to preliminary data. Readings of 1.15 or higher point to a short-term bottom. Scorecard: could be bullish, at least in the short term.


—According to Bloomberg data, the yield curve threatened to invert again Friday. Both the 10-year yield and two-year were at 1.53%, as of 4:30 p.m. ET. Research shows [the yield curve inversion is poor](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/yield-curve-stock-market/) as a short- to intermediate-term indicator. Score card: not immediately applicable.


The market outlook remains under pressure, so investors must be on guard. Raising exposure to stocks right now is risky.


IPO Breakout
------------


Breakouts on a day like Friday were understandably scarce.


Cloud platform provider **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)) cleared a 25.65 buy point in morning trade but then reversed back under the buy point. The pattern was a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/bullish-stock-patterns-are-sometimes-double-bottoms/). Fastly debuted on the NYSE in May. The small-cap company has yet to turn an annual profit. Revenue leapt 38% in 2018.

Stocks Surge For Second Straight Day
=====================================

Stocks gapped up at the open Thursday and never looked back.


The S&P 500 sprinted 2.4%, while the Nasdaq tagged along with a 2.2% gain.


The IBD 50 also added 2.2%.


Volume fell modestly on both major exchanges.


The back-to-back days of hefty price gains were the best in months. For the Nasdaq, it was its best three-day rally since Oct. 17-21, when the composite strung together three 1%-or-higher gains. The third of those was the Oct. 21 follow-through day.


Despite the impressive price pops, individual investors should delay buying stocks until the market delivers a follow-through, which would confirm that a new uptrend is underway.


It's also good to keep in mind for now that the past two days of big percentage gains were preceded by three distribution days in a row â€” the footprints of institutional selling.


A fight is in process for the soul of this market, and it isn't yet clear who will win.


One positive development is reflected in the balance of new highs versus new lows, today on Page B1. New lows had hit triple digits in every session since Nov. 28, but that ended Thursday.


The market looks stronger now than it did three sessions ago, and individual investors should have watch lists ready if a new uptrend is confirmed.


Flexibility is a virtue for market-timing growth investors. The idea is to protect a portfolio from big drawdowns, while re-entering the market to capture most of the advance.


Yet, 2014 has been a year of U-turns, which can be challenging for market timers. The Nasdaq has pulled back five times, with declines in the 4% to 10% range. Advances that followed each of those pullbacks resulted in gains in the 6% to 11% range, until the nearly 17% run from mid-October to late November.


Ideally, bulls would like to see the uptrend resume and carry through well into the new year. But individual investors need to make sure they are acting on reality, not a wish. Avoiding buys during corrections and buying stocks only after a follow-through are two steps designed to keep investors out of the wish zone and in the reality zone.


Breakouts have not been much of a part of the market reality lately. In the past 10 sessions, only four stocks with decent ratings have broken out: **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Habit Restaurants** ([HABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HABT)) on Dec. 11, and **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Insys Therapeutics** ([INSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSY)) on Thursday.


Friday will be a quadruple witching day, which could lead to volatility and heavy trading.

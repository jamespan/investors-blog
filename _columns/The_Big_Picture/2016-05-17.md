===============================================

The stock market stumbled Tuesday, as little remained from a once-promising rebound in the indexes.


The Nasdaq slid 1.3%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1.6%. Losers led winners by 9-to-5 on the NYSE and by nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

Volume increased, and that was the most compromising statistic of the day, because it gave the indexes a new distribution day. The number of higher-volume losses is unquestionably high (see the accompanying Market Pulse table), indicating a high level of risk in stocks. Investors must maintain limited exposure to stocks until conditions improve.


If the amount of distribution wasn't enough to make investors pause, the indexes are crafting a cautionary picture.


A bullish reversal on May 6 started a rebound in the indexes. But after the Nasdaq met resistance at its 50-day moving average a week ago, the rebound started drifting. Both indexes closed Tuesday narrowly above the May 6 lows. A drop below that level would be taken as another bearish signal.


As the market seeks direction, some signals are proving to be ephemeral. For example, a bounce at the 50-day line on May 6 was encouraging for the S&P 500. But the index closed right back below the line Tuesday. With the market unable to sustain a trend, it's daunting to make money with stocks topping buy points.


Some leading stocks reflect that frustrating tendency. High-speed data networking play **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) had advanced as much as 22% from a 28.54 buy point, but has erased most of that gain. Nursing and physician staffing firm **AMN Healthcare Services** ([AHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AHS)) surged to new highs after beating estimates May 5. But seven days later, the health staffing company finds itself 8% below the prior high.


Both are in the IBD 50, which lost 1.1% on the day.


Index losses steepened Tuesday afternoon after two Federal Reserve presidents, Dennis Lockhart and John Williams, said at least two interest-rate increases may be needed this year. Lockhart said the chance of a hike at the Fed’s June meeting was “live,” according to reports.


Early Tuesday, the government reported that [consumer prices rose 0.4%](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/consumer-prices-jump-most-in-4-years-housing-starts-climb/) in April. The bigger-than-expected rise, which was the biggest increase in three years, also fueled speculation of a rate hike.


Energy stocks were higher after crude oil climbed 1.2%. Crude futures reached a seven-month high earlier in the day. The Dow Jones transportation average added 0.6%.


Despite the weak market, a couple of defensive areas came under selling. Utility industry groups fell 1.7% to 4% -- perhaps a reaction to the higher likelihood of rate hikes. Food-related groups -- market leaders just like the utilities -- dropped 1.9% to 3.6%.


Earnings sparked some volatility in the retail sector. **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) beat Q1 expectations, but shares fell 3% on slowing growth in same-store sales. The stock traded below its 50-day moving average for the first time since February but has not triggered a sell signal.


**TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) erased a 4% gain and was modestly lower. The discount apparel chain beat Q1 estimates and raised full-year profit guidance. **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) reversed lower also, dropping 2.5% in active turnover. Ross Stores reports fiscal Q1 results (EPS and sales are seen up 6%) on Thursday.

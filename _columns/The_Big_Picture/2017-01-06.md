U.S. stock indexes posted all-time highs Friday, as the Nasdaq overcame resistance at the 5500 price level.


The Nasdaq chalked up a 0.6% gain, outperforming the S&P 500 for the fourth session in a row. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


![mp_010617](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP_010617-218x300.png)While the media gushed over the market's all-time highs, the Street probably found more meaning in the Nasdaq's rise above recent resistance at the 5,500 area.


Why so?


The all-time highs are not adjusted for inflation. The high of 5,132 in the Nasdaq in March 2000 would be about 7,087 if adjusted for inflation.


Also, the overall market context was different in 2000. The Nasdaq had been steadily making new highs for five years, and 5,132 was the trapdoor for "buy on the dips."


The market made new highs regularly for five years after 1995, something today's market has not achieved yet.


Anything can happen in the stock market, but the Street is beginning the new year with more confidence than in recent years.


[Breakouts](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787) in the banking sector has set an optimistic tone since the election. The Federal Reserve's widely expected rate hike Dec. 14 also played a role in changing the mood.


On Friday, more wood was added to the fading embers. Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said in a conference in Washington, D.C. that rates "may need to increase more briskly than markets appear to expect."


Lacker, though, is not a voting member of the Fed.


Super regional banks and money centers rose 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively. Higher rates are expected to improve net interest margin at banks.


Few markets come gift-wrapped, and the current uptrend is no exception.


While the action has been encouraging, there are several secondary indicators in uncomfortable places.


Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears ratio is in what the research firm calls, "the danger zone." Also, the percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day moving average was 67%, going into Friday's action.


On the plus side, the number of new highs vs. new lows is bullish. And the indexes have been trimming the distribution-day count. On Friday, the Nov. 30 distribution day came off both indexes because of time.

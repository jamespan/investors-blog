The stock market closed mixed after a volatile session Friday where the bulls and bears struggled to decisively gain the upper hand. With the latest Fed meeting and a deluge of important earnings reports due, next week now looks key.




The Nasdaq composite continued to waver, this time dipping 0.2%. This caused it to close below its [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/). Importantly, it also added its third [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) in a row, an unwelcome sight. Bulls will point to the fact that its 0.6% dip for the week is relatively mild. In addition, the tech-heavy index is up almost 36% so far in 2023, so a pause for breath is not unusual.


One factor driving volume here is the Nasdaq 100 rebalance taking effect Monday. This is due to the fact **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) had risen to make up almost 30% of its weighting. This no doubt stirred portfolio managers into action.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP_4x3_072123-288x300.jpg)The S&P 500 managed to close with a nominal gain, though it was essentially flat. The benchmark index turned in a weekly gain of less than 1% and is clear of its short-term moving averages. It continues to lag the Nasdaq, but is now up nearly 19% for the year.


Advancers and decliners were roughly even on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq. [Volume was mixed](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/). With the stock market still in a confirmed uptrend, IBD is recommending 80% to 100% exposure. But be prepared to take money off the table as earnings season continues to gather pace. Locking in at least partial profits and being quick to act on any sell signals is prudent at the current time.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned in a tiny gain of just 3 points. While it was essentially flat, it was still enough for it to rise for a 10th session in a row. This is itsÂ longest winning streak since August 2017. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) fared best, while **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) lagged.


Small caps and growth stocks underperformed on the day, with both the Russell 2000 and Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slipping 0.4%.


Fed Chair Powell, Big Earnings On Deck
--------------------------------------


The week ahead looks pivotal, with the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting and a slew of important earnings reports looming large.


The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference will be keenly watched for any guidance on more rate hikes. But with next week's meeting the last until September, he is likely to punt on firm guidance until Jackson Hole in August.


Adding to what could be a heated debate between stock market bulls and bears next week is the fact a slew of key earnings reports are on deck.


While growth stock aficionados will be focused on reports from **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), heavy hitters like **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) and **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) will also be sharing quarterly results.


These Stock Market Groups In Rude Health
----------------------------------------


A slight majority of the S&P 500 sectors actually managed to close the day in positive territory. Utilities and health led the upside while industrials and communication services lagged.


As ever, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave investors a closer look into what was happening under the hood of the stock market.


A variety of medical industry groups, book stocks and shipping transportation plays were all strong performers.


On the flip side, auto retail stocks, metal products distributors and mail order retailers were among the worst laggards.

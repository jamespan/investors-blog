Nasdaq, Small Caps Lead Stock Market Lower; Apple Earnings Top Views
=====================================================================

The stock market ended lower, as small caps and tech stocks sold off sharply Thursday. Despite the session's losses, a rally attempt is still intact, as indexes continue to hold above this week's lows.




After the stock market close, Dow Jones tech titan **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and payments leader **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) reported their quarterly results. Both stocks climbed in extended trade. Apple [beat profit and sales estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-rises-as-iphone-maker-beats-holiday-sales-expectations/) as Visa also topped views.


Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched lower Thursday, while the S&P 500 moved down 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off 1.4%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 tumbled 2.3%. All four indexes closed near session lows after opening sharply higher in the wake of stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP growth. A strong open with a weak close is a characteristics of a stock market correction.


Top growth stocks were also hit hard, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slid 1.6%. The ETF of top growth stocks extended a losing streak to three sessions and is down 2.4% for the week.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and also appeared to be slightly lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.

What To Do Now
--------------


Despite Thursday's losses, the major stock indexes held above Monday's lows, which means the market's rally attempt is still intact. Continue to wait for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), which is when a major index posts strong gains in volume heavier than the prior day. A follow-through day could occur any day now, so make sure your watchlists are primed with top stocks, though strong merchandise is lacking.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP012722.jpg)Even though a follow-through is possible, there aren't many traditional growth stocks near new buy points. Many previous leaders — like **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) — are 33% or more from their previous highs.


One of the easiest ways to find new leadership and top growth stocks is to use the [RS Line Blue Dot](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) screen in [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). This exclusive MarketSmith screen focuses on ideas with market-beating performance. They could be some of the next big winners after a new confirmed uptrend in stocks.


Stocks this week with the Blue Dot include **American International Group** ([AIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIG)), **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)), **Weatherford** **International** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)) and **Williams Cos.** ([WMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMB)).

Bullishly, the stock's RS line hit a new high this week, indicating strong stock market outperformance. [CF stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-c-f-industries-holdings-cf.aspx) boasts a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) per the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) The stock was up 0.9% Thursday, but only recovered a portion of Wednesday's 5.1% dive.

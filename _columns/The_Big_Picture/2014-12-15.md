Mounting Distribution Puts Market In Correction Mode

There's been a consistent pattern of strong opens and weak closes in the market lately, and it was more of the same Monday as early gains faded, sparked by another drop in oil prices.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.8% early, but sellers quickly regained control. The Nasdaq fell 1%, ending just above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 wasn't so lucky. It gave up the key support level, dropping 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average also lost 0.6%.

  

Volume rose across the board, resulting in another distribution day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The S&P flashed its fourth distribution day in six trading sessions.

  

The weak action was enough to put the market in a correction (see the change in the Market Pulse). Headed into Monday, the market was already teetering, with five distribution days on the Nasdaq and four on the S&P 500.

  

Market risk was elevated after last week's bearish action that saw the S&P 500 slump 3.5% for the week in higher volume. On Wednesday, the current outlook was downgraded to "uptrend under pressure."

  

For growth investors, the best strategy is to get out of the market's way and don't try to make money when sellers have the upper hand. Losses can accelerate; big gains in winners can disappear in no time, especially when institutions are unwinding positions and taking profits.

  

The market generally does a good job telling investors when to be in the market and when to be out. The message is clear now: Raise cash if you haven't done so already. At this point, the market's main focus is on plunging oil prices and the Fed.

  

January WTI crude oil lost just over 3% to around $55.91 a barrel. Lower oil prices are good for the U.S. consumer, but not so good on a macro level. Fears are growing that a financial crisis could be brewing for big oil exporters like Russia and Venezuela.

  

Meanwhile, the two-day Fed meeting starts Tuesday with a policy statement due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.

  

Despite a mixed bag of economic data, the Fed continues to pay close attention to the jobs market, which continues to hum along. Earlier this month, November payrolls increased by 321,000 in November, the best gain in nearly three years. Over the past six months, monthly job growth has averaged around 250,000.

  

In economic news Monday, industrial production surged in November, but that was offset by news that factory activity in the New York region contracted in December. The New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing index registered a December reading of -3.6, well below the consensus estimate of 12.

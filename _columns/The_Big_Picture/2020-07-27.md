Nasdaq Leads Continued Bounce, But Latest Breakouts Found In This Sector
=========================================================================

The stock market showed a short memory Monday, quickly forgetting the coronavirus pandemic and a U.S.-China rift — at least for a day. Instead, the market chose optimism.




Investors watched as Congress worked to extend aid for the unemployed. Reports late Monday said [Senate Republicans are preparing a $1 trillion coronavirus relief bill](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-to-release-coronavirus-aid-proposal-after-delay-11595860826?mod=hp_lead_pos7). The stock market also looked with hope at **Moderna**'s ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) experimental Covid-19 vaccine, which [began late-stage trials Monday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/moderna-starts-phase-3-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-mrna-stock/). Shares rose more than 9%.


The Nasdaq composite led with a 1.7% leap. The composite climbed back above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which has been reliably stopping the Nasdaq's pullbacks since the [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on April 6. The S&P technology sector was strongest, up 1.6%. Semiconductors charged ahead, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rallying 3.2%.


Small caps pitched in too, with the Russell 2000 gaining 1.2%. But the rest of the market was more sedate. The S&P 500 added 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.4%. Volume edged lower on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.


Stocks weakened last week as both the U.S. and China forced consulate closures. Coronavirus infections continued to spread.


![MP072720-2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP072720-2-252x300.jpg)But coupled with Friday's positive reversal, Monday's gains put indexes back on an upward path, at least short term.


Yet this is a different stock market than just a couple of weeks ago. Today, the uptrend has moderated. After soaring 63% from the March lows to the July 13 high, the Nasdaq is in a sideways pattern. Still, the composite is the undisputed leader this year, up 17.4% while the S&P 500 is up a fraction and the Dow is down nearly 7% since Jan. 1.


Tech Sector Leading The Stock Market
------------------------------------


No doubt, the coronavirus recovery largely has come on the back of the tech sector. Based on the S&P Global Industry Classification Standard classifications, half of the S&P 500's 11% gain over the past two months has been driven by the technology, interactive media and internet retail sectors, says Jeff Buchbinder, Equity Strategist of LPL Financial. That interactive media sector includes social media and digital advertising giants — areas that have benefited from work, learn and play at home.


Some analysts are starting to think the sector is overbought. Morgan Stanley analysts on Monday downgraded the software sector to in line from attractive, reports said. Software stocks are trading at lofty multiples, and the sector's exceptionally strong performance has accelerated in the past few months, Morgan Stanley said.


Already, the stock market is pausing. That's normal given the big feast the market has to digest. This is also causing some sector rotation.


While technology, health care, materials and real estate were the top S&P sectors, breakouts Monday were a mix of industrial and mining stocks. In gold mining, **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) and **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) broke out of [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). [Other stocks in the industry have been breaking out, too](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/gold-prices-nail-record-high-gold-miners-break-out-in-droves/).


Gold Hits Record High
---------------------


The price of gold hit a record high above $1,943 per ounce and has been one of the best-performing assets this month. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF ([GDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDX)) is up 17% from a breakout July 7. Shares gapped up Monday.



Chemicals companies **Chemours** ([CC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CC)), **Eastman Chemicals** ([EMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMN)) and **Huntsman** ([HUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUN)) cleared [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), though only Huntsman saw adequate volume. Industrial stocks appeared to rise on encouraging news for the sector in the latest durable goods report. Orders rose 7.3% in June, above expectations. Of course, Covid-19 remains a cloud over the economic outlook.


BMO Capital Markets Senior Economist Jennifer Lee cautioned in a report that orders are still down over 20% from year-ago levels. "But after being nearly completely shut out in March and April, this (is) another step to returning to 'normal' (whatever 'normal' is these days)." Opening up the country brought life back into the economy, but "it also brought the virus back into communities and that, alone, is the biggest risk to this recovery."


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) climbed 2.1% as only a few stocks ended lower. Watch for leaders testing the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) or the 10-week line. Those include **Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)), **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)).

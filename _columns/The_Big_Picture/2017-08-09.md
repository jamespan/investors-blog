Indexes Cut Losses Amid North Korea Crisis; Will Apple Get Extended?
=====================================================================

Tuesday's trading session showed how the market can run into so-called technical resistance on the upside. So, was Wednesday an example of the exact opposite? That is, did the big boys and girls of the market lend a hand of buying support, even though the major indexes finished down again?




In some ways, yes, especially when you are looking at the biggest companies in the U.S. equity markets.


The Nasdaq composite lost nearly 0.3% despite a fourth gain in a row by its largest constituent, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Plus, total volume expanded vs. the prior day. NYSE volume fell.


That combination of a significant decline (a minimum 0.2%) in higher turnover is the best sign that the deep-pocketed investors on Wall Street took profits with more enthusiasm than usual. In IBD-speak, that's called [distribution](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764).


The Nasdaq slid almost 1% after just 15 minutes of trading. Global concern over what North Korea will do next in its game of nuclear brinksmanship, combined with President Trump's strongest words yet in targeting the dictatorial East Asian state, reverberated across financial markets. So everyone expected U.S. equities to quiver. U.S. Treasury bonds jumped and yields plunged. Yet likely few expected the Nasdaq to rebound as much as it did.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP080917.png)A solid rebound in the final hour of trading slashed the Nasdaq's decline by day's end. The S&P 500 almost closed in positive territory; the large-cap benchmark rebounded from a 0.5% drop to finishing the day off by just one point, at nearly 2474. That's less than 1% below the S&P 500's all-time high of 2490.87, reached on Tuesday.


The S&P 600 fell nearly 0.9% as small caps were clearly out of favor, but it too bounced significantly off its intraday low.


Still, Wednesday also marked the sixth such distribution day for the Nasdaq over the past 25 trading sessions.


Does this mean the mighty bull run is over? Not at all, when you look at the rest of the market's action.


For starters, consider how the Nasdaq finished well in the upper half of the day's trading range. Ditto for the S&P 500 and even the Dow Jones industrial average, which lost less than 0.2%.


Regarding the Nasdaq itself, six distribution days are certainly enough in number to quash any bull market. Go back to March 2000, and the Nasdaq showed three vanilla-flavor distribution days and two stalling sessions. That's all it took for the Nasdaq to mark a major market top, then drop 78% over the next 2-1/2 years.


However, fast-forward to today, and none of the six distributions really show big fangs. The biggest drop? A 0.6% sell-off on July 27.


The average decline among the other five distribution days, including a July 26 stalling day (in which the Nasdaq gained 0.2%), is a measly -0.22%.


Second, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow all continue to ride on the north side of their 50-day moving averages. (See the page of charts for all three indexes via the link at the bottom of this article.) That's a healthy sign.


The S&P 600 is sandwiched in between its rising 50- and 200-day lines.


Third, the new-highs list continues to be robust. In four of the prior five trading sessions, IBD's screened new-highs list has shown a minimum 200 names on either the Nasdaq or the NYSE that posted an all-time or 52-week high. On Tuesday, a combined 271 stocks hit new highs, vs. 114 making new lows.

Going back to Apple, the iPhone and iPad firm's heft in the major benchmarks cannot be ignored. Put another way, almost one of every 14 dollars' worth of market value in the Nasdaq is controlled by Apple, and its impact on other companies as a customer or partner is gigantic as well.


Apple, up 0.6% to 161.06, has now climbed nearly 3% past a new flat-base entry at 156.76. The 5% buy zone goes up to 164.60. Apple has also risen as much as 37% after clearing a 118.12 first-stage cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 6-9.


No doubt, 2017 has been a year of the large and mega-cap equity play.


The S&P 500 through Wednesday stands with a tall year-to-date gain of 10.5%, scorching the S&P SmallCap 600's 0.7% lift. However, the IBD 50, Sector Leaders, Stocks Near A Buy Zone and Stock Spotlight screens have also identified companies that may have a market cap well below $15 billion but are mighty in growth and in stock price strength.

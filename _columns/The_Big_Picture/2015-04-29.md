Stocks struggled to snap out of their latest minislump Wednesday, but the overall intensity of the selling was checkered.


Decent gains in heavy volume by some leading stocks also muddied the total investment landscape. (See the "Leaders up in volume" portion of the Market Pulse table.)


The S&P 500 forfeited the prior day's gains and then some, losing 0.4%. NYSE trade rose sharply, indicating more pronounced selling by fund managers and other institutional investors.


Wednesday's decline also handed the S&P 500 its seventh distribution day in recent weeks.


Breadth was terrible across the market as losers led winners 2-to-1. Yet the S&P 500 ended the day in the upper half of the day's trading session, a good sign. In the past, 2100 was a resistance level. Now, it's providing support.


The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.6%, but it escaped a distribution day as turnover cooled. Because the March 24 distribution expired on time, the Nasdaq's count fell to six.


While IBD's current outlook remains technically in a confirmed uptrend, the day-to-day action tells prudent readers that the market is not making it easy at all to generate quick profits on breakout moves.


In fact, although the major indexes still hold tightly near record highs, some highly rated stocks violated their key 50-day moving averages, a sell signal.


Take **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)), which broke out of a long base at 33.27 in April 2014. On Wednesday, the managed health care provider continued to fall like a stone, sinking 5.09 to 63.95 and slicing right through its 50-day line in heavy volume. That's a sell signal.


**GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Spirit Aerosystems** ([SPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPR)) and budget airline **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) also took out their 50-day lines.


A disappointing advance reading on U.S. first-quarter GDP likely ushered Wednesday's early sell-off. But at around 1 p.m. ET, stocks bottomed and rebounded ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates near zero. The U.S. central bank also further backed away from any details on when it would raise the cost of money.


The top 40 IBD industry groups have not shown much rotation among leaders. Meanwhile, a few of the oil-related subgroups have risen a tad. Despite the recent rebound in crude oil prices, the stocks in these groups are hardly ready to take a leadership role.

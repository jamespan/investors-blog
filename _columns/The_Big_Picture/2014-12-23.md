Market Uptrend Resumes But Distribution Still An Issue
=======================================================

The S&P 500 closed at a new high Tuesday, which technically put the market back in an uptrend. But conditions remain difficult.


The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average extended their winning streaks to five sessions, but the Nasdaq couldn't keep up, weighed down by a burst of institutional selling in the biotech space.


The Dow hit a milestone, topping 18,000 for the first time. The blue-chip index rose 0.4%, buoyed by **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)); the S&P 500 added 0.2%, its second straight all-time closing high; but the Nasdaq eased 0.3%. NYSE and Nasdaq volume came in slightly below Monday's levels.


Breadth was pretty good on the NYSE, with advancing stocks beating decliners by nearly 2-to-1. Nasdaq breadth was flat. The IBD 50 lost 1%.


Even though major averages have resumed their uptrends, the distribution day count is still elevated in the market, which means the uptrend is still under pressure. The Nasdaq currently shows seven distribution days. Five of them have come in the month of December alone.


For growth investors, it remains a challenging market where risk arguably outweighs reward. Legitimate buy candidates remain in short supply. When one does arise, it's anyone's guess on how it will act. Some breakouts are working while plenty of others aren't, or are struggling to make progress.


Recent breakouts from the likes of **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), **Valeant** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) and **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), for example, have been sluggish at best.


Those looking for bona fide leadership Tuesday were left largely disappointed as the day's top-performing industry groups generally ranked near the bottom of IBD's 197 industry group rankings.


Biotech leaders like **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) closed below their 50-day lines Tuesday, plunging 6.5% and 5%, respectively, in heavy volume. **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) also had a tough day. It's still above its 50-day moving average but is firmly below a 347.85 buy point. Shares lost 5%. As a whole, the biotech group slumped 5%.


The only legitimate breakout came from **Walgreen** ([WAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAG)). Strong earnings fueled a heavy-volume breakout over a cup-with-handle buy point of 75.24.


**NetSuite** ([N](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=N))also broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 111.08 buy point, but it's been a low-volume breakout so far. Same with **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) which closed just above an 88.60 cup-with-handle buy point.


After a low-volume breakout over 62.34 Monday, **WageWorks** ([WAGE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAGE)) extended gains, rising 4% in above-average turnover. Its latest breakout was from a first-stage base despite a more than 600% gain since its May 2012 IPO at 9 a share.


Indexes opened higher on news that third-quarter gross domestic product was revised up more than expected, to 5% from a prior estimate of 3.9%. The final reading on Q3 GDP was the fastest quarterly growth since the summer of 2003, and followed a reading of 4.6% growth in Q2.


The U.S. dollar strengthened on the data and oil rallied $1.86, or 3.4%, to 57.12 a barrel.

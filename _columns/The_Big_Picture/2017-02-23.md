U.S. stock indexes were mixed Thursday, but that only masked some serious losses among top-rated stocks.


The Nasdaq fell 0.4%, while the S&P 500 inched up less than 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq's loss in rising volume qualified as [distribution](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), a sign of institutional selling. Also, a stalling day on Feb. 7 that had been provisional became added to the count with Thursday's distribution, making it five.


![mp_5nas_022317](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP_5nas_022317-184x300.png)The selling was ugly for many leading stocks.


China-based microblogging service provider **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) dived 16% in huge volume, stopping just above its 50-day moving average.


Fellow China-based stock and social network provider **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) slid 4.5% in heavy volume.


Chip designers **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) lost 9% and 3%, respectively, in heavy volume. Nvidia broke under its 50-day line, adding to its troubles.


Infrastructure plays **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)), **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) and **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) shed 6%, 3% and 5% respectively.


What drove the selling?


In the case of the infrastructure stocks, the selling might have been based on news. A report based on anonymous sources said [President Trump was ready to delay infrastructure projects until 2018](https://www.investors.com/news/steel-materials-mining-stocks-dive-as-trump-mulls-infrastructure-delay-to-2018/). Infrastructure projects have a long lead time between conception and implementation -- so any delay would be bad news for the related stocks.


However, the report could prove to be wrong, especially given Trump's unpredictable nature. The three materials stocks mentioned above have been falling since late January, so the sell-off Thursday was not out of line with the trend.


Two other factors could've been behind the selling.


First, after rising in nine of the previous 11 sessions, the Nasdaq was vulnerable to some profit-taking.


Second, Trump's meeting with corporate chief executives at the White House may have created some jitters. Trump sounded populist themes, slamming "unbelievably bad" trade deals.


While the stock market has regarded the Trump factor as a positive since the election, antipathy toward free trade is something many view as a negative.


For the day, the winners were iShares Gold Trust ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)), up 1%; and the Dow Jones utility average, also up 1%. On the downside, big losers were the Philadelphia semiconductor index, down 1.6%; and the small cap S&P 600, down 0.7%.

Is the current pullback in the stock market over? Judging by the way many key indexes finished on Monday, the answer isn't immediately clear.


The first 2-1/2 hours of action certainly felt bullish. But technical action turned bearish after lunch time on Wall Street.


Bolstered by technology stocks, along with a [keynote speech and other highly anticipated presentations at the CES technology trade show](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ces-2025-ai-robots-wearables-smart-glasses-rings/) in Las Vegas this week, the Nasdaq posted the best gains. Up 1.2% on Monday, the composite index briefly spent time above 20,000 before closing the day at 19,864.98.


The Nasdaq ended 2024 at 19,310, up 28.6% for the year. So, it's understandable to see the Nasdaq cool off with five straight down sessions from Dec. 26 through Jan. 2.




Stock Market Today
------------------


Since then, however, the Nasdaq has made a nice rebound off its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).



That's exactly what investors should look for in a confirmed stock market uptrend. That's especially true since over a rolling 25-session count, the Nasdaq has shouldered a high load of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


If the Nasdaq composite were to aim at a third year in a row of double-digit gains, then the first three trading sessions of 2025 mark a healthy start. The leading index of top-tier growth stocks has gained 2.9% year to date.

The S&P 500 showed decent action. While it closed more than 0.5% higher and reclaimed its 21-day exponential moving average on Monday, the large-cap index also closed considerably off session highs. At one point, the 500 traded at 6,021, up as much as 1.3%. Put another way, the index ended Monday in the lower half of the intraday range.


Investors generally like to see major equity averages finish in the upper half of their intraday ranges, not the lower half, especially during solid rallies.


Smaller issues had even a tougher time hanging on to their early advances. The Russell 2000 gained 1% intraday but ended the session up less than 2 points, or less than 0.1%. But the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average acted like small caps on Monday. The 30-stock index finished disappointingly lower, down 25 points, or less than 0.1%.


Nasdaq Vs. NYSE
---------------


The New York Stock Exchange composite, meanwhile, scratched out a tiny gain of 7 points, or less than 0.1%. The NYSE index finished beneath its 50-day moving average for a 16th straight session.



In the Dow industrials, tech and financial components as well as **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) performed well. As many as six components rose 1 point or more. But at least nine Dow stocks in fact declined one point or more. Plus, these losers included techs such as **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), bankers like **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and consumer-oriented stocks.


Overall, the message on Monday from the stock market seemed to be that some institutional investors and big money traders wanted to take advantage of the session's early gains to sell into strength and lock in gains.


Meanwhile, it's also worth noting that despite the large gains on an intraday basis, neither the Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 rallied strong enough to knock out any of their existing distribution days off the current count.


Let's consider the Nasdaq. Among the seven distribution days on the current count, it won't be until Jan. 15 until these sell-offs in heavier volume begin to expire due to time. Also, the Nasdaq would need to advance to at least 20,276 before the Dec. 31 distribution day falls on upward price progress.


Volume jumped nearly 35% vs. Friday's session on the NYSE to 4.94 billion shares and lifted 17% on the Nasdaq to 9.59 billion shares.

Industry Group Action
---------------------


A brief look at the stock market internals also suggested that Monday's rally was mixed.


On the Nasdaq, gainers exceeded decliners by a slim margin of nearly 11-to-10. But on the NYSE, losers actually topped gainers by close to a 4-3 margin.


Go to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com) and the homepage shows 295 stocks in the IBD database up on Monday in above-average turnover vs. 258 down in rapid trading. In other words, the bulls were only slightly more enthusiastic in their buying vs. the bears were in their selling.


On the downside, numerous defensive industries fell sharply. According to early data, they included meat products, down 2.4%, and tobacco, which was off 2%. Others included packaged food, losing 2%, and soap makers, which fell 1.9%.


On the upside, computer hardware, chip equipment, alternative energy, airline, home furnishings retail, internet content, telecom infrastructure and data storage stocks led. These groups and others rallied at least 2.5% on a price-weighted basis.


Will Stock Picking Get Rewarded This Year?
------------------------------------------


Adam Parker, president of New York-based Trivariate Research, notes the third quarter of 2024 turned out to be the second best three-month period for long stock ideas in the past 20 years. Specifically, 159 of the firms in the S&P 500 outperformed the market by more than 10 percentage points in that quarter.


Parker's team also discovered that the second and fourth quarters of last year created good opportunities for short selling. Why? Downside volatility among stocks spiked. For instance, in Q4 last year, 168 of the S&P 500 stocks lagged the market by more than 10 percentage points.


Will variance of returns among large caps keep a high pitch this year?


"We recommend long-only firms hire a 'blow-up avoidance' expert as part of their risk management," Parker wrote in a slide during a 2025 outlook webinar.


For investors who like to do a deep dive on the relationship between fundamentals and stock performance, Parker sees at least one change coming vs. recent years.


Trivariate Research discovered that since 2020, big winners have grown their gross margins year over year by an average of 5%. Quite a change from the 2010-2014 period, when big stock market losers actually posted more gross margin growth than big gainers within the large and mega-cap space.


Gross margins rise for a variety of reasons. Lower input costs, pricing power, and technology that makes manufacturing more efficient can each play a role.


Gross margin expansion has also mattered more in stocks that rank in the bottom half of the small and mid-cap stock universe in terms of "quality" fundamentals vs. the top half. But this year, Parker is advising clients to pay more attention to revenue acceleration.


For 2025, Parker and his team favor overweighting stock portfolios vs. the S&P 500 in the health care and industrial sectors while switching to underweight positions in consumer discretionary and communication services.


"I think we could have a more choppy first six months of 2025," he added.


Is This Move By Bitcoin Bullish For The Stock Market?
-----------------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, the strength in bitcoin and related stocks on Monday signaled that investor speculation is still healthy. Bitcoin still represents a fairly new sector within the overall economy. Bull markets thrive on themes of new sectors, new companies, and stocks making new highs.


According to Dow Jones Data, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index surged 4.1% to $102,258. The index has now rallied in five of the past six days. It also now hovers just 4% below the Dec. 17 peak of $106,734.



Related stocks had a great Monday. They included **MicroStrategy** ([MSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR)), which jumped more than 11%. The bitcoin investor is forming a new base and is building a cushion above its still-rising 50-day moving average.


**Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) powered back above both its 21-day exponential moving average and the 50-day moving average with a 6.3% gain in below-average trading on Monday. The stock holds an enviable 94 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) on a scale of 1 to 99.


On Monday, the Bitcoin spot price tracker, iShares Bitcoin Trust ([IBIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBIT)), has staged a very strong rally since breaking out of a nearly eight-month base with a standard entry at 41.99 and a slightly lower handle buy point at 41.96. The exchange traded fund on Monday rose 4% to 58.17, 38% above the 41.99 pivot.


Watching The Economy
--------------------


There continues to be concern among stock market observers that the incoming Trump administration could stoke more selling in U.S. government bonds, which would raise bond yields and possibly threaten the continued rise in U.S. stocks. A higher cost of money makes stock buybacks, dividends and corporate acquisitions harder to finance.


Could the stock market move on some key pieces of economic data later in the week?


Watch for Friday's monthly jobs report. [According to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar), economists believe 157,000 net new jobs were created last month, down sharply from 227,000 in November. They predict, on average, an unemployment rate of 4.2%, same as the prior month. Average hourly earnings are seen rising 0.3% vs. the prior month and up 4% vs. a year ago.


BNP Paribas wrote in a note to clients that it sees U.S. nonfarm payrolls hitting 165,000 in December and the jobless rate holding steady at 4.2%.


"We expect the Fed would require a clear miss in key dimensions to spur a rate cut this month (payroll growth well below 100K and a jobless rate above 4.3%) versus proceeding with the hold (in the fed funds rate) that is currently well priced in," BNP Paribas economists wrote.


Currently, the fed funds rate on overnight loans to bulge bracket Wall Street firms has fallen to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%, down 100 basis points from the 2023 peak of 5.25%-5.5%.


The stock market will close Thursday to honor the life of former President Jimmy Carter, who passed last week at the age of 100.

S&P 500's New High Nudges Stock Market Back To Uptrend
=======================================================

Stocks stepped ahead in flat volume Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve calmed the markets by doing essentially nothing.


The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The IBD 50 added 0.7%. Volume inched down on the Nasdaq and rose a sliver on the NYSE.


The S&P 500 struck a new high, which tipped the market to resume its uptrend. The uptrend had been under pressure, a yellow caution light of sorts. The new high turns on the green light, signaling friendlier conditions.


When the uptrend was under pressure, IBD-style investors probably raised some cash. The resumed uptrend creates an opportunity to redeploy cash into areas showing strength.


A number of top-rated stocks have either broken out in the past few days or found support at their 10-week moving average lines. Both are bullish signs.


Breakouts include rail operator **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)) on Tuesday, **Knight Transportation** ([KNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNX)) on Wednesday and **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)) from a three-weeks-tight pattern Thursday.


Stocks finding support at their 10-week line include **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)).


An additional plus is that all of the above stocks — with the exception of TAL — are in strong industry groups. Research shows that a strong industry group can provide a tailwind for a stock.


On Wednesday, Fed chief Janet Yellen quieted the buzz surrounding the timing of the first interest rate hike. She did so by keeping the language about "a considerable time" before a rate hike in the Fed's statement.


Wednesday afternoon's reaction was muted, and Thursday's follow-up reaction attracted only routine volume.


The overall response suggested that there was little behind the fuss except the fuss itself. This is a jittery market looking for reasons to justify its anxieties.


From another angle, Thursday's flat volume was natural, considering Friday's news lineup. Scotland votes on a referendum to become an independent country. China-based **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is expected to launch its initial public offering.


The provider of an online and mobile retail marketplace has a three-year earnings growth rate of 118% and 69% for revenue. However, IBD cautions against buying shares before a stock has formed an IPO base. The goal is to get a clear read on a stock before buying shares.


August housing starts and permits were weaker than expected. The Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing survey also missed views. However, first-time jobless claims were less than estimated.

Major indexes showed mixed action on Thursday, and this time it was the lagging one that took top honors.




The Dow Jones industrial average, helped by six of its 30 components rising one to four points each, led the entire session and rallied as much as 1.1%. It finished with a 0.5% gain. The S&P 500, hurt by weakness in defensive and commodity-oriented issues, slipped less than 0.1%. The large-cap benchmark was up as much as 0.3% early.


Calculation of the 30-stock Dow index is driven more by higher priced stocks, not by market cap like the Nasdaq composite. That said, **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) all advanced 1% or more. All three are in base-building mode.


The Nasdaq fell for a third day in a row on Thursday, losing 0.2%. Breadth was negative on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. But if you compared the Nasdaq's current slide with other losing streaks over the prior month and a half, you'd likely conclude that it's been the most pleasant decline of them all. The index, at 7481, remains up more than 8% since Jan. 1.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP031518-229x300.png)The S&P 500 is up just 2.8% year to date.


Volume was sharply higher on Tuesday as the tech-driven composite fell 1%, knocking the premier index with a third [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). But since then, turnover has shrunk dramatically the past two sessions.


A market drop in lower volume is always acceptable for the bulls. You want concrete evidence that the institutions are showing reluctance to sell.


Still, IBD readers should continue to monitor the health of the market via these five measures.


**1. How is the distribution-day count?** On the Nasdaq, the blood pressure of selling intensity among institutional investors is normal at three. On the S&P 500, it's elevated at six. However, the S&P 500 continues to fight against a deep decline and hold above the 50-day moving average. (See the line on the General Market Indicators link at the bottom of this story.)


The S&P 500 has an E Accumulation/Distribution rating, which reaffirms the selling that has slapped the index with six recent distribution days. The Nasdaq, through Wednesday's close, shows a slightly negative C-. (See the markets page via the PDF link on this page.)


**2. Are interest rates rising sharply?** Fortunately, not right now. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is currently near 2.82%. This means it's still lower than the earnings yield for the S&P 500. Based on this yardstick of valuation, equities are still attractively priced.


The probability of a quarter-point rate hike in the fed funds rate (the rate charged on overnight cash infusions to big banks) to a 1.5%-1.75% target range stands at more than 90% now, according to the CME Group's analysis of trading in fed funds rate futures, but this is no surprise.

It's still not clear whether the Fed will aim for four rate hikes instead of three. The Fed's policymaking committee's announcement with new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday will be closely watched, to say the least.


**3. Are the true market leaders acting strongly?** Definitely yes. **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **KLA Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **MKS Instruments** ([MKSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKSI)), **Maxim Integrated** ([MXIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXIM)) (frequently featured in The Income Investor) and numerous more companies in the software, internet and semiconductor fields are acting like market champions.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF rallied 0.4% on Thursday.


As the Market Pulse table shows, it was quite difficult to find leading stocks that declined in above-average turnover on Thursday.


**LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) would have made the list, but it's currently not a true leader as the homebuilder undergoes its deepest decline since the second half of 2016. Shares fell more than 2% and are having a tough time reclaiming the downward-sloping 50-day moving average.


In [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/), seven of the 11 current members fell with the market, but none in above-average turnover. **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), one of the 11 Leaderboard names, ramped up after hours on a [solid quarterly report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adobe-systems-beats-first-quarter-views-shares-rise-late/).


**4.** **Which industry groups are dropping like flies?** Most of the day's worst performing industry groups are definitely not leadership material currently: agricultural operations, oil transport, oil drilling, packaged food, generics, dairy products, pollution control and cement.


Among the 18 or so industry groups that sank 1.5% or more, only one comes from the [top 20](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/): the biotech group.


**5. Watch other key sectors.** The Dow transports edged up 0.2%, helped in part by trucking companies. (Please see the new breakout from small-cap play **Covenant Transport** ([CVTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVTI)).) The sector index, often treated as a barometer of the U.S. economy, cut its year-to-date loss to 0.2%.



Watch to see if the Dow transports can rally back above its key 50-day moving average.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index, or the SOX, edged slightly lower and holds a commanding 13.4% year-to-date gain.

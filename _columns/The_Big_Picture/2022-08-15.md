  Stock Market Shrugs Off Data As It Grinds Higher; These Key Retail Earnings Loom

The stock market rally showed resilience even as it took a well-earned breather Monday. Indexes battled back after coming under early pressure amid new data and managed to end marginally higher.




The Nasdaq composite once again fared best out of the major indexes. It finished just off highs for the day as it rose 0.6%. It is continuing to press higher after wiping out a good portion of its losses for the year, though it remains down more than 17% so far in 2022.


The S&P 500 reversed higher and held the bulk of its gains as it rose 0.4%. Investors should be on their guard in case of overhead supply as it gets ever closer to its downward-sloping [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


There was an extra reason to cheer as both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were able to wipe out a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) apiece under the 5% rule. Only one distribution day remains, and that is for the Nasdaq.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was also encouraging, with the clear majority closing in the green. Only energy and materials gave up ground. Consumer staples and utilities, defensive areas, made the best gains. But the growthy technology sector was just behind them.


Blue chips were also rising, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.5%. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) were the best performers here, both rising more than 2%.


Small caps edged higher, with the Russell 2000 enjoying a second session above its 200-day line after gaining 0.2%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) disappointed, though, lagging with a 0.4% loss.

Stock Market Shrugs Off Negative Data
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP081522-209x300.jpg)The stock market has been showing an increased ability to shake off negative news of late.


On Monday it emerged that the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Index had dipped to -31.3 in August from 11.1 in July. This was significantly worse than the decrease to 5 expected by analysts.


In addition, the National Association of Home Builders' monthly housing market index fell to 49 in August from 55 in July. This was also worse than expected.


The fact that the indexes continued to move higher even in the face of less-than-stellar news is encouraging.


Oil Stocks Slippery Amid China Worries
--------------------------------------


More negative data had dropped overnight, this time from China. Both consumer spending and factory data came in well shy of expectations. The economic giant's central bank also slashed interest rates.


This caused the price of oil to take a sharp dip. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude ended the day down 4.6% to just under $88 per barrel.


Energy groups were among the worst performers of the day. A slew of oil and gas areas lagged, including drillers and explorers. Agricultural chemicals stocks, which are related, also struggled.


[Leaderboard energy picks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) fared relatively well though. **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) ended the day down 0.7% and at the very top of its buy zone from a 150.10 entry. New Fortress Energy did even better, rising 0.8% to get further extended from its most [recent breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) of 52.47.


These Industries Shine
----------------------


It is also important to keep track of the best-performing industry groups.


On Monday, dairy products firms, mail-order retail plays, departments stores, cable equipment companies and internet content stocks were the best performers.


The strength in mail-order and department-store retailers comes just as some of the biggest beasts in the space are getting set to report earnings. Their results will no doubt impact the stock market. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) earnings are both on deck before the open Tuesday. **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), meanwhile, reports Wednesday.


Outside of their importance to stockholders, these earnings reports will also give key insight into the current health of the U.S. consumer. For the U.S., consumer spending accounts for about 70% of GDP, making it a vital gauge.

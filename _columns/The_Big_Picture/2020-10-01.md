Nasdaq Leads New Stock Market Rally; Beyond Meat, Datadog, Deckers Near Buy Points
===================================================================================

Trading on the major stock indexes ended with varying results Thursday, as the new stock market uptrend tried to extend itself. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced as much as 1.6% before trimming gains.




The Nasdaq outperformed with a 1.4% climb. The S&P 500 moved up 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 1.6%.


Leading growth stocks also outperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) moved up 1.7%. In the IBD 50, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) advanced 5.5% and 3.5%, respectively. Netflix is approaching a 557.49 entry in a double bottom, while AMD continues to rebound from its 50-day moving average.


Volume was slightly lower on the Nasdaq, and was indicated sharply lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Rally Continues
----------------------------


![MP100120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP100120-234x300.jpg)After [Wednesday's bullish action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gives-bullish-signal/), the stock market rally is back in a confirmed uptrend. But the trend-change day does come with caveats because the signal came on the Dow Jones index, rather than the much broader Nasdaq or S&P 500.


The Nasdaq showed more positive action Thursday, but lower volume removed some of the power from the trading session. Had the volume been higher than Wednesday, the Nasdaq would have staged a follow-through day of its own, giving investors more confidence in the nascent uptrend.


After the bullish signal on the Dow, investors are cleared to start buying new breakout stocks. For now, continue to keep purchases small and slowly build up exposure, as more and more top stocks break out. If this uptrend is real and meaningful, there will be plenty of time for new breakouts to emerge. Many stocks are now near buy zones.


The best candidates are those that held up the best during the recent stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with [strong relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). These ideas could become stock market leaders.

Breakout Stocks: Beyond Meat, Datadog, Deckers
----------------------------------------------


IPO stock **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND))Â continues to try to break out above a cup base's 167.26 buy point, according to a [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares rallied 2.7% Thursday to retake the entry.


Beyond Meat [was featured](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stocks-to-watch-beyond-meat-stock-servicenow-veeva-systems-qualcomm/) in this week's [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/) column. It was added to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) list on Tuesday's breakout attempt.


Software leader **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) broke out above a 99.09 buy point Wednesday on the [company's partnership with Microsoft](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/datadog-stock-surges-cloud-partnership-microsoft-azure/). Shares rallied another 1.3% Thursday and are at the top of the buy range. The buy zone tops out at 104.04.


**Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) broke out past a 223.34 buy point of a cup with handle with a 7.2% advance, ending slightly out of the 5% buy zone, which goes up to 234.51. The base is first stage, which means the stock has more upside potential than a later-stage formation.

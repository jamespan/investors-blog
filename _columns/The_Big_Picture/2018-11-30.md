Bulls Find Confidence In Strongest Weekly Gains Of The Year
============================================================

Bulls stepped up their buying in two of five sessions the past week, changing the stock market's condition to confirmed uptrend.




For the week, the Nasdaq gained 5.6%; the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average, 5.2%; the large-cap S&P 500, 4.8%; and the small-cap S&P 600, 2.7%.


The percentage weekly gains on the three major indexes (excluding the S&P 600) were the biggest so far this year. Monday and Wednesday were the best days. In each of the week's four gains, indexes closed at or near session highs, a positive sign.


On Friday, the indexes initially slipped but then rebounded nicely. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones each gained 0.8%. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and was indicated higher on the NYSE.


News Defines Stock Market's Condition
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MP113018-294x300.jpg)News dominated the stock market in November, which isn't ideal. The Street prefers rallies based on earnings and outlooks, or just plain institutional buying.


That's not what has been happening.


A follow-through day Nov. 7 came after the midterm elections. A follow-through day Wednesday came with Fed chair Jerome Powell's dovish speech.


Now the market appears focused on the U.S.-China trade talks.


If President Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping reach an agreement, the next question will be if it is convincing to Wall Street.


Last week the South China Morning Post reported that Lawrence Lau, a scholar and former member of China's top advisory body, predicts a framework agreement will be reached. A framework agreement would leave the details for later.


China is known for talking a good game on free trade but rarely delivering on the promises.


Sparse Breakouts
----------------


Meanwhile, breakouts during the week were sparse.


The best-looking weekly moves came from **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)), up 15% as it cleared a 112.98 buy point; **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), up 21% as it crossed above a 157.22 entry; and virtualization software provider **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)), up 9% while surpassing a 161.50 buy point.


VMware's base is a double bottom with handle.


Other stocks breaking out included **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), which climbed above a choppy consolidation that began in mid-January; and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), which closed at its 22.33 buy point.

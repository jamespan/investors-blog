The Nasdaq composite scored a small victory Wednesday by holding above Monday's low, but a 3% decline in higher volume resulted in another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the index and put the stock market in a correction.




**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) fell hard after the company's Battery Day left Wall Street wanting more, while [FAANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) ended with losses of more than 4%. **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), Apple and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were among the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 1.9%


The S&P 500 lost 2.4% in higher volume and also marked a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). The Russell 2000 small-cap index fell 3% and pierced its 200-day moving average. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped almost 2.7%.


With the stock market in a correction, the distribution day count is no longer shown in the Market Pulse.


Declining stocks swamped advancers on the Nasdaq by nearly 6-to-1, but waning breadth has been an issue on the Nasdaq for some time now. When the Nasdaq was hitting new highs in late August, the advance/decline was flattening out. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.7% Tuesday but declining stocks were about equal with advancers.


Bullish Sentiment Falls Again
-----------------------------


The bulls got some good news from the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers. Bullish newsletter writers dropped to 51.5% from 54.8% the prior week and 59 the week before that. The bulls hit 61.5% on Sept. 1, just before the major stock indexes started to pull back. The [Sept. 4 Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-sell-off-creates-first-bearish-outlook-since-april-2-follow-through-day/) noted an initial downgrade in the current outlook for stocks.

The survey is a contrarian indicator because excessive bullishness has been seen near market tops in the past with excessive bearishness near market lows. Bearish newsletter writers rose to 19.4%, the highest level since a 19.8% reading in late June.


The put/call volume ratio came in at 0.75 Wednesday, still well below the 1.15 level which indicates excessive fear. Investors tend to be the most fearful near market bottoms.


Stock Market Technicals
-----------------------


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 still face a major technical hurdle as both indexes sit below their 50-day moving averages. A move above the 50-day line with volume for both indexes would strengthen their technical pictures. But the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have additional resistance levels to conquer after that. The Nasdaq still needs to get over its Sept. 10 intraday high, and the S&P 500 needs to clear its Sept. 16 intraday high.


The U.S. dollar strengthened again, fueling a sell-off in gold stocks. **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) lost ground for the seventh straight session. It had been forming a [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) while holding support at its 50-day moving average, but support gave way on Monday. Those who bought at a recent [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 44.33 should be out of the stock by now.


Other top-rated gold stocks have come under selling pressure, including **Wheaton Precious Metals** ([WPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WPM)), **Franco-Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)), **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)), **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) and **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)).


What To Do Now
--------------


Market conditions have gotten choppy. And choppy markets aren't very friendly to growth investors. If you've been buying stocks in recent days, you know how hard it is to make headway.

It pays to have an edge when investing — whether it's recognizing a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) after a stock market correction, or buying base breakouts in the early stages of a confirmed uptrend.


But there's no edge at this point now that the stock market is in a correction. So it's a good idea to keep your powder mostly dry and watch from the sidelines.


Now is the time to start building a watchlist of stocks that have been generally immune to the selling. In the retail sector, **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) are showing great price action after recent breakouts. In the enterprise software group, Salesforce, **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) and **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) are holding up relatively well.


Solar Stocks Shine
------------------


Solar stocks outperformed, helped by a strong earnings report from **JinkoSolar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)).



The stock broke out over a 24.01 [handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) Friday and hasn't looked back. Shares soared Wednesday to a new high, rising 21% to 33.46.

**Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)), **Canadian Solar** ([CSIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSIQ)) and **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) are other top-rated solar stocks with strong charts.


**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) also delivered a powerful breakout after finding support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/). Twitter surged past a 44.19 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), helped by a Pivotal Research upgrade to buy from hold and a 59.75 price target. TWTR stock closed at 45.33, up 6.1%.


IPO **GoodRx** ([GDRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDRX)) was another rare bright spot Wednesday, up 53% to 50.50. The company operates a prescription drug price comparison platform. It priced Tuesday night at 33, above the proposed range of 24 to 28.

  Stock Market Rallies On Hot Nvidia Earnings; Why There's Reason For Caution

All eyes were focused on **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) earnings late Wednesday. And the artificial intelligence juggernaut didn't disappoint. The hot earnings report sparked a broad stock market rally Thursday, as Nvidia stock skyrocketed to record highs.




Meanwhile, stock market leaders **Birkenstock** ([BIRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIRK)), **SharkNinja** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)), **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) and **Weatherford** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)) are breaking out past their latest buy points.


Jobless Claims, Nvidia Earnings
-------------------------------


Ahead of Thursday's stock market open, the Labor Department's initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell to 201,000. That gives no indication of a softening labor market. They were expected to rise to 216,000 vs. 212,000 in the previous week.


In response, the 10-year Treasury yield held steady at 4.32%, remaining at its highest level since early December.


Nvidia soared more than 16% after the [company beat Wall Street's targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-rises-on-q4-beat-and-raise/) for its fiscal fourth quarter and guided higher than views for the current period. Shares hit record highs, more than 50% above a flat base's 505.48 flat-base entry. Nvidia, an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock, added $276.65 billion in market cap — a record one-day increase, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Gains were moderately broad, with advancers topping decliners by a 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq. About 150 of 197 industry groups closed higher, as utilities, food, beverage and other defensive groups were among the weakest.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2%, while the S&P 500 moved up 2.1%. Both indexes hit new highs, while the Dow Jones industrials closed above 39,000 for the first time ever. It took the Dow only 22 sessions to rise from 38,000. That's the shortest time between 1,000-point milestones since the 33,000-to-34,000 jump.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced 3%, closing above the 16,000 level for the first time and ending just shy of a fresh all-time high. And the small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1%.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP-021924-216x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That's a bullish sign of institutional participation. Further, the S&P 500 lost its Jan. 22 and Jan. 31 [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) due to gains. When an index rallies 5% from the closing price of the distribution day, it is no longer considered relevant to the current action.


In the Dow Jones industrials, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were among the biggest advancers, with gains of 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively.


On the Dow Jones' downside, **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) declined 0.8%. The stock is being replaced by **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) in the Dow 30 Monday.


And top growth stocks climbed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) jumped 4.5% to snap a three-day losing streak. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) rebounded 6.3% Thursday, successfully testing support at its 50-day line after a sharp drop.

What To Do Now
--------------


After Thursday's powerful gains, the major stock indexes and top growth stocks are once again getting extended. So investors should be hesitant to add much exposure at these levels, especially in AI stocks. Despite Thursday's bullish action, IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60%-80%. The overall outlook remains "confirmed uptrend."


Still, there's nothing that should keep investors from looking for new breakouts or strong rebounds from key support levels if you need to raise some exposure, or replace stocks in which you've taken profits. It's just that indexes are stretched to a point where investors shouldn't be buying heavily.


[IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list showed four stocks Thursday**,** including **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)). Shares are breaking out past a 219.17 cup-base entry.


The MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows only a handful of stocks nearing buy points in bases. For example, **AvidXchange** ([AVDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVDX)) is approaching a cup with handle's 12.63 entry.

Stock Market Leaders: Birkenstock, SharkNinja, Toll Brothers

Meanwhile, market leaders Birkenstock, Weatherford, SharkNinja and Toll Brothers are near buy points, but their action varied.


Birkenstock reversed from big gains Thursday, closing with a 1.2% drop. Shares broke out past a choppy cup with handle's 51.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/), but are now below the entry, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).

Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/sharkninja-swims-in-a-buy-zone-after-108-rally/), SharkNinja, is trying to break out past a flat base's 53.40 buy point but also closed below the entry. The buy zone runs up to 56.07.


Homebuilder Toll Brothers staged a breakaway gap Wednesday past a flat base after strong earnings results and a raised outlook.


Key earnings movers Thursday included **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Lucid Motors** ([LCID](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCID)), **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) and **Rivian** ([RIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIVN)).


Etsy shares tumbled more than 8%, falling back below the 50-day line. Electric-vehicle stocks Lucid and Rivian plunged 16% and 25%, respectively. Planet Fitness shares slid more than 5%, falling further below the 50-day line and closing below the 200-day average.

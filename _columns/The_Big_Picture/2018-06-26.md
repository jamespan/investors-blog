Stocks Bounce Modestly But Hold At Key Levels; 3 Rules For A Weaker Market
===========================================================================

Stocks made a modest rebound Tuesday, making up precious little from Monday's rout. But while the ceiling seemed limited, the floor looked firmer.




That's because the three major indexes defended key technical levels on their charts. That gave market bulls some hope after a day that changed the market's complexion for the worse.


The Nasdaq composite, which rose 0.4%, held at the 7500 price level. The Nasdaq pierced that round number during the worst of Monday's sell-off. The composite closed at 7561 Tuesday, or 3% below its prior high.


At 7500, the Nasdaq has met its match a few times this year. The index met resistance around there in January, March and finally made a serious move above it this month — until Monday's shelling.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MP062618-265x300.jpg)The S&P 500 rose 0.2% Tuesday and held at the 50-day moving average. The index penetrated the 50-day line Monday for the first time since early May. The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.1% and held at the long-term 200-day moving average. The Dow remains below the 50-day average, which is about 2% above the 200-day.


With June's gains in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 nearly wiped out in a single day and the Dow now lower for the month, the market needs to restart its advance. Tuesday's gains were a start, although not a confident first step.


Indexes closed off session highs, indicating some buyers' reluctance. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. If volume is a measurement of investor enthusiasm, it was lacking Tuesday.


Many leading stocks bounced also, but most weren't impressive.


In the IBD 50, China-based **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) (highlighted in [today's Sector Leaders column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/when-to-buy-chinese-growth-stocks-time-to-buy-baozun-again/)) and **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)) made good gains from pullbacks to the 50-day moving average, but volume lagged. Technology leaders **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) are seeking support.


**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), still in IBD Leaderboard, climbed back above the 100 price. Impressively, the stock was about flat Monday while the rest of the market imploded.


With 11 components up 2% or more, the IBD 50 index rallied 1%, easily beating the main indexes. Often, it is the top stocks that start the market's rebound, and indexes catch up later.

Other leaders managed only lackluster gains. **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) closed still below their 50-day lines in wimpish gains. Wall Street will need a lot more Baozun-like rebounds to get back on track.


Small caps also were relatively stronger. The Russell 2000 climbed 0.7%, and closed nearer to a new high than other indexes.


3 Rules For Current Market
--------------------------


Monday's intense selling led to IBD downgrading its market outlook to "market under pressure." That means there's higher risk in stocks, and investors have to adjust. Selling any stock that [falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) is a must. It's OK to be less patient with stocks that are weakening. Also important, be more judicious with any stock purchase. Those three rules should keep investors afloat during a clunky market.


The energy sector led Tuesday, after the price of oil shot up more than 3%, [closing above $70 a barrel](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/oil-surges-after-state-dept-orders-buyers-to-cut-iranian-imports.html). It touched the [highest price since May 24](http://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/delayed-quotes/energy.html). The U.S. government is cutting all oil imports from Iran to zero, adding to supply constraints. Among the 197 industry groups, 13 of the top 20 were oil and gas.


Homebuilders and building-related industry groups also performed well. **Lennar**'s ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) slumping shares jumped after the Florida-based [homebuilder beat profit expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stock-lennar-soars-demolishing-earnings/). Its report helped soothe worries over rising interest rates and operating costs.

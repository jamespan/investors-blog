Stock Market Rallies Powerfully, Makes Case For A Bottom; Apple Soars On Earnings; Vertex Clears Buy Point

Major stock indexes closed out the week with bullish gains Friday, a welcome development for stock market bulls after a rough week.




The Nasdaq composite surged 3.1% and closed just above Thursday's high. But the powerful gain fell short of a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) because Nasdaq volume came in lower than Thursday. Breadth wasn't great on the Nasdaq, with winners beating losers by less than 2-to-1.


With growth stocks in the technology sector not showing anything in the way of leadership, and good bases few and far between, a follow-through day would've been tough to trust. The Nasdaq still needs to retake the 14,000 level after getting turned away at that round number Wednesday.


Beaten-down technology stocks did the heavy lifting Friday, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) up 4.4%. Energy and materials stocks lagged.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Sentiment was positive in the tech sector after **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reported solid earnings late Thursday. AAPL stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average, soaring 7% in strong volume.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP012822-235x300.jpg)The S&P 500 jumped 2.4%, its best percentage gain since early June 2020, but closed just below its 200-day line. The index was boosted by strong performances from **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), which reported earnings.


S&P 500 component **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) when it surged past a 234.68 handle buy point. An early gain faded for Vertex Thursday despite another quarter of solid bottom- and top-line growth. But Friday, it closed at session highs.


Breadth was a little better on the NYSE, with advancers beating decliners by close to 3-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.7% despite earnings sell-offs for **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), down 5.2%, and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), down 3.5%.


Small caps, which had been lagging badly for a good part of the session, eventually found their footing. The Russell 2000 gained 1.9%.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 1.6%, helped by strength in shipping stocks like **Global Ship Lease** ([GSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSL)), **Zim Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) and **Matson** ([MATX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MATX)). Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)) soared out of a cup base with a 89.51 buy point.


Fear Gauges
-----------


Excessive fear has been seen at several market bottoms in the past, and popular fear gauges like the put/call volume ratio and the Cboe Volatility Index have shown some fear recently. But perhaps it's not excessive fear.


The put/call volume ratio spiked to 1.08 exactly one week ago (Jan. 21) and hit 1.04 on Jan. 24. The Cboe Volatility Index hit a high of 38.94 on Jan. 24, the highest since late October 2020. It's a fearful market, but both indicators are not at extreme levels seen at the March 2020 market low.


The stock market liked the look of December personal income and spending data released before the open. Futures were down close to 1% ahead of the data but quickly turned flat on news that the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.4%. But that was below November's reading of 0.6%. Year over year, the PCE price index was up 4.8%, in line with views.

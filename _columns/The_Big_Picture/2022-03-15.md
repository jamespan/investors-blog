Stock Market Rallies As Oil Prices Continue To Fall; These Sectors Start To Rotate Away
========================================================================================

For only the third time this month, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite registered a gain, keeping a flicker of hope for a troubled stock market.




To be sure, Tuesday's gains were impressive. But, as we learned only days ago, big gains don't necessarily signal [true market uptrends](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). Tuesday's index gains were the largest since March 9, which only took the market lower.


The S&P 500 on Tuesday roared with a 2.1% gain. Despite closing below 4200 twice in the past two weeks, that level is still the index's best chance at etching a low so far this year. The S&P 500 found buyers each time it dipped below 4200.


The Nasdaq jumped 2.9%. Monday's close at 12,581 marked the lowest since Dec. 14, 2020. That's nearly two years of Nasdaq capital gains that have disappeared in less than three months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP031522--232x300.jpg)Against that backdrop, indexes rallied into the close Tuesday in a broad advance that saw only the energy sector decline. But volume fell more than 7% on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and roughly 3% on the NYSE.


With the energy sector coming off its 2022 rally, the stock market is now getting some sector rotation.


Energy, Shipping, Mining Rotating Away
--------------------------------------


Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) gapped down to a loss of 3.7% Tuesday and is off 10.5% from last week's peak. Seven of the 10 worst-performing industry groups Tuesday were oil related.


Some of the cyclical and mining stocks that rallied with energy also are cooling off. Fertilizers, chemicals and agricultural groups fell around 1%.


Most shipping stocks, which had sprouted into a nice pocket of strength, sold off. Dry-bulk shippers fared poorest in this group. **Navios Maritime Partners** ([NMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMM)) slid below its 33.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). **Eagle Bulk Shipping** ([EGLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGLE)) lost nearly 10% in heavy volume.



**Matson** ([MATX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MATX)), which serves ocean shipping lines across the Pacific, fell 1.2% in active trading. But container cargo company **Zim Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) climbed to a new high in heavy trading.

Mining stocks also have been sliding since Monday. IBD's metal ores mining group is down more than 6% since Monday's open. **BHP Group** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) fell nearly 7% below its 67.94 buy point. **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)) is off nearly 10% so far this week. **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) has lost about 20%.


Industries that are moving up include airlines (happy to see fuel costs drop) and travel groups. Some health care stocks also are firming up. **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) rose 2.4% Tuesday and is forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/).


Payment cards, dairy products, auto parts, discount retail and managed care — i.e., a lot of consumer stocks — are picking up the slack.


Stock Market Likes Lower Oil
----------------------------


The stock market appeared to be relieved after the price of crude oil continued to retreat. Nymex crude for April delivery slid 6.4% to $96.44 a barrel. Crude is now down 11.8% over the last two sessions. Brent crude fell 6.5% to $99.91 a barrel.



The February producer price index also delivered some price moderation. Wholesale inflation climbed 10% in February from a year ago and 0.8% from the previous month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. February's PPI slowed from a revised 1.2% increase in January.


The year-over-year increase matched [the consensus Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), while the monthly increase from January was a bit less than the 1% economists expected. Excluding food and energy items, the index rose 8.4% from a year ago and 0.7% from January. Strip out trade services as well, and the PPI data sharply missed year-over-year views.


Finally, in a frontal assault on inflation, the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter point when it concludes its policy meeting Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a 52-week high Tuesday, to 2.16%.


But what will come next?


Lindsey Bell, Ally's chief markets strategist, said in a commentary that the amount of uncertainty with regards to the path forward remains high. "The market is split on the size of the move the Fed will make at the May meeting."


The Fed is entering the tightening cycle cautiously, knowing there could be economic downside from the Russia-Ukraine war, Bell added. Still, inflation is still expected to be the key driver of future Fed action.


Six More Rate Hikes?
--------------------


John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, said the fed funds futures market projects cumulative rate hikes of 165 basis points, which would amount to six to seven hikes of 25 basis points each. Lynch also notes the Fed hasn't presented clear plans on how it plans to shrink its balance sheet.


China's stock market remains deeply troubled. The Shanghai Composite plunged 5% Tuesday in the largest single-day drop and largest two-day decline (7.4%) since February 2020. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index plummeted 5.7% in the biggest decline since July 8, 2015. A three-day rout of nearly 12% is the biggest since October 2008.


China is dealing with a [surge in Covid-19 cases](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-covid-19-cases-more-than-double-as-outbreak-spreads-11647336996?mod=hp_lead_pos7), and authorities are imposing travel restrictions and otherwise limiting the movement of residents. [Other worries hitting Chinese stocks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-today-51647336733?refsec=asia) include further regulations on China's tech sector, possible Chinese military aid to Russia, and continued distress in the property sector.


Yet Chinese ETFs reversed higher. The KraneShares China Internet ETF ([KWEB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KWEB)) rose 4.7%. The IShares China Large-Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) pared a loss of more than 2% to 0.2%.

Major indexes trimmed opening gains but ended on positive ground ahead of the Fed minutes and inflation data due this week. The stock market got a boost after President-elect Donald Trump nominated hedge fund investor Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) lost ground for the second continuous day and fell below a buy point. The stock is now testing the 10-week moving average. But while the largest stock in the U.S. sputtered, multiple other stocks [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past buy points.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1% to a record closing high. The S&P 500 has made up all losses from its Nov. 15 tumble, when it gapped down 1.3%.


On Monday, the S&P rose 0.3% but ended in the lower half of its day's trading range while volume climbed. That combination of factors made it a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) for the index, a type of distribution.


Among S&P 500 stocks, **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) and **Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) were the best performers, while **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) and **GE Vernova** ([GEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEV)) declined the most.


With a gain of 0.3%, the Nasdaq has erased most of its 2.2% fall on Nov. 15. Both indexes continued to get support from the 21-day exponential moving average.


Volume also rose on the Nasdaq. Advancers beat decliners by nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by more than 2-1 on the Nasdaq.


Stock Market: Yields Dive On Treasury Pick
------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP112524-218x300.jpg)Many Wall Street figures [applauded Bessent's nomination](https://www.wsj.com/politics/how-scott-bessent-won-the-knife-fight-to-be-trumps-treasury-secretary-a0e5ce33?mod=article_inline) to the Treasury post. The hedge fund manager is considered someone capable of carrying out Trump's economic agenda and who can help reduce the federal deficit.


Homebuilders and small-cap stocks particularly benefited as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid 15 basis points to 4.26% — the largest one-day drop since Aug. 2, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


**Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) broke out of a flat base with a 6.5% gain in heavy volume. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20the%20relative%20strength,with%20the%20Relative%20Strength%20Rating.) is also at a new high. The building industry group was one of the top 20 groups in IBD's 197-industry ranking.


**Taylor Morrison** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) added 5% and cleared a buy point of 71.95. The homebuilder was the latest addition to Investor's Business Daily's model portfolio, [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/?).



The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1.5% and made its highest close in three years. It's now inches away from taking out the all-time high of 2,458.86 set in November 2021.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.8% and is extended from a cup base's buy point of 29.15.


Minutes of the Fed's November policy meeting are due Tuesday at 2 p.m. ET.


On Wednesday, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, will be released. [Economists expect](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/?) a 0.2% monthly increase in the October PCE and a 2.3% rise on an annual basis. Core inflation is expected to rise 0.3% for the month and 2.8% for the 12 month period.


Stock Market Sees Multiple Breakouts
------------------------------------



**Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)), which cleared a flat base at a buy point of 392.57, was among Monday's breakouts. The stock was also the second-highest point contributor to the Dow, while Nvidia cost the index more than 36 points. The Dow added 440 points Monday.


Although oil and gas stocks lagged, offshore energy stock **Oceaneering** ([OII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OII)) rose and attempted a breakout at an alternative [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 30.45 before pulling back. Oceaneering cleared a handle entry at 29.22 earlier.


Other notable breakouts included **Ceco Environmental** ([CECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CECO)), which rallied past a 31.55 buy point amid a nine-day winning streak. The stock also has a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20the%20relative%20strength,with%20the%20Relative%20Strength%20Rating.) at a new high. In building products, **Azek** ([AZEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZEK)) gapped past a 50.78 buy point.


Insurance provider **Fidelity National Financial** ([FNF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNF)) rose into a buy zone from a 62.97 buy point.


Big Movers In Stock Market
--------------------------


In earnings, **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) soared into a profit zone from a cup-with-handle base's [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 72.36. Third quarter results after the market close showed that sales rose 3.6% to $1.2 billion, in line with estimates, while earnings of $1.38 per share rose 7%, beating views. The stock was little changed in extended trading.


But biotech **Cassava** ([SAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVA)) [cratered to a four-year low](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cassava-sciences-stock-sava-stock-alzheimers-treatment-phase-3-simufilam/) after a Phase 3 test for its drug to treat mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's failed trials.


**Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) pared early gains and was almost unchanged headed into its earnings report Tuesday. Also on earnings watch, **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) fell over 2% while **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) fell 0.6%. **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) was unchanged. All three will report on Tuesday as well.


Retail earnings also continue this week. **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) rose past a buy zone from a cup-with-handle buy point of 279.51 and will report on Tuesday. Retail stocks did well on the stock market today with four retail industry groups among the top of the 197 industry groups.

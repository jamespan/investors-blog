A late round of selling spoiled what was looking to be a strong comeback for the stock market Tuesday, highlighting the fragile state of affairs. The S&P 500 slumped 1.4%, while the Nasdaq lost a mild 0.4%. Gains in Internet, biotech and software stocks cushioned the tech-heavy index's fall. Both indexes ended at their intraday lows and extended their losing streaks to six sessions. The S&P 500 ended a hair above Monday's low.

  

At Tuesday's highs, the Nasdaq and benchmark S&P index rallied as much as 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 1.3%, with 28 of its components ending lower. Tuesday marked another volatile day for the blue-chip index, which saw a swing of more than 600 points. The Russell 2000 fell 0.7% to a 10-month low; the IBD 50 lost 0.6%.

  

Stocks bolted out of the gate amid news of more stimulus out of China (see related story [here](http://news.investors.com/economy/082515-768110-pboc-eases-as-markets-reel-but-priorities-conflict.htm)), but they faded badly in the final hour. A strong start and a poor finish is a key trait of a weak market.

  

Volume dropped off sharply on both major exchanges from the blistering pace in Monday's ultra-wild session. The Nasdaq saw its busiest session in four years Monday.

  

Losers beat winners by 9 to 7 on the NYSE, while decliners barely edged winners on the Nasdaq.

  

After major sell-offs, many times stocks stage rebounds. Sam Stovall, managing director of U.S. Equity strategy at S&P Capital IQ, noted in a blog post Tuesday that since 1945, the S&P 500 rose an average of 1.6% in the week after a drop of more than 4%. This has occurred about 66% of the time.

  

While a bounce is likely, avoid getting back into the market until a follow-through day takes place. A follow-through signal involves a big gain in the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 in higher volume. This signal will tell you when the tide has likely turned.

  

Unlike the smaller pullbacks of this year, this month's damage to the stock market isn't just a small abrasion, but a deep cut that will take time to heal. So far, the Nasdaq has corrected nearly 18% from its July 20 multiyear high. That's the biggest since a 20% correction from its May 2011 peak. Even with weakness in energy and commodity stocks, the S&P 500 has pulled back a smaller 12.5% from the May 20 record high. This is the largest decline since a nearly 22% downturn from its May 2011 high.

  

What is important now for investors is managing holdings. This is the time to be defensive. Sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your buy point. This is IBD's golden rule. A 7% or 8% loss is the most that you should take.

  

Also get rid of any holding that's threatening to erase a double-digit gain. Leaders such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) round-tripped recently. Seeing a double-digit gain get away is bad enough; letting it turn into a loss is even worse.

  

Market corrections can be brutal, but the good thing is that this is the time when bases are formed.

  

A correction is also a good time for investors to work on their watch lists.

Stock Indexes Post More Gains, But Correction Remains Intact
=============================================================

Stocks advanced Friday, but the gains came in declining volume.


The Nasdaq added 1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively.


The IBD 50 checked in with a 1.4% pop.


Volume fell across the board.


The gains in the indexes were primarily the result of a strong start. The Nasdaq was up 1.9% at midday and then gave back a chunk of the advance as it met resistance near the 200-day moving average.


Bulls would've preferred a strong close, but sustained gains in the indexes haven't yet developed. Four of the week's sessions involved sell-offs in the late afternoon.


Strong gains that fade are typical in a market correction, and individual investors should respect that reality.


With the market in correction, cash remains not only the investor's best bet but also a key to keeping a positive attitude.


There is nothing worse for an investor's psyche than holding stocks as they grind further south, or buying stocks that immediately roll over. Often investors who suffer sustained hits are incapable of acting when the market does turn.


A follow-through day can develop when few investors emotionally believe the bullish case. And that is the advantage of heeding an emotion-free signal like a follow-through .


The follow-through involves a significant gain in a major index in volume up from the previous day.


When that occurs, the individual investor should test the rally by buying a breakout stock and seeing how it works. Either the market will reward the buy or it will push the investor back to the sidelines.


Investors looking for reasons to hope haven't found much evidence lately.


Previously reliable bottom gauges haven't been working too well. For example, the put-call ratio closed above 1.0 a dozen times in the past 17 sessions. But it still isn't clear that the market has established a firm low.


Still, a technical bright spot developed in Friday's market — the new highs and new lows tally.


Day after day, combined new highs (NYSE plus Nasdaq) have been scarce while combined new lows consistently hit triple digits. On Friday, new lows dropped to 52 — below 100 for the first time in five weeks.


Admittedly, that isn't much to cheer about. New highs remain at pathetic levels. However, the drop in new lows at least suggests the selling might be approaching exhaustion.


Ultimately, the surest cure for a declining stock market is a declining stock market. At some point, valuations will look attractive to the value-investing camp. And while IBD-type investors aren't value investors, everyone can agree that the first fellow to raise his head out of the trenches without drawing fire provides a useful service to those waiting for the all-clear signal.


You just don't want to be that fellow.


Just because it's correcting, don't ignore the market.


For the week, the small-cap S&P 600 grabbed the lead with a 2.3% gain, while the IBD 50 rose 1%. The Dow and the S&P 500 lost 1% each, and the Nasdaq eased 0.4%.


The coming week will be busy with Q3 earnings reports, including **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) on Monday; **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), Tuesday; **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), Wednesday; **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), Thursday; and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), Friday.

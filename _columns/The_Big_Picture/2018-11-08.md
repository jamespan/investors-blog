Stock indexes kept their cool Thursday, trading in a narrow range as they chalked up an inside day.




An inside day is when trade stays under the high and above the low of the previous session. The contained action points to either indecision or nonchalance.


In Thursday's case, the inside day communicated calm. Coming after Wednesday's big gains, bulls could regard it as a confident refusal to give back much.

At first glance, the loss on the Nasdaq might look worrisome.


Volume in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/), though, sagged on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Lower volume on the decline suggested institutions were in no rush to sell. Another positive sign was that the S&P 500 closed in the upper 40% of its daily price range.


Fed Offers Nothing New
----------------------


The stock market's drift downward sharpened after the Federal Reserve wrapped up its two-day meeting at 2 p.m. ET and released its statement. As expected, [interest rates were kept the same](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-hike-fears-dow-jones-today/) — a target range of 2% to 2.25%.


Little changed in the Fed's statement vs. the September statement. The Street still expects a rate hike in December and then three additional increases in 2019.


Two Factors In Uptrend
----------------------


On Wednesday, IBD's [market outlook shifted from correction to confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-soars-midterm-election-results/).


Two factors — in addition to the follow-through day — appear to be shifting to the bulls' favor.


First, new highs outnumbered new lows Wednesday, 140 to 97. That hadn't happened in five weeks.


New highs were running about even with new lows Thursday, according to incomplete data.


Second, quality stocks are breaking out, a crucial ingredient for stock market uptrends.


Breakouts
---------


Breakouts Thursday included shoe maker **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), up 30%; online travel site **TripAdvisor** ([TRIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRIP)), up 15%; payment software provider **ACI Worldwide** ([ACIW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIW)), up 10%; **Wright Medical Group** ([WMGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMGI)), up 8%; prepaid debit card provider **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)), up 8%; online homemade goods retailer **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), up 7%; infrastructure play **Tetra Tech** ([TTEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTEK)), up 5%; specialty retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), up 5%; and **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), up 3%.



Watch for more breakouts in the days ahead. Stocks that lead an uptrend often emerge fairly soon after a follow-through day, if not the same day.


The best approach to a new follow-through is to start with half-sized purchases of top stocks breaking out. If the stock appears to be working, complete the purchase. If it starts to fail, sell.


IBD-style investors also should watch for distribution. Selling in rising volume would be a bad sign, especially if it occurs soon in a new uptrend.

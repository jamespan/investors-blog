Bifurcation in the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) continued for another day. Major equity indexes fell sharply in lighter turnover, trimming some of their early losses. Tech firms struggled again. But oil stocks reaffirmed their leadership on Wall Street.




The accompanying Market Pulse offers examples of how institutional investors are targeting the beneficiaries of inflationary times today.


The reversal off morning lows on Tuesday did not match the scale of Monday's breathtaking rebound. That may reflect a stance among equity trading desks across the land to wait and see what the Federal Reserve will say and do about inflation, which [hit 7% at the consumer-prices level in December](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-new-39-year-high-december-dow-jones/).


While the Nasdaq slumped 2.3% to close at 13,539 on Tuesday, 16% off its all-time peak, it actually completed an inside day. That is, Tuesday's high and low came inside Monday's high and low. The S&P 500, off 1.2%, also staged an inside day.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP01252-155x300.jpg)Such technical action points to short-term uncertainty. Is the next big move up or down? We don't know yet.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond jumped 4 basis points to 1.78%, up from 1.51% at the start of 2022.


AXP Goes Positive In 2022 Again
-------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, getting a boost from strength in four components that each gained 4 points or more — **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) — actually edged for a while into positive territory after falling as much as 2.3% intraday. The blue chip index closed 0.2% lower and finished well in the upper half of the day's range.


AmEx is trying to put some bullish touches on a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


Notice on a daily chart how it's crisscrossed the 50- and 200-day moving averages for months. This makes a trendline breakout near 174 more tricky.


Plus, a market in correction already stacks the odds against the longs for meaningful gains past a true breakout. Yet AmEx's 12-month performance still looks quite good. That merits the charge-card giant with an 88 Relative Strength Rating.


Chevron has risen hesitantly for months since its [saucer breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/) at 113.21 back in October. But this year so far, nothing has been uncertain about the megacap member of IBD's Oil & Gas-Integrated industry group. Chevron has ramped 13% higher since Jan. 1, expanding its post-breakout gain to 17%.



The integrated oil group broke into the top 10 among [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jan-24-2022/) after dwelling in the middle of the rankings just six weeks ago.


However, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) may weigh on the stock market early Wednesday after [falling nearly 3% after hours Tuesday on its fiscal second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-falls-despite-december-quarter-beat/). The [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) is trying to find support at its 200-day moving average. At Tuesday's close of 288.49, the business software and cloud computing titan stood 17% off its all-time peak of 349.67.


Already In Bear Territory
-------------------------


Small caps, as a group, have fallen more in the stock market. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF, off 1.3% on Tuesday, has dropped as much as 21.8% from its Nov. 8 peak. So, technically speaking, smaller issues have already entered bear-market territory.



The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF fell 1.6% and is now 29% below its 52-week high.


West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures jumped another 2.2% on Tuesday to $85.17 a barrel. Oil is up 13% year to date.


Right now, the Federal Reserve faces the question of how much does it have to do to quell inflation — without derailing the economy.


Wednesday's statement, followed by a news conference by Chairman Jerome Powell, will give market watchers more clarity on how quickly the U.S. central bank wants to remove the gigantic monetary measures put in place to support the economy during a once-in-a-century pandemic.

How Inflation Can Impact Corporate Profits
------------------------------------------


Inflation, however, can be difficult to gauge, let alone, tame.


André Perold, co-founder and CIO at investment manager HighVista Strategies, points out that inflation is made up of many forms and contains many elements. Take shadow inflation. The fact that a restaurant will take 20 or 30 minutes longer than usual to deliver a customer's entree does not translate into a higher reading into the U.S. consumer or producer price data. Neither does a smaller hamburger, even if the price stays the same. Yet both reflect inflation.


Governments can cure high inflation with policies that improve supply. Sometimes, the cure to high prices in a commodity is simply high prices. But Perold, Professor Emeritus of finance at Harvard Business School, advises IBD readers to look for clues to a change in the mindset among participants within the economy, which can make inflation what he calls "self-fulfilling." Sustained inflation can lead to a significant change in corporate earnings. That has big implications for shareholders.


Boston-based HighVista, which has $5 billion in assets under management, told IBD that its research has found the amount of employees' share of a company's earnings before compensation — called labor profit share — has fallen to 82% in the last decade vs. 88% during the 1980s. Back then, inflation was high, but came down as a result of former Fed chief Paul Volcker's sledgehammer approach to slaying inflation.


So, what if workers today can command even larger pay raises to keep up with inflation? What if corporate managers accept this "change in mindset" and change their policies? Such changes could reverse the labor profit share from its recent lows. And, Perold estimates, it could lead to as much as a 45% drop in corporate earnings over time.


The U.S.: Underinvested In Energy?
----------------------------------


Perold also points out that the persistence of strong energy prices today is related to U.S. underinvestment in new oil and gas supplies prior to the 2020 Covid-19 crisis. IBD's analysis of industry groups within the stock market currently points to leadership in the oil and gas patch.



**NOV** ([NOV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOV)), part of the oil and gas machinery and equipment industry group, jumped 6.2% in volume that grew 37% above average. The midcap stock is trying to clear a 16.86 handle entry point on a long [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/).


NOV hosts a solid 93 Relative Strength Rating. Watch for Q4 results on Feb. 3.


Meanwhile, tariffs on various goods set during the Trump administration have also hit consumers' wallets. So, the future growth of multiple supply chains to alleviate these pressures can and likely will work. But it takes a lot of time and a lot of effort.


The Fed will release its statement on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.

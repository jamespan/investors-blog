U.S. stock indexes advanced confidently Friday, as the market overcame a slew of doubts during the week.




The Nasdaq climbed 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.


The small-cap Russell 2000 slipped 0.1%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.

— **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was the first worry. Lackluster sales this year of Apple's existing smartphones raised a question: Were customers postponing purchases to grab the iPhoneX version, or was something more negative behind the weak sales?


Apple provided an answer after Thursday's close, when the company reported quarterly results that humbled the pessimists. Earnings jumped 24% vs. expectations for 12% growth. Sales spurted 12% vs. views for 8%.


For the week, Apple's stock surged 5.8%, its best weekly gain in nine months.


— The second worry was President Trump's choice to head the Federal Reserve. Doubts proved unwarranted as Trump picked a consensus candidate in Jerome Powell.


— The Republican tax plan provided the third set of doubts. Special-interest lobbyists took a dim view of some elements of the plan, such as the elimination of tax deductions related to higher-end homes. But homebuilder stocks rebounded Friday.


— The fourth worry was the payroll data released Friday. Payrolls added 261,000 jobs in October, but that was about 20% below the consensus. Bulls found solace in the sharp upward revisions for August and September.


Going into the coming week, the stock market is left with only the tax plan as a continuing concern.


Breakouts in strong volume Friday included screen-technology maker **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) and homebuilder **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)), both of which retook buy points; **American Axle** ([AXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXL)), which gapped up 5%; restaurant chain **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)), which gapped up 15%; **Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)), which gapped up 9% from a tight pattern; and managed health care provider **Molina Healthcare** ([IBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBD)), which cleared a three-month consolidation. All those companies rallied on their quarterly results.

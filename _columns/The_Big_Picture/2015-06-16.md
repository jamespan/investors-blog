Stocks Look Past Greece; End With Decent Gains
===============================================

If the market is truly worried about a Greek debt default, it wasn't apparent Tuesday as stocks ended with decent gains in lower volume. The Dow and S&P 500 each rose 0.6%. The Nasdaq gained 0.5%. The IBD 50 lagged a bit, rising 0.4%. The IBD 50 closed above its 50-day moving average for the 15th straight session.

  

Nasdaq volume fell 5% from Monday's level. NYSE volume fell 4%.

  

The Dow's outperformance was helped by a 2% gain in shares of **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)). Published reports said the health insurer approached **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)) about a possible merger.

  

Tuesday's gains were good to see in light of the Nasdaq's bullish reversal Monday, when a 1.3% intraday loss was pared to 0.4% by the close. Once again, the tech index is showing stickiness around its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 is still below its 50-day line.

  

Market breadth was OK Tuesday, with advancing stocks outnumbering decliners by less than 2 to 1 on both main exchanges, but the overall breadth picture leaves something to be desired. The S&P 500's advance/decline has been trending slightly lower for about one month now. Same with the Nasdaq's A/D line.

  

Weakening breadth and an elevated distribution count for both indexes give the bulls pause, but the news isn't all bad because indexes are still holding near highs and leading growth stocks are generally holding up well. When it comes to recent distribution days in the major average, few, if any, have had the feel of intense institutional selling.

  

In economic news, housing starts fell 11% in May, but the drop followed a 22% jump in April. The better news was in housing permits, a good preview of future starts. Permits rose 12%, touching a high not seen since 2007, when the economy was about to enter a recession.

  

The two-day Fed meeting got under way Tuesday. Wall Street will be listening closely to what the Fed has to say Wednesday afternoon, when it gives forecasts for inflation and U.S. economic growth.

  

According to the CME Group FedWatch, futures traders are pricing in a 0% probability of a rate hike Wednesday, a 5% chance at the July 29 meeting, a 26% chance at the September meeting and a 46% chance at the October meeting.

  

Meanwhile, talks in Greece remain stalled because the country refuses to accept more austerity demands from creditors. Discussions will resume Thursday when eurozone finance ministers meet in Luxembourg. Tuesday's gains could be the market's way of saying that Greece's situation has greater ramifications for the country than it does the global economy and financial markets.

  

In stock news, **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) was the top gainer in the IBD 50 Tuesday, rising nearly 5% in strong volume. It's working on a new base with a 39.85 entry.

  

A recent breakout in the small-cap space continued to thrive. **Papa Murphy's** ([FRSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRSH)) extended its winning streak to three sessions, rising nearly 4%. It broke out with conviction Monday, clearing a 20.10 buy point.

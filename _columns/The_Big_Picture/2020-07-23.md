The stock market took a breather on weaker-than-expected jobless claims Thursday, ending the day just off session lows. The Nasdaq composite tumbled as much as 2.8% before paring losses, dragged down by sharp weakness amid stock market leaders Amazon.com, Apple, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Microsoft and Tesla.




The Nasdaq slid 2.3%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3%, or 353 points. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 sharply outperformed, trading flat for the day. Leading growth stocks were also sharply lower, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) fell 1.9%. Volume was mildly higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Rally Pauses On Jobless Claims
-------------------------------------------


On Thursday, the Nasdaq saw its biggest loss since June 26 when it fell 2.6%. The Nasdaq is about 3.5% off the all-time high that it set on Tuesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP_4x3_072320-216x300.jpg)Early Thursday, [jobless claims](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/job-market-has-stalled-but-30-million-face-aid-cut-dow-jones-slips/) rose for the first time, on a seasonally adjusted basis, since they peaked in late March. Jobless claims hit 1.416 million in the week ended July 18, according to the Labor Department. Economists expected about 1.3 million claims.


Sharp losses Thursday, along with heavier volume than Wednesday, added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to Nasdaq composite. The Nasdaq now has three distribution days. The S&P 500 also added a distribution day as NYSE volume edged higher. For now, the institutional selling isn't heavy enough to change the market's trend. However, large-cap technology stocks were hit particularly hard Thursday, adding fuel to the day's bearish action.


Stocks Market Leaders: Amazon, Apple, Chipotle, Microsoft, Tesla
----------------------------------------------------------------


The price action in top stocks offers a great deal of insight into the risk appetite of institutional investors. Leading growth stocks stumbled Thursday, including **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).

Amazon tumbled 3.7%. Apple fell 4.5% and pierced its short-term 10-day moving average. [Chipotle](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-digital-sales-chipotle-stock-high/) tumbled 5.4%, while [Microsoft](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-earnings-q4-2020-msft-stock/) slid 4.3% despite strong earnings from both. Tesla reversed from an [earnings-fueled](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-profit-second-quarter-earnings/) 6% advance to fall 5% by the close. This weak price action could signal further weakness over the short term.


However — long term — all five stock market leaders remain far above their 50-day moving average lines, a key support level.


Remember, investors shouldn't be making all-or-nothing decisions. Thursday's weakness could be a good time to just reduce some exposure among top growth stocks, especially after their rapid run-ups in recent weeks. Keep a close eye on these leaders. If they find support near their 50-day lines, then new buying opportunities would arise. On the downside, if they break down through their 50-day lines, further weakness could arise.

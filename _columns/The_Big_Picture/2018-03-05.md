  Dow Leads As Stocks Extend Rebound, But For How Long?

Stocks extended their rebound Monday as the Dow Jones industrial average led gains of 1% or more in the major indexes.




 The Dow closed 1.4% higher. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) gave the average some fuel, and only one of the 30 components closed lower: **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)).


The S&P 500 added 1.1% and the Nasdaq composite 1%. The Nasdaq has looked best in the rebound, finding support at its [50-day moving average](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) Friday. On Monday, the S&P 500 and Dow tried to catch up, but both remained below their 50-day averages. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was indicated lower on the NYSE.


Both also are still 5% to 6% below prior highs, while the Nasdaq is just 2% away. Much like last year, the Nasdaq is outpacing the other indexes in 2018, up about three times better than the S&P. With Monday's gains, the Dow is back to having a gain for 2017 — by a fraction.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP030518-230x300.jpg)Back-to-back solid gains were encouraging, but investors need to watch for signs that the two-day rally is not just a reflex. The general market remains under pressure until there's more evidence that buyers are back in control.


Until then, investors need to watch their steps carefully. A cluster of [distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in the past two weeks threatens to undermine the bullish [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) of Feb. 14.


Be picky on new stock purchases. Take some profits, especially on stocks up more than 20%. [Cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Indexes finds themselves on the positive side of a seesaw market, in which indexes have spent no more than a couple of weeks in a single direction. This is not the 2017 market, which was unusually steady and had a remarkable ability to shake off crisis selling.


The next signal is likely to come from the indexes' moving averages. These lines can help identify price trends, though they are no match for follow-throughs and distribution in the indexes. Still, they provide important clues. The market bottomed Feb. 9, when the S&P 500 touched its 200-day average. Once all indexes are above their 50-day line, you can feel more confident about adding stocks.


On Monday, the market seemed to like reports that House Speaker Paul Ryan and others in Congress are [pushing back on President Trump's plan to set tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/could-congress-block-trump-steel-tariffs/) on steel and aluminum imports. Trump's announcement of new tariffs sent stocks reeling last week. Faced with congressional opposition, Trump said he won't back down and doesn't believe his decision will trigger a trade war.


Energy, utility, financial and software sectors were some of Monday's best.

The IBD 50 climbed 1% in what was a good day for leading stocks, including several that broke out.


**Nutanix** ([NTNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTNX)) soared past a 38.90 buy point in heavy volume. The server software company began rallying Friday after it posted a narrower-than-expected  loss and sales that beat views.



**Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) broke out past a 25.10 buy point in huge volume. The pattern could be interpreted as an odd cup-type base or as the handle of a much longer pattern. Either way, the breakout looks strong. The business software company is reporting results Thursday after the market's close.


**Guidewire Software** ([GWRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWRE)) topped the 83.62 buy point of a lopsided base. Volume was lackluster, however. The maker of software for the insurance industry announces earnings Tuesday after the close.

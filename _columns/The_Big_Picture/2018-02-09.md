  Bulls Come Out Of Hiding Friday; S&P 500 Bounces Off Key Line

Wild action on Wall Street ended on a bullish note Friday, as the indexes overcame some choppy trading.


The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average posted gains of 1.4%, while the S&P 500 added 1.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1%.




 Volume was emphatically higher on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE as well.


The S&P 500 sank to its 200-day moving average and then bounced north, an early sign of a possible low. The Nasdaq came close to the line and then rebounded.


Although the indexes finished high in the day's range, they marked fresh lows earlier in the session.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP020918-264x300.png)The correction has now reached 11.6% on the Nasdaq and 11.8% on the S&P 500 from prior highs.


How Long Will The Correction Last?
----------------------------------


Going back more than three years and not including the current correction, the Nasdaq has had corrections of about 19%, 18%, 10% (rounded up) and 11%.


The deeper corrections lasted six to 10 weeks, while the shallower corrections ran four to six weeks.


Traditionally a correction is defined as a pullback of 10% or more, and a bear market 20% or more.


The current correction has burned through a lot of capital in just two weeks. The quick decline might suggest that the battle between the bears and the bulls has further to go. Volatility is likely to remain for a while.


Yet, the individual investor should not get locked into a prediction. Stay flexible and be ready to buy a stock if a [follow-through day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) develops.


Watch For This Bullish Signal
-----------------------------


A follow-through day involves a big index gain in rising volume on the fourth day or later of an attempted rally.


Friday's action constituted Day 1 of an attempted rally. The indexes have to stay above their intraday lows in order for the count to continue.


In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder William O'Neil made this cautionary point: "There will be cases in which confirmed rallies fail. A few large institutional investors ... can run up the averages on a particular day and create the impression of a follow-through. Unless the smart buyers are getting back on board, however, the rally will implode."


Look For Relative Strength
--------------------------


One thing investors can do while waiting for a new uptrend is cull the market for stocks with rising [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/). The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500.


Stocks currently with strong RS lines include **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), **Hilton Worldwide** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)) and **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)).


Saturday's Stock Notes
----------------------


Six bank stocks made the IBD 50 in the weekly print edition. It's been awhile. The bank sector is No. 19 of 33 sectors, which is nothing to boast about. However, the sector is down only 0.1% so far in 2018, the ninth best price performance among the 33 sectors.


The biggest loser among sectors so far this year is the building sector, down 13.6%. Next is utilities and energy, off 9.8% and 8.9% respectively.


That once lovely chip sector looks sick. The chip sector is now No. 25 among 33 sectors and down 3.7% for the year.


—The put-call ratio closed at 1.26 Friday, a bullish reading. Readings of 1.15 or more often mean either a market bottom is near or it has been made. The put-call ratio is a secondary indicator.


—The Federal Reserve's Feb. 5 decision to punish **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) by stopping the company from growing was a peculiar decision. A fine would've been less harmful to the U.S. economy. Neither the economy nor the U.S. Treasury is helped by this lose-lose decision.


—For the week, the stock indexes suffered two distribution days (big losses in rising volume and a sign of institutional selling) and enjoyed two days of accumulation (big gains in rising volume and a sign of institutional buying). Bears and bulls both go into the coming week with much at stake.


—Look on the bright side as the market goes down: If the correction can go down to the minus 15% to 20% level, more weak holders will be chased out, and amateurs previously considering a jump into the stock market will be scared off. A new uptrend doesn't need nervous money. A shakeout can be constructive.

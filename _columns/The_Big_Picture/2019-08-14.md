  Stock Market, 10-Year Yield Take A Beating As Recession Fears Mount

The stock market got hit with a nasty wave of selling Wednesday that raised new questions about the market's direction. **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) were big decliners in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) fell sharply in the Nasdaq 100.




The Dow industrials and Nasdaq ended with losses of 3%. The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small-cap index gave back 2.9%. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are getting resistance at their 50-day moving averages, the Russell 2000 is experiencing the same at its 200-day line.


Dow Jones stock **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) wasn't much help after the close. The company [reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-earnings-csco-stock-q2-2019/) and gave a sluggish outlook. Shares were down more than 6% in after-hours trading.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped 3.5%, weighed down by weakness in **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP081419.jpg)Breadth was awful, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers by more than 5-to-1 on both exchanges. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Tuesday, resulting in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


It was a conviction move higher by the indexes Tuesday, but an undercut of Tuesday's low raises the likelihood that Tuesday's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) won't amount to much.


But the put/call ratio jumped to 1.24 Wednesday, indicating excessive fear in the market. Excessive fear has been seen near market bottoms in the past.


Still, the weak action Wednesday was enough to put the market outlook to uptrend under pressure, just one day after the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 confirmed their latest rally attempts with bullish gains in higher volume. With market risk rising again, investors need to reduce some exposure. New stock purchases must be selective, and cutting losses short is imperative.


Stock Market Worries About Recession
------------------------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield plunged 12 basis points to 1.58%. It went below the two-year yield for the first time since 2007, fueling fears of a recession for the U.S. economy. An inverted yield curve is a rare occurrence because lenders typically require a higher interest rate to lend for longer periods of time.


[Inverted yield curves](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/inverted-yield-curve/) have flagged economic downturns in the past but many took time to develop. Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, said in a note Wednesday that the yield curve "isn't the best timing signal, as a recession doesn't start for an average of 21 months after the initial inversion. Given the continued strong employment picture and healthy U.S. consumer, there could still be time for this economic cycle to have plenty of life left."

Rather than worry about a recession, growth investors should continue to watch daily price and volume in the major stock indexes. When compared to Europe and China, the U.S. is still the nicest house in the neighborhood. But the stock market is also forward looking, so more signs of institutional selling would be troubling. To have a distribution day so soon after a follow-through is disappointing.


Retail Sector Under Pressure
----------------------------


Worries about a recession fueled selling in retail-related industry groups. Department store operators were among the worst performers, down around 5%, hurt by weak earnings and a soft outlook from **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)).


Oil and gas-related groups also lagged. After four straight gains, U.S. crude oil futures settled at $55.23 a barrel, down 3.3%.


Recent IPO Pops On Earnings
---------------------------


Meanwhile, a couple of new issues went in opposite directions on earnings. **Grocery Outlet** ([GO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GO)), a member of the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), jumped to a new high. The stock broke out of a new [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 39.66 entry. But China-based **Luckin Coffee** ([LK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LK)) gapped below its 50-day moving average after a short-lived breakout from a deep base.


Grocery Outlet was among a small group of stocks in the MarketSmith Growth 250 that ended higher Wednesday. Gold stock **AngloGold Ashanti** ([AU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AU)) outperformed, but it's extended past a proper buy point.


But a couple of speculative biotech stocks in the MarketSmith Growth 250 continued to act well. **Turning Point Therapeutics** ([TPTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPTX)) is close to a 45.51 double-bottom entry, while **Stoke Therapeutics** ([STOK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOK)) is just below a 31.86 buy point.



While it makes sense to look for healthy charts in a down market, favorable technical setups are generally going to have a hard time making headway.


**Wendy's** ([WEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEN)) continues to hold near highs. It's just below a 20.24 buy point after gapping up in price last week on strong earnings.


It's often said that a weak market eventually brings everything down with it, and that was certainly true in the utility sector Wednesday. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) reversed lower, erasing a 0.6% intraday gain. The exchange traded fund is still holding above its 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base.

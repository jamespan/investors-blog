Stocks Rise Modestly As A Curious Trend Reemerges Ahead Of Earnings Season

The stock market made record highs Tuesday, extending a superb start to the year.




 The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 have yet to be down in a single session since the new year. Both rose 0.1% after paring gains in the final couple of hours of the session. The Russell 2000 also hit a new high but was flat at the close.


The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.4%, thanks mainly to strong up days for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), which reported a [record number of commercial jet deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-hits-new-high-as-deliveries-orders-climb/) for 2017, and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)). J&J broke out of a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) in one of the better breakouts Tuesday, even though the stock closed slightly below its 144.45 buy point.


As selling appeared, the breadth of the market's advance diminished. Decliners led advancers by 7-to-5 on the NYSE and by 15-to-13 on the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP01091818-242x300.jpg)After a strong 2017 for stocks (the Nasdaq roared 28.2%), buyers don't seem to be letting up. [Distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) are minimal, and leading stocks are performing for the most part.


Nasdaq volume eased Tuesday, but volume has been above average on the composite for five straight days. That's a sign that institutional investors are adding shares, all the while they may be shedding bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.55%, the highest level since mid-March.


With yields rising, financials were one of the best-performing sectors. Money center banking, superregional and regional banking and brokerage industry groups rose 0.4% to 1.5%.


Some of the trends of 2017 are continuing in the new year. Semiconductor, energy, technology and health care are some of the early leaders, judging by [top performers in the ETF industry](https://www.investors.com/best-etfs/). Industrials also are leading, exemplified by **Caterpillar**'s ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) near-breathtaking advance from its breakout past a 140.54 buy point. Many Chinese stocks, particularly in the internet field, are amassing gains.


Fourth-quarter earnings kicks off this week, with notable reports Wednesday from **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), on Thursday from **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) and Friday from financial heavyweights **Wells Fargo** ([WFC,](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC%2C)) **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **PNC Financial** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)).


Expectations are for another great quarter. The consensus estimate is for a 10.6% increase in S&P 500 profits, according to CFRA Research. It would be the third quarter in the past four with EPS gains of more than 10%.


Moreover, CFRA says estimates for Q1 through Q3 of this year also top 10%. That's a formidable foundation for stock gains. Indeed, encouraging profit expectations may be fueling the new-year rally.


"As we prepare for fourth-quarter earnings season, a trend we noted last quarter is seemingly persisting: In each of the three quarters of 2017 the market moved about 5% higher ahead of earnings season (over a one- or two-month period), baking in the anticipated earnings beat," Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA, noted in a report last week.


For example, the S&P 500 climbed 5.3% during a one-month period leading up to the third-quarter earnings season.


The broad market's rise has spawned dozens of breakouts. But for at least some names, volume has been elusive and price moves light. **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) were some of Tuesday's examples.


But in finance, **Sterling Bancorp** ([SBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBT)) stood out as the new issue topped IPO base. Shares rallied 4.4% to close above the 13.89 buy point.

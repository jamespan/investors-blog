Stocks Close Flat But Close At Session Highs
=============================================

The main indexes closed flat Tuesday, but that masked some positive behavior in the market.


Indexes came off moderate declines as buyers took the upper hand in the afternoon and erased practically all losses. A day after some churning blemished the averages, it was encouraging that they were back to a trend of closing near session highs.


The Nasdaq rose less than 0.1% after being down 0.4% in early trading. The S&P 500, down 0.3% at one point, closed with a minimal loss. Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq but fell on the NYSE.


Monday's stalling action in the S&P 500 was a subtle form of institutional selling that gave the market its first distribution day since the May 27 follow-through. But aside from that, stocks haven't shown they're ready to take a break from a rally that's accelerated the past three weeks.


Although market risk appears to be low, a pullback wouldn't be surprising now, the way the market has burst to new highs. Remain watchful with your new stock purchases, especially those in which you have small profit cushions.


Checking some of the market's internals, there's scant evidence of major selling so far.


The NYSE's advance-decline line is at new highs; the Nasdaq's line has made a decisive breakout above a trend line. Losers moderately topped winners Tuesday, which bent those lines down only a tad.


There's been a sharp uptick in 52-week highs vs. new lows since late May.


So far, however, few stocks have made substantial gains from their breakouts. A winner like **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)), which has ascended 12% in smooth form from a six-week-old breakout, is rare these days. An investor also would have had to take the risk of buying before the follow-through to win that profit.


But what the market is lacking in big gains it is making up for in breadth. Many high-rated stocks remain above buy points, and participation has come from several sectors, such as autos, chips, transportation, chemicals, apparel and energy.


The IBD 50 also is well diversified among sectors, although health care owns the plurality of components. The IBD 50 lagged Tuesday, falling 0.4%, despite strong performances from a few major stocks.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) rallied 5%, clearing short-term resistance around 64, after it grabbed a top executive from **eBay**'s ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) PayPal division. The stock is still forming a base.


**Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) climbed 2% to a new high. It broke out of a cup-with-handle base Thursday, although the pattern is late stage.

Nasdaq Leads Stock Market To Nice Gains
========================================

The stock market painted a bullish picture in confident strokes Friday, concluding a week of solid gains.




The Nasdaq sprinted 0.8%, leading the market largely on strength in semiconductor stocks.Â The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each added 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.3%. Volume rose sharply due to the simultaneous expiration of options and futures.


During the week, leadership was broadly based. A dozen and a half groups scored weekly gains of 5% or better, according to preliminary data. They included medical stocks, retail, tobacco, semiconductors, computers, oil and transportation ships.


Note the variety: This is not a narrowly based uptrend, and that's good news. Bulls prefer diversified leadership because it protects the indexes against one-off outcomes.


Stock Market Climbs Above Key Lines
-----------------------------------


In a broader measure for the week, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 retook and stayed above their 200-day moving averages.

After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current market conditions.


Calm Reactions To News
----------------------


News that had shaken the stock market not too long ago is now having little effect.


For example, the market shrugged off reports Thursday that the U.S.-China high level trade talks would be delayed.


On Friday, the South China Morning Post reported "concrete progress" in the talks. The market didn't seem too impressed with that as well.


A rough gauge for China is **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), which is pinning its growth hopes on the communist nation. When the Shanghai composite dropped 4.4% March 8 on weak China trade data, Starbucks gapped down 1.8%.


In the latest week, Starbucks rose four days in a row and then eased 0.1%.


How To Play The Current Market
------------------------------


Playing more than one leading sector is fitting. Check IBD's [sector rankings and the year to date percentage gains](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-mar-15-2019/) for areas to fish in.


If the investor takes profit in a stock at the 20% to 25% level, he or she should sell a laggard along with it. Why? If winners are cashed in without a corresponding lightening in losers, then the investor's portfolio will eventually be dumbed down.


Watch for second-chance breakouts. **Ulta Beauty's** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) November [breakout gains were short-lived](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch-ulta-beauty-building-base/). But after triggering the 8% sell rule, a second pattern brought a February breakout that has gone better. Those who bought the second-chance entry at 294.54 are now up about 15%. Shares gapped to a record high Friday after strong results.


The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday. The Street expects no change in rates.

Bears came out in force Thursday, swatting the indexes solidly south. The Nasdaq chopped off 1.6%, while the S&P 500 pruned 0.8%. The IBD 50 led the carnage with a vicious 2.9% drop.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges.

  

The action met the definition of a distribution day — a loss in rising volume that points to institutional selling.

  

Few stocks escaped Thursday's sell-off. Leaders, which until recently dodged most of the pain, fell almost without exception.

  

Every stock in the Big Cap 20 fell. In the IBD 50, only one stock rose — pizza maker **Papa John's International** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)).

  

The balance of losers to winners on the major indexes wasn't nearly as dramatic. Declining issues led advancers by a 5-to-2 ratio on the Nasdaq but only 3-to-2 on the NYSE.

  

Among industry groups, beaten-down oil stocks led the gainers. Meanwhile, the highly rated biotechs were among the day's biggest losers.

  

The major indexes ducked under their 50-day lines, but that's been a battleground for more than four months. Moves above and below the line have been shallow and relatively brief.

  

Although Thursday's action was ugly, the indexes stayed within recent trading ranges. The indexes remain only 2% to 3% off recent highs.

  

The difficulty has been earnings season, which hasn't provided much of a tailwind. Instead, quarterly results have conjured up some destructive gusts.

  

Consider some of the one-day losses in the past seven sessions: **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) dropped 11% on July 29. **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) gapped down 14% on July 30. **Outerwall** ([OUTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OUTR)) skidded 13% Friday. **Tucows** ([TCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCX)) slid 10% Monday. **Mallinckrodt** ([MNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNK)) and **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) lost 14% and 12%, respectively, on Tuesday. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) nose-dived 9% Wednesday.

  

And Thursday, hot [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) **Fitbit** ([FIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIT)) slammed 14% lower.

  

Unrelenting one-day losses, such as those above, erode confidence in the market.

  

In economic news, chain store sales in July showed soft results. (See the New America article on Page A9.) First-time jobless claims were fewer than expected.

  

On Friday, market watchers will be focused on the nonfarm payrolls number. The consensus is for a 212,000 increase.

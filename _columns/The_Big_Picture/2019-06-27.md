  Small Caps Set Pace; What History Says About This Stock Market

The stock market dealt some generous gains Thursday, though volume was unimpressive for a second day in a row.




The small-cap Russell 2000 rushed ahead 1.9%, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 jogged 0.7% and 0.4% higher, respectively.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume.


News Thursday provided three items for the market to mull.


Oil Prices
----------


The first item involved crude oil. OPEC's oil minister Thamer Ghadhban said Thursday that a bigger cut in oil production could be in the works. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet Monday and Tuesday.

GDP Accelerates
---------------


The second item was the third reading on U.S. first-quarter GDP. The reading came in at 3.1%, matching expectations. The 3.1% growth represented acceleration from Q4's 2.2% growth.


Subcategories provided disappointing data for bears to feed on, such as weakness in consumer spending. But the larger picture is still bullish. The U.S. economy's expansion will reach 10 years in July, the longest on record.


Walk-Away Scenario
------------------


The third item is Saturday's meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping in Japan. Plenty of pessimism surrounds the trade negotiations, although [a cease-fire is still possible](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-xi-summit-fed-dow-jones-dash-china-trade-deal-hopes/). A delay in new tariffs and a willingness to talk might be the most realistic outcome.


JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that the important thing for the U.S. is that if Trump "can't get a good deal, he should walk away."


Under a walkaway scenario, the stock market might remove at least part of the current uncertainty. The market could then quit hoping and learn to live under imperfect conditions.


Trade talks remain the biggest factor influencing the stock market. The uncertainty is causing many investors to be guarded.


Keep in mind that the S&P 500 is up 17% so far this year. Despite the sizable gain, the mood of the market seems tentative. A look at the S&P 500 chart shows why. Many of the price gains this year involved patching over the hole created from October through December.


In other words, the S&P 500 hasn't risen much since Oct. 1.


History's Lesson On Stock Rebounds
----------------------------------


Also, consider the bearish end of 2018. The stock market began 2019 in the trough of a bear market. IBD research shows that the current market is [a laggard compared to historically similar market rebounds](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-next-six-months-2019/). The six-month rebound averaged 34% in similar markets. The current market, in this context, is a historical laggard.


Breakouts involved mostly small caps Thursday.


**Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) knifed 4% higher, coasting past a 67.12 buy point in roughly average volume. The restaurant chain grew earnings 24% and 25% in 2017-18. Revenue stepped up 34% and 28%.



Another small cap, **Dova Pharmaceuticals** ([DOVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOVA)), broke above a 12.30 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) in huge volume. The company reported that the FDA expanded the approved uses of Dova's Doptelet, a treatment for a condition called thrombocytopenia.


Other stocks showing good action were furniture makers **Herman Miller** ([MLHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLHR)) and **Knoll** ([KNL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNL)), utilities meter maker **Badger Meter** ([BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)) and construction aggregates producer **Summit Materials** ([SUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUM)).


**Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)) tried to clear a buy point but came up pennies short.

Indexes reversed higher Tuesday, a positive sign as the stock market tries to extend an unusually long advance during a historically poor month.




The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each climbed 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite, which was down as much 0.7%, closed 0.5% higher. All three ended at session highs — evidence that institutional buyers remain engaged.


After rising eight of the past nine months, a stock market pullback would not come as a surprise. For now, though, there's no clear sign of such a pullback. True, the number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is high, especially in the S&P 500. But there hasn't been any new distribution in more than two weeks.


All three main indexes held above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Consider that a good short-term market indicator, a way to guide your exposure while the stock market balances earnings, economic data, Covid-19 trends, inflation and other factors.

A number of reopening-economy stocks fell or lagged. IBD's restaurants industry group edged lower even as other retail groups rose. Airlines climbed minimally. Travel booking and lodging groups fell about 1.7%, while casinos and resorts groups dropped nearly 2%.


Reopening Stocks Lag Stock Market
---------------------------------


The industry performance reflects worries about a new spread of Covid-19. Some governments and corporations are reinstating masking rules, including San Francisco and Los Angeles County. New York City will require vaccinations for indoor activities.


U.S. car companies and labor unions started requiring workers to resume wearing masks. Automakers were the latest in a series of companies going back to masking requirements and sometimes delaying return to workplaces. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google are [requiring vaccinations before workers return to the office](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-google-and-other-u-s-companies-requiring-workers-to-get-vaccinated-before-returning-to-the-office-11627935376?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D86767752584359609670535559432365936577%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1628022430).


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 1.17%. It is trying to hold above the July low of 1.12%. It's been trending lower since late March, as investors opted for bonds amid signs of a slowing economic recovery.


The IBD 50 rose 0.5%. **Translate Bio** ([TBIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBIO)) did wonders for the IBD 50. The biotech soared 29% to a new high after France's **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)) [agreed to acquire the company in a deal valued at $3.2 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tbio-stock-flies-as-sanofi-jumps-into-mrna-with-takeover/).



**Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)) surged more than 13% after the heavy-construction products company [reported strong June-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-atkore-near-buy-point-730-percent-surge-blowout-earnings/). The stock is forming the right side of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


But **Ultra Clean Holdings** ([UCTT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UCTT)) plunged 14% despite that [the company beat quarterly estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/uctt-stock-ultra-clean-holdings-posts-beat-and-raise-quarter/) and raised its guidance. The chip-equipment company continues to work on a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


Compared with one or two weeks ago, the pace of breakouts has slowed. Most of those breakouts are working still, though some have stalled, including **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) and **Tenet Healthcare** ([THC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THC)).


On Tuesday, **Maravai Lifesciences** ([MRVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVI)) broke out past a 45.89 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


4 Facts About Stock Market In August
------------------------------------


The month of August historically is bad for stocks, although it was a solid month last year.


Lindsey Bell, Chief Investment Strategist for Ally Invest, notes first that August is the third worst performing month of the year, and it typically sees more volatility.


The S&P 500 hasn't fallen 3% or more from a record high since May, she adds. That puts the index on track for what would be only the third time in history when the S&P hasn't dropped 3% or more from a record high in the summer.


"Additionally, the impressive July performance which included notching seven new highs in the S&P 500, could make for a tough setup for August. History shows it becomes more difficult for stocks to rise in August if the market cruises at record highs in July."


In a third market fact, since 1950 the S&P 500 has dropped an average 1.3% in August after reaching at least one record high in July. And the S&P has never risen in August after making seven or more record highs in July.


Here's a fourth fact: The stock market's monthly win streak doesn't necessarily mean a long market slump is in the cards.


LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick wrote in a report that the six-month win streak usually means good news in the longer term. "What most might not realize is that (a six-month win streak) is a very bullish event," Detrick said. "In fact, one year later it has been up 18 of 21 times with nearly a 12% average return. The bull might have a few tricks up his sleeve yet."

Stock Market Holds Up In Face Of Headlines; The S&P 500 Level Everyone Is Watching
===================================================================================

Stock market indexes were resilient Monday in the face of negative headlines, while the S&P 500 continued to battle a resistance level that could be pivotal for the market in the coming weeks.




The Nasdaq made the highest close since Aug. 18 after adding 0.5% for the day.


The S&P 500 was barely higher. The index is trading around 4200, where sellers stood firm in February and the start of May. A move above that level would be a bullish sign, not just for the S&P but the general market as well.


The Nasdaq already climbed above resistance around 12,250. If anything, the composite could be a bit stretched. After last week's 3% jump and a 4% gain for the month, a pullback would not be surprising.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a 0.4% drop Monday. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was a big reason for that, after [an analyst downgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-cut-to-sell-as-u-s-business-faces-challenges/) took shares below the 200-day moving average.


But small caps led, with the Russell 2000 up 1.2%. Strength in regional banks helped the small-cap benchmark once again.

Stock Market Watching Debt Talks
--------------------------------


The stock market's most immediate worry is debt-ceiling talks, and there was nothing to alarm investors during Monday's session.


Bad news for semiconductors ([China acting tough](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mu-stock-china-action-against-micron-technology-called-political/) on **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU))), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) ([$1.3 billion fine from the EU](https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-meta-fined-by-eu-stock-price-a65b9729?mod=hp_LEAD_4)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) ([analyst downgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-downgraded-on-signs-of-slowing-iphone-demand/)) failed to significantly dent demand in those assets.


Such resilience speaks well of the market. Yet, even while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at the highest levels of the year, some stock market internals are soft.


As this column has pointed out before, breadth remains too narrow for comfort. Poor breadth, in fact, was one of the signs in late 2021 that warned investors of a bear market.


The NYSE advance-decline line remains rangebound even as the S&P 500 climbed to the highest since August last week. The Nasdaq's A/D line shows a wider divergence.


Nasdaq 52-week lows and the number of stocks falling in higher volume are both trending the wrong way. On the NYSE, however, those numbers are coming into balance.


That's just part of mixed signals facing the stock market.


Stock Market Leadership Improves
--------------------------------


In an unusual twist, the S&P 500 still is burdened with six [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). But the Nasdaq has shed all its distribution days thanks to a combination of index gains and time passed since the distribution took place.


But while stock market breadth leaves a lot to be desired, market leadership is widening.


Dozens of stocks have broken out past buy points and remain in buy range. Some are already extended past their buy zones, while few sell signals have appeared. Multiple sectors are participating in those breakouts, too.



Last week, First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) broke above a trend line touching the highs since February. That's a positive sign for market breadth.


Still, the stock market is in a precarious position, facing the risk of recession, a government default and perhaps even higher interest rates.


Monday marked the 222nd consecutive trading day that the yield curve is inverted, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That's using the 2- and 10-year yield spreads. It's the longest period of inversion since the 446 days that ended May 1, 1980.


D.C. Negotiations: No Consensus Among Fed Officials
---------------------------------------------------


President Biden, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other government leaders were meeting Monday for another negotiating session on the debt ceiling.


Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says June 1 is a hard deadline to avoid defaulting on U.S. bonds.


Meanwhile, Fed officials are sending mixed signals on the next rate move.


Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari is [in favor of holding interest rates unchanged](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-official-is-open-to-foregoing-june-rate-hike-ebb9c7c7?mod=economy_more_pos3)Â to assess the impact of past rate increases. Fed Chair Jerome Powell [sounded dovish Friday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-falls-as-debt-ceiling-worries-trump-jerome-powell-boost-foot-locker-hurts-this-group/).


But a few others won't rule out further tightening. And St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, perhaps the biggest hawk on the Fed, said [he wants two more quarter-point rate hikes](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-bullard-backs-two-more-hikes-359fb941) this year.

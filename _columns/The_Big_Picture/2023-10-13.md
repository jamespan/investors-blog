  Stock Market Sinks Broadly As Nasdaq Gets Rejected At Key Level, Triggering This Outlook Change

The stock market fell broadly on Friday, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average begged to differ with a tiny gain. Yet perhaps the real disappointment really stems not from the day's action, but from the entire week.




The Nasdaq composite led the sell-off with a 1.2% drop, with a more than 0.5% retreat by the S&P 500 and a 0.8% slide by the Russell 2000. Some sector indexes fared much worse. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones transportation average slumped 1.8%. At 14,699, this barometer of economic activity slid back under its long-term 200-day moving average, a negative sign.


Also, volume fell on both the Nasdaq exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.


During a broad decline, you'd much prefer to see turnover cool off. It indicates, most of the time, that institutional-class investors are not exiting stocks en masse.


Stock Market Today: Character Changes Again
-------------------------------------------



However, just one week after the Nasdaq composite issued a [new confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) in place with its strong [follow-through rally on Oct. 6](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-surge-despite-hot-jobs-report-triggers-this-fed-minutes-jerome-powell-inflation-data-looms/) — a move that came on the eighth day of a new rally attempt — you'd like to see the index pad its gains.


Instead, Friday's sell-off highlighted a weak spine among the bulls.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP101323-288x300.jpg)For starters, a daily chart shows how the Nasdaq lost a battle to climb above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), a key technical price level. In a healthy bull run, both key equity indexes and individual leaders in the stock market not only rise above their 50-day lines, but they lead them higher.


The Nasdaq's 50-day line continued to slope lower for a third straight week. Not bullish.


For sure, concerns of lingering inflation, the recent spike in crude oil prices following the surprise Hamas group attack on Israel, and the upcoming wave of third-quarter results are still weighing on investor sentiment. In fact, investors rushed back into long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The key 10-year bond's yield fell 8 basis points to 4.62%.


Second, at 13,407, the Nasdaq has now fallen a touch beneath the closing price of its Day 8 follow-through day. This alone does not determine that the new confirmed uptrend is dead. But the budding rally is now under pressure.

Lower Your Exposure
-------------------


Therefore, IBD readers should remain very cautious about taking on new positions. Plus, Friday's disappointing move spurred a change in guidance on stock market exposure to a 0%-20% level, down from 20%-40%.


Few stocks are making 52-week highs. This means that breakout opportunities remain sparse. On Friday, losers outpaced winners on the Nasdaq exchange by at least 5 to 3. On the NYSE, declining issues beat gainers by a more than 3-to-2 margin.


The day had at least one bright spot.



Money center banks in general dished up some decent third-quarter results. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) gained ground for the second week in a row. And its 2% weekly gain hoisted the megacap bank back above the 10-week moving average for the first time in nine weeks. Further, JPMorgan's rally helped the Dow Jones eke out a slim 0.1% rise Friday.


Strong growth in JPMorgan's banking and wealth management revenue — up 30%, excluding the assets it acquired from failed lender First Republic — increasing debit and credit card sales volume by 8%, and improving capital ratios likely impressed Wall Street. However, JPM is still in a base and has yet to break out.

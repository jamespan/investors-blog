title: Stock Market Extends Gains As Chip Stocks Fuel Nasdaq Rally

A 2.5% gain for the Philadelphia Semiconductor index Wednesday fueled another solid performance for the Nasdaq composite, but the stock market weakened late after a contentious meeting between President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over border security ended with Trump calling the meeting "a total waste of time."







Semiconductor stocks like **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) led the Nasdaq 100 with gains of 4% or more, but all four stocks are in various states of technical disrepair. Out of the four, Broadcom is clearly the healthiest at only 10% off its prior high.


The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.4% each. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added 0.9%. Nasdaq volume rose slightly, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE was also slightly higher than Tuesday's levels.


The Nasdaq is bumping up against its 50-day moving average, a potential resistance level to watch. The 50-day line can serve as a support level when a stock or index pulls back off highs, but it can also act as resistance after a period of recovery. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was getting resistance at the 50-day line in October before the bottom fell out.

China Names Soar
----------------


China-based growth stocks also outperformed, but many are damaged goods, like most chips stocks. **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) added nearly 7%, while **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) jumped 3.5%. But NetEase is still 24% off its high, and Alibaba is 28% off its high.


Other China names look a little better. New-issue **Bilibili** ([BILI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILI)) is close to clearing a Dec. 3 high at 16.74. **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), meanwhile, broke out with conviction over the 25 level. And don't forget about new-issue **Tencent Music** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)), which continues to work on an IPO base with an aggressive entry at 14.33. It's on the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) watch list.


Fed Minutes
-----------


The stock market didn't react much when the minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting were released around 2 p.m. ET. The minutes basically showed what the stock market already knows — that the Fed is taking a more cautious approach to future rate hikes.


Separately, U.S. crude oil futures gained ground for the eighth straight session, rising 5.2% to $52.36 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration reported a decline in weekly U.S. crude inventories. Another reason for oil's strength is the perception that trade talks with China are generally going well.


Stock Market Uncertainty
------------------------


The stock market certainly has a lot to worry about: A trade war with China. The possibility of an economic slowdown in the U.S. Sluggish corporate earnings.


But the S&P 500 flashed a sign of strength Friday with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) on the seventh day of its rally attempt. Prior follow-through days for the Nasdaq composite on Nov. 7 and Nov. 28 didn't amount to much. But it's always important to note when one occurs because no meaningful market uptrend has ever started without a follow-through.


The confirmed uptrend is looking pretty good, but for growth investors, actionable charts are still hard to come by.


Breakouts from top-rated growth stocks haven't exactly been a dime a dozen. Leaderboard stock **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) is an exception. An initial breakout attempt over the 89.92 buy point stuttered, but the breakout gained traction after Friday's follow-through. Outside of that, it's been slim pickings.


Bullish Setups In The Stock Market
----------------------------------


The good news is that setups are out there. Retailer **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) didn't break out of base, but it did break out over a trend line this week.


Meanwhile, ahead of next week's flurry of financial earnings, an India-based bank is a breakout candidate. **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) initially tried to break out from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 102.60 buy point but faded. A new handle shows a 104.60 entry. As a foreign bank, it hasn't been hit as hard as many U.S. financials amid a sharp decline in U.S. interest rates in November and December.


**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), meanwhile, is near the top of a flat base with a 119.94 entry.


[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Horizon Pharmaceuticals** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) is only 9% off its high as it works on a base with a 23.48 entry.

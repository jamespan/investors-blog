Stocks Keep Winning; These Bank Earnings Are On Tap
====================================================

Stock indexes kept to a narrow range Friday, as the S&P 500 and the Dow logged their fourth consecutive weekly gains.


The Nasdaq composite inched up 0.1% Friday, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average was flat. The small-cap Russell 2000 eased 0.1%. Volume fell across the board.




Small caps have led the market with an 11% gain since the market's Aug. 21 low. But for the week, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial led with a 1.6% gain.


Two stocks in the Dow logged 4% gains for the week â€” **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)). The Dow is a price-weighted index, and so Goldman chopped most of the wood and carried most of the water for the Dow's weekly gain.


Goldman has the second highest price in the 30-stock Dow, which gave clout to its 4% gain. Intel has the fourth lowest price in the Dow, which made its 4% gain less helpful.

Goldman is consolidating and is about 3% under its 255.25 buy point in a saucer base.


Notable Movers
--------------


Friday's session offered little excitement in the stock indexes, but there were some notable movers.


**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) stormed above the 5% buy zone after breaking out Sept. 27 in low volume. Volume was heavy Friday.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) broke out Thursday and padded the gain with a 1% pop Friday. The stock is in its 5% buy zone.


**General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) closed in its 20% to 25% profit-taking zone. Stocks will often begin to consolidate after such a gain.


Meanwhile, oil prices dropped almost 3% on fears of Tropical Storm Nate.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 ended their win streaks at eight, but some of the gains were razor thin. One concern in the market is that recent rallies haven't been able to rise either as smoothly or as long as the Nasdaq did from Jan. 3 through March 1.


Economic News
-------------


Before the opening bell Friday, the nonfarm payroll report for September was released. The Street expected a gain of 100,000 jobs. Instead, the payrolls dropped by 33,000. This was the first decline in seven years.


Banks To Report Q3 Results
--------------------------


The third-quarter earnings season will get cranking in the coming week. **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) reports Wednesday; **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), Thursday; and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), Friday.

Stocks Give Back Chunks Of Gains; Secondary Indicators Are In Conflict
=======================================================================

Stock indexes posted gains Thursday, but the sagging price pops and fading volume were action typical of a weak market. The Nasdaq ended basically flat after being up 1.5% at midday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.


The IBD 50 slipped 0.1%.


Volume fell across the board.


A handful of top-rated stocks ran ahead in brisk volume, but there were more leaders down in fast turnover than up.

One hopeful sign is the retreat of utility stocks in the past two sessions. On Jan. 12, utility stocks took over the Big Cap 20, occupying about half of the list.


In the past two days, however, the utilities in the Big Cap 20 have lost momentum.


**WEC Energy** ([WEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEC)), for example, was up as much as 6% this year but has trimmed the gain to 2%.


**Consolidated Edison** ([ED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ED)) was up about 8% but has cut that to 5% (and in bearishly rising volume).


Aggressive growth investors would prefer to see money coming out of defensive areas and into groups with more growth potential. For that to happen, though, stable market action is needed to rebuild conviction. Recently, the stock market has been anything but stable.


Wild swings have characterized the Nasdaq since July and August. An 18% slide those two months was echoed by an almost 17% drop in December and January. And it isn't clear if the current decline won't dive further.


Meanwhile, secondary indicators are flashing contradictory messages.


• **Bullish**: The put-call volume ratio has closed above the 1.2 level three times this year, which sometimes indicates a market bottom is either in or near.


• **Bearish**: Only 15% of NYSE stocks were above their 200-day line going into Thursday's trade.


• **Bullish**: Bearish advisers outnumber bullish advisers, a condition which sometimes precedes a market uptrend.


• **Bearish**: Food and utilities held the top seven slots among industry groups going into Thursday's session. No bull expects lasting market leadership there.


So what to believe?


As always, the price and volume action of the major indexes themselves settle all arguments. And the word now is correction.


News was generally positive Thursday. The European Central Banks stood pat on interest rates, which pleased the Street, and ECB President Mario Draghi hinted at additional stimulus measures .

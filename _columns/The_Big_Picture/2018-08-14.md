The stock market climbed broadly Tuesday in an indication that indexes' previous wobbly days were merely another short-term dip.




The Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% and just about erased the losses of the previous two sessions. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to end a four-day losing streak. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.4%. Indexes closed near session highs, a favorable sign as they try to bounce back.


Small caps also led, with the Russell 2000 up 1% and the S&P 600 1.3% higher to make a record high.


Nasdaq volume rose and was lower on the NYSE. Advancers led decliners by 13-to-5 on the NYSE and by 12-to-7 on the Nasdaq. Only 23 of 197 industry groups fell, and a dozen rose 2% or more.


Retail stocks topped the industry performance Tuesday. Department stores, auto parts chains, consumer electronics, apparel and drugstores were the five best performing groups, rising 2.9% to 3.8%. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) rose 2.3% and is following through from a breakout to new high.

The luxury handbags and accessories company, formerly known as Coach, beat estimates and gave a bullish revenue forecast.


The market is making moderate gains and declines this summer, and the behavior of the past several days suggests this is another short-term pullback. As [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-put-call/) noted, the up/down volume ratio hit 1.11 on Friday. That's an elevated level of investor fear, and close to the readings that have marked index lows.


Even while the broad market has been bumpy, leading stocks are standing firm. Few have collapsed and fresh leaders have emerged.


The IBD 50 rose 1% Tuesday despite that the biggest move on the list was an 8% plunge in **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)). The Chinese delivery service fell back below the 50-day moving average in a broad sell-off for Chinese stocks.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is up more than 17% this year, beating the Nasdaq's 14% gain and the Russell 2000's 10.2% increase. But the IBD 50 is more than 3% below its prior high, a bigger lag than the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Russell 2000. Those indexes are within 1% of new highs.


The IBD 50's lag can be traced to its July 24 peak. Since then, [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) has fallen 0.8% and the S&P 500 is up 0.5%. The Nasdaq is up 0.4%. Yet, the difference seems to be just part of a rotation.


Bad earnings reactions hit some IBD 50 companies that were on the list in July.


**TechTarget** ([TTGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTGT)) and **Kemet** ([KEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEM)), which were on the July 30 IBD 50, dropped off the list after steep declines. **Huazhu Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), **Supernus** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)), **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) and **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) also dropped out.


How The IBD 50 Shifts
---------------------


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is sensitive to market trends, and while some stocks fall by the wayside, others are appearing. Health care and technology stocks have rotated into the market leadership.


**Nanometrics** ([NANO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NANO)), in the chip equipment group, is a new winner. **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)), a rental software provider, is forming a base. **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) makes medical research equipment. **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) is forming a flat base.


While most of the market was in good spirits Tuesday, [Chinese stocks were punished](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/china-internet-stocks-quarterly-earnings/). Retail sales in July reportedly came in lower than expected, and Turkey's financial crisis seems to be hurting emerging markets.


**Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) reversed sharply lower, sinking deeper below its 50-day line. The provider of services for e-commerce reported a revenue increase of 31% in local currency and adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share, topping views of 13 cents.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) fell nearly 3%, swimming deeper below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. New issue **Huya** ([HUYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUYA)) plunged 16% after earnings matched views but the [livestreaming company gave weak guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/huya-earnings-report-revenue-guidance-huya-stock/) on Q3 revenue.


**YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)), the parent company of Huya, gapped down to a loss of 14%. YY beat profit estimates late Monday, but Q3 revenue guidance was light.

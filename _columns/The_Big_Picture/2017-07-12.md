  Nasdaq Leads Gains; Which Sector May Point To A Faster Economy?

If you're still an equities bear, you certainly didn't like Wednesday's market action.


The Nasdaq led the major indexes again. Leading stocks flexed their strength. Sector indexes impressed (think the Dow transports). And volume lifted higher, albeit mildly so, on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.




In other words, the market still seems to favor the upside, climbing a thick wall of worry. That wall is built upon concerns ranging from an investigation into the Trump campaign's connections with Russia, to what impact rising interest rates would have on the modestly growing U.S. economy, to whether President Trump will in fact make good on his many promises to accelerate growth.


Want another notable statistic that shows investor worry? The stubbornness of this bull run.


Senior market strategist Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial notes that the S&P 500 hasn't shown a 5% decline on a closing basis for more than a year, the longest streak since 1995. It's only the sixth such occurrence since 1950.


Boosted by hefty demand in the semiconductor, software and internet spaces of the market, the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.1% on Wednesday. Both the gap up in price and a high finish within the day's trading range painted the session in bullish colors. Plus, the Nasdaq's move outran gains of 0.7% for the S&P 500 and 0.6% for the Dow Jones industrial average.


The worst industry group of the day was a defensive one: Dairy products slipped more than 3%.


Among the 14 IBD industry groups and subgroups that rallied 2% or more for the day, seven came from the computer, electronics and chip sectors. The other big gainers were solar energy, airlines, foreign banks, auto retail, and health care services.

**IBD's TAKE:** *How do you track sector rotation on a day-to-day basis? Here are four steps. One, look at the daily performance of all [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-jul-12-2017/) as seen in the [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). Two, check the action of the top half-dozen sectors within the [IBD stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jul-12-2017/), which are divided into 33 sectors and ranked by mid- and long-term performance. Three, check out the [Stocks On The Move tool](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx), both on the upside and downside. Four, monitor changes within the IBD 50.*

So, what could help stocks conquer the wall of worry in the near term? It may be the next wave of earnings results over the next several weeks.


Among S&P 500 firms, earnings grew 15% vs. year-ago levels in the first quarter. LPL Financial notes that big rates of profit gains will get harder because the first quarter of last year served as the trough in overall earnings.


However, keep in mind that a lot of that had to do with the tremendous plunge in oil companies' fundamentals. Dow Jones component **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), for instance, posted net losses in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first two quarters of 2016. What does the Street see in Q2? Earnings of 95 cents a share, vs. a 78-cent loss in Q2 2016.


Indeed, LPL points to several positives for the new earnings season. One, the ratio of companies preannouncing negative Q2 results vs. positive preannouncements is at 1.9, much better than 2.3 in the year-ago quarter and the 20-year average of 2.7.


These statistics are "suggesting a high percentage of companies could exceed estimates again," LPL wrote in a recent note. "An impressive 75% of companies exceeded consensus estimates in the first quarter, leading to a 5% overall upside surprise."

The Dow industrials were not the only popular average to strike all-time new high ground. The Dow Jones transportation average, with big help from trucking and airline issues, rose 1.2%, and its session high of 9727 was good enough to eclipse past new highs.


Dow theorists in the stock market today like to emphasize how important it is to see the Dow transports rise in parallel form with the other major benchmarks. The reason: Demand for shares in shipping, trucking and airline stocks give a big hint that at the ground level, economic activity is rising.


Some Wall Street observers have brushed off the dismal 1.2% increase in first-quarter U.S. GDP, due in part to statistical factors and a recent trend that shows activity picking up steam in the second quarter.


But perhaps more urgently, the astute investor always keeps a finger on the pulse of corporate earnings. This week is still quiet on that front. However, more than two weeks ago **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) vaulted over 8% in big turnover after posting its biggest quarterly EPS increase (89 cents a share, up 10%) in more than three years.


Since the end of 2014, the database and cloud-based software giant had moved sideways, essentially sitting out the market's advance. But four weeks, ago, the big-cap stock saw a character change. The 13% blast higher in the week ended June 23 gave Oracle the muscle to break out of an aircraft carrier-sized saucer with handle at 47.09.



Notice how volume during that week was the heaviest in two years. Not all of that had to be [short-covering](https://www.investors.com/short-selling/).


At 50.45, Oracle (90 Composite, 84 RS, A Accumulation/Distribution on [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-oracle-corp-orcl.aspx)) is now up 7.1% from the proper entry.


Whoever is in the White House, whatever party dominates in Congress, it's earnings and the prospect of stable, increasing profits that matter.


So does a feeling of certainty regarding monetary policy. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appeared to provide fund managers with such a feeling. Reuters reported that her testimony on Capitol Hill appeared to strengthen the belief that future hikes in the fed funds rate will continue to be gradual, and that later this year the Fed will signal a start disposing of the bonds and mortgage-backed securities on its massive balance sheet.


Strategists at Regions Asset Management, part of the Birmingham, Ala., superregional **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)), believe that the yield curve is poised to stabilize or even steepen a bit. For one, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond has had a difficult time going below 2.15%, as seen in recent weeks.


"Next, investor positioning surveys indicate that those wanting to own bonds are already overweight, and few incremental net buyers of bonds remain; in short, buyers of bonds have exhausted their dry powder," Regions Asset wrote in a Monday note.


On Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield finished around 2.32%, 30 basis points below its 52-week high of 2.62%, while the 3-month yield is at 1.04%.

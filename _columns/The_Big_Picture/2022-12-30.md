Stock market indexes ended 2022 on a mixed note Friday, as relentless tax selling kept Santa Claus stuck in snowdrifts at the North Pole. At least investors can now breathe a sigh of relief because no two market years produce the same sets of winners and losers.




The S&P 500 lost 19.4% of its value in 2022. The Nasdaq posted a horrific 33.1% loss while the Dow Jones Industrial Average held up the best, down "just" 8.8%.


Friday volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared lower on the NYSE as investors turned their attention to the long holiday weekend. The Dow closed just below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) after briefly mounting it earlier in the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also remain below their 50-day lines.


All major benchmarks trimmed modest intraday losses into the close. The Nasdaq trimmed a loss of about 1.5% to 0.1%. The S&P 500 closed less than 0.3% lower, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%.


The 10-year Treasury yield gained 4 basis points to 3.88%. Crude oil ticked higher as well, closing above $80 per barrel, but natural gas fell more than 3% to $4.41.


Earlier this week, IBD lowered its outlook to "market in correction" after a string of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), signaling skepticism about price action in the first quarter of 2023. We recommend that investors stay on the sidelines, only taking advantage of the most-perfect technical plays. It's also wise to keep notes on January price action to see what's working and what's not in the new year.


Waiting On The January Effect
-----------------------------


Tax-loss selling is finally over but January price action often generates a symbiotic response, popularly known as the January Effect.

Stock market investors tend to sell their biggest prior year winners in the first weeks of January, to raise cash for beaten-down value plays. Small caps are often the greatest recipients of this long-observed market phenomenon but we can add tech stocks to the list after their worst year since the 2008 market crash.


However, growth stocks may underperform for a second year in a row because the Fed's aggressive rate trajectory is showing no signs of reaching the elusive pivot, when they turn back toward rate cuts. In fact, their obsession with 2% inflation could delay that turnaround into 2024, or beyond, because we might not see that level again in our lifetimes.


Old-timers will tell you that inflation cycles are long waves, shifting over decades, rather than years. The regrowth period after 2009 gave us ideal conditions for historically low interest rates, fueled by quantitative easing. The Fed bought back Treasuries at an alarming rate during those years and now has to dump the debt back into world markets, whether they like it or not.


Massive government stimulus during and after the pandemic flipped the debt equation, perhaps permanently. Massive liquidity and supply disruptions combined to awaken the inflation genie and central banks could easily fail in their efforts to stuff it back into the bottle.


As a result, we may have to live with higher inflation that's closer to norms set back in the 1970s and 1980s.Â That translates into traditional mortgages between 6% and 9%, and credit card interest in deep-double digits.


What To Do With Growth Stocks In 2023
-------------------------------------


Everyone will be thinking about tech stocks in early 2023, wanting to "buy the dip." But these issues may not perform well in coming years, at least in comparison with the last decade.


Layoffs and cost cutting are just starting in Silicon Valley and other tech-heavy locations, and getting rid of the fat could take years. That will impede growth and make it harder for these companies to maintain rapid growth trajectories.


So what should investors buy in 2023?


It's still hard to ignore defensive plays, even though consumer staples like **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) and **Kellogg** ([K](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=K)) are coming off their best annual performance in years. Dividends make perfect sense in the current environment as well, perhaps allowing these sleepy plays to book a second year of superior performance.


However, these safe havens were cheap at the start of 2022, but are quite expensive now.


Energy and commodities also look attractive in 2023, with crude oil finding support in the $70s and natural resources becoming more scarce, due to macro and political catalysts. Commodity cycles tend to last for decades and the reawakening of inflation bodes well for metals, fuels, grains and meats.


Stock Market: Friday Movers
---------------------------


**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) retreated on the last trading day of 2022, dropping 1.3% after Argus downgraded the Idaho memory giant to hold. The firm expects the chipmaker to post "deep operating losses over the next few quarters." MU stock lost more than 46% in 2022 and is trading near September's bear market low in the upper 40s.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) added more than a buck and is trading about 15 points above the past week's bear market low. The end of tax-selling season could stoke speculative interest in early January but investors are looking at CEO Elon Musk to grab hold of the helm and deliver a bona fide recovery plan.

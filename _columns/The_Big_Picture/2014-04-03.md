============================================

Stocks headed south Thursday, but declining volume eased the sting.

  

The Nasdaq rubbed out 0.9%, or about a third of its four-day advance, while the S&P 500 erased 0.1%. The IBD 50 shed 1.8%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

The lower volume was a relief to the bulls because it suggested that funds weren't selling aggressively.

  

Biotechs, however, fell hard again, which was a reason the Nasdaq did worse. The selling suggests that money could be rotating out of this group. Since funds build positions slowly, it may take some time to see clearly where the money is going.

  

For now, individual investors should watch for breakouts from top-rated stocks.

  

The chief focus, though, should be on the price-and-volume action of the major indexes.

  

If an uptrend is to succeed, down days must come in weakening volume. Thursday's lower volume was welcome in that respect.

  

The Nasdaq on March 27 bottomed near the 100-day moving average â€” an area that now has ended pullbacks four times in the past 12 months. Since that low on March 27, the market has flashed no signs of institutional selling.

  

The 100-day line isn't as widely followed as other moving averages. But when the market keeps sending the same signal, it's good to listen. A week ago, the Big Picture noted that brushing the 100-day line marked Nasdaq lows in April, June and February.

  

At least for now, it appears the Nasdaq has done it again.

  

However, even if the lows turn out to be set, the bad news is that the advances after those pullbacks have been relatively restrained.

  

With the market in an uptrend, how does that alter the individual investor's strategy?

  

The individual investor might look for the earliest entry possible into a stock. Support at the 50-day line, a three-weeks-tight pattern or a shakeout plus three can get a position established quickly.

  

While the market pullback wasn't long enough to carve many bases, a few stocks that broke out are still in the 5% buy zone. They include **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)), **Lazard** ([LAZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAZ)), **Ameriprise Financial** ([AMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMP)), **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)), **Core Laboratories** ([CLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLB)) and **ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)).

  

Stocks near their 50-day lines include **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) and **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).

  

One breakout that triggered the 8% sell rule Thursday was that of **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)). The stock dropped 9% below a 35.09 entry.

  

Economic news was mostly disappointing but not hard-hitting.

  

First-time jobless claims were somewhat worse than expected, according to Econoday. The PMI services index was above the consensus estimate, but the ISM nonmanufacturing index narrowly missed the target.

  

Payroll and jobless figures for March will be released before the market's open Friday.

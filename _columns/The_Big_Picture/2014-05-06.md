Stocks took a big step back Tuesday, erasing all of Monday's big rebound and raising new questions about the market's rally attempt.

  

The Nasdaq slumped 1.4%, marking its biggest loss in more than a week. **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) dropped 2% and neared its 200-day line. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) lost 1%. New issue **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) plunged to a record low as its lockup period expired.

  

Software, telecom, Internet and chip-related industry groups were among Tuesday's worst-performing industry groups, which helped explain the tech-heavy Nasdaq's poorer performance.

  

The S&P 500 fell a milder 0.9%. Still, financials were hard hit as **American International Group** ([AIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIG)) reported lower Q1 results. **The Financial Select Sector SPDR** ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) ETF tumbled 1.4%. But energy stocks helped offset weakness in financials.

  

Small caps were the hardest hit, as the Russell 2000 swooned 1.6% and closed below its 200-day moving average.

  

After Monday's big upside reversal, the market got no follow-on strength. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 progressively worsened from a lower open and closed right at their session lows, as investors shunned risky assets.

  

Volume climbed sharply across the board on both major exchanges from Monday's soft pace. Losing issues trounced winners by nearly 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq and more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE.

  

Leading stocks had a rough day. The IBD 50 dived 1.6%.

  

**Alliance Fiber Optic Products** ([AFOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFOP)) fell for the second straight session in heavy trading. It has now pared a 15% gain from a 17.91 buy point to 3%.

  

**Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)) reversed lower and a snapped a six-day winning streak. Despite this, the stock appears to still be building a base. 

  

**Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) blew past a 65.93 buy point from a flat base in huge trade. The chip designer will join the benchmark S&P 500 after Wednesday's close.

  

As the correction drags on, the market is dealing with many cross currents. The S&P 500 is only 1.5% off its April record high. But a rally attempt that started April 15 hasn't seen a confirmation signal.

  

A number of breakouts are taking place, but the results have been mixed. For example, **AerCap** ([AER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AER)), **AmTrust Financial Services** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)) and **Westlake Chemical** ([WLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLK)) are doing fine after recently clearing buy points.

  

But **Manitowoc** ([MTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTW)), **Iconix** ([ICON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICON)) and **Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)) haven't made headway from their entries.

  

Worries about Ukraine continue to pressure stocks. Also, earnings reports are still rolling in, which adds to market volatility.

  

In this indecisive environment, keep your powder dry and let the market tell you which way it wants to go. In the meantime, continue to work on your watch list.

Tech stocks led a stock market rally Thursday, as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) snapped back from a weak start to the year. Meanwhile, market leaders **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) and **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) made bullish moves.




A trio of economic announcements came out Thursday morning. First was the Labor Department's first-time jobless claims. Claims surprisingly dropped to 187,000. They were expected to rise to 206,000 vs. 202,000 in the previous week.


"With initial jobless and continuing claims remaining low (and below consensus), there seems to be no signs of a collapse in the labor market and that is good news for those that believe the economy will continue to expand and that a recession will be averted for this year as well," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, in a note to clients.


Housing starts and building permit data from the Commerce Department came out mixed. Housing starts in December fell to 1.46 million annualized vs. 1.56 million in November. And permits in December rose to 1.495 million vs. 1.46 million in November, indicating optimism about future demand.


The [Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-011824/card/philly-fed-s-factory-activity-marks-another-contraction-TTieTQJUlz1fUqd2UgKQ) fell to -10.6 in January, indicating declining activity in those regions.


In response to that mixed economic data, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.14%, extending its gains above the 4% level.


Key Earnings Movers
-------------------


Key earnings movers Thursday came via results from **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)), **Fastenal** ([FAST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAST)), **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)), **M&T Bank** ([MTB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTB)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)).

Alcoa stock dropped 1.6%, while FAST stock rallied 7.2% to hit new highs. KeyCorp shares faltered 4.6%, and MTB stock climbed 1.5%.


Taiwan Semiconductor surged nearly 10% after [beating earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-forecasts-return-to-sales-growth-in-q1/) and saying it expects to return to sales growth in the current quarter. For the first quarter, TSMC expects revenue of $18 billion to $18.8 billion. The midpoint of $18.4 billion topped Wall Street's target of $18.27 billion. In the first quarter of last year, TSMC generated revenue of $16.62 billion.


TSM stock broke out past a 105.52 buy point in a cup with handle and was a catalyst in the tech sector leading the market.

------------------


The major stock indexes closed near session highs, overcoming an early-afternoon pullback.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5%, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied nearly 1.4%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 moved up nearly 0.6%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Inside the Dow, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) was the top performer, while Apple and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) were at the front of the pack as well. [Boeing shares rebounded](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-gains-as-budding-indian-airline-orders-150-737-max-jets/) 4.2%, still more than 20% off their 52-week high following big losses since the start of the year. And Intel gained 1.5%, finding support at its 10-week line.


On the downside, **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) dropped 1.6% in sympathy with other managed health care stocks. **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) dived to a nearly two-year low Thursday after [slashing its earnings outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/humana-stock-falls-ill-on-this-warning-unh-cvs-catch-virus/) and reporting lackluster growth in its Medicare Advantage plans in the 2024 enrollment period. The stock trimmed its loss to 1.6% at the close.


Among the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rallied to more record highs, extending further above a flat base's 505.48 buy point. But **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) skidded 1.7%, reaching its lowest close since Nov. 9.

What To Do Now
--------------


The Nasdaq is looking to finally decisively clear resistance around 15,000, a key psychological level to watch. And over on the S&P 500, the 4,800 level is acting as a potential ceiling.


With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 just off new highs, IBD recommends an exposure level of 80% to 100%. That means scanning the daily market action for new breakouts and strong rebounds from key support levels.


A great resource for finding daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks topping buy points. In Thursday's list, there were four breakouts, including **Elastic** ([ESTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESTC)) and **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)).


Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows a handful of stocks nearing buy points in bases. For example, **Gartner** ([IT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IT)) is approaching a 469.58 flat-base entry.

Stock Market Leaders: Apple, DraftKings, Spotify
------------------------------------------------



Several stock market leaders were near crucial areas in Thursday's market action.


Apple rallied 3.3%, buoyed by Taiwan Semi's optimistic guidance. AAPL stopped just short of its 50-day line. A sharp move above that level would likely present an early buying opportunity. Meanwhile, a new flat base is close to finishing.


DraftKings jumped 7% after [UBS said that the company](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/draftkings-ibd-stock-of-the-day-leaps-above-50-day-line-during-rally-toward-buy-point/) should sustain a high online sports betting (OSB) market share. DKNG bullishly regained its 50-day line, placing the sports-betting giant in a new buy area. A cup base has an official buy trigger at 39.35. DraftKings is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/draftkings-ibd-stock-of-the-day-leaps-above-50-day-line-during-rally-toward-buy-point/).


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Spotify rallied 3.1%, breaking out past a 202.88 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Spotify was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) during the session's bullish move.

Stocks staked out nice gains early Friday, but the bears once again wrested away a large portion of the increase. 


The Nasdaq settled for a 0.1% gain, giving back most of a 1.3% pop. The S&P 500 held onto about half of its 1% late-morning advance, closing with a 0.5% gain.


The IBD 50 added 0.2%.


Volume fell across the board.


Advancing issues led decliners by a 9-4 ratio on the NYSE. Losers, though, had a tiny advantage on the Nasdaq.


Despite the lower volume and reversing action, the session technically defined the start of an attempted rally on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.


Any kind of a gain in any volume can launch an attempted rally. Volume becomes a deciding factor only on a follow-through day.


A follow-through day, which involves a sizable gain in rising volume, would confirm that a new uptrend is under way. Except in rare instances, a follow-through day can't come before Day 4 of an attempted rally.


A second way to end a correction is via a new high in a major index, which would signal a resumed uptrend. This looks more likely at the moment, at least for the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is 1.4% off its recent high. The Nasdaq is 5% off its high.


Until a green signal is flashed, individual investors should avoid purchases. Raising cash and working on watch lists are the safest approaches.


In Friday's IBD, this column noted that the Nasdaq had a brush with its 100-day moving average. In April, June and February, the 100-day brush was the precursor to four- to six-week advances.


While the Nasdaq's weak action Friday raised doubts whether that pattern will repeat, it's too early to render a judgment.


Patience at this juncture is important. There's no need to risk capital until the correction is in the rear-view mirror.


April could provide a more normalized view of the market. The end of the quarter usually involves some window dressing, which can distort late March action in individual stocks.


Leaders snoozed Friday, with few moving up or down in big volume.


Economic news also was on the sleepy side. Personal income for February was better than expected, but consumer spending was in line with views. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for March fell short of the Street's estimate.


For the week, the IBD 50 staggered to a 5.8% loss. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell 2.8% and 0.5% respectively.


Industry groups showed oil and software stocks going in opposite directions. The seven best performers for the week were retail electronics, foreign banks, hospitals and four oil groups. The seven worst for the week were biomed, media periodicals, telecom infrastructure and four software-related groups.

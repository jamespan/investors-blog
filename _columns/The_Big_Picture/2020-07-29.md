Stock Market Rallies On Bullish Earnings, Dovish Fed; 3 Chip Stocks Surge Late On Earnings
===========================================================================================

Sometimes, it's strong economic data that puts the stock market in a good mood. Other times, it's a dovish Federal Reserve statement that lifts markets. The stock market definitely got the latter Wednesday. But it also got another strong round of earnings reports, including bullish results from **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)).




The Federal Reserve's two-day meeting concluded Wednesday, and [Fed Chair Jerome Powell](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-july-fed-chief-jerome-powell-dow-jones/) gave the stock market exactly what it wanted when he reiterated policymakers' commitment to use their "full range of tools to support the U.S. economy."


The Russell 2000 small-cap index led the way, up 2.1%, and the Nasdaq composite added nearly 1.4%. After Tuesday's [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/), the S&P 500 bounced 1.2%. The benchmark index closed just above its 10-day moving average and just off last week's high near 3280. Nasdaq volume rose, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Tuesday, more so on the NYSE.


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was a top performer in the Dow Jones, up 2% to 306.68. It closed just below a 311.07 buy point. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has started to trend higher, but it's still off highs.


Growth Stocks Lead The Way
--------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP072920-227x300.jpg)Growth stocks carried the leadership baton again Wednesday, with 10 Leaderboard stocks up 2% or more. Meanwhile, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is getting into position for another move to new highs. The exchange traded fund, which tracks the performance of [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) growth stocks, added 1.6% to 36.56.


Wednesday's after-hours yielded three big earnings movers in the semiconductor sector: **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) showed gains of 5% to 12%. Lam Research is extended past a proper buy area, but Qorvo and Qualcomm were near buy points headed into results. Both rose sharply after the close.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The S&P now shows five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) in less than a month. But it's nothing more than a yellow flag at this point, because the stock market has shown in the past it can do well with an elevated distribution-day count. The count for the Nasdaq is relatively light at three, but two of those days showed declines of at least 2%.


The biggest feather in the market's cap at this point is the decidedly bullish price action of leading growth stocks.



Despite some yellow flags, leading growth stocks continue to hold their own — and then some. Big stock market leaders like **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Sea Limited** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)), **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)) and **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)) are working on [flag formations](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-tesla-stock-rally-high-tight-flag-base/) after huge gains post-breakout.


Other top stocks are finding support at their 10-week moving average, including software leaders like **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) and **Avalara** ([AVLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVLR)), as well as China-based leaders like **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)).

Base breakouts are getting harder to come by, but Thursday's session yielded three, fueled by strong earnings reports. Chip designer **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) cleared an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/) with conviction. The buy point was 255.79, 10 cents above its July 13 intraday high. In the security software group, **Tenable** ([TENB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TENB)) gapped out a consolidation with a 32.20 entry. **Scotts Miracle-Gro** ([SMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMG)) move powerfully out of a cup base with a 151.13 buy point.


For now, it's OK to give your big winners more room to work. But taking the foot off the accelerator and trimming some winning positions also makes sense.


Bullish Sentiment Edges Higher
------------------------------


The latest Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a small rise in bullish sentiment to 57.3%, up from 56.7% the prior week. The latest reading is near the mid-January high of 59.4%, which came just ahead of a 8.4% pullback for the index in February.


According to Investors Intelligence, readings above 55% call for defensive measures, including tighter stops and trimming some of your big winners. Readings above 60% increase the chances for a market decline. In September 2018, the bulls hit 61.8% just ahead of sharp pullback for the S&P 500 in the first half of October.

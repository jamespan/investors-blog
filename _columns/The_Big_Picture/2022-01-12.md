Stock Market Climbs Despite Hottest Inflation Rate In 40 Years; What's Next?
=============================================================================

The stock market held its ground Wednesday, even though the inflation rate jumped to the highest level in 40 years.




After two days of strong upside reversals since testing its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/), the Nasdaq was due for a breather. At Monday's low, the tech-heavy index had fallen more than 10% from its Nov. 22 peak.


But it also erased a 2.7% loss to close slightly higher that day. It then followed that up by turning an early 0.7% loss into a 1.4% gain by Tuesday's close.


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq rushed 1% higher before pulling back to settle for a 0.2% gain. While its action this week has been mostly encouraging, the index must first retake its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) before even trying for gains this year.


The S&P 500 staged similar upside reversals Monday and Tuesday, but is showing overall healthier action. It bounced back above its 50-day line on Tuesday and remains well above its 200-day average. The benchmark index led Wednesday with a 0.3% gain and is now just 2% away from its Jan. 4 high.


Inflation Hits 40-Year High
---------------------------


Inflation was the hot topic of the day after the U.S. consumer price index jumped 7% in December from a year ago. That marked the [fastest pace since 1982](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-december-2021-11641940760?mod=hp_lead_pos1) and fell just short of Econoday's forecast for a 7.1% increase. The core price index (excluding food and energy costs) rose 5.5% in December from the prior year, hitting a 31-year high.

Despite the sharp increase, the CPI didn't rattle Wall Street. The major indexes still closed in positive territory; the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased 2 basis points to 1.73%.


"U.S. stocks initially rallied after the latest reading of consumer prices showed the biggest gains since 1982, but was nevertheless, in line with expectations," said Edward Moya, Oanda senior market analyst. "Wall Street was worried that a much hotter inflation report could have not only cemented four Fed rate hikes this year, but potentially made the May FOMC meeting a possibility for when the balance sheet runoff could start."


In testimony before the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell assured lawmakers the central bank will bring inflation under control. He said the need for aggressive monetary stimulus is over.


On Wednesday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester repeated her [backing for an interest rate hike](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/fed-s-mester-says-case-for-removing-policy-support-compelling) in March. Mester and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard are among officials saying the Fed could raise rates [three to four times this year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-s-bullard-four-interest-rate-rises-in-2022-now-appear-likely-11642017785), starting in March.


Stock Market Laggards: Small Caps
---------------------------------


Small caps lagged sharply as the Russell 2000 fell 0.8%. Yet growth stocks showed resilience as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.9%. Tech stocks tracked by Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) climbed 0.5%, while iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) added 0.4%.


In the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), rare earths miner **MP Materials** ([MP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MP)) rallied 4% to reenter the 20% profit-taking range from a 40.78 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a cup base.



**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) rose nearly 5% to add to Tuesday's upside reversal. But on Monday, the chip gear maker's stock triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) entry cleared in late December.


**Zim Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) gained almost 3% to a new high, extending its win streak for a fifth session. Shares are now extended past a 58.41 alternative buy point. Zim was featured as Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/zim-stock-breaks-out-alibaba-shipping-partner-rising-volumes-fuel-huge-profit-growth/).


Other IBD 50 winners included several building-related stocks. **West Fraser Timber** ([WFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFG)), **Commercial Metals** ([CMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMC)) and **Louisiana Pacific** ([LPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPX)) advanced from 3% to 5% each.


Electric-vehicle makers **Xpeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rallied late to join the top gainers.


What To Do Now
--------------


With the market uptrend still under pressure, investors should remain cautious. Lock in gains if a stock reaches the 20% target goal and pay close attention to any sell signals.


The stock market is rebounding from a tough first week of the year. Note that the VIX [hit a market bottoming signal](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) on Monday. So far, that's proved to be true. Volatility tends to spike when fear rules Wall Street. And that typically occurs as the major indexes find a bottom and head north.


The indexes pared gains Wednesday, but managed to close modestly higher. And all but one of the 11 S&P sectors rose. Materials, consumer discretionary and technology led the upside. Health care was the only holdout.


While the indexes have shown better action this week, it's important to be patient. Wait for the stock market to return to a [confirmed uptrend](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/action-plans/). Keep your watchlists updated and ready.

  Stocks Cool Off As Fed Stays Put; Are Equities Still Superior To Bonds?

Stocks continued to cool moderately on Wednesday, and the pullback is mostly what a bullish investor would expect to see after a couple weeks' of hefty gains.


This week is not only heavy in quarterly corporate results, but also in key measures of the economy. On Wednesday, the ADP report on private sector job growth (up 177,000 in April, slightly ahead of the Econoday consensus estimate of 170,000 jobs added) set up reasonable expectations that Friday's [April payrolls report](http://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) will lack big surprises.

But most indexes lifted nicely off their late-morning lows and finished well in the upper half of the day's ranges.


Such action is positive for the bulls, even though the Nasdaq composite dropped nearly 0.4% while the S&P 500 surrendered less than 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrials, on the back of 1-point gains by at least five of the average's 30 components, eked out a microgain.


Volume rose slightly on both the Nasdaq and on the Big Board, the old nickname for the NYSE. This meant the Nasdaq picked up another distribution day, or session of unusually intense professional selling. As such, the total count goes up to five from three on Tuesday, due to the fact that an April 19 stalling session also now gets counted.


Still, while the quantity of distribution remains high, consider this: On the three traditional declines in heavier volume on the Nasdaq, the average drop is a mild -0.4%.


Some professional investors take the view that for 2017, the continued rise in the cost of money (i.e., interest rates) will be slow. That's good for equities.


"If you are really positive (about the prospects) on tax reform . . . and if there's progress on deregulation and infrastructure, then you would see rates (on the 10-year Treasury bond) go up to 3%," Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, said in an exclusive interview with IBD at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills earlier this week. PGI manages $255 billion in mutual fund assets and is part of the financial services giant **Principal Financial Group** ([PFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFG)).


McCaughan adds it's "more likely to see rates stuck at 2.3% to 2.6% if we don't see a very strong, coherent execution of a growth agenda." He expects the Fed to kick the fed funds rate up one or two more times this year. With rates on the long end unlikely to change much, such actions are going to likely lead to a flattening of the yield curve. But it's not likely to cause an inversion of the curve, which typically sounds the death knell for the economy.
Principal Financial has been featured several times over the past two years as a top dividend play in The Income Investor. The Des Moines, Iowa-based company features an annualized yield of 2.8%, far better than the S&P 500.


The fed funds rate, for now, stays at 0.75% to 1%, well below the 5.25% level seen from June 2006 to August 2007, or nearly 10 years ago.


In the meantime, McCaughan says he's advising clients to maintain a positive view on equities by putting capital to work on future setbacks by the major indexes.


Asked if equities still look good vs. corporate and government bond yields in terms of the S&P 500's forward-looking earnings yield, McCaughan said, "Absolutely. U.S. equities are not anywhere close to a structural overvaluation. Since the middle of 2016, growth in earnings have really been quite well."


The current strength in equities is due to "the wonderful performance of our U.S. corporate sector," McCaughan added.


The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond inched up to 2.31%, according to Tradeweb, but still remains far off its mid-March near-term peak of 2.62%. The 12-month forward earnings yield for the S&P 500 remains well north of 5%.


Judging by IBD's specially screened new high list in recent weeks, the market seems to be telling alert investors that strength in sales, earnings and other fundamental measures appears to be coming back in sectors that had sort of sat out the strong gains in November and December after President Trump's shock victory.


For instance, take a look at Monday's new high list (194 hit new highs on the Nasdaq, 165 on the NYSE); the Medical sector led the way with 30 stocks, followed by Leisure, Software and Retail (15 stocks each) and Chips (at 7).


Six months ago, you would have seen small, superregional and "bulge bracket" Wall Street banks crowding the pinnacle of IBD's new high list. Pay special attention to those with high EPS Ratings, as they get boldfaced in IBD's list (see the list every day at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com).

Elsewhere in the stock market, the S&P SmallCap 600 sank nearly 0.7%, while the Russell 2000 gave up 0.6%. After enjoying hot gains in 2016, small caps are still underperforming since Jan. 1.


Some stocks are round-tripping from buy points. But money is flowing more into retail and consumer names.

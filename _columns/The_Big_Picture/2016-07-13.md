Nasdaq Eases, Still Holds Above 5000; Dow Transports Roll Higher Again

Savvy investors likely expected the market to take a pause Wednesday. As far as pauses go, the session played a friendly tune.


The Nasdaq composite halted a five-day winning streak, but Wednesday's 0.3% decline was barely a door ding against a cumulative 4.1% rally that started on July 6. The Nasdaq 100 inched just 0.3% lower.


Despite a 4% plunge in West Texas intermediate near-term oil futures, sparked apparently by the latest weekly report on U.S. oil and fuel supplies, other major indexes took the news in stride. The S&P 500 edged less than 1 point higher. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.1%. Volume sank on both major exchanges.


Thanks in part to the sell-off in crude, the Dow transports rose nearly 0.7%. As noted in an [intraday column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stocks-cool-after-dow-industrials-new-high-will-the-dow-transports-follow/) on market action, this index has been lagging the Dow industrials but is positive for the year. The Dow utilities rebounded 0.8%.


![MP071316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP071316-190x300.jpg)Going back to the Nasdaq composite, it's absolutely ideal to see a major index fall modestly in lighter volume. You don't need a seasoned Wall Street strategist telling you that the big boys and big girls of the market -- namely mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors, endowments, pension funds and the like -- weren't eager to cash in on the recent rebound following the global Brexit sell-off of late June.


IBD monitors the market daily for evidence of distribution -- specifically, a day in which the key averages fall at least 0.2% in price in increased turnover from the prior session. Volume does not need to be above average, but simply higher. Such action indicates that institutional investors are anxious to sell.


That urgency has not yet surfaced within the Nasdaq composite since its rare Day 3 follow-through on June 30, which signaled regular readers of this column that a new uptrend may be in the making. The S&P 500 has logged one distribution, a 0.7% drop on July 5.


On June 30, the Nasdaq rose 1.3% to end at 4842. On Wednesday, it finished at 5005, closing above the psychologically important 5000 price level for only the second time in 2016.


Similar to the major indexes, leading stocks eased in orderly fashion. Please see the [daily charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) of insurance brokerage software firm **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)) (buy point at 50.02); China's social network **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) (breakout at 19.20); data networking appliance maker **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)) (not to be confused with Pokemon; 34.24 cup-with-handle buy point) and pharmaceutical industry software play **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) (entry points at 28.05 and 33.20). All four of these stocks showed mild declines in light trade Wednesday.
The four companies are seen growing Q2 earnings per share by 17%, 100%, 50% and 0%, respectively. Veeva faces an especially tough year-over-year comparison as profits leapt 140% to 12 cents a share in Q2 of 2015. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) name joined the list of top-performing stocks on June 20.


Could a further pullback occur?


Absolutely. No one has a crystal ball on the events over the next 24 or 48 hours that may impact the market. But one can reasonably guess that the wave of quarterly results arriving over the next three weeks will spur more trading.


The market has probably digested the likelihood that earnings among S&P 500 firms will be down year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. Traders will be laser-focused on future outlooks for earnings and sales in the second half of 2016.


The decline in S&P 500 profits is due largely to the earnings meltdown in the oil and gas sector. Crude oil is still nowhere near $100-plus levels, but at $45 a barrel, the futures are a lot closer to their year-ago prices. That has to give at least some relief to oil stock investors.


Today's [Sector Leaders column](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) highlights the trend that Wall Street tends to lowball their estimates, because no sane analyst wants to be above the crowd in his or her profit forecasts for a company. Set the bar too high, and the company management may never talk to you again.

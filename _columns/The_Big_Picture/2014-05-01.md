Stocks kept to a tight range Thursday with the indexes unable to make much progress.

  

The Nasdaq advanced 0.3%, while the S&P 500 was virtually flat. The IBD 50, though, scored a 1.2% pop.

  

Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE.

  

Technically, the Nasdaq's action amounted to stalling, a sign of stealth distribution. It essentially involves higher volume with little price progress.

  

Also, breadth on the Nasdaq was poor. Slightly more stocks fell than rose despite the index's gain.

  

Another bad sign for this market is that recent breakouts haven't been occurring among the stocks with the strongest fundamentals.

  

Income stocks and blue chips are the issues stirring. Recent breakouts include **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), manufacturer **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), **Wal-Mart Stores** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and tobacco firm **Lorillard** ([LO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LO)). None has a Composite Rating of 75 or better, though Lorillard has growth potential thanks to its [acquisition of e-cigarette maker blu eCigs](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-income-investor/040414-696008-is-lorillard-stock-a-buy.htm).

  

Other stocks breaking out recently or heading to new highs include **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) â€” two former leaders that have yet to re-establish fast growth in revenue or earnings.

  

Yet on Thursday, several top-rated stocks made bullish moves in fast trade.

  

Chip designer **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) thrust almost 6%. Barge operator **Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)) broke out with a 7% gain. Communication infrastructure provider and new issue **CommScope** ([COMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COMM)) jumped 4% to a new high.

  

Oil refiner **PBF Energy** ([PBF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBF)), which carries a Composite Rating of 82, also broke out.

  

As the month of May begins, some investors might be tempted to heed the old saw of "Sell in May and go away."

  

While there is historical evidence for that argument, investors should not rule out a follow-through day in May.

  

The Nasdaq delivered a follow-through on May 4, 2005, which led to a playable uptrend. On May 25, 2004, the Nasdaq also posted a follow-through.

  

The index rolled over after the signal, but leading stocks continued to break out and drive higher. They included Apple, **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)), **Central European Media** ([CETV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CETV)), **Southwestern Energy** ([SWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWN)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)).

  

Had investors sold and gone away in May 2004 or May 2005, they would've missed out on some good gains.

  

While it's still not the right climate for buying stocks, individual investors should stay alert and be ready if the market re-ignites.

title: Stock Market Gives Bullish Signal, But Is The Coast Clear For New Buys?

The final trading day of the third quarter provided plenty of fireworks in the stock market Wednesday, including a bullish signal in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.




The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also rose but closed off session highs.


The Dow made a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). File it under the category of a "hold your nose" follow-through day, though, because the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 faded off highs by the close.


It's best to see follow-through days convey strength and power, not begrudging and on the fence. Wednesday's session had the feel of the latter. Nonetheless, the stock market is back in a confirmed uptrend.


The Dow Jones industrial average barely met the criteria for a follow-through, rising 1.2% in higher volume. The Nasdaq held above its 50-day moving average, rising 0.7%. It also closed above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). But the Nasdaq backed off highs after coming close to its Sept. 10 high. It's still a potential resistance level to watch.


The S&P 500 rallied 0.8% and also closed slightly above its 50-day line. The Russell 2000 small-cap index eked out a 0.2% gain.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose sharply from Tuesday's levels. Breadth wasn't great on the Nasdaq, with advancing stocks barely beating decliners. On the NYSE, winners topped losers by a 2-to-1 ratio.

With the stock market back in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), it bears repeating to buy carefully and in smaller positions to start. Leading growth stocks are acting well, with many breaking out of [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) or follow-on entries. But it doesn't make sense to start heavy in a stock. The stock market could stay volatile for a while, with back and forth choppy action.


Stimulus Deal?
--------------


Before the opening bell, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sounded optimistic that Republicans and Democrats could reach a deal on an additional coronavirus stimulus package. Futures turned higher after the comment, and held strong gains. The S&P 500 jumped 1.8% and the Nasdaq rose 1.7%, but sellers came into the market in afternoon trading after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said both sides are still far apart.


Wednesday's gains came after a constructive session for the stock market Tuesday that saw indexes fall moderately in lower volume. The quiet down session came after the Nasdaq composite gapped above its 50-day moving average Monday, rising 1.9%. Monday's gain had the feel of a follow-through day, but volume came in lower than Friday so it didn't qualify.

The market outlook switched to "market in correction" exactly one week ago, when the Nasdaq slumped 3% in higher volume. The call came two days after the Nasdaq rallied sharply off lows on Sept. 21, paring a 2.5% loss to 0.1%. The price action resulted in a "pink day" and qualified as the first day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


There was no "pink day" for the Dow. The first day of its rally attempt was on Sept. 24. So Wednesday's follow-through day came on the fifth day of its rally attempt.


Bullish Sentiment Edges Higher
------------------------------


The latest Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers showed a small rise in bullish sentiment to 52.5% from 51.5% the prior week. The bulls were at an extreme reading of 61.5% at the beginning of September, just ahead of sharp pullback for the market. That the bulls are down to 52.5% is actually good news for the bull camp. The survey is a contrarian indicator because excessively bullish readings have been seen at several market tops in the past, while bearish sentiment has been seen at market bottoms.


Excessive fear has also been seen near market bottoms in the past. But fear gauges like the put/call volume ratio aren't pointing toward a fearful market.


Two direct listings came to market Wednesday. Data-mining software firm **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) opened at 10 and closed at 9.50 on its first day of trading. Workforce collaboration software firm **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)) opened at 27 and closed at 28.80.


As the stock market finds its footing again, it's important to pay attention to the price action of new issues, especially those with compelling growth stocks. Recent [IPOs](https://www.investors.com/iponews) like **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)), **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)), **AmWell** ([AMWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMWL)), **JFrog** ([FROG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FROG)) and **GoodRX** ([GDRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDRX)) all deserve on a spot on the watchlist. Short [IPO bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) could yield new entry points.


Stock Market Gainers
--------------------


Despite a lukewarm follow-through day for the Dow, leading growth stocks continue to perform well.



Wednesday's session served up some notable movers, including security software firm **SailPoint Technologies** ([SAIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIL)). The company isn't profitable yet, but sales growth has been accelerating. SailPoint faded 0ff highs, but its weekly chart still looks good after a solid first test of the 10-week moving average. Headed into this week, SailPoint showed some tight weekly closes as it tested support at the 10-week line.


Meanwhile, two top China stocks flashed buy signals, prompting a move from the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) watchlist to the Leaders list. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) jumped 6.2% after the company said its cloud business will be profitable within its current fiscal year 2021. Alibaba is extended past the 5% buy zone from the 268.10 buy point, but the weekly charts shows the stock is still in buy range after a nice bounce off the 10-week line.

After a move to new highs Aug. 18, **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) came close enough to a test of the 10-week line, creating a follow-on buy area.


Software stock **Clarivate** ([CCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCC)) soared nearly 5% to 30.99 Wednesday. A breakout over a 30.35 buy point corresponded with a bullish first test of the 10-week line. Weak sales growth in recent quarters raises an eyebrow, but Clarivate has excellent fund sponsorship and boasts big annual earnings estimates. Also in the enterprise software industry, **Duck Creek Technologies** ([DCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DCT)) cleared an IPO base with a 44.60 buy point.


**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) also made a big gain, up more than 12% to 102.16. The company, which provides a monitoring and security platform for cloud applications, announced a new strategic partnership with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Datadog cleared a 12-week consolidation with a 99.09 buy point.

Stock indexes advanced quietly Friday, as attention shifted to looming economic news and upcoming quarterly reports.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rose 0.5%, while the Dow added 0.3%. The IBD 50 rose 0.9%. The Dow Jones utility average popped 1.4%, though it was nearly flat for the week.


Volume fell across the board.


With the indexes playing a game of one day up and the next day down, individual investors might wonder what direction the market is headed for. Four factors could play a determining role.


![MP072216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP072216-203x300.jpg)No. 1: The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday. CME Group's FedWatch Tool sees a 1% chance of a rate hike. Analysts will be watching the Fed's wording, which could hint at the pace of future rate hikes.


No. 2: The first take on second-quarter GDP is expected Friday. In recent readings, the first takes have undergone significant upward revisions. Yet, even final figures on GDP growth have trended lower the past few quarters, from 3.9% in Q2 2015 to 2%, 1.4% and then 1.1%. Bulls would like to see a reversal of this trend.


No. 3: Divisia M4 including Treasuries -- the broadest gauge of the money supply -- spurted 5.9% in June, the biggest jump since January 2013. The Center for Financial Stability noted that the last time money supply growth hit this level, nominal GDP began an advance.


No. 4: Key companies will be releasing quarterly results in the coming week. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) will report Tuesday. The Street expects Apple's earnings to drop 25% on a year-ago basis, according to Thomson Reuters data.


Who then are expected to be the sluggers?


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which reports Thursday, is expected to crank up earnings 484%.


Cloud-based work software provider **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is seen growing EPS 100% when it reports Wednesday.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) reports Wednesday, and the consensus is for 62% earnings growth.


Automatic car technology provider **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) is pegged for 50% earnings growth. The company will report Tuesday.


Internet play **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) also reports Tuesday. The Street expects earnings to pop 43%.


Breakouts dwindled Friday. Yet, a few stocks crossed buy points. They included restaurant chain **Chuy's** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)); provider of cloud data storage  **Carbonite** ([CARB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARB)); and savings and loan **Banc of California** ([BANC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BANC)). Volume, though, was inadequate for each.


For the week, the Nasdaq added 1.4%; the IBD 50, 1.2%; the S&P 500, 0.6%; the Dow, 0.3%; and the S&P SmallCap 600, 0.15%.

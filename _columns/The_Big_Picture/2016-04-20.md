The major indexes advanced Wednesday, but it wasn't the type of finish that a chart reader would desire.


Up until the final 45 minutes of the session, the market showed strength. The S&P 500 looked poised to finish not only up for the third session in a row, but also to end trading near the session highs. That would indicate a healthy eagerness among fund managers to deploy more capital into stocks.


Instead, the big boys and girls of the market nailed down profits and raised cash in the final 45 minutes of Wednesday's trade. Thus, the S&P 500, which was up as much as 0.5%, finished just 0.1% higher. The Nasdaq rose just 0.2%, a fraction of its 0.6% intraday gain.


Volume expanded on both exchanges, resulting in twin stalling sessions for the key indexes. Stalling is bad. It implies institutional investors sold shares heavily into the market rally, an attempt to disguise their real intent. The stall day pushed the distribution-day count for the S&P 500 up to five. For the Nasdaq, the count remained at five; the March 15 distribution day expired due to time.


![MP042116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP042116-177x300.jpg)Investors sold the yield plays with abandon. The Dow utility average got slammed, falling almost 2.5% and ending near its session low. The SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) sector ETF is now facing a real test of support at the 50-day moving average.


In one sense, the sell-off by utilities comes as no surprise at all. Through April 1, the Dow utilities were up 16.3% year-to-date -- excluding cash dividends. Expecting such a pace to continue would be perhaps asking too much. Also worth remembering is this: Utilities do not necessarily buck the trend in a heavy-duty bear market. From January to October 2008, the Dow utilities plunged 47%.


As this column noted in [Wednesday's paper](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/kuwait-workers-strike-injects-energy-into-oil-stocks-but-nasdaq-falls/), the S&P 500 has reached a price level where the market's wheels have tended to spin faster without much upward traction. The large daily chart on B2 shows part of that story: Both in July and November, the large-cap benchmark poked its head above 2,100, only to get beaten back down in Wall Street's version of "whack a mole."


With the distribution count still at elevated levels, it's smart to be extra prudent about new buys. The market has climbed well since the early-February levels. A pullback at this point would not be surprising.


Yet, the market continues to do its job of confounding the masses. Retail and other consumer-oriented stocks are continuing to thrive in this choppy market. Whether it's **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)) (strong earnings on "Star Wars" merchandise), **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)) (streamlining the home mortgage process), or IBD 50 members such as **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) (No. 3 in Wednesday's IBD 50), **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) (No. 37) or **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) (No. 38), there are plenty of newer companies or mature leaders in their industry doing brand-new things. "New" is the ["N" in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-n-component-of-can-slim-can-lift-a-stock-to-great-heights/).


Housing and construction stocks rallied amid better-than-expected U.S. home resales in March. Use the IBD 50 and other features to find leaders in those sectors. As seen on Page B4 in Wednesday's IBD, the heavy construction, wood products and construction-products groups all rank in the top 20 among all 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance.


New leaders are also emerging in the semiconductor industry, a well-known hotbed of creative destruction. On Wednesday, the Philly SOX index rebounded nearly 1%.

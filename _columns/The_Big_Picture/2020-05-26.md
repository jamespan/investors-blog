America is back! At least that's what the stock market seemed to say on Tuesday.




For yet another weekend, controversy stirred across the country over citizens ignoring orders to keep at least six feet apart in public places, even in outdoor areas such as lakes and beaches. The U.S. is still No. 1 in the world in terms of coronavirus-related known cases and deaths. We're still months, if not years, away from a Covid-19 vaccine.


But Wall Street, which also saw floor traders return to the NYSE for the first time in two months, gave a thumbs up overall to the continued steps that both federal and local governments are taking to nurse the U.S. economy back to health.


A few mini-milestones marked Tuesday's trade following the three-day Memorial Day weekend holiday. The S&P 500, up 1.2% for the day, crossed back above 3000 for the first time since March 5. The large-cap index also battled with technical resistance at its flattened-out long-term 200-day moving average.![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MP052619-183x300.jpg)


While the S&P 500 failed to finish above 3000 and closed below its 200-day line, it rose at least 5% (at session peak) past the closing prices of its [two distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) marked on April 28 (when it finished that day at 2863.39) and on May 12 (2870.12).


Thus, the Market Pulse table shows those two distribution days (instances of unusually heavy institutional selling) wiped off the books.


The Nasdaq made a nominal gain. Tuesday's 0.2% rise certainly proved disappointing, given that in the first five minutes of trading this chock-full-of-growth-stocks gauge soared almost 1.9%. After the open, the composite index reached as high as 9501.


So, based on the 5% gain rule, Tuesday's action eliminated the May 12 distribution day by a country mile.


The Bull Run Shows Minimal Distribution
---------------------------------------


However, the Nasdaq's close deep in the lower half of Tuesday's closing range, combined with higher volume vs. Friday, marked a rare form of distribution called [a stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/). So a distribution day was added back to the Market Pulse.


Why didn't the S&P 500 also register such a stalling session?


Given the size of the bullish gap in price from Friday's high and the start of Tuesday's trading, looking at the "true range" of price action is instrumental in this case.


This means that looking at the range from Friday's close of 2955 and Tuesday's session peak of 3021, the large-cap benchmark still managed to finish in the upper half of this range.


Regardless, Tuesday's real market stars came from the so-called "SMID-cap" territory, or small and midcap stocks. The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ETF finished the day up 3.5% and very high up within its true daily price range.


That big gain sent the ETF to less than 17% off its 52-week peak of 384. Meanwhile, the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund roared 2.9% higher. While the small-cap is still more than an arm's length away from its long-term 200-day line, it's now built up a fine cushion above its medium-term 50-day moving average.



Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) swung from a nearly 2.3% early gain to a 1% loss. At 31.37, the IBD 50 ETF is still down 9.7% for the year.


Rotation in the stock market was not limited to market cap.


While the FAANG stocks and other giant tech leaders succumbed to profit-taking, stocks from the bottom quartile of the IBD industry group rankings showed real signs of life. Airline, banking, apparel, travel booking, truck, specialty retail, ship transport and machinery-related stocks rose 6% or more on a price-weighted basis.

How To Handle Leading Stocks
----------------------------


[IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) on Tuesday commented on numerous market leaders that emerged following the S&P 500's [April 2 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/). Many of these names fell in light volume Tuesday, a good sign. However, keep these three questions in mind when deciding if it's prudent to sit on any current winning positions in your portfolio.


One: Do you have a 20% to 25% gain since the stock broke out? In most cases, [take at least partial profits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) and free up some cash in the account. Cash serves as both a cushion for any future market bumps and gives you a chance to re-invest in new winners. If your best stocks have [triggered the eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/), then this would be an exception.


Two: Is a stock's double-digit gain shrinking fast? If so, selling the stock for a profit helps you avoid the misery of seeing a winner do a full round trip. A great stock will digest the selling and eventually romp higher. You just might get another entry point.


Three: If your stock is part of a top-ranked industry group, see how the group's leaders are faring. Are they, as a whole, conducting a normal pause? If yes, then consider holding through a normal looking pullback. Many [CAN SLIM-quality winners](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) have quickly gotten well above their 10-week moving averages. Time is needed for the 10-week lines to catch up.

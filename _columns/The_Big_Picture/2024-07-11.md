  Nasdaq, S&P 500 Sell Off Despite Cool CPI Data; Magnificent Seven Tumble

The stock market ended sharply mixed Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite receiving a beating as Wall Street digested a cooler-than-expected inflation reading. The [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), especially **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), suffered heavy losses.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, continuing to bounce up from the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 lost 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off nearly 2%, its largest one-day decline since April 30, per Dow Jones Market Data. The small-cap Russell 2000 index outperformed with a 3.6% advance, just shy of a new high.


Volume rose sharply on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That resulted in new [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Early Thursday, [the consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-june-2024-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-sp-500/) for June showed that core inflation cooled more than expected last month as services inflation turned mild — even housing costs. In response, the 10-year Treasury yield tumbled to 4.19%, its lowest close since March, as Wall Street celebrated the implications for rate cuts.


The overall consumer price index unexpectedly dipped 0.1% on the month vs. forecasts for a 0.1% increase. The 12-month CPI fell to 3% from 3.3% in May.


The core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose just 0.1% vs. May levels, cooler than 0.2% forecasts. The 3.3% 12-month core CPI, down from May's 3.4%, undershot 3.5% expectations. The core CPI inflation rate peaked at a 40-year-high 6.6% in September 2022.


More inflation data is due out Friday, with the early release of the producer price index.


Meanwhile, second-quarter earnings season kicks off in earnest Friday, with results from **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)). All three are in or near buy zones in their charts.

Stock Market Today
------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was the biggest loser, with a 3.9% drop, while **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) rallied nearly 3%.


[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), all ended at least 2% lower. Nvidia dived 5.6%, erasing most of this week's gains. Tesla skidded 8.4% to finally snap an 11-day win streak. And **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) gave up its 514.01 entry during the session's more-than 4% decline.

The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.6% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) dropped 2.7%. Shares are just above 27.50 and 26.57 buy triggers.


Despite Thursday's losses, IBD is keeping its recommended stock market exposure at 80% to 100%. But with the Nasdaq still sharply extended, it makes more sense to be closer to the 80% threshold. Keep an eye out for potential sell signals and don't hesitate to lock in partial profits among your holdings.


If today's selling persists over the next few days, then it would be logical to further cut back your exposure level. Remember, a cluster of distribution days is a bearish sign of market weakness, although so far that's not a concern. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq remains squarely above its 21-day exponential moving average, a shorter-term support level to watch. That would likely be an important battleground to determine the severity of the pullback.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list was healthy Thursday, with six new breakouts, including **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)).


With a number of top growth stocks near buy points, the current market action is sector rotation rather than broad-based market weakness. If that holds, keep an eye on fresh breakouts that could form the next wave of leadership.

S&P 500 Leader GE Aerospace Eyes Buy Point
------------------------------------------


There are many sectors pulling back after leading the market for the last several months, including restaurants, software, footwear, hospitals and more. But other groups like gold stocks, health care, biotechs and financials are showing strength.


Investors are rotating into rate-sensitive sectors as they become more sure that a [rate cut is coming in September](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-june-2024-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-sp-500/). Housing, utility and consumer stocks benefited from that shift.


Stocks to watch include **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)), **Carpenter Technology** ([CRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRS)), **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) and **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)).


Gold miner Agnico Eagle rallied 1.8% Thursday, adding to Wednesday's breakout move beyond a 71.50 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).


[Alloy supplier Carpenter](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/carpenter-technology-stock-steel/) is nearing a 112.75 buy point, as it holds above its 50-day line. S&P 500 stock [GE Aerospace](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ge-stock-new-entry-opportunity-ge-aerospace/) is right at the 50-day line, as it continues to trace a flat base with a 170.80 buy point.


KB Home surged more than 10% Thursday, as the steep drop in interest rates sparked an industrywide rally in homebuilders. Shares of KB Home are approaching a 74.66 buy point in a flat base and climbed above a trendline entry. KB Home is a new [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock and the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/kb-home-stock-buy-area-fed-rate-cut-hopes/)

U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range Thursday, as indexes closed little changed and volume slowed.


The Nasdaq eased 0.1%, while the S&P 500 added less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average was almost flat.

Volume fell on both major exchanges.


After the close, the market got some negative news from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). The online retailer's fourth-quarter sales missed expectations, and the sales outlook for Q1 was disappointing. Amazon shares fell in extended trading. Because it is a major component of the Nasdaq and S&P 500, a sharp decline would impact the broad market.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's top 20 gainers included the staid and the defensive. Tobacco, beverages, meat and prepared foods added a defensive emphasis. But steel and oil stocks also advanced.


The best-performing index for the day was the Dow Jones utility average, which added 0.9% and set a conservative tone for the session.


In the blue chip Dow, **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) climbed above an 88.07 buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern but then retreated to close under the entry. Volume was average.


**Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), a conservative stock that is in the Nasdaq 100, broke out of a base in strong volume and kept the gain. It cleared a 165.05 buy point in fast trade. Costco reported a 5% pop in January same-store sales, [the biggest gain in more than two years](https://www.investors.com/news/costco-shares-break-out-on-biggest-comp-gain-over-2-years/).


In the S&P 500, **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) thrust 13% in twice its usual volume. The midcap stock cleared a shallow consolidation.


Idexx provides veterinary diagnostics, software and water testing. The company reported quarterly results that beat the consensus view on revenue and earnings.
On the downside, upscale apparel marketer **Ralph Lauren** ([RL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RL)) skidded 12% in torrid volume. The stock's chart looked sick even before Thursday's action.


Ralph Lauren's CEO, Stefan Larsson, quit after a dispute with the founder over creative control. Meanwhile, the company reported quarterly results that topped views on earnings and met the consensus estimate on revenue.


Brokerages took some hard hits after **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) announced it is cutting its standard commission from $8.95 to $6.95. Schwab fell 5%, but rivals **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) and **E-Trade Financial** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)) each slid about 9%.


Schwab gets about 10% of its revenue from trading, whereas its competitors depend more on trading fees.


In economic news, Challenger Gray & Christmas said U.S. employers announced 45,934 payroll cutsÂ in January, which actually was an improvement on the year-ago level of 75,114.


First-time jobless claims were about 3% fewer than expected, and Q4 nonfarm productivity was also slightly better than expected.


Coming up Friday: The Bureau of Labor Statistics will report nonfarm payrolls. The Street's estimates range from 155,000 to 195,000, with the consensus at 175,000.

Stock action was restrained Friday — not a bad development considering the market's goal now is to stay above lines of former resistance.




The Nasdaq slipped less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.2%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


The Nasdaq closed above its 50-day moving average for a sixth session in a row. The S&P 500 did the same for a third session in a row.

Ideally bulls would like to see the indexes stay above the line in the fashion of baseball's phantom double play. That is, no need to touch, just get close enough to bounce and be done with it.


If that is accomplished, then market watchers will turn their attention to the Nasdaq's 7500 price area and the S&P 500's 2800 price level. Those are areas of prior resistance.


The Nasdaq needs only a 1.3% advance to bump up against the 7500 price level. But the S&P 500 needs a 2.7% gain to test the 2800 level.


Trump Slams 'Total Ripoff'
--------------------------


Meanwhile, President Trump spoke on drug prices Friday afternoon. He called the drug-price system a "total ripoff."


After Trump's speech, the stock market yawned. Stocks climbed from just under the day's break-even line to just over it.

Drug stocks showed no sense of panic. In fact, the biotech group, ethical drugs group and generic drug stocks all rose 2% to 3%.


The White House released a 44-page outline of Trump's "American Patients First" plan.


What was the reason for optimism among big pharma? Trump denounced "global freeloading." In other words, he sees it more like a trade issue, where foreign drug companies are the bad guys.


Breakouts Friday included trucker **ArcBest** ([ARCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCB)), up 28% in huge volume; **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)), up 2% in more than twice its usual turnover; and apparel brand **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), up 1.6% in quiet volume.


Superregional bank **Fifth Third Bancorp** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)) came close but did not break out. The stock is near a 34.27 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's worst performers included semiconductors, oil and tobacco. The best gainers included trucking, medical and cement stocks.

  Small Cap Stocks Take A Backseat To This Still-Important Index

Tuesday proved small-cap stocks don't have to lead the market's advance every day.




The bulls wasted no time in putting fresh capital to work after the long MLK holiday weekend. The Nasdaq jumped from the start, took a few steps back during the first two hours of the session, then resumed its rise to finish almost at session highs. A 1.5% advance closed the composite's second best single-day gain of the new year. Plus, it exceeded a 1.3% lift by iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) and 0.9% by S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)), another early leader in 2021.


The S&P 500 nearly matched the strength in midcap stocks, rising 0.8%. Pullbacks by some financials dragged on the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 0.4% gain. But the blue-chip index halted a mild three-session losing streak.


**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), one of the stocks in the media spotlight after [reporting dismal Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/goldman-sachs-stock-bank-of-america-earnings-q4-2020/) (EPS down 20% to 59 cents, sales off 21% to $21.3 billion), retreated 0.7%.



That mild drop may lead to a [new handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) on its large first-stage base.


Analysts watching BofA expect the money center to grow profits 22% to $2.28 a share in 2021 and another 23% to $2.80 in 2022.


Better Than Small-Cap Stocks Today
----------------------------------


Semiconductor stocks had a blessed session.


As seen in the accompanying Market Pulse table, stocks in this industry helped fuel the important Nasdaq's outperformance. VanEck Vector Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)), a popular gauge of chip stocks, throttled 3.4% higher.


The ETF already shows a breathtaking 11.1% gain since Jan. 1.


No fewer than four of the [top 10 companies in the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10) headed into Tuesday's session make the highly valued integrated circuits or machines that go into the manufacturing process. **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), ranking No. 7 inside [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), coasted nearly 6% higher in above-average volume and made new all-time highs.

![MP011921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP011921-192x300.jpg)Volume decreased on both main exchanges vs. Friday's pre-holiday session. That's okay. You don't need to see every up day in the stock market show higher turnover. Rather, keep a keen eye on what the current market leaders are doing. And keep tabs on the amount of heavy institutional selling hitting the major averages.


The Point About Professional Profit Taking
------------------------------------------


The Market Pulse shows [five distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the S&P 500. Undoubtedly, that's a high count. But what about the quality of the distribution? Indeed, the picture gets cloudy here.


For starters, only one of those five declines in higher NYSE turnover vs. the prior session exceeded 1%: the 1.5% drubbing on Jan. 4, the first trading day of the year. Was it opportunistic profit-taking by large fund managers after double-digit gains seen in the key indexes last year? Perhaps. Was it also selling out of concern over what the Georgia Senate elections would do to the political landscape? Likely as well.


Yet since then, stocks have stepped higher and major averages have made new highs.


Second, the Dec. 18 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 came on the third Friday of December, the same day that stock and index options and futures expire. Good chance the volume got a boost for technical reasons.


The three remaining distribution days — Dec. 14, Jan. 14 and Jan. 15 — all showed drops in the 0.4% to 0.7% range. Mild pullbacks are better than large ones.


It's The Biden-Harris Show Now
------------------------------


The market shows mild year-to-date gains ahead of Wednesday's inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th U.S. president. No doubt, you've likely seen headlines about how busy he's going to be in not only the first 100 days, but the first 10. Investors will be eyeing headlines on significant changes in taxation, fiscal stimulus to help the economy recover from Covid-19, immigration policy, the minimum wage, dealings with nuclear superpowers such as China and Russia, and travel between the U.S. and Muslim-majority nations.


And then you've got the occasional exogenous shock that very few will see coming.


Whew! That's a lot of news to digest. But the successful [CAN SLIM investor](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) need not feel like he or she has to scrape through every single headline. Not that it's possible, anyway.


Turn, Turn, Turn
----------------


Rather, as noted in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), one good thing to do is to take some time out of every day or week and get a feel for where the money is flowing.


We've certainly seen some rotation into cyclical and interest-rate-sensitive areas of the market. As long-term interest rates have gone up a lot since the fall, the increased spread vs. short-term bonds blows a nice profit tailwind into lenders. It's no coincidence that on Monday, the super-regional banks boasted a No. 20 ranking among [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jan-15-2021/) surveyed each day by IBD for six-month price performance.


The [IBD stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), meanwhile, highlights leadership in auto, energy, chip, agriculture, apparel and metals stocks. Headed into Monday, these six sat atop the 33-sector rankings for mid- and long-term blended price gains. Please note that the sectors do not get ranked by year-to-date performance.


Utility ranks dead last at No. 33.

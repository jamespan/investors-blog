  Tech Stocks Slammed Again; Is A Rotation Underway?

Tech stocks picked up where they left off Friday, with another round of stiff selling. Broad-based weakness in tech stocks and the software sector Monday put the market on shaky ground.




The Nasdaq composite lost 1.4%, ending just below its 50-day moving average. The Russell 2000 also closed below its 50-day line, falling 0.6%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average also fell 0.6%. Selling was curiously muted in the broad-based NYSE Composite. It lost 0.1%.


NYSE volume came in lower than Friday. Nasdaq volume was lower also. The June 22 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq fell off the count because enough time has passed to make it irrelevant. Declining stocks led advancers by more than 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq and by 15-to-13 on the NYSE.


The weakening action among leading stocks caused IBD to change its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure." That means now is the time to be taking defensive measures with your portfolio, if you haven't done so already. Start raising cash by taking partial or full profits in recent winners. And when it comes to newer holdings that aren't working, don't be afraid to cut these names loose.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP_3x2_073018.jpg)It's hard to believe the Nasdaq composite avoided a distribution day Monday, but that's exactly what happened. Monday was almost a carbon copy of Friday, when the technology-heavy index fell 1.5%, also in lower volume. Even so, growth stocks showed bad price action Friday and the selling was just as intense Monday.


Tech Stocks Slammed
-------------------


To be sure, the notable weakness in [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/facebook-stock-netflix-stock-market-signal/) like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is cause for concern. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is hanging in there, but another strong earnings report Thursday wasn't much help much to the stock Friday. After rising 4% intraday, it ended with a gain of just 0.5%.


Will [strong results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-preview-fiscal-q3-2018/) from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) Tuesday after the close be enough to pull tech stocks out of their recent funk? It's possible, but not likely, amid widespread damage in the technology sector. Shares of Apple lost 0.6% Monday, ending just above the 50-day moving average and below a 194.30 entry it topped last week.


After falling 3.4% Friday and giving up support at the 50-day moving average, Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost another 3.5% Monday. It's now testing longer-term support at the 200-day moving average.


Damage was plentiful in the IBD 50 Monday as well. Over half the stocks in the screen lost 2% or more. Long-term holders of **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) got a sell signal when the software leader gave up support at the 50-day moving average in heavy volume, falling 4.9%. The 50-day line was a support level for Adobe after the stock broke out of base in January.


Software Stocks Lag Badly
-------------------------


Of the day's worst-10 performing industry groups, nine hailed from the software sector. Headed into Monday, it was the top-ranked sector out of 33 ranked by IBD based on various price-performance factors.


**SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) also showed bad action after a breakout attempt Friday. Shares lost nearly 5% to 301.60. Late last week, the Silicon Valley-based bank delivered another strong earnings report, but the stock flashed a sell signal Monday when it fell 8% below the 329.75 entry.


IBD Sector Leaders **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) also showed bad action Monday, ending with losses of 5% to 7%.


**Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) was a rare spot in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), rising 1%. Oil and gas stocks have been acting well overall, but it's too early to say that the tech trade is done and oil and gas stocks are ready to grab the leadership baton.


Still, many oil and gas names are acting well. Diamondback is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 138.35 entry, while **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) is holding just above a 128.06 handle buy point.


**Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)), meanwhile, is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 38.35 entry. **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) is holding just above a 33.53 handle entry best seen on the daily chart.


The [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com) is a great screen to use to detect shifts in market leadership.


Not only did oil and gas names hold up relatively well Monday but retail names like **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), **American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)) and **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) held their own.


**Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) also outperformed, rising 3.5% to 29.72. Shares gapped up on June 21 after reporting strong earnings. It moved sideways after that, presenting a new entry at 30.10.


Investors sold bonds, but the selling wasn't intense. The 10-year Treasury yield added 2 basis points to 2.98% ahead of the start of the two-day Federal Reserve meeting Tuesday.


A decision on interest rates will be out Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. According to the [CME Group FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/) tool, futures traders think there's no chance of a rate hike Wednesday, but the chances for a quarter-point hike at the September meeting are around 89%. That would lift the Fed's key lending rate to a range of 2% to 2.25%.

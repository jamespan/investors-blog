The stock market closed lower Tuesday as growth stocks in particular took a pasting. Now all eyes will be on a crunch earnings report from **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) as well as the latest Fed minutes Wednesday.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day down 0.9% and is testing the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Finding support at this short-term level will be key for the current stock market uptrend. The tech-heavy index remains up more than 3% so far this month.


The S&P 500 endured a more modest 0.6% decline and has now slipped just below its [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/). The benchmark index remains more than 3% above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) however and is up nearly 3% in February.


Decliners edged out advancers on the New York Stock Exchange, while losers topped winners [by a 9-5 ratio on the Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/daily-market-statistics). Bulls looking for a silver lining will point out there wasn't an overwhelming number of downside moves.


However there was one bearish sign that will upset investors. Volume was higher on both main exchanges, which means an additional [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) was added to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. It comes after Friday's narrow escape due to lower volume.


Blue chips showed relative strength though, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping just 0.2%. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) popped following earnings while **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was also strong. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) was the worst laggard here.


Late Tuesday, [S&P Dow Jones Indexes announced](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20240220-1470711/1470711_djiadjtawbajblu-feb2024.pdf) that **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) will join the Dow Jones Industrial Average starting next Monday. **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) will lose its spot in the index. Walgreens shares fell more than 3% in extended trading, while Amazon climbed 1.2%.


Small caps were another obvious area of weakness as the Russell 2000 fell 1.4%. But it was growth stocks that were given the worst beating by the bears, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund diving 3%. FFTY still holds strong year-to-date gains, though.


Nvidia Earnings, Fed Minutes Loom
---------------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP022024-213x300.jpg)Tuesday could end up being the calm before the storm, because there are a couple of key news items set to drop Wednesday.


First, during trading hours the Fed will release minutes of its latest meeting. Investors will pore over the document covering the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee for further clues about where Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow voting members see interest rates heading in the coming months.


But a potentially even bigger market mover will be when Nvidia posts earnings after the close. The chip stock has soared more than 40% so far this year as it flies the flag for the current artificial intelligence craze.


Being priced to perfection carries risk, especially when the stock sits about 50% above its 200-day moving average. Analysts are expecting EPS to explode 416% to $4.54 as revenue rockets 234% to $20.21 billion. As important as earnings are, guidance could prove even more pivotal to its post-report fortunes.


These Stock Market Sectors Suffer
---------------------------------


Almost all of the [S&P 500 sectors closed lower](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Consumer discretionary and technology were the worst-performing areas. That the defensive consumer staples sector was the only one to end in the green is a bearish sign.


The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a more granular view of how issues performed on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Mail order retailers, drugstore firms, meat products plays and long term medical care stocks were among the top performing groups.


In contrast, computer hardware firms, oil & gas drillers, automakers and wood products stocks had a tough day. The fabless chip group, which is home to [Leaderboard stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) Nvidia and **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), also took a tumble. But while it fell more than 5%, Arm is still not broken after getting support at its 10-day line.

This IBD 50 Stock Crumbles
--------------------------


One of the reasons the IBD 50 index in particular was hit today was the pasting suffered by **GigaCloud Technology** ([GCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GCT)). It was the No. 1 stock on the IBD 50 and is a member of the tech services industry group.



Volume was well above average as GCT stock sank 24.8%, though it did close well off lows after testing the 50-day moving average. Very aggressive investors might see this as a buying opportunity but it could be a foolhardy move given the stock remains [more than 110% above its 200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-key-climax-top-sell-signal-mstr-stock/) following recent ebullient action.


In contrast, those with big gains might opt to use the rebound as an opportunity to lock in gains now given it came close to flashing a round-trip sell signal in addition to its 50-day line breach.

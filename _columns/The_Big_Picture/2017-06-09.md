title: Bears Rip Tech Stocks, But One Sector Keeps Climbing

Tech stocks ran into a buzz saw Friday, but a budding rally in financials raised the possibility of sector rotation.


The Nasdaq plunged 1.8%, while the S&P 500 eased 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4%. Small caps matched the Dow, as the Russell 2000 climbed 0.4%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

Although the number of distribution days remained low, the intense selling in many leading stocks was troubling. Because of that shift, IBD's market outlook has been downgraded to uptrend under pressure. This requires investors to be quicker in taking profits and watching sell signal carefully.


Technology stocks, and in particular the chips, suffered fierce selling. The chipmaker group dived 4.3%. Chip designers plunged 4.5%. Chip equipment makers slid 5%.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and the FANG stocks also attracted heavy selling.


What caused the sell-off? There was no shortage of suspects.


A short-seller report on **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) apparently ignited the selling, but an earlier report from Bank of America and a Friday report from Goldman Sachs raised caution flags about the whole tech group. Goldman Sachs pointed to a ["valuation air pocket"](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/forget-fang-goldman-adds-apple-microsoft-faamg-to-tech-leaders/) under the megacap favorites.


Then too, chips and megacaps have been rising long enough to spark profit-taking. But complacency also might have played a role. The CBOE Volatility Index, [a fear gauge](http://ow.ly/VeH630csTQH), on Friday hit the lowest level since 1993.


The one-day plunge in chip stocks isn't a rarity in this uptrend. On Dec. 1, March 21 and April 28, the chipmaker group suffered losses of 3% to 5% while closing near the bottom of the day's range. Each time, the group resumed its rise.


That won't happen forever.


So, where did the money go?


When funds lighten up on leaders, the money has only three ultimate destinations: Cash, defensive vehicles or new sectors.


On Friday, there was no strong evidence that money was piling into defensive stocks such as soap, food and tobacco.


Banks appeared to be getting a chunk of the money. For example, **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) popped 1.8% in volume 33% above average. **Seacoast Banking** ([SBCF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBCF)) leapt 3.7% in more than twice its normal volume. **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) reached a 49.74 entry in double-bottom pattern, but volume was only average.


For the week, the Russell 2000 rose 1.2%, and the Dow 0.3%. The Nasdaq dropped 1.6% and the S&P 500 lost 0.3%.


Coming up: The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday. The Street expects an interest rate hike.

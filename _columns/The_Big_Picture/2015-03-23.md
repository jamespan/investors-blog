Market Dips, But Some Leaders Take Lumps

Stocks fell mildly Monday as sellers pounced in the final hour. Some leading stocks got dinged in an otherwise quiet session.


After snapping a three-week losing streak last week, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after holding a modest gain for much of the session. The benchmark index is less than 1% off its Feb. 25 record high.


The Nasdaq wavered to a 0.3% loss. It closed at its session low but held above the 5000 level.


Overall, stocks fell amid a lower U.S. dollar and disappointing existing-home sales for February.


Volume fell sharply from Friday's pace on both major exchanges. Quadruple witching on Friday made for a tough comparison. Yet trade was also well below average on both major exchanges.


Breadth, however, was positive. Winners beat losers by nearly 7 to 5 on the NYSE. Nasdaq winners edged losers by about 7 to 6.


Monday's small setback followed last week's strength brought on by the Fed's signal that it's not in a hurry to raise interest rates.


Even with the recently improved market outlook, the level of distribution remains high, so investors need to stay disciplined and cautious when buying stocks.


Opportunities are still out there. **Sonic** ([SONC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SONC)) broke out from a rare ascending base in huge turnover ahead of its fiscal Q2 results after Tuesday's close.


Biotechs, which have been leaders for a long time, were an area of weakness. **The Market Vectors Biotech** ([BBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBH)) ETF tumbled 2.3%.


Biotech leaders sold off in heavy trading. **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) trimmed losses but still fell 4% on a disappointing study of its cystic fibrosis drug. **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) gave up nearly 3% after Stifel cut shares to hold from buy. **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) also fell in heavy trading.


**Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)) and **IPG Photonics** ([IPGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPGP)) slumped in heavy trading.


The former snapped an eight-week win streak, while the latter started the final week of the eight-week-hold rule for handling fast movers.


While no leaders suffered catastrophic moves Monday, weakness in leading stocks is something to eye closely. The action in leaders tells you about the health of the overall market. Also, leading stocks are the actual trading vehicle of CAN SLIM investors.


Another sector actually did worse. The Dow Jones Transportation index tumbled 2%, hurt by railroad stocks. **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)) lowered guidance. But the small-cap S&P 600 edged up 0.1%.

Stocks Fall As Apple, Facebook, Other Key Techs Send Mixed Signals
===================================================================

The Nasdaq composite's woes continued Monday, with the index leading the market lower and its main stocks giving mixed signals.


The composite fell 0.5%, although it had been as low as 1.6% in the first half-hour. The S&P 500 ceded only 0.1% at the close, while The Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.2%. The Dow might have ended even lower had it not been for **General Electric**'s ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) 3.6% jump on news that CEO Jeff Immelt will step down and be replaced by GE Healthcare chief John Flannery.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MP061217-178x300.png)The Nasdaq has easily outperformed the other major indexes this year, thus had the most to lose. The composite (up 17% in 2017 at last week's peak) owed its success largely to several of its largest components, heavyweights such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


That made the market's uptrend top-heavy, with smaller stocks lagging considerably. Now, those big-cap stocks are under distribution and eroding the market's foundation. That was the reason IBD shifted its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure," from "confirmed uptrend," after Friday's session.


Two of those market cornerstones, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Apple, suffered significant damage Monday. Both broke below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume, showing uncharacteristic weakness.


Before they started selling off Friday, both stocks had run up more than 20% from January breakouts, enough to harvest profits. With shares unable to find support at the 50-day line, it's smart to take profits. Volume in Apple's 2.5% slide Monday was unusually strong — the highest since Feb. 1, when an earnings report sparked a rally.


The market bounced back quickly from one-day sell-offs on May 17 and March 21. Can it do it again?
Certainly, the market will need some fresh leadership. Financials are back in favor, for now at least. Many smaller banks have been breaking out of bases. Watch for opportunities in that sector.


Also keep an eye on current leaders, some of which are showing signs of re-energizing themselves. **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Vail Resorts** ([MTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTN)), **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Advanced Energy** ([AEIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEIS)) are bouncing from their 50-day or 10-week moving averages.


While Netflix and Apple go through pains, other key stocks also appear to be finding support. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), Facebook, Amazon.com and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) offer hope for bulls.


Those stock have a smaller weighting in the S&P 500, which helps explain why it's steady. It had been lagging the Nasdaq for much of this year, but the role may be reversing. Strength in financials is helping the S&P 500.


The Russell 2000 fell 0.2%. It made a new high Friday, a bright spot for small-cap investors who have been frustrated with small returns this year.


While the market uptrend is under pressure, investors must trim their exposure to stocks. Take profits on some stocks like Netflix that are bending lower after big advances. Also be ready to sell quickly, certainly before a loss reaches 8%. Breakouts will be more iffy with the market under pressure, so be selective. Investors should not be buying on margin.

After four straight distribution days for the S&P 500, the bulls were hoping for a break Monday. They got one because the S&P 500 avoided a distribution day thanks to lower volume. But sellers were still in the market, weighed down by weakness in China and Europe.

  

After falling below its 50-day moving average last week, the S&P 500 gave up 0.6%. It closed 3 points above the long-term 200-day line. The index has tested support at the line two times this year, both successfully. It plunged below the support level in October but only spent six sessions below it before flashing a follow-through on Oct. 21.

  

The Nasdaq shed 1% and the Russell 2000 fell 0.9%. The IBD 50, which has been holding up well in a shaky market, did more of the same Monday. It fell 0.7% and is still holding above its 50-day moving average.

  

The June 19 distribution day for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell off the count due to time. The count now stands at seven for the S&P 500 (still a high number) and three for the Nasdaq.

  

Breadth remained weak as declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both main exchanges by more than 2 to 1. There were 686 new lows and 28 new highs on the Nasdaq and NYSE.

  

In no time at all, the market's focus has moved from the Fed to Greece and now China.

  

The Shanghai Composite slumped 8.5% Monday. Concerns about China's slowing economic growth coupled with doubts about the effectiveness of stimulus measures weighed. Since hitting a high of 5,166 on June 12, the index is down 28%.

  

The focus will be back on the Fed on Wednesday, when its two-day meeting ends. According to CME Group FedWatch, the market sees a 0% chance of a rate hike Wednesday, a 17% chance at the September meeting and a 34% chance in October.

  

Investors found safe havens Monday in utility stocks, bonds and gold.

  

For individual investors, the best strategy always is to swim with the market tide and put money to work when institutional money is coming in from the sidelines.

  

What's clear at this point is that the market tide is not flowing positively and institutional investors are not putting new money to work. That always makes for a challenging environment in which it's easy to get whipsawed out of stocks. For now, play defense — not offense — and wait for market conditions to improve.

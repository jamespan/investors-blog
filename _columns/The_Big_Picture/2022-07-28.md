  Stock Market Rallies As GDP Triggers Recession Signal; 4 Breakout Stocks To Watch

The stock market extended Wednesday's [Federal Reserve-fueled gains](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-delivers-huge-rate-hike-despite-slowing-growth-dow-jones/) Thursday, as the [U.S. economy was tagged](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-dodges-tagged-with-recession-label-as-gdp-rises-slips-dow-jones/) with a recession label. Tech giants **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reported their quarterly results after the close and added to the market's gains.




[Amazon shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-jumps-earnings-beat-estimates/) surged 12% in extended trade, while [Apple stock jumped](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/aapl-stock-apple-earnings-fiscal-third-quarter-2022/) nearly 4% after the market close. Stock market futures rose.


On the economic front, second-quarter GDP dropped 0.9%, missing estimates that called for a slight rise. It was the second straight quarter of decline, after GDP contracted 1.6% in the first quarter. A second straight fall in GDP meets a common definition of recession, although economists are divided on whether the economy is truly in recession. Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims unexpectedly rose to 256,000 vs. 251,000 in the previous week.


The 10-year Treasury yield ticked down to 2.68%, closing at its lowest level since early April.


On the earnings front, Facebook owner **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) tumbled more than 5% after the company [reported second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-earnings-second-quarter-what-to-expect/) that missed estimates and a slight quarterly decline in revenue. It was the first time Meta posted a year-over-year decline in revenue.


Stock Market Trend
------------------


The stock market uptrend shrugged off the recession signal, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 gained 1% and 1.2%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.3%. While recession could slow earnings, investors appeared to think the GPD data could take pressure off the Fed to continue raising interest rates.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP072822-236x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and appeared to also rise on the NYSE. On a positive note, the Nasdaq's July 26 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) was wiped out due to a 5% climb from that day, taking its count down to just one.


Top growth stocks ended higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 1.8%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Murphy USA** ([MUSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUSA)) finally moved out of buy range past a 262.68 buy point. Shares jumped 7.8% Thursday after the company's Q2 results.


Due to the continuation of recent gains, along with a number of new breakouts among top stocks, IBD upgraded its market outlook from "uptrend under pressure" to "confirmed uptrend."


Investors have the green light to boost their exposure to stocks, focusing on those breaking out past correct [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Gradually commit capital to leading stocks. Still, it's not time to be overly aggressive.


Use each purchase as feedback on the current strength of the market rally. Don't panic if you miss the first couple of breakouts. If the stock market uptrend is real, there will be plenty of time to buy stocks and make money. This is an important strategy because prior follow-throughs have failed this year and rallies have been cut short.

4 Breakout Stocks To Watch: Carlisle, Cheniere, Molina, Quanta Services
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



Amid a stock market rally that is perking up, these four leaders are among the stocks in or near buy zones today â€” **Carlisle** ([CSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSL)), **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)), **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) and **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)).


[Thursday's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stock-to-watch-materials-stock-carlisle-breaks-out-after-earnings/) pick, Carlisle, is just above a buy zone after breaking past a 272.68 entry in a [double-bottom base](https://click.email.investors.com/?qs=15aa15eac44f123e572f3914b75fa89bc29e6c3c23a0572ed9466f2853f411d9a5f108b8c0e7289ac3269f2ef097ce49e98e4085beac8d70), rallying nearly 6% Thursday. The 5% buy area tops out at 286.31. Volume surged 171% vs. average, confirming a large amount of institutional demand. Its relative strength line is at new highs.


[Cheniere Energy](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/cheniere-energy-fuels-buy-point-ahead-of-earnings-as-a-plus-funds-buy-shares/) is in buy range past an early entry's 140.00 buy point as a result of a trendline amid Thursday's slight fall. An alternative buy point looms at 146.45 due to the stock's double bottom formation. Earnings are due Aug. 4.


Molina Healthcare is breaking out past a double bottom's 316.01 buy point in the wake of the company's better-than-expected Q2 results. Late Wednesday, the company said its EPS grew 34% year over year to $4.55 on revenue of $8.05 billion. Sales grew 18%. Molina shares jumped 3.7% Thursday, closing just above the entry.



[New IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Quanta Services broke out past a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/)'s 138.56 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares rallied 8.5% in big volume, barely closing in the 5% buy area that goes up to 145.49. Earnings are due out Aug. 4, so this breakout does carry some extra risk. Look for the stock to build a profit cushion ahead of the earnings report, which should give investors more confidence heading into the report.


[Quanta stock boasts](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-quanta-services-inc-pwr.aspx) a perfect 99 IBD Composite Rating, per the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)


Remember, the stock market volatility is a reason to remain conservative. But these four leaders are stocks to watch in a strengthening stock market rally.

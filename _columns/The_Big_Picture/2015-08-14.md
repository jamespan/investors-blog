Stock indexes Friday moved with a languor normally associated with the eve of a holiday, but unfortunately for those looking for a day off, it was only apathy.

  

The S&P 500 added 0.4%, while the Nasdaq tacked on 0.3%. The small-cap S&P 600 outperformed with a 0.8% gain.

  

The IBD 50 inched up 0.2%.

  

Volume dropped emphatically for a second session in a row. Friday's volume on the Nasdaq reached the lowest level since the day before the July 4 holiday.

  

Breakouts were missing, but a handful of stocks showed good action.

  

**Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)), not the most likely area for bulls to hunt for leadership, hit a new high.

  

The stock is extended from a low-volume breakout, but the company's fundamentals are not of elite quality.

  

**Fidelity Southern** ([LION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LION)) also hit a new high. The holding company for Fidelity Bank and LionMark Insurance is based in Atlanta.

  

Small banks have been doing well of late. Fidelity Southern grew earnings 27% in Q3, then 94%, 73% and most recently 59%.

  

Size, though, is a problem. Like many other small-cap banks, Fidelity Southern is thinly traded. The stock turns only a little more than 150,000 shares daily. With a daily dollar volume of about $3 million, institutions would have trouble getting in and out of the stock.

  

Individual investors generally should avoid thinly traded stocks.

  

Meanwhile, the market's inability to break free of a five-month trading range poses other problems for investors.

  

For IBD-style investors, a stock might have strong fundamentals and strong technicals and still fail. The M factor for market (market direction) isn't what it should be to deliver big gains. An uptrend under pressure can weigh on stocks.

  

This leaves individual investors with two choices. They can keep a higher level of cash than normal, or they can play small ball — cashing in smaller gains and exiting on losses well below 8%.

  

Economic data released Friday didn't offer much encouragement for the bulls or the bears.

  

The Producer Price Index for July popped 0.2%, topping the consensus view of 0.1%. The Federal Reserve's index for industrial production for July advanced 0.6% vs. views for 0.4%. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for August came in at 92.9, which fell shy of the consensus estimate of 93.5.

  

Oil remains a wild card in this market, but the **Baker Hughes** ([BHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHI)) rig count for the U.S. rose from 670 to 672 — the fourth straight gain. What does it mean? U.S. oil production isn't slowing as fast as originally expected. Frackers are finding ways to get more oil out of fewer wells at a lower cost.

  

Ironically, the net effect of Saudi Arabia's war on U.S. frackers is providing an incentive for better retrieval techniques, which could cause more problems for the Saudis down the road.

  

The Saudis' declaration of war on the oil markets isn't looking too smart right now.

  

Likewise, individual investors should take it as a lesson for themselves: Don't fight the market. If a trade goes badly, emotions will call for a revenge trade to try to get even quickly. Emotions are emotions. They should never be misidentified as an idea. In this market, it's best to stay cool and tread carefully.

  

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.7%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6%. The Nasdaq edged up 0.1%. The IBD 50 lost 0.5%.

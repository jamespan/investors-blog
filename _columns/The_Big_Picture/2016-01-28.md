Bulls and bears battled for control of Thursday's session and eventually the optimistic crowd prevailed.


The Nasdaq added 0.9%, closing high in the day's range. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6% and 0.8% respectively.


The IBD 50 trotted 0.4% higher.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell on the NYSE.


News that Saudi Arabia might agree to a production cutback fired up the bulls. However, it wasn't clear if that was a done deal. Oil jumped as much as 8% and then retreated to a 4% gain.

The action did answer a question: Is the market weakness primarily tied to oil or to weakening manufacturing?


Given that the durable goods numbers for December were awful, and the market nonetheless rose on the oil hopes, investors got their answer.


Oil is the make-or-break item.


For the past five sessions, market watchers have seen the indexes seesaw between big-percentage gains and big-percentage losses.


The centerpiece was the confirmation of a new uptrend Tuesday followed by a wicked distribution day Wednesday.


So, Thursday's action held greater importance than usual as investors looked for new signals. Bottom line: The market held off the bears.


Did this settle anything?


No, basically it bought more time. This fledgling uptrend still could either fall apart or it could find traction.


What use then is a follow-through day? It is not a fortune-telling device as much as it is an OK to test the uptrend.


Pyramiding into a stock is the proper method: A half position is initiated and the full position is not completed unless the stock is working. (See Page 257 of the fourth edition of "How to Make Money in Stocks" for more on this strategy.)


However, if no quality stocks break out, no stocks are bought.


Quality breakouts have not yet appeared.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), though, soared almost 16% in heavy volume on strong results. The stock is near a 110.75 buy point.


**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), which went public in July, gapped up 8% following its quarterly report. However, the stock remains under its 50-day line and 19% off its high.


There are things worth watching for in this uptrend. Don't go by feelings. Let the market prove or disprove the uptrend. Let any stock buys do the same.


After the close, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) reported disappointing earnings and revenue growth. The stock plunged, dashing hopes that it might be a leader of the uptrend.

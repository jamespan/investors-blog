U.S. stock indexes dodged technical trouble Thursday, even as the three-day win streak ended for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.


The Nasdaq retreated 0.5%, while the S&P 500 eased 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average extended its win streak to five sessions as it added 0.2%.




The small cap S&P 600 slipped 0.2%, ending its win streak at four sessions. Through Thursday, the S&P 600 was leading the other indexes for the week, according to preliminary data.


Volume fell across the board, which helped the Nasdaq avoid a distribution day.


The market's technical picture improved as the Aug. 8 distribution day fell off the Nasdaq because of time. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current market conditions.


With the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting coming up next week and Friday being a quadruple witching day, the bulls probably would be happy to get out of the week with moderate weekly gains for the indexes.


Some stocks weren't waiting for the Fed.



On Thursday, carmakers were stepping on the accelerator. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) sped 3% higher, crossing a 370.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. The pattern is second stage, still early enough to buy. Tesla broke out in April and rose 34% before consolidating.


Tesla, despite no shortage of favorable hype in the media, lost money in the past two years. More red is expected this year and next year.


In the first half of 2017, funds trimmed their overall stake in Tesla by 11%. Quality funds lightening their position included the A+ rated T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund ([PRGFX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRGFX)), which sold half of its position in the first six months of the year.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MP091417.png)General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) rolled to a 1.5% gain, cushioning its profit from a Sept. 1 breakout. The stock is now too extended to buy. The A+ rated Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) dumped 55% of its position in the first half of the year.


Meanwhile, credit payment processor **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) jumped 4% Thursday in more than twice its usual volume. The stock cleared a 28.07 buy point in a cup base. Funds have increased their stake in the stock by 67% in the first half of 2017. Contrafund opened a new position in Q2.


Short Interest Ratio
--------------------


Among secondary indicators, the NYSE short interest ratio hit 5.51 Wednesday, matching a five-year high. The last time the ratio was that high was Sept. 18, 2014. The S&P 500 dropped 9% over the next month, while the Nasdaq fell 10%.


Secondary indicators, however, can frequently be wrong. That's why they are called secondary. Perhaps their best use is persuading individual investors to study the price-and-volume action of the major indexes more closely. That's an investor's primary indicator.


Coming Up Friday
----------------


Data on the [Economic Calendar](http://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) scheduled to be released Friday include: retail sales for August; the Empire State manufacturing gauge for September; industrial production for August; business inventories for July; and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge for September.

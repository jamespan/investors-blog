This Index Leads Stocks Up; 2 New Questions To Ask Right Now
=============================================================

The Nasdaq composite finally bounced higher [in the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), ending a six-day pummeling with a 1.4% gain, its strongest single-session advance since an important 1.7% rise on June 7.




One up day — no matter how large — doth not make a new confirmed rally, though.


The outperformance, mathematically speaking, by the Nasdaq over other key U.S. equity indexes actually was trivial.


The S&P 500 rallied 1.3%, and the S&P SmallCap 600 gained 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 matched the Nasdaq composite's rise. Volume fell on both main exchanges. On the NYSE, composite volume fell nearly 8%.

While winning stocks outpaced losers by a more than 2-1 pace on the NYSE and nearly so on the Nasdaq, far more stocks hit 52-week or all-time lows than those making new highs. Meanwhile, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have now fallen to a worst-possible E. That indicates institutions have been net heavy sellers of stocks over the past 13 weeks.


Why did the market rebound on Tuesday?


The market got oversold in the short term. China's lambasting of U.S. economic strategy and foreign policy, as quoted by the government's China Daily newspaper, did not amount to fresh news on the bilateral duel for economic hegemony. Short sellers covered and took some profits. Bargain hunters licked their chops and scooped up shares.


For the savvy IBD reader, however, these two questions perhaps carry more merit.


Question No. 1 For The Stock Market Today
-----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP080619-248x300.jpg)One, when will the market signify that the heavy hitters on Wall Street are swinging their bats hard again?


IBD has a simple answer for that. Wait for [the follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to emerge.


Such a day, when a major index rises in most cases a minimum 1.2% in higher volume than the prior day, indicates that large investors see an opportunity in stocks and are getting greedy again. Remember, when you boil the market down to emotions, it's the daily interaction of two: greed and fear.


[Not all follow-through days work](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). As the [Monday Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-correction-dow-jones-plunge-sell-apple-trade-war/) notes, some of these confirmed uptrend signals turned out to be head fakes.


But no [major stock market bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-follow-through-day-sparked-a-market-bottom-one-century-ago/) since 1900 started without a follow-through that occurred on Day 4 or later in a new rally attempt.


So looking back at Tuesday's action, it's certainly nice to see the Nasdaq composite refuse to make another short-term low.


On the other hand, a 1.4% gain does not even recoup a quarter of the 7.2% drubbing that the Nasdaq suffered after it posted a new all-time closing high of 8330 on July 26.



Let's look at the S&P 500.


The large-cap benchmark, for all its gains on Tuesday, failed to approach Monday's intraday high. Good up session, yes. But technically speaking, the 500's up day was no more than an inside day. That is, the range between intraday high and low on Tuesday was far narrower than what we saw Monday.


Such technical action bespeaks uncertainty.


Question No. 2
--------------


Are individual growth stocks still looking healthy?


For stock pickers, answering this question may be just as important as the first one.


Second-quarter earnings season has been perhaps a bit more famine than feast for top growth stocks. And this is understandable; the best growth stocks have enjoyed elephantine gains.


Consider [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders). Headed into Tuesday's trade, the price-weighted advance since Jan. 1 for this elite group of stocks cooled off to 36.3%. That more than doubles the 13.5% gain, excluding dividends, by the S&P 500.


The Sectors Leaders list is a great barometer for growth stocks. If you see the list shrink fast, then you know that high-growth companies are getting slammed especially hard.


Meanwhile, Tuesday's Market Pulse table shows a relatively solid number of leaders that rose significantly in above-average volume. Some of these names may go on to stage a new breakout or produce a new follow-on entry point.


Bonus Question
--------------


Are any individual groups showing particular strength, and could they help lead the market higher?



Looking at the past eight weeks of action, these groups may be worth a closer look:


* Gold Mining, up 26% (see **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) and **Royal Gold** ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD))).
* Energy-Solar, up 12.4%. (**SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) surged after hours on good quarterly results. It recently broke out at both 46.82, a super-aggressive buy point deep within its [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/), and at 57.05. Also see fellow solar system inverter expert **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)).)
* Auto and Truck Retail and Telecom-Fiber Optic, up 9.2%. (**Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) retook its 50-day moving average on Tuesday.)
* Truck Transport, up 8.8%.
* Building-Wood Products, up 8.6%.
* Internet content (think **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR))), up 6.9%.

The stock market uptrend continued to gain traction Tuesday as major stock indexes notched their third-straight bullish session.




The Nasdaq composite rose above the 11,000 level with ease, ending with a gain of 2.2%. Nasdaq volume rose, completing a second [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) for the index. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 4-to-1.


The strongest outperformance came from small cap and midcap stocks. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ramped higher by 2.7%, helped by strong earnings reports and huge gains for **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) and **Calix** ([CALX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALX)). The small-cap ETF briefly crossed above its 50-day moving average but ended just below the line.


The SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) jumped 2.5% and closed just above its 50-day line.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 marched ahead 1.6%, bringing its three-session gain to 5.2%. Preliminary data showed volume very close to Monday's level.


The S&P 500 is getting closer to a rendezvous with its 50-day line, a potential resistance level to watch. If the index pauses and consolidates below this level for a short time, it wouldn't be such a bad thing. Price action like this could pave the way for a convincing retaking of the line.

NYSE advancers beat decliners by just over 5-to-1.


Heavy volume rolled into S&P 500 component **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) again after shares surged more than 19% last week on strong earnings. But the stock's 200-day line looms large as a possible resistance level. Like many other stocks, ISRG has a lot [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/david-ryan-how-to-spot-and-understand-overhead-supply) to work through.


The stock market looks a lot healthier after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 confirmed new uptrends on Friday, with big percentage gains in higher volume.


The crop of technical breakouts and bullish setups has been rising, helped by a market tide that is flowing positive once again. Increasing market exposure is fine, but pay attention to the ticker tape's feedback when it comes to new buys. Are they making progress past proper entries?


If so, that should make you feel good about increasing exposure.


Market Movers
-------------


After soaring above its 50-day line Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on another 1.1%, helped by strong gains for **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)). The blue-chip index now has its sights set on the 32,000 level.


The IBD 50 served up plenty of bullish gainers, including **Clearfield** ([CLFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLFD)), up nearly 10%. It's forming the right side of a cup base with a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) already in new high ground.


**Graphic Packaging** ([GPK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPK)) soared above its 50-day line after the company reported a 79% surge in quarterly profit. Revenue jumped 38% to $2.45 billion. Shares jumped 7.5%.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **DoubleVerify** ([DV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DV)) cleared a flat base with a 30.02 buy point. DV stock jumped 9% intraday but closed off highs.


**Flex LNG** ([FLNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLNG)) also outperformed in the IBD 50. The transporter of liquefied natural gas moved nicely above its 50-day line, rising 7%.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)) jumped above its 50-day line and cleared a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/), rising 6%.


Yields, Greenback Pull Back
---------------------------


The stock market was cheered by falling bond yields and weakness in the U.S. dollar.


The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury ETF ([TBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBT)) gapped down and lost nearly 6%. TBT had been showing signs of a climax top when it started to gap up in price, despite being over-extended. Even with Tuesday's decline, TBT is still holding above its 10-day moving average.


The 10-year Treasury yield was trading at 4.10% just after 5:15 p.m. ET and is currently testing support at the 10-day line. After 12-straight up weeks, the note is down about 10 basis points so far this week.


Meanwhile, the Invesco DB US Dollar Bullish ETF ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) also gapped down but held above its 50-day line. UUP fell 1.1%


The next Federal Reserve meeting is set for Nov. 1 and 2.


The Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to raise the federal funds by 75 basis points again, to a range of 3.75% to 4%.


But another 75-point hike at the December meeting is far from a sure thing, especially after a Wall Street Journal story late last week revealed that some committee members are concerned about over-tightening.

The stock market mostly recovered from Wednesday's sharp losses, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the major stock indexes higher Thursday.




**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)), **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)), **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are among the top stocks to watch in the strengthening stock market uptrend.


Stock Market In Young Uptrend
-----------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1% Thursday, while the S&P 500 ended 1.4% higher. The S&P 500 is back above its 200-day line after dipping below it Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced 1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1.1%.


Top growth stocks outperformed the S&P 500 and Dow, and edged past the Nasdaq, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied nearly 2%. Strength in commodity and chip stocks aided the IBD 50. **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) surged 12%. **MP Materials** ([MP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MP)) jumped 13%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP032422-288x300.jpg)Chip giant and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Nvidia joined the rally, soaring nearly 10%. Per Leaderboard commentary, Nvidia was raised to a three-quarter size position after it surged past a trendline entry point of 272.38 and is actionable as high as 286.


On the IBD 50's downside, **Zim Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) tumbled 5.5% for the worst performance in the index.


The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked up to 2.34% Thursday, holding near its highest point since May 2019. U.S. oil prices took a breather Thursday, with West Texas Intermediate crude trading below $112 a barrel.


Volume was nearly flat on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Following [last week's follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-as-fed-chair-powell-grasps-this-challenge-these-areas-shine-brightest/) on the S&P 500, investors should continue to raise exposure by buying top stocks breaking out past proper buy points.

Buyers watched Monday’s action mostly from the sidelines, although major averages got a late lift and pared losses by the close.


The S&P 500 trimmed an 0.7% intraday loss to 0.2%. The Nasdaq and IBD 50 also gave up 0.2%, and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1%.


Transports lagged, with the Dow Jones Transportation Index down 1.2%. The Russell 2000 also underperformed, falling 0.8%.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Friday’s levels. NYSE breadth was poor, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers by 2-to-1. The ratio was 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


![MP042516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP042516-207x300.jpg)After rallying 5% last week, crude oil for June delivery slumped $1.09, or 2.5%, to $42.64 a barrel as concerns of a continued global supply glut went back on the front burner.


The two-day Fed meeting starts Tuesday and the policy statement will be out Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Futures traders see a zero chance of a rate hike Wednesday but a 23% chance at the June 15 meeting.


The Fed has delivered on a vow to be transparent with the markets, so it’s not likely that markets will hear anything earth-shattering from Chair Janet Yellen. Still, Wall Street will be listening closely for signs of hawkishness from the Fed after mostly dovish statements in recent months.


The distribution-day count in the Market Pulse graphic remains stubbornly high. It hasn’t been enough to derail the rally, but it’s at a level that bears watching. But what’s not important to lose sight of is the fact that the S&P 500 is close to its 52-week high. An upside breakout isn’t out of the question, but since early November, the 2,100 level has been a tough nut to crack. The Nasdaq is 6% off its high and still has the 5,000 level to conquer.


Investors sold bonds again Monday but not with conviction. Still, the 10-year Treasury yield gained ground for the sixth straight session, rising three basis points to 1.92%.


Price action in top-rated growth stocks was muted, but **Zimmer Biomet** ([ZBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBH)) is showing bullish price and volume trends, with an up/down volume ratio of 2.1. It’s trading tightly near the top of a consolidation that started just over one year ago.


The overall environment for growth stocks remains challenging, and it’s even tougher during earnings season.


Last week, names like **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were setting up nicely ahead of earnings, but all four gapped down after reporting.

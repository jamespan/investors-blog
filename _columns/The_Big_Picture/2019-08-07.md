Stock Market Recovers After Soft Start; Disney Weighs On Dow, But Growth Stocks Shine
======================================================================================

The second day of a rally attempt for the stock market didn't look so hot early Wednesday as money moved out of stocks and into bonds again. But the session turned out to be a win for the bulls as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fought back after sharp losses, and growth stocks outperformed. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ended with a gain of 0.5%, helped by strength in **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) and **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)).




The Dow Jones industrials recovered nicely after a brief drop below its 200-day moving average, a longer-term support level. The index ended with a loss of just 0.1% after falling 589 points, or 2.3%, early in the day. The Nasdaq fell 1.7% early but reversed higher for a gain of 0.4%. The S&P 500 picked up 0.1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Tuesday.


**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) weighed on the Dow Jones all day, ending with a loss of 5%. There wasn't much good news in itsÂ [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-earnings-q3-2019-first-look-investments-disney-stock-buy-point/). Disney cited weakness at its theme parks as well as a disappointing performance from 21st Century Fox, which it acquired earlier in the year.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP080719-259x300.jpg)Silver jumped 4.5% to around $17.20 an ounce. Gold closed above the $1,500 level, rising 2.4% to $1,519.60 an ounce.


10-Year Plunges, Then Recovers
------------------------------


Another drop in the [10-year Treasury yield](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/inverted-yield-curve/) fueled negative sentiment early when it breached the 1.60% level, its lowest level in nearly three years. But the yield recovered with the stock market, ending at 1.72%, up 2 basis points.


A [big drop in interest rates](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/dow-jones-treasury-yields-yuan-slide-gold-price-spikes/) hurt financial stocks early, but a late rally in the 10-year yield wasn't much help for IBD's superregional bank industry group. It ended with a loss of around 3%.


Larger-than-expected interest rate cuts in India and New Zealand, and an unexpected rate cut in Thailand, reminded Wall Street early Wednesday that economies around the world remain vulnerable. Bond yields in Germany are still negative.


The oil market is also concerned that a worldwide economic slowdown could get worse before it gets better. U.S. crude oil futures plunged 4.7%, settling at $51.09 a barrel.


Stock Market Strength
---------------------


Earnings winners included **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)). Match gapped up to a new high, while HubSpot and FleetCor gapped above their 50-day moving averages.


Recent breakouts from **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)), **L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) look good, with all four stocks holding above [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Twitter held just above the 41.02 buy point.



**Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) has rebounded back above a 79.93 entry.


Bullish Sentiment Falls
-----------------------


Meanwhile, bullish newsletter sentiment in the latest week dropped sharply to 48.1% from 57.2% the prior week. Investors Intelligence noted that the 57.2% reading was the fourth in five weeks above the 55% level, signaling market risk.


Following newsletter writer sentiment is worthwhile because it's been shown to be a good contrarian indicator. Excessively bullish sentiment has been seen at market tops in the past. Bearish sentiment has been seen at market bottoms in the past.


For now, the important thing is to look for a follow-through day. As long as the Aug. 5 lows for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are not undercut, the rally remains intact. But the rally attempt needs at least a couple more days for a follow-through signal to work.

Earlier this year, the Nasdaq composite flashed a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) on Jan. 4, soaring 4.3% in higher volume on the seventh day of its rally attempt. After a market pullback in May, the index followed through again on June 7, jumping 1.7% in higher volume on the fourth day of its rally attempt.


FAANG Stocks Struggle
---------------------


If the stock market flashes a sign of strength with another follow-through day, don't expect leadership to come from the [FAANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/). **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) have fallen hard in recent days amid clear signs of institutional selling.


In the early stages of a new stock market uptrend, new leadership tends to come from newer names with top fundamentals trading near highs.

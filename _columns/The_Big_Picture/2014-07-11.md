Stocks End Week With Gains, But Volume Fades
=============================================

Stocks closed the week on a quietly upbeat note, a welcome relief to battered bulls.


The Nasdaq rose 0.4% Friday while the S&P 500 and the IBD 50 added 0.1%. Volume dropped across the board.


Despite the Nasdaq's gain, declining issues led advancing issues narrowly on the Nasdaq. Winners led losers by a 6-5 ratio on the NYSE.


Overall, the week's action was the worst in three months, as measured by distribution. One or more indexes suffered distribution in three sessions of the week, enough to downgrade the market's condition from confirmed uptrend to uptrend under pressure. The week's up days came in lighter volume.


The pressure label is like a yellow caution light. Research shows that since 2009, the next change in market outlook has been back to uptrend 46% of the time.


However, even if the market's next step is a resumed uptrend, headwinds could linger. How can the market inspire confidence when it's loaded with distribution days?


The heavy load makes it look unlikely that the market can navigate in less than ideal conditions. One bad news day could push such a market into trouble.


Yet stock investors should stay flexible, especially when something looks unlikely. Good moves sometimes start amid entrenched skepticism.


The investor should let the market itself guide his or her exposure, not the expectations surrounding the market.


Although the distribution count alone tells us that it wouldn't take much to push the market into a correction, flexibility requires the other question be asked: What could change the market for the better?


Since 2012, the market has managed to plod ahead and avoid a deep correction, often despite a high distribution count.


One factor that may help explain that ability to persist is corporate buybacks. Several market watchers have noted that since the broad, bullish move began in 2009, corporate buybacks have been the key driver.


Another factor that could change the market's current mood, for better or for worse, is earnings season.


Earnings will shift into a higher gear in the coming week. Companies set to report quarterly results include the major investment banks, semiconductor makers, oil companies and tone-setters such as **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


Google carries a respectable Composite Rating of 91. The stock has sketched a cup-with-handle base with a potential buy point at 595.75. The base is stage two, according to MarketSmith's pattern recognition technology.


For the week, the IBD 50 fell 3%, the Nasdaq 1.6%, the S&P 500 0.9% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slid 3.8%.

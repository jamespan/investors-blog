 The stock market barely moved Monday, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite managed all-time highs, at least on an intraday basis.


The market seemed confident about a win for Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential election, and the pro-EU candidate won in a landslide over the weekend.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was a big gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, rising nearly 3%. The tech bellwether's market capitalization topped $800 billion intraday, helped by news that Warren Buffett increased his stake in Apple to just over $19 billion in recent months.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MP050817-177x300.png)The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended with fractional gains in a session of tight trading. The S&P 500 crept above the 2400 level for a short while but ended below it. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.4%. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) eased 0.2%. Volume on the Nasdaq edged higher from Friday's level. Volume on the NYSE fell a bit.


Another distribution day fell off the count for the S&P 500 by Monday's close. Of the three that remain for the benchmark index, the losses range from 0.3% to 0.4%. That's hardly indicative of a market that's under distribution.


A popular fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index gave up 7% to 9.79. The last time the VIX was below 10 was in late 1993, a few months ahead of a decline of about 8% for the S&P 500 in February and March. The VIX shouldn't be used on its own to gauge market health, but when it's this low, it's a sign of a complacent market, and complacent markets can be risky markets.


That said, the market remains in a confirmed uptrend. As always, monitor new buys closely, and don't be afraid to take a solid gain in a stock if you have it. If it's a conviction holding that's trading tightly near highs after a nice gain, it's OK to give it more room, especially with the major averages trading tightly near highs.


Among the day's movers, China-based growth stocks followed **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) higher after the company reported strong earnings. Shares of JD.com jumped nearly 8% to 38.55, but they are well extended after a breakout last month from a flat base with a 32.57 buy point. JD.com competes with **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) in the China e-commerce space, and JD.com's latest results show the company is holding its own. Total sales jumped 34% to $11.1 billion.


**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) added 1.11 to 36.24 ahead of its earnings report Wednesday after the close. It's still in buy range after a breakout from a cup-shapedÂ  base with a 36.11 buy point.


**Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), which operates a social networking platform in China, reports May 16 before the open. It cleared a cup-with-handle base, best seen on the daily chart, with a 57.57 buy point.


Meanwhile, some top-performing new issues will be out with earnings this week. **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) reports Thursday after the close. The software name is back above its 50-day moving average as it works on a cup-shaped base.


Tech services firm **Presidio** ([PSDO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSDO)), which JPMorgan brought public in March at 14, also reports Thursday after the close. Fundamentals are light, but Presidio is working on a nice flat base with a 16.09 buy point.


And **Ichor Holdings** ([ICHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICHR)) reports Thursday after the close. The speculative chip-equipment name is getting support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout from a short IPO base in early January.


Some selling in the bond market lifted the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.39%, up 4 basis points, as the market gets more comfortable with the prospects of a rate hike at the June meeting.

Stocks Post Ho-Hum Gains; Market Like Watching Paint Dry
=========================================================

U.S. stock indexes coasted to moderate gains Friday, as payroll data reassured those who fear rate changes.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each chalked up a 0.4% advance. The IBD 50 rose 0.6%. The small-cap S&P 600 pounced 1.2% higher to a record high, while the Dow utility average leapt 1.3%.


Volume fell across the board.


![mP090216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mP090216-190x300.jpg)In August, small moves in below-average volume comprised the trend and that continued in the first two sessions of September. The quiet behavior has made market monitoring as interesting as watching paint dry.


Dullness, though, can mask significance. Distribution has sneaked higher. On Aug. 1, the distribution-day count was two on the Nasdaq and three on the S&P 500. It's now four and six, respectively, despite losing a few because of time.


How should investors handle the current situation?


The content of a portfolio will shape tactics. Consider taking these steps:


* Lock in profits on stocks up more than 20% from the buy point if your conviction in the stock isn't high.
* Sell any stock that drops 7% or 8% below your buy point.
* Sell any stock that threatens to turn a gain into a loss.
* If you take a 20% profit, consider unloading your weakest stock as well. You don't want to take profits in your best stocks and let laggards take over the portfolio.


What if the stocks in your portfolio don't match these situations? Perhaps your gains aren't yet at 20% and your losses not yet at 8%. Consider these steps:


* Take profits earlier, at perhaps 15%. If so, then losses should be cut at 5%. Keep a 3-to-1 ratio between profits and losses.
* If a stock breaks out and then limps back and forth in the 5% zone, consider selling. Such stocks could be signaling that they need more of a tailwind than the market is giving.


Here's a question to ask of every stock in your portfolio: Is it acting better or worse than you expected when you bought it? If worse is the answer, you have to ask why you are not selling.


On Friday, **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) made strong moves in context. Volume was only 10% to 15% above average but much stronger than recent sessions.


For the week, the IBD 50 added 1.2%; the Nasdaq, 0.6%; and the S&P 500, 0.5%.


**The future and its anomalies**: The market is getting close to events that need to be fully priced in. The Fed meets Sept. 20-21 and will have to make a rate decision.


Also, the market must price in the presidential election. The major parties have fielded candidates that are against or inconsistent on free trade and free markets. Pricing this into the stock market is unlikely to be bullish.

title: Small Caps Lead Stock Market Rally; Nasdaq Also Shows Bullish Price Action

The Nasdaq composite led a solid up session for the stock market Wednesday, rising 1.1%, while small caps continued their string of outperformance. After reclaiming its 50-day moving average Tuesday in solid volume, the Russell 2000 small-cap index rallied just over 2%. A rally in semiconductor stocks, and a solid breakout for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), boosted the Nasdaq.




The heaviest-weighted sectors in iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) are financial services (16.6%), industrials (15.3%), technology (15.1%) and health care (14.9%).


The 10-year yield has rallied sharply since hitting a low of around 1.43% earlier this month. That's helped financial stocks in the Russell 2000, although the Federal Reserve is still expected to cut its key lending rate by another 25 basis points at next week's meeting. That would bring the Federal Funds rate down to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Late Wednesday, the 10-year yield was around 1.74%.


Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) picked up 0.6%, on pace for its third straight weekly gain. It's trying to clear a short consolidation inside of a longer pattern that started last year.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones industrials rallied 0.8% and the S&P 500 picked up 0.7%. Volume narrowly fell on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed NYSE volume coming in lower than Tuesday's total.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP090919-1.jpg)The Aug. 23 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell of the count due to solid gains for both indexes since that day. The Nasdaq's Aug. 14 distribution day also fell off the count for the same reason. That leaves a light distribution-day count for both indexes.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose for the sixth straight session, up 1.5%. Semiconductor stocks to watch include **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)). It's still a breakout candidate as it sits just below a 52.52 entry. Group peer **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), meanwhile, is testing support at its 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout from a base July 1. Results from **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), a bellwether in the chip sector, are due Thursday after the close.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq now show five straight closes above the 50-day moving average. That's a positive for the confirmed uptrend as money rotates out of higher valuation, aggressive growth names into cheaper areas of the market like the financial and energy sectors.


Speaking of cheap, a fresh wave of institutional buying pushed **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) (a lower valuation stock) over a 221.47 buy point. At the company's [media event](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-iphone-11-launch-event/) on Wednesday, Apple introduced the iPhone 11, a fifth-generation Apple Watch and also gave details about upcoming services like Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade.


After Tuesday's rally off lows, the Nasdaq closed above last week's high of 8134 Wednesday, strengthening the bull thesis. Same for the S&P 500, which closed above its recent high of 2989.


But the stock market isn't out of the woods yet due to selling in leading growth stocks. Price action like this has been seen at market tops in the past. Still, the stock market's overall technical picture remains sound, which means it's OK to selectively nibble at new buys.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, soared 5% to an all-time high, helped by strong earnings. Headed into earnings, the top-performing retailer was extended past a 149.86 handle buy point.


Small cap **Funko** ([FNKO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNKO)), an [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) name with big earnings and sales growth, soared nearly 8% to 25.85. It closed just above a 25.58 buy point. But Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) couldn't keep up with the broad market, rising 0.6%.


Meanwhile, **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) is getting support at its 10-week moving average after a powerful breakout.


Former leaders in the [software sector](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) faced another round of selling, with **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) leading the downside. Shares plummeted 19% after the security software firm [reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zscaler-earnings-zs-stock-q22019/) and gave weak guidance.

CLOSE




Meanwhile, IBD's enterprise software group is down nearly 5% so far this week as group leaders like **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) and **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) have come under intense selling. Paycom is now the poster child of what a leading growth stock looks like when it rolls over. Shares are down 17% so far this week in heavy volume. Don't expect a meaningful rally from Paycom anytime soon.

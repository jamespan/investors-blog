The major indexes fell sharply Tuesday as a troubled stock market deteriorated more.


Wall Street sold off into the close, as it often does when the market is correcting. The Nasdaq slid 1.6% and the S&P 500 1.5%. Both had the lowest closing price since mid-August.


Volume rose significantly â€” the vapor trails of institutional investors flying away from stocks.


Since the Sept. 19 peak, the indexes have been making lower lows and lower highs. That's a classic downtrend.


But Thursday's lows are holding so far. The market can consider itself in an attempted rally as long as the indexes don't sink below those levels.


For now, it's best to treat stocks with the caution and apprehension that a downtrending market deserves. Avoid buying stocks and take profits to reduce your exposure.


Last week, market fear hit elevated levels as the put-call volume ratio spiked above 1.0. In the past year or so, such readings signaled market bottoms.


So far, there's been no sustained rebound, although the ratio's spikes haven't coincided exactly with index lows.


This week is the start of earnings season, a time that tends to make the Street nervous. The market's slides in January and July occurred around earnings seasons. The March-April correction bottomed at about the start of the Q1 earnings reports.


But on Tuesday, it was worries about the global economy that seemed to pressure stocks the most.


The International Monetary Fund downgraded its global growth forecast for 2014 and 2015. German industrial output fell 4% in August, a drop worse than expected. A day earlier, German industrial orders for August fell the most since 2009.


Institutional investors maneuvered funds toward lower-risk assets.


Defensive stocks such as utilities, consumer staples, medicals, food wholesalers and hospitals fared relatively better.


The transportation sector, which has been a market leader, skidded. Railroad, shipping and related stocks were among the day's worst performers.


Some cyclical industry groups such as construction machinery and oil exploration also lagged.


Peeling back another layer of the market: the leading stocks were weaker. The IBD 50 tumbled 2.6%, its largest loss since April 25. About half of its components are trading below the 50-day moving average.


**Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) is the most recent breakout in the IBD 50 and is holding up.


**GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)), the market's runaway winner of late, reversed from a new high. Its shares were lower in extended trading on a report that Piper Jaffray downgraded the camera maker to neutral from overweight.


Medical stocks remain a sort of lifeboat in the market, with some of the leaders showing resilience.


**Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) found support at the 50-day line. It is one of four Sector Leaders in the medical sector, which ranks fourth out of 33 sectors. (See the sector listings on Page B6.)


**Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) is forming a flat base that shows some solid price and volume action.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major stock indexes sold off Thursday, as Wall Street digested President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs. Up next, investors are preparing for more inflation data, with Friday's release of the producer price index.


Following Wednesday's historic rally, blue chips on the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 2.5%. The S&P 500 sold off 3.5%, while the Nasdaq composite dived 4.3%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 crumbled 4.3%.




Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange compared with Wednesday's session. The 10-year Treasury yield slashed big losses to close at 4.39%, still at its highest level since February.


And the Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, jumped back above 40. The VIX had spiked above 60 Monday for the first time since August. The fear gauge signaled at least a short-term market bottom, but it doesn't have to last.


Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors moved lower, with energy and technology pacing the losers. The consumer staples sector was the clear winner of the session as investors rotated further into defensive stocks.

Trump Tariff Fallout; CPI Inflation Report
------------------------------------------


With President Trump's 90-day reprieve on reciprocal tariffs above 10% — except for China — markets pulled back from the brink of instability. Now the focus turns to the impact of still-significant Trump tariffs on inflation, the labor market and the outlook for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, as well as Trump's deals with key trading partners over the next 90 days.


Early Thursday, [the core consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-march-federal-reserve-jobless-claims-sp-500/) came in much cooler than expected in March, easing to a four-year low.


The CPI unexpectedly fell 0.1% in March, as the 12-month inflation rate slid to 2.4% from 2.8% in February. The core CPI edged up just 0.1% vs. 0.3% forecasts. That lowered the 12-month core inflation rate to 2.8%, the lowest since March 2021.


After the CPI data and Thursday's action, markets are now pricing in a 27% chance for a rate cut at the May 7 Fed meeting, up from 20% a day ago, according to [CME Group's FedWatch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html). Economists now put the chances of a rate cut by the June 18 meeting at 83.5%, up from 74%.


For the full year, markets are on the fence on whether the total in rate cuts will amount to 75 or 100 basis points. Predictions call for a 51% chance of cuts totaling 100 basis points while the chances of that coming in at 75 are seen at 49%.


Up next, the Labor Department is set to release its March producer price index Friday morning. The core PPI for March is expected to rise 0.3% on the month with an annual increase of 3.6%, according to Econoday estimates.

All of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended the day sharply lower, as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) exchange traded fund lost 5.2%.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MP041025.jpg)


As the major stock indexes continue to swing wildly, IBD maintains a  recommended exposure level at 0%-20% for investors. That's a clear sign that caution continues to be the obvious choice, a key element of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/).


With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 holding off their recent lows, investors are on the lookout for a potential follow-through day. Day 1 of the attempted rallies began Monday.


On Day 4 or later of the attempted rally, the Nasdaq or S&P 500 must deliver a strong gain in volume up from the previous day. That big gain in rising volume is the [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/), which confirms that a new uptrend is underway.


That means the Nasdaq can stage a follow-through day anytime now, as long as it holds above its April 7 low. But even if there is a follow-through day, investors will need to maintain their disciplined approach to risk management. Make sure to wade into and out of the market as the indexes strengthen and weaken.


Remember, not all [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) succeed, but no market uptrend has started without one.

Instead of buying stocks right now, [investors should consider new watchlists](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) with stocks that are holding up best in the current stock market correction. These could be some of the next uptrend's market leaders. And many previous leaders are moving up the right sides of new bases. These stocks could re-emerge as market leaders if the market is able to stabilize and then move higher.


An easy way to identify market leaders is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) to gauge an individual stock's relative performance. A rising relative strength line shows a stock is outperforming the S&P 500, while a downtrending line shows the reverse.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured zero new stocks Thursday, which makes sense given the market weakness. And the Near Pivot list has dwindled to just seven ideas, a sign that most stocks have succumbed to heavy selling.

Stocks Market Leaders To Watch: DoorDash, Life Time, Netflix, Spotify
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Amid the ongoing stock market correction, now is not the time to be raising exposure in growth stocks. Doing so would be fighting the current stock market trend. Instead, keep an eye on market leaders that are holding up and eyeing new buy points, including **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)), **Life Time** ([LTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTH)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)).



[IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) DoorDash is about 10% away from a 201.03 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a double bottom, according to [IBD MarketSurge chart analysis](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). The relative strength line is just off new highs.


Fitness leader [Life Time](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/planet-fitness-life-time-group-stock/) is forming a double bottom that has a 32.85 buy point, as shares rebound from last week's lows. The relative strength line has already made a new high, triggering the blue dot on the IBD MarketSurge chart. That's a bullish indicator of market leadership.


[Netflix's double bottom](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/netflix-stock-best-mutual-funds-binge-on-shares/) offers a 998.70 entry and its relative strength line is at a new high. Finally, [Spotify has also built a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-has-one-knock-against-it-analyst-says/) that has a 621.20 buy point.

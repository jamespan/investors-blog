Indexes Snag Distribution Again, But Small Caps Up
===================================================

Mixed earnings results tend to produce mixed market reactions. Wednesday was no exception. The major stock indexes fell in unison, with the Nasdaq taking the bigger hit. The tech-rich composite fell 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 1.1%; the Philly Sox slumped 2.5%.

  

The S&P 500 fell only 0.2%, despite another broad sell-off in oil, steel and mining stocks.

  

Volume grew on both exchanges, boosting the distribution day count (see Market Pulse table).

  

When a distribution day occurs, it means hedge funds, mutual funds, banks, pensions and the like are actively taking profits and raising cash. When these investors sell, stocks struggle.

  

A slew of such days after a long market run-up can spell the end of a bull run and usher a savage bear or at least a pullback.

  

With the S&P's distribution count back up to six, that number alone should raise concern. However, Wednesday's session featured numerous peculiarities.

  

One, the Nasdaq finished in the upper half of its trading range, while the S&P 500 was close.

  

Two, smaller companies rallied as some leaders posted nice Q2 results. Companies such as [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) member **Blackhawk Network** ([HAWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAWK)) (market cap of $2.5 billion), **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)) ($5 billion) and **Evercore Partners** ([EVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVR)) ($2.1 billion) are thriving in the market, rising to new highs and acting well after staging recent breakouts.

  

Manhattan, which recently cleared a 60.08 flat-base buy point, notched its 11th straight quarter of 20%-plus EPS growth. Q2 earnings lifted 28% on a 14% bump up in sales to $139.1 million, a quarterly best. It's No. 7 in Wednesday's [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/).

  

Today's Industry Themes column notes strength in the homebuilding arena.

  

The small-cap S&P 600 gained 0.2%, the Russell 2000, 0.3%.

  

The IBD 50 added 0.2%.

  

Three, the market is due for a rest. As Greece pledged to change its profligate spending ways and stay in the eurozone, U.S. stocks have soared in recent weeks. The S&P 500 had jumped as much as 4.3% after tickling its 200-day moving average for a few days in early July.

  

Finally, a look at the six distribution days that occurred between June 19 and Wednesday shows that they've all been tame. The declines were 0.5%, 0.7%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.4% and 0.2%. Contrast that with the S&P 500's August 2000 top. Among some of the major distribution days back then, the 500 fell 0.9% and 1% in back-to-back sell-offs Sept. 5-6. A week later, the 500 dropped another 1% on Sept. 15.

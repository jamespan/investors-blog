Stocks caught their breath Wednesday on news suggesting that eurozone leaders and Greece were still at loggerheads over the latter's ability to cut its spending and pay off debts.

  

The market also appeared to telegraph some nervousness over the Supreme Court's pending decision over whether ObamaCare's federal subsidy program runs afoul of the Constitution. Several hospital, drug distributor and other stocks that could be affected fell in busy trading.

  

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%, its biggest decline in more than two weeks. Volume shrank just 1%.

  

The decline follows new all-time highs in the leading market index. The decline is also normal in light of the 2.6% rally that the Nasdaq enjoyed over the prior six sessions.

  

The Nasdaq 100 lost 0.5%. It seems to have trouble overcoming upside resistance near the 4550-4560 level. The benchmark for the Nasdaq's 100 largest nonfinancial companies is having a decent year so far, up 6.8% since Jan. 1.

  

The S&P 500 matched the Nasdaq composite's 0.7% decline, but volume on the NYSE edged slightly higher. That added a seventh distribution day, or a significant decline in higher turnover, to the S&P 500 in recent weeks.

  

Normally, a market rally cannot last when distribution days pile up fast. Indeed, Wednesday's action revealed a higher degree of serious selling in leading software and health care stocks.

  

The IBD 50 dropped 1.4%. Yet volume was mostly subdued among leading stocks as a whole. Perhaps portfolio managers want to see whether Greece can get out of its fiscal jam.

  

The high distribution count remains a concern, but as noted in this column last week, few of the recent sell-offs were serious in nature. In contrast, go back to June 22 to July 11, 2011, and it took just three sharp declines for IBD's outlook to downgrade to "uptrend under pressure" soon after the June 21 follow-through that year.

  

That year, the Nasdaq had a 20% decline.

  

Homebuilders moved higher after **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) reported robust results. (See [story](http://news.investors.com/business/062415-758854-lennar-sales-profit-surge-on-strong-orders.htm).) Earlier this week, U.S. new home sales in May beat views. The stock is building a base-on-base pattern, and its 82 RS Rating is in the ballpark for stocks that aim to break out to new highs.

  

The Dow transports slumped 1.9% while the Philadelphia semiconductor index dropped 1%.

title: Bear Market Gains Traction; What The Fed's Dot Plot Means For Growth Investors

In a bear market, investors can expect trading sessions to end badly. Wednesday's reaction to another steep jump in short-term interest rates reaffirmed this unwritten law of Wall Street.




Early gains by the major indexes expanded measurably after the Federal Reserve made it three meetings in a row in jacking up the fed funds rate by three quarters of a point. That decision, announced at 2 p.m. ET, set the cost of overnight loans by the U.S. central bank to large banks to a target range of 3%-3.25%.


But as the roughly 43-minute news conference held by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wore on, those brief gains of more than 1% to 1.5% withered. Indexes then turned decisively lower in the final hour of trading. The S&P 500, falling 1.7% to 3789.82, closed 0.33 point above the day's low.


The announcement also highlighted the [Fed's changed thinking on how high interest rates could in fact go in both 2022 and 2023](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-stock-market-sells-off-as-hawkish-fed-sees-new-terminal-rate/) before the U.S. sees inflation really moderate.


This heavy-handed selling extended to the other averages.


The Nasdaq composite, slipping 1.8% on Wednesday, posted its lowest daily close since July 1. The tech-heavy index has now fallen more than 7% below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), which for now continues to rise. Meanwhile, small caps fell less. But the Russell 2000 still got whacked with a 1.4% loss.


An Entrenched Bear Market
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP092122-300x300.jpg)Bank and financial stocks weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, off 1.7%. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) all surrendered at least 2 points. They also have forfeited mild gains gotten during the quarter.


None of these blue chips trade above their long-term [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/), either. Treat that as typical action during a real bear market.


Volume rose on both main exchanges vs. Tuesday. Again, you'd expect selling to intensify in such dreary conditions for equities.


What caused the momentary rise in equities?


Price Stability Takes Priority
------------------------------


It may be comments such as the one by Powell in response to journalists' questions regarding the possibility that the Fed, having already raised short-term interest rates by three full percentage points in about nine months, would consider slowing down its monetary tightening campaign. The Fed chief also clearly stated that the bank is not going to make any decision on how to reduce its federal agency-backed mortgage debt holdings in the immediate future. Higher rates and a long rise in home prices have led to some cooling in the real estate market.


However, Powell's other comments made it crystal-clear that the Fed's No. 1 job today is to focus on getting the long-run inflation rate to 2% annually. And it will take a long time before that could occur.


The newly revised summary of economic projections by the FOMC monetary policy committee members shows a median forecast for core PCE inflation to fall from 4.5% this year to 3.1% next year, then cooling off further to 2.3% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025.


Powell said that the Fed wants to take interest rates up to a level that is "restrictive enough to take inflation to 2%." In plain English: Even higher interest rates are needed to slow down demand and prices in the economy.


IBD Trading Strategy Today
--------------------------


In such a situation, do defensive stocks flourish in a bear market? Not necessarily.



The SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) exchange traded fund tanked 1.4% in accelerating and heavy turnover. The ETF also sliced further below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


For sure, utilities have done comparably better than the broader stock indexes. But as the 2008-2009 financial crisis showed, even utilities can go on wicked declines. Back then, the Dow Jones Utility Average dove from 557 to 287, falling more than 48%.


The Fed's "dot plot" of economic growth looks crummy. The central bank sees GDP up just 0.2% this year. What about the next three years? How do 1.2%, 1.7% and 1.8% sound? Not good.


Of course, economists and bankers make forecasts that are often wrong. But if economic growth is to remain slow for years, one might expect the market to make smaller advances. And this means that finding and singling out concentrated investments in companies with brilliant fundamentals, excellent new products and services, and other qualities seen in true [CAN SLIM-quality stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) is going to matter even more.

Yield Curve Fuels Bear Market Risk
----------------------------------


Meanwhile, bond investors actually bought long-dated bonds, perhaps to take advantage of the strong jump in rates. The yield in the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 6 basis points to 3.51%, Cboe data showed. But at one point, the yield hit 3.62% to mark the highest level since February 2011.


The yield curve continues to invert. This means interest rates in short-term debt are climbing above the rates of longer-duration bonds. The opposite of this is a rising yield curve, which normally offers a healthy environment for the economy. Lenders borrow money cheaply from the Federal Reserve, then provide longer-term loans at a profitable rate.


Today, this spread in net interest is getting ever more squeezed.


Data from Tradeweb showed that at 3 p.m. ET, the spread between 2-year and 30-year Treasuries stood at a negative 48 basis points. That expanded from a deficit of 38 basis points on Tuesday's market close.Â  At the end of August, the spread was much thinner at -19.7 basis points.


Put another way, the yield spread between these bonds remains at its most inverted since the end of August 2000.

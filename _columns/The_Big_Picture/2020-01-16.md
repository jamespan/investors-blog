Stock Market Powers To More Record Highs; Novocure, PayPal, XP Are 3 Leaders To Watch
======================================================================================

The stock market set more record highs Thursday on strong U.S. retail sales and [bullish trade news](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-roars-on-bullish-trade-econ-news-dow-extends-winning-streak-to-fourth-day/), as the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 270 points. The major stock indexes closed right at the day's highs as the market uptrend saw no slowing.




The Nasdaq composite closed with a nearly 1.1% gain. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 ended with a 0.8% rise and the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a 0.9%, or 267-point, gain. All three major indexes hit all-time highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 also reached record highs Thursday. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) jumped 1.3%, resulting in its addition to [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader). Volume was modestly lower on both main exchanges.


Stock Market Rally Hits More Highs
----------------------------------


With the major stock indexes setting more all-time highs Thursday, the current [stock market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) continues to power higher. The Nasdaq is already up 4.3% in the first 11 sessions of the new year. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are each up 2.7% in 2020.

The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remains muted, with just two on both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes. Meanwhile, there hasn't been a whole lot of selling across the stock market's best stocks, although **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) sold off as much as 5% after an [analyst downgrade.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-drops-acceleration-fuels-concern-overheating/) But the electric-car maker closed down just 1%. During strong markets, stocks hit with bad news typically sell off at the start of the day but then bounce to close well off session lows, as they receive institutional support.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP011620-239x300.jpg)That support wasn't evident for **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) on Wednesday, when the [retailer plunged](https://www.investors.com/news/target-stock-flashes-sell-signal-as-holiday-flop-hits-outlook-key-executive-retires/) through its 50-day support level. It fell a bit more Thursday.


Amid light institutional selling in the market, investors should feel free to remain on the offensive. There have been solid breakouts in the past several weeks — like today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), **Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) — so buying opportunities still exist. But be sure to follow trading rules. Take at least some profits in stocks that rise 20% to 25% from the correct buy point to lock in gains on the upside.


3 Top Stocks To Watch: Novocure, PayPal, XP
-------------------------------------------


Top stocks to watch in addition to [Novocure](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cancer-treatment-stock-novocure-breaks-out-strong-quarterly-sales/) include [top payment stock](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/) **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and [IPO stock leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-brazil-top-broker-shows-first-buy-point-xp-stock/) **XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)).


Novocure stock jumped 11.8% to break out past a double bottom's 90.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after the company's strong preliminary Q4 sales results. The stock is in the 5% buy zone, which tops out at 94.61, so the stock is barely clinging to the buy range.


Top digital payments stock PayPal is approaching a 121.58 buy point in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/), according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


IPO Leader XP continues to shape an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 40.60 buy point. It is the Brazilian broker's first buy point since its Dec. 11 IPO.


Earnings Results To Watch: Fastenal, Schlumberger
-------------------------------------------------



Earnings results to watch Friday morning are **Fastenal** ([FAST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAST)) and **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)). Fastenal's earnings are expected to grow 7% to 32 cents per share vs. the year-ago period on revenue of $1.29 billion. Fastenal stock is trading about 2% below a 38.01 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).


Schlumberger stock is still trying to create a proper base after trading as low as 30.65 on Oct. 8. The company is expected to end a four-quarter streak of declining earnings growth. Analysts expect the oilfield services giant to earn 37 cents per share, an increase of 3%, on revenue of $8.16 billion.

The Nasdaq composite led the stock market rally Thursday, as a plunge in Treasury yields gave stock investors some relief. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hit more record highs.




The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled some 11 basis points, closing at 1.53%, its lowest level since March 11. On March 30, the 10-year Treasury yield peaked at just over 1.76%, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


The Nasdaq outperformed Thursday, rising 1.3%. The S&P 500 moved up 1.1%, while the Dow 30 rose 0.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.4%.


Leading growth stocks underperformed slightly, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.8%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 17-ranked **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) is trading just below an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 547.57 in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) after Thursday's 4.1% advance.


![MP041521](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP041521-242x300.jpg)Volume ended higher on the Nasdaq compared with Wednesday's figures; NYSE volume was mildly lower.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The Nasdaq snapped back from Wednesday's sell-off, more than recovering from that 1% fall. The tech-heavy composite closed above the 14,000 price level and is just shy of all-time highs. Meanwhile, the Dow and S&P 500 set more record highs Thursday.


All three major stock indexes again closed near session highs. Strength into the market close, especially after early weakness, is a key characteristic of a healthy [stock market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). On Thursday, the major stock indexes opened squarely higher and remained strong throughout the session.


Amid the recent strength, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both have only one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which bodes well for the current stock market uptrend. With low levels of institutional selling, investors should feel confident in buying stocks breaking out past [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

Stocks To Watch: Apple, Coinbase
--------------------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) continues to march up the right side of a new cup base, rallying nearly 2% Thursday. For now, the stock is still pretty far from its 145.19 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a [cup base.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) Be on the lookout for a potential handle to offer a lower buy point.


A key flaw is the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/). It remains far from its late January highs.


Cryptocurrency exchange **Coinbase Global** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) reversed from early gains to fall 1.7% Thursday following Wednesday's debut. Investors should wait for an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) to form before jumping into the hot IPO stock.

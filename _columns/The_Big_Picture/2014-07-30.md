Indexes Rise But Accumulation Is Still Less Than Robust
========================================================

The market returned to a limited buying mood after the U.S. central bank further reduced its appetite for bonds and mortgages, its effort to keep the cost of money low.


The Nasdaq composite snapped a mild four-day losing streak Wednesday with a 0.5% advance in lower volume. That gain nearly recouped all of the prior four sessions' worth of losses.


But the S&P 500 showed that the institutional crowd wasn't exactly buying with serious conviction. It edged less than 1 point higher. That marked the S&P 500's third tiny gain since last Thursday, when the index popped an all-time high. NYSE volume rose.


The IBD 50 rose 0.3%. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, or the Sox, ran up 1%.


The Federal Reserve, after wrapping up a two-day policy meeting in Washington, noted in a news release that inflation "has moved somewhat closer to the Committee's longer-run objective." And with Wednesday's surprise 4% jump in U.S. second-quarter GDP, no equity-desk trader likely blinked an eye when the Fed cut its monthly purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgages to $25 billion. The Fed's purchases of such securities had peaked at $85 billion each month, but started being trimmed this year.


The surprise in the Fed's comments was that ongoing slack in the labor market is good reason to be cautious in any future move to begin raising the federal funds rate — what is charged to big banks. That rate continues to hover between zero and 0.25%.


The 2 p.m. ET announcement gave some late-afternoon energy to the bulls. But the market's internals remain mixed at best. As seen in the Dow industrials chart on this page, the NYSE advance-decline line is still cooling. It's treaded lower for nearly four weeks.


On the Nasdaq's side, the number of stocks rising to 52-week or all-time highs has been muzzled — and thus, so have the number of solid breakouts. Over the prior five trading sessions, the average number of Nasdaq stocks hitting new highs on IBD's list was 63. Finally, the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings for the indexes (see the charts on this page) remain poor.


Sector rotation continues to prevail. Look at the top 20 industry groups in Wednesday's newspaper, and you'll see that no fewer than seven had not been in the top 20 six weeks ago.


Would this imply that new breakouts are ready to burst out like butterflies passing their chrysalis phase? Not necessarily.


Groups such as Medical-Long Term Care (No. 3 out of 197 industry groups), Banks-Foreign (No. 5) and Medical-Hospitals (No. 4) aren't exactly brimming with high-growth firms that are trading near their 52-week highs and crafting excellent bases. Rather, many stocks in these groups are on the mend.

Stocks closed at record highs Monday, stretching their January rally to a point where investors have to wonder if it's getting late at the party.




 Indexes were dull in early trading, but picked up the pace after headlines flashed news that congressional leaders had reached an agreement on [ending the government's shutdown](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/government-shutdown-could-end-today-unless-democrats-dig-in/). Many federal offices were closed after Congress failed to approve new spending on Friday. Monday's vote keeps operations running at least through Feb. 8.


The Nasdaq composite led with a 1% jump thanks to an outstanding day for biotech and internet stocks. Oil and gas stocks also thrived. The S&P 500 added 0.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.5%. All four indexes made all-time highs.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE. Advancers beat decliners by 7-to-4 on the NYSE, but breadth was more subdued on the Nasdaq, where winners had only a small advantage.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP01221818-220x300.png)Despite the composite's sharp gain, much of the Nasdaq's advance centered on biotechs (where two major deals were announced) and megacaps that performed exceptionally well, including **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), ahead of its earnings report. (After the close, Netflix surged as it beat sales and subscriber estimates.)


No doubt, market gauges are pointing in the right direction. The only question is whether indexes are at an elevation where the air is too thin and some adjustment in the course of its ascent may be in the offing.


If the market is due for a pullback, it won't be because of heavy levels of distribution. Only one [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/ http://www.investors.com/short-selling/) is on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500: a bearish reversal on Jan. 16. Investors shrugged it off and indexes have climbed above that day's price ranges.


If a pullback does happen, it could be just due to the laws of gravity. The Nasdaq is up 7.3% this month, a sharp acceleration from the 0.4% to 3.6% monthly increases during the final six months of 2017. The composite is on track for its best month since October 2015, when it leapt 9.4%. That month, the composite was recovering from a correction, which makes this month's rally all the more impressive: Indexes keep padding the superb gains of 2017.


As market risks go, the most immediate is fourth-quarter results. Earnings reports start coming in at a faster pace this week, and with each bellwether company lies the risk that Wall Street will think a hiccup might be indicative of something larger.


This week, 79 S&P 500 companies are [reporting fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), FactSet says, and there are signs the index will post another strong quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to increase 12.4% from the year-ago quarter, according to Thomson Reuters and Lipper Alpha Insight. Excluding the recovering energy sector, the earnings growth estimate drops to 9.9%.


Of 53 companies in the S&P 500 that had reported earnings by Friday, 79.2% topped analyst expectations. "This is above the long-term average of 64% and in-line with the prior four quarter average of 72%," the Thomson Reuters-Lipper Alpha report said. So far nearly 87% of companies have reported Q4 revenue above expectations, which is also above the long-term average of 60%.


Rotation continues to unfold, and it is bringing up some sectors that months ago had been out of favor, namely retail and energy.


Nine of the top 30 industry groups Monday were in oil & gas. **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) broke out past the 53.79 buy point of a cup with handle. Volume was heavy after Halliburton beat Q4 earnings and revenue views Monday.


In retail, companies are coming back from the dead. **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) is near a potential 36.20 buy point as it recovers from a 60% correction from November 2016 to June 2017.


**Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) stock soared 12.6% after the [youth-oriented apparel chain forecast better-than-expected quarterly sales](https://www.investors.com/news/abercrombie-fitch-stock-surges-to-16-month-high-on-raised-holiday-sales-guidance/) on Monday. The stock has been rising strongly since the Aug. 24 earnings report, much like the retail sector also has been rebounding on strong holiday shopping.


The updraft in retail is part of a rising leadership in consumer stocks.


Casino operator **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) gapped up nearly 9% Monday after it reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales that topped Wall Street forecasts, lifted by strong results in Macau.


Biotechs were the best-performing industry group Monday thanks to [two major acquisitions](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sanofi-said-near-11-5-billion-bioverativ-buy-as-drug-ma-buzz-heats-up/). **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)) agreed to buy **Bioverativ** ([BIVV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIVV)) for $11.6 billion and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) will acquire drug-development partner **Juno Therapeutics** ([JUNO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JUNO)) for $9 billion. Bioverativ shares soared 62% and Juno 27% in huge volume. Sanofi fell 3% while Celgene erased losses and closed up a fraction.

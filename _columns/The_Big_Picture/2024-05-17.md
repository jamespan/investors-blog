The stock market made weekly gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above a key level for the first time on Friday. Now the latest Federal Reserve minutes and earnings from artificial intelligence giant **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are imminent.




While the Nasdaq composite dipped 0.1% Friday, it still turned in a solid weekly gain of 2.1%. It has now risen for four weeks in a row and is now up 11.2% for the year. The tech-heavy index sits above its short-term moving averages as well as the key [50-day line.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)


The S&P 500 ended the session up 0.1%. But its weekly climb came in at 1.5% and it has powered nearly 3% above the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The benchmark index is also now up more than 11% in 2024.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned in a gain of 0.3% and managed to close above the 40,000 mark for the first time. A decisive move above this level will be encouraging for blue chip investors. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) fared best while **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) struggled the most. **JP Morgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) was also strong on a day where about half of money center banks made new highs.


Small caps slipped, though the Russell 2000 only turned in a nominal decline on the stock market as it ended essentially flat. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund, a good gauge for growth stock investors, reversed lower as it slipped 0.1%.


Advancers held a slight edge on decliners on the New York Stock Exchange while the opposite was true on the Nasdaq exchange.

Metal miners, database software firms, gold miners and a variety of oil-and-gas groups were among the best performers. Many mining stocks made new highs Friday.

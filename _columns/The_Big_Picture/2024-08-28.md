The stock market fell sharply Wednesday as a nervous vibe set in on a session that preceded one of the most consequential earnings reports in **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) quarterly results after the close.




The Nasdaq composite slid 1.1% and closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/), which had been a footrest for the index over the past couple of weeks. Weakness in tech stocks contributed to the Nasdaq's loss.


Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) slid 1.4%, easily the worst performing of the S&P major sector indexes. The index closed below the 50-day moving average. To be sure, techs weren't the only weak sector as most S&P sector indexes fell Wednesday. Financials and health care had minor gains.


The S&P 500 lost 0.6%, extending a sideways trend that has developed over the past couple of weeks. The Nasdaq also has moderated the past two weeks, as the stock market uptrend takes what seems like a normal pause from a solid run.


Volume rose on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq exchange, although an increase was almost assured following quiet trading Tuesday. In fact, market volume Tuesday was the lightest so far this year, excluding half sessions.


Distribution Day For S&P
------------------------


The combination of losses in higher volume Wednesday gave the major indexes a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), including the first for the S&P 500 of the current market cycle.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP082824.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) accounted for almost 35 of the Dow's 159-point loss as shares fell 2%. But the stock bounced back 3.5% after hours following the company's earnings report.


Small caps didn't fare much better, with the Russell 2000 down nearly 0.7% for its third straight decline.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by roughly an 8-5 ratio on the NYSE and by 9-to-4 on the Nasdaq.


Still, there were many more new 52-week highs than new lows, and market breadth in general continues to be positive. The 10-day moving average of stocks up in volume vs. down in volume has been positive for about two weeks, corresponding with a sharp decline in the new lows.


Nvidia Lower After The Close
----------------------------


After Wednesday's close, Nvidia reported July-quarter sales and earnings that topped expectations and the company boosted its outlook.


But in the stock market's initial reaction, Nvidia shares fell 5% in extended trading. That came despite the fact the artificial intelligence leader set a new $50 billion stock buyback.


Stocks weakened overnight, too. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) was down 0.7% around 5 p.m. ET, while SPDR S&P 500 Trust ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) lost 0.4%.

Even in a group of stocks that accounts for much of the stock market's performance, Nvidia stands out. The stock has outperformed the Magnificent Seven this year, up more than 150% compared with a 31% increase for the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) exchange traded fund. Nvidia also has more than tripled the ETF's performance from the Aug. 5 market bottom.


But Investor's Business Daily's IBD 50 index, which includes Nvidia, fell 1.3% Wednesday. The index is testing resistance at its 50-day moving average. It would have performed better if not for a sell-off for index newcomer **Harrow** ([HROW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HROW)), which slid nearly 9%, and **Powell Industries** ([POWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWL)), which was down 10%.


Stock Market Opportunities Ahead?
---------------------------------


Other IBD tools suggest investors will find more buying opportunities if the stock market holds up. The Relative Strength Blue Dot screen in [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) — which identifies stocks with RS lines at highs while they form or break out of bases — has nearly 100 stocks.


Although some of those are extended from breakouts, keep an eye on **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)), **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **SPX Technologies** ([SPXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPXC)). NetApp reported quarterly results after the close and was little changed in extended trading.


From a broad perspective, the stock market is behaving the way investors might expect. Indexes rebounded from their August lows and nothing in the current pause seems excessively bearish. Distribution days remain low and benign. Thus, IBD continues to recommend a stock exposure level of 60% to 80%.


Keep in mind that market's reaction to Nvidia with a full day of trading Thursday is likely to impact the tech sector and beyond.


Turning to the bond market, traders continue to price in lower interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield is near its lowest levels of the year, at 3.84% late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, at 3.866%, is at the lowest since May 2023, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

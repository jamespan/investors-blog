The stock market opened the week with more gains Monday, helped by a rally in tech stocks sparked by a buyout in the semiconductor sector.


The Nasdaq rose 0.5% as it tries to build a new home above the 5000 level. The S&P 500 picked up 0.2% and the Dow added 0.1%. The Russell 2000 rose 0.2%, marking its fifth straight close above 1200. The IBD 50 outperformed with a 0.6% gain.


Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by nearly 2 to 1. Winners had a slight edge over losers on the Nasdaq.


Japan's **SoftBank** ([SFTBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFTBY)) agreed to pay $32 billion for U.K.-based chip designer **ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)). Shares of ARM soared just over 40%. It was a big premium, because headed into Monday, ARM's market capitalization was around $22 billion. ARM dominates the market for wireless microprocessors for the **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone and other mobile devices.


![MP071816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP071816.jpg)After a 10% rally over the past 14 sessions, a pause for the Nasdaq wouldn't be surprising. If it pulls back in the near term, watch for lower volume. The less signs of institutional selling there are in the early stages of a confirmed uptrend, the better the chances for a sustained rally.


Healthy pullbacks come in lower volume; unhealthy pullbacks come in higher volume. The latter is usually indicative of institutional selling. Since the June 30 follow-through, there's only been one instance of distribution in the S&P 500 (July 5).


A slew of retailers outperformed Monday.


**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) paced the discount retail group, up more than 5%. **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) also outperformed in the group. Both are vying for breakouts from flat-base structures.


**Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) did the heavy lifting in the apparel, shoes and accessories group. Shares leapt 8.5%. It's a leader after a breakout in late May.


In economic news, the National Association of Home Builders index clocked a reading of 59, below the consensus estimate of 61 and June's reading of 60. Homebuilders didn't move much on the news. Housing starts are due Tuesday and existing-home sales will be out Thursday.


Leading homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) added 0.4%. It reports earnings Thursday after the close. It's trading tightly and still in buy range from an early 32.20 flat-base entry. 


Shares of **Mellanox** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) rose 0.4%, ending just above a 50.79 cup-with-handle buy point. Earnings are due Wednesday after the close.


The bulls have reason to be optimistic, with growth stocks acting well, and the distribution-day count as low as it is. It remains a headline-driven market, though, where sentiment can turn on a dime. Second-quarter earnings season is here. The bulls are hoping that earnings will be the next catalyst.


**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/results-due-from-intuitive-mellanox-dominos-yum-results-impress/) column, is setting up in a good base ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. Its weekly chart shows a conventional entry at 140.90, although a handle area has formed on the daily chart that shows a 137.12 entry, 10 cents above its July 8 high.


In Monday's after-hours session, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) were earnings winners, up 3% and 9%, respectively. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) wasn't so lucky. Shares slid 14% after Q2 subscriber growth came up short.

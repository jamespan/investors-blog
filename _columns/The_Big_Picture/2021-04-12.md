The stock market drifted lower Monday as Wall Street braced for another reading on inflation and a busy week of earnings reports in the financial sector. After a hotter-than-expected reading on wholesale inflation Friday, the Consumer Price index will be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET.




The Nasdaq composite traded in a tight range again, falling around 0.4%. It held within Friday's high and low, giving the index an inside day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% and the S&P 500 eased less than 0.1%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index gave back 0.4%, closing just below its 50-day moving average.


Declining stocks topped advancers on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.


Volume on the Nasdaq came in higher than Friday, resulting in a mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Preliminary data showed NYSE volume lower.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was a drag on the Dow industrials, down 4%, after [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) company **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) announced a new data center central processing unit (CPU) for artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. Nvidia's new offering will put it in direct competition with Intel and will be based on technology from Softbank-owned ARM Holdings, which Nvidia is in the process of acquiring for $40 billion.

![MP041221](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP041221-251x300.jpg)Nvidia jumped 5.6% to 608.36 and is close to a breakout from a cup base with a 615 buy point. Nvidia's performance came amid broad-based weakness in the chip sector. IBD's chip-equipment group fell nearly 2%, weighed down by weakness in group leaders like **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)).


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) also lagged in the Dow Jones average, down around 1%. The aerospace giant flashed a sell signal on March 23, when it erased a double-digit gain from the 244.18 buy point. But Boeing is back above the buy point, still trying to get some lift.


Some of the worst performers in the S&P 500 Monday were cruise line operators and airline stocks. IBD's airline group gave back around 2%.


With the stock market in a confirmed uptrend and distribution days a nonissue for now, it makes sense to put money to work in stocks. But it's a tricky market, where growth stocks are working well one day but struggling the next. The price action in cyclical stocks, or "reopen economy" stocks, has also been choppy of late.


Keep your attention focused on stocks with [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) at or near new high ground. **Roblox** ([RBLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBLX)) has an RS line that is rising as the stock forms an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).


Inside The IBD 50
-----------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied off lows and closed 0.1% higher. Inside the IBD 50, **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) was a top gainer, up nearly 4% to 112.83. Shares jumped nearly 6% Friday and briefly topped a buy point of 108.64.


**Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) was a top gainer in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). It broke out over an 80.99 buy point with conviction, soaring nearly 7% to 84.28. Volume was more than 2-1/2 times its average. The maker of premium coolers and beverage holders has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 93, helped by two straight quarters of strong earnings and sales growth.



While Yeti held gains, a couple of strong early movers faded by the close.


**Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) broke out over a trend line but closed off highs after the company said March [ride-hailing bookings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/uber-stock-climbs-on-record-bookings/) were the highest in the company's history. The next price level to watch for Uber is 61.02, its March 16 high, which represents a possible resistance level.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) watchlist stock **Ingersoll-Rand** ([IR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IR)) looked poised to break out over a 51.71 buy point early Monday, but the stock reversed lower. Shares were strong early after the company agreed to sell its Club Car golf cart business to a private equity firm for $1.68 billion.


Bank Stocks To Watch
--------------------


Ahead of a busy week of financial earnings, the SPDR S&P 500 Regional Bank ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) shows some tight weekly closes as it tests support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/).


**Truist Financial** ([TFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TFC)), formed after the merger between BB&T and SunTrust, is forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 61.36 buy point while it holds support at the 10-week line. Q1 results are due Thursday before the open.


Results from **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) are due Wednesday before the open. It's also forming a flat base with a 180.45 buy point. But a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 71 doesn't stir much excitement.

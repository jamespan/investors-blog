<p>In a late show of investor caution, indexes gave back some gains in the final 75 minutes of trading.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite led at the close with a 0.6% increase, after being up as much as 1%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3%, settling with half of its earlier gains. It made its highest close since April 4, 2022. The small-cap Russell 2000 ended practically flat.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with an 0.1% rise. That was barely enough to squeak by with its 12th consecutive daily rise, the longest win streak since February 2017.</p>
<p>The after-hours trading suggested a 13th gain will be difficult to obtain. Dow component <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT" target="_blank">MSFT</a>) fell 1% after the close following <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/msft-stock-microsoft-cloud-business-boosts-q4-results/">the company's earnings report</a>. <strong>Visa</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V" target="_blank">V</a>) edged lower after <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/visa-mastercard-hover-in-buy-zones-ahead-of-earnings/">besting analysts' views</a>.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>
<p>But&nbsp;<strong>Alphabet</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL" target="_blank">GOOGL</a>), which is a big component of the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, rallied more than 7% in after-hours trading after <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/googl-stock-google-earnings-news-q22023/">beating second-quarter expectations</a>.</p>
<p>Volume rose on the Nasdaq and edged lower on the NYSE from Monday's levels.</p>

The June 16 distribution is now too far back in time to matter for the current market analysis. That leaves the S&amp;P and Nasdaq each with three days of higher-volume declines, which could be termed acceptable.</p>
<h2>Earnings Movers In The Stock Market</h2>
<p>Earnings, as usual, accounted for some of the biggest moves in the stock market Tuesday.</p>
<p>Airlines fell broadly, dealing a blow to what had been one of the market's leading groups.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska Air Group</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK" target="_blank">ALK</a>) gapped below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume after the carrier <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/alaska-air-record-revenue-stocks-1bb01637?mod=md_stockoverview_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast current-quarter revenue growth of 0% to 3%</a>. Shares slid nearly 10% and are back below a 51.02 buy point.</p>
<p>IBD's airlines industry group was the worst performer in Tuesday's stock market, down 3.6%. <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL" target="_blank">DAL</a>) fell 2.2%. <strong>United Airlines</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL" target="_blank">UAL</a>) lost 3.3% and is back near its 54.05 buy point. <strong>JetBlue</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU" target="_blank">JBLU</a>) fell 5.6%. Mexico-based <strong>Volaris</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLRS" target="_blank">VLRS</a>), which also reported earnings, sold off 7.2%.</p>
<p>In others sectors, electrical equipment maker <strong>Hubbell</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBB" target="_blank">HUBB</a>) tumbled 4.6%. <strong>Hexcel</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XHL" target="_blank">XHL</a>) gapped below the 50-day line. Fitness company <strong>Life Time Group</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTH" target="_blank">LTH</a>) sold off more than 13%.</p>
<p><strong>RTX</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX" target="_blank">RTX</a>) was the biggest loser in the S&amp;P 500, tumbling 10.2%. The aerospace and defense company formerly called Raytheon Technologies beat Q2 estimates but <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/rtx-stock-raytheon-earnings-senate-debates-defense-bill/">disclosed a defect in its Pratt &amp; Whitney engines</a>&nbsp;used in Airbus A32neo planes. The problem will hurt free cash flow.</p>
<h2>Fed Set For Another Rate Hike; What's Next?</h2>
<p>Most stock market traders expect the Fed to raise the fed funds rate by 25 basis points Wednesday, to a range of 5.25-5.5%. Far less certain is the outlook for future rate policy.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy has withstood 10 rate hikes and has avoided a recession so far. On the other hand, the manufacturing sector has weakened, and rising crude oil prices threaten to slow progress against inflation. Nymex crude rose 1.1% to $79.63, the highest level since April 18. Gasoline futures rose 1.4% to $2.8533 a gallon, the fourth-highest settle this year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning saw more good news on the economic front. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index climbed to a two-year high, up 6.9 points to 117.0 in July. That was better than economists expected.</p>
<p>"U.S. consumers are feeling happier these days," Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, noted in an analysis. "Cushioned by excess savings and a robust labor market, U.S. consumers — the biggest engine of economic growth — are holding up well."</p>
<div class="small-12 columns medium-6 leftchart"><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=ups"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 5 percentage points to 3.91%.</p>
<p>In another bit of good news, <strong>United Parcel Service</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS" target="_blank">UPS</a>) <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-teamsters-reach-agreement-on-new-contract-a134c910?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached a tentative five-year labor pact</a> with the Teamsters. The union's 330,000 UPS delivery drivers must still ratify the agreement, but it avoids what would have been a costly strike for U.S. supply chains and merchants. UPS stock reversed lower, closing below the 187.82 buy point.</p>
<h2>Stock Market Internals</h2>
<p>Even as the Nasdaq rose, declining stocks topped advancers by a 6-to-5 ratio. Winners and losers were nearly even on the NYSE.</p>
<p>That doesn't necessarily disrupt a trend of broadening stock market leadership.</p>
<p>All 11 S&amp;P sector indexes are up this month, but there's been a shift. Technology — which had led with a gain of nearly 40% from January to June — is lagging other sectors. Its July return is less than 3%.</p>
<p>The new leadership is in other sectors. Energy Select Sector SPDR (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE" target="_blank">XLE</a>) is up more than 6%, while Financial Select Sector SPDR (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF" target="_blank">XLF</a>) has climbed about 5% and the utilities index is up some 4.5%.</p>
<p>The ratio of <a href="https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jul-24-2023/">52-week highs to lows</a> continues to trend bullishly.</p>

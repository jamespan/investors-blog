===========================================================

Stocks barely touched the brakes Friday as the market coasted into a three-day weekend. The Nasdaq was essentially flat, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The IBD 50 rose 0.1%.

  

Volume fell across the board, which allowed the S&P 500 to dodge distribution.

  

The market has been moving timidly up and down since the Nasdaq's 1.4% gain on May 14. Scratch that session, and the only sign of accumulation was Thursday's 0.2% increase in the S&P 500 in rising volume.

  

As accumulation days go, that small gain is hardly convincing.

  

Recent distribution also has the tone of a technicality. The Nasdaq scored a stalling day Wednesday with a minuscule gain in rising volume.

  

In recent weeks, the indexes appear content to do nothing.

  

Breakouts, however, are pointing to some confidence and promising action among top-rated stocks.

  

On Friday, managed health services provider **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) joined the May breakout parade, a procession that is rising in number, though concentrated in terms of sectors.

  

Medical-sector play Cigna popped 2% in almost twice its usual volume as it cleared a 135.10 buy point. The stock remains in the 5% buy zone.

  

From May 7, when the Nasdaq and S&P 500 began to climb, roughly two dozen top-rated stocks have broken out.

  

About 60% of the breakouts emerged from just three sectors: medical, chips and software. This is kind of a more-of-the-same situation. Those sectors have been leaders for some time.

  

The best-performing recent breakouts from those three sectors are:

  

•Detox center operator **AAC Holdings** ([AAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAC)), up 11% from a 35.50 entry.

  

The company grew earnings 75% in 2012, then 100% and 186%. The Street expects 60% earnings growth this year and 81% in 2016. The stock, though, is thinly traded, with an average daily dollar volume of $8 million.

  

•Chipmaker **Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)), up almost 9% from a 20.84 buy point.

  

In fiscal 2014 and 2015, ended in March, earnings rose 75% and 88%, respectively. Analysts expect 26% growth in the current fiscal year. One drawback: Fidelity Contrafund sold its entire position in the first quarter.

  

•Software developer **Cheetah Mobile** ([CMCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCM)) and cloud software firm **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)), up 30% and 16%, respectively.

  

Cheetah Mobile's gain reached 43% Wednesday, but then the stock retreated. Ebix's gain reached 20% Friday before it stepped back.

  

Cheetah's initial public offering was launched about a year ago. The stock probably carries more risk than normal in this kind of on-and-off market.

  

Although the stock's quick and big gain triggered the eight-week hold rule this month, individual investors couldn't be faulted for taking profits. The same could be said of Ebix.

  

Taking profits on the way up is generally a sound strategy. Trying to squeeze the last dollar out of a winning position is not prudent in this market. Big gains have been rare this year, and disciplined investors have to accept that reality.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq added 0.8% and the S&P 500 0.2%. The IBD 50 outperformed with a 2.3% gain.

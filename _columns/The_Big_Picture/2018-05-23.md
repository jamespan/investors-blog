Have you ever heard someone say, it's not so much what you said, but how you said it that counts? Wednesday's stock market seemed to share this message.




It wasn't so much the gains by the major indexes that impressed. More so, how the key averages achieved those gains would bolster confidence in this aging yet still solid confirmed uptrend.


The market looked like it woke up from the wrong side of the bed. Headlines shared President Trump's well-justified pessimism that a June 12 summit between the U.S. and North Korea is on the rocks. Index futures showed the major benchmarks headed for an instant 1%-something decline.


The Nasdaq composite gapped down at the open and was down 0.6% in the first five minutes of trading. But the sell-off ended. The rest of the trading day saw stocks dust themselves off and rebound steadily. The release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's May 1-2 meeting on interest rates helped accelerate the rebound.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MP052318-193x300.jpg)Institutional investors clearly saw no indication from those minutes that the U.S. central bank is going to get more hawkish and raise the cost of money rapidly. Bond holders rejoiced. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond dipped to as low as 3%. It got as high as 3.11% last week, reaching heights not seen since July 2011.


The Nasdaq composite finished up 0.6% for the day. The S&P 500, Dow industrials and Russell 2000 closed with gains of roughly 0.2% to 0.3%.


The size of the advance? Minor, of course. But the way in which stocks overcame a weak start and finish strong gave the session a thoroughly bullish tone.


Plus, consider the higher volume on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session as icing on the cake. Rising stock prices in more active trading point to quiet institutional accumulation.


The session carried numerous other positive elements.


First, leading stocks acted fine.


Yes, a few top guns in the energy sector retreated. Today's Market Pulse table highlights some of these leaders. But after strong gains in recent months, they deserved a break.


While **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) continued to show whipsawing action, other oil and gas leaders are riding a smooth advance. IBD 50 name **Viper Energy** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)), [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO))Â and **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) present a compelling case that the run in energy stocks still has legs.


In fact, holders of these stocks have a "good" problem, and that's the problem of deciding whether to take gains at the 20%-25% profit zone, or try to hold longer. In this case, big moves in crude oil prices will factor in a big way. But make no mistake: Right now, the hottest sector within the S&P 500 in terms of earnings is energy.


Outside the oil patch, the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange-traded fund edged up 0.15, or 0.4%, to 35.70. FFTY is now up 7.6% year to date after screaming up 34% in 2017.


Still Tech-Driven
-----------------


Two, big cap techs led the way.


The Nasdaq 100 rallied nearly 0.9%**. Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), [on IBD Leaderboard as way back as December 2016](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and more recently on April 5, muscled into new high ground with a 4% gain. Volume edged slightly above average and was the highest in more than three weeks.


Remarkably, Netflix is one of those rare companies that can lead more than one bull market. But the Los Gatos, Calif., firm continues to redefine itself and keep the [N factor in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). A decade ago, it was the go-to company for renting DVDs with no late fees. Today, it's setting the pace in delivering original shows as well as a massive library of movies and TV episodes over an internet connection.


Three, market internals remain sound.


On the Nasdaq, winning issues led losing ones by a relative thin margin of just 200 stocks. But that still means the Nasdaq's advance-decline line is rising. Earlier this week, the line stretched into new high ground.


Ditto for the NYSE Accumulation-Distribution line, which you can see within the large S&P 500 chart. Go to the General Market Indicators link at the bottom of this article to see it.


Strength in interest-rate-sensitive issues, such as REITs, homebuilders and utilities, helped the market edge higher on Wednesday. The property REIT and residential building groups rose 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively. But look at the top 15 industry groups on Wednesday, and you'll see it stuffed with retail, apparel, software and computer-related names.


A Sterling Move
---------------


**Tiffany** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)) on Wednesday became the [newest member of IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) with a strong gap up following excellent Q1 results. There are now four companies on the Leaders list that are in the retail sector or are directly connected with consumer spending.


The jewelry and luxury gifts retailer posted a 54% leap in April-ended fiscal first-quarter profit to $1.14 a share. That marked the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 20 quarters. Sales rose 15% to $1.03 billion, accelerating from a 9% pick-up in the normally very busy holiday quarter that ended in January.


In short, Tiffany is reminding IBD investors what **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) surely did in January of 2017: Do not ignore the big fundamental turnaround stories. Just as Apple has succeeded in driving revenues with new products and services, Tiffany is hitting its stride in emerging markets where the middle classes may just very well exceed the entire United States in population. Tiffany is also apparently winning in its strategy to sell items to millennial shoppers at attractive price points.


How The Pundits Feel
--------------------


Four, pundit bullishness is far from excessive.


The latest Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter editors shows bullishness rise to 49.1%. That marks the highest level since early April. The peak in bullishness over the past 12 months? In the week of Jan. 15, the bulls ratio spiked to 66.7%. That meant just a third of the herd believed stocks were headed into a bear market or an intermediate correction.


What happened next? The February slide, in which the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both dropped nearly 12% off their highs.


A healthy dose of pessimism is manna for long-only investors. Why? Those who are pessimistic have usually gone into cash and are hoping for stocks to go lower. If they do, it proves they were right about the general direction.


But if they are wrong, these folks may have to switch and buy back equities.


Meanwhile, there are still signs that options players are shaking just a bit in their boots.


The put-call volume ratio hit 0.93 on Wednesday. For every 100 bullish calls traded, 93 bearish puts exchanged hands across the major options exchanges.

  Stock Market In Santa Claus Rally? S&P 500, Dow Mark New Closing Highs

Despite another quiet session Wednesday, the S&P 500 managed to eke out a new closing high, while the Nasdaq composite finished slightly lower.




The S&P 500 climbed 0.1% to resume its uptrend after Tuesday's break. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq paused for a second day, following a four-day advance. Both indexes started out Wednesday with small gains before diverging.


To be sure, the stock market was due for a respite after its rally toward record highs.


However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its win streak for a sixth session and set a new closing high, thanks to gains from **Walgreens** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)). The Dow has held solidly above 36,000 this week, after hitting resistance at the level the past five weeks.


Volume was slightly higher on both major exchanges — from ultra low levels — which suggests the big money isn't engaging in heavy buying or selling. While that's typical during the holiday season, trading this week is among the lightest this year, even coming in near the post-Thanksgiving half-session.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP122921-265x300.jpg)NYSE volume totaled 2.685 billion shares on Wednesday, after coming in below 2.6 billion Monday and Tuesday. Nasdaq volume climbed to 3.613 billion shares Wednesday, up slightly from 3.588 billion Tuesday but below Monday's 3.7 billion.


Cyclical or defensive stocks led the market Wednesday, as real estate, health, utilities, materials and consumer staples saw the biggest gains among the 11 sectors tracked by the S&P. Energy, communication services and financials were the only losers.


Data Storage Among Stock Market Winners
---------------------------------------


Yet, several leading growth stocks outperformed. In the Nasdaq 100, **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) rallied 3.5% in heavy trade to a new closing high. Shares are now extended from an 89.15 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/), according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


Micron and other data storage stocks got a boost after Samsung said it's reducing memory chip production at one of its key factories in Xi'an, China, amid an accelerating Covid outbreak.


**Western Digital** ([WDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC)), also fueled by Samsung's news, gapped up and surged more than 5% in heavy trade. The stock reclaimed its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) for the first time in four months and extended its win streak to six days.


Chemicals maker **Huntsman** ([HUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUN)) leapt 4.4% to break out past a 34.57 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/). The stock spiked after the company said it would review a possible sale and other options for a textiles business. Shares remain in [buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) up to 36.30. Huntsman was featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/huntsman-stock-breaks-out-on-hopes-of-more-streamlining/).


Other growth stocks on the move included [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10) leader **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)), which soared nearly 6% in fast turnover to a new closing high. The chip designer's stock is sharply extended from a 43.10 buy point of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) cleared last month.


**Zim Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) rose 4% to nearly retake a 57.07 buy point of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) despite a sell signal that followed the breakout.


AOSL and ZIM stocks helped the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) score a 0.9% gain. The tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), by contrast, edged slightly lower.


What To Do Now
--------------


Several leading stocks have cleared buy points this week, giving investors a chance to add exposure. On Wednesday, Huntsman cleared its buy point in volume 46% higher than normal — meeting the 40% minimum threshold for most successful breakouts.


The [Santa Claus Rally](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/the-santa-claus-rally-just-started-12-stocks-gain-most/) is still intact, with the major indexes on track to close out the year with additional gains. If that continues in the first two trading days of the new year, the rally will hold true.


But the market advance is showing signs of slowing. While the Dow and the S&P 500 marked new high closes, neither index finished at session highs. Index moves the past two days were mild. The Nasdaq Wednesday quickly headed south and spent most of the session underwater before trimming its losses.


Investors who have added significant recent exposure could consider holding off on new purchases until the new year, given the light volume in the market.


It may be an ideal time to freshen up your watchlists and see which stocks and sectors will emerge as 2022's leaders.

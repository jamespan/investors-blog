Stock Market Mixed As Dow Hits Record High But Nasdaq Reverses Lower; DraftKings Surges
========================================================================================

The stock market ended mixed Wednesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high but the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite reversed from strong gains to end with a slight loss.




The Nasdaq advanced nearly 1.6% before closing less than 0.1% lower. The S&P 500 rallied 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrials jumped 1.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.8%.


Leading growth stocks were higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.3% Wednesday, but was unable to decisively clear resistance at its 50-day moving average.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq. Preliminary data showed higher volume on the NYSE compared with Tuesday's figures.


Stock Market Uptrend Resumes: What To Do Now
--------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP031021-208x300.jpg)Even though the Nasdaq continues to struggle, the Dow 30 sits at record highs, the S&P 500 is back above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and the small-cap Russell 2000 is approaching new highs. Given the mixed picture, it's certainly no longer a stock market in correction, at least not in whole. It's more accurate to describe the market as a rotation out of high-growth technology names into so-called real economy stocks. A number of opportunities exist in the latter.


So, the market uptrend resumes, as noted in today's IBD Market Pulse current outlook. While that means investors should be increasing exposure, you should maintain a necessary degree of caution. Since there hasn't been a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-etf-strategy-qqq-potential-uptrend/) on the indexes, the old distribution days are back in play. And there is still a high amount of institutional selling. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both carry six [distribution days.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/)

A follow-through day in the coming days would certainly be bullish for the resumed market uptrend. It would also reset the distribution-day count back to zero.


During new stock market rallies, investors should be wading in slowly, not plunging, back into the market. It's time to put your watchlist of stocks to use.


One of the best ways to identify the next cycle of leading stocks is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If a stock is outperforming the broader market, the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, the line will point lower.


Real economy stocks like **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)), **Element Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)), **Westlake Chemical** ([WLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLK)) and **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) have broken out past a new buy points this week. If this uptrend is real, there will be plenty of time for more leaders to set up and break out past new buy points.


CF Industries and Westlake Chemical were added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) this week.


Elsewhere, many tech leaders remain far from their old highs. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is about 25% off its high, while **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) is about 43% from its old high.

Stocks To Watch: Boeing, DraftKings, Generac, Uber
--------------------------------------------------


Inside the Dow 30, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) broke out above a 244.18 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Shares advanced 6.4%, closing in the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) that tops out at 256.39.


**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) surged 11.4% Wednesday after multiple analysts upped their price targets in the wake of the [company's investor day event](https://www.investors.com/news/draftkings-stock-high-long-term-targets-cryptocurrency-use-eyed/). The company raised long-term profit and betting targets. CEO Jason Robins also said DraftKings has explored the use of cryptocurrency. "We know it's popular among our customers, but we have to have a conversation with regulators."


DraftKings stock ended just 4% away from its all-time high amid a three-day win streak. Shares are up 16% this week.


[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) rallied nearly 2% Wednesday, continuing its rebound from the 50-day moving average.


**Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) bullishly reclaimed its 50-day line Wednesday with a 4.4% rally. The ride-hailing company moved above an [early entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/tesla-stock-showed-early-buy-point-dow-jones-leader-microsoft-nvidia-stock/) at 57.90.


Uber is a new addition to [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader). Deutsche Bank raised Uber's price target to 82 from 78 and reiterated a buy rating.

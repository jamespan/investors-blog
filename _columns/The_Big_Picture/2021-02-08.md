  S&P 500 Makes It 6 Straight Gains; A Sign Of Stock Market Trouble To Watch

The stock market picked up right where it left off last week, charging to new highs but leaving doubts about just how sustainable its rally is.




The S&P 500 rose for a sixth straight day, adding 0.7%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9%. Both closed near session highs as a frenzy of buying in the final 10 minutes had a don't-want-to-get-left-out feeling.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE. That buttressed the day's gains. Advancing stocks led decliners by 7-to-2 on the Nasdaq and by more than 13-to-5 on the NYSE. The [number of stocks hitting new highs](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/) remained elevated.


The Jan. 27 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq got deleted because the composite Monday climbed more than 5% from that day's closing price. While the Nasdaq now has a clean slate, the S&P 500 still has four distribution days. That's tolerable, although distribution — [a sign of heavy institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) — sometimes starts developing before the stock market peaks.


![MP020821-](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP020821--210x300.jpg)Small caps outperformed Monday, as the Russell 2000 joined the stable of indexes reaching all-time highs. The small-cap benchmark surged 2.5% Monday and is the early winner in 2021, up 16% and beating the Nasdaq's 8.6% year to date gain.


Small caps were [expected to benefit from a rebounding economy](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-2021-could-be-bumpier-than-you-think/), and they are proving that thesis.


Dow Makes Another Stock Market High
-----------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also made a record high with a 0.8% increase. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) was a key contributor after the stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) on news that [a food event is planned for its California Adventure park](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-rallies-theme-park-open-first-time-year-special-event/) next month.


Investors who've been buying on breakouts can enjoy the fruits of their trades, but have to ask themselves if the stock market is overextended. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are close to piercing trends lines touching index highs stretching back to November. As the Big Picture has repeatedly noted, the Nasdaq's gap with its 50-day moving average is dangerously high.


Signs To Watch For A Stock Market Top
-------------------------------------



If the stock market will topple, one of the first signs will be erosion in the leading stocks. So far, those premium stocks are holding up well. [The IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) rose 1.4% and is near new highs.


Most of the [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) over the past few weeks are intact. But a few petered out Monday.


**Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) rose above the 25.26 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) but closed below the entry. The file-sharing company was discussed in [today's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/dropbox-stock-tries-breakout-ahead-of-quarterly-earnings/). **JetBlue** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)), **Weyerhaeuser** ([WY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WY)) and **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) were met with unimpressive volume.


The stock market is rallying largely on new stimulus to combat the economic slump created by the coronavirus. Last week, Congress passed measures to speed up approval.


GDP Forecast Raised On Stimulus Hopes
-------------------------------------


On Monday, IHS Markit cited the new stimulus in raising its forecast for real GDP growth in 2021 from 4.0% to 5.7%. Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist for IHS, said in a report that the new forecast reflects "the new near-certainty of a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief measure by spring," combined with falling Covid-19 infection rates, some relaxation of social distancing measures, and an acceleration of the inoculation campaign.


IHS Markit expects GDP rising past its previous peak by the middle of this 2021, and by early 2023 U.S. employment should top the previous peak of employment.


"With such expansive fiscal policy providing for a quicker improvement in labor markets and an earlier rise in sustained inflation, we've revised our assumptions on monetary policy. We now expect the Fed to start raising the federal funds rate in mid-2024, more than two years earlier than previously assumed," the economist said.

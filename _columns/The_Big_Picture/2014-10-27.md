Stocks fought back from early selling to end narrowly mixed Monday.

  

The Nasdaq rebounded from a 0.7% deficit to end fractionally higher. It also closed a hair above its 50-day line for a second straight session. Monday marked a third straight gain for the tech-heavy index.

  

Hurt by energy stocks, the S&P 500 ended lower by 0.2%. But it also was down as much as 0.7%. Energy makes up almost 10% of the benchmark index. Six of the 10 worst-performing industry groups belonged to the oil and gas space. Crude oil hit a two-year low after Goldman Sachs cut its 2015 price forecast.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 dipped 0.1%.

  

Volume ended mixed. Nasdaq trading fell sharply from Friday's pace. Turnover rose on the NYSE. But the S&P 500 dodged a distribution day because its loss was too small.

  

Even after last week's big gains, Monday's resilient action showed that there are still buyers out there. It's been nearly a week since the market outlook was changed to a confirmed uptrend and so far everything looks good so far.

  

There's been no distribution since the Oct. 21 follow-through. This is a good sign, because distribution days soon after a follow-though can bring down a fresh market uptrend.

  

Breakouts are happening nearly every day. On Monday, **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)) cleared a 79.23 buy point from a flat base in more than twice its average trade. The drug distributor reports earnings Thursday.

  

**Cepheid** ([CPHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPHD)) and **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) also cleared buy points from bases. However volume was either below average or less than 40% above average. Still, some leading stocks have gone on to make big gains from low-volume breakouts. **U.S. Silica** ([SLCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLCA)) rose big from a 37.35 buy point in March. And **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) rose 18% after clearing a cup with handle in early June.

  

This week will mark another heavy week of corporate earnings. **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) rallied in extended trading after beating views. But **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) sold off on a weak outlook for Q4 sales. (See [story](http://news.investors.com/technology/102714-723702-twitter-q3-earnings-user-growth-revenue-guidance-weak.htm).)

  

Tuesday marks the start of two-day Fed meeting. Earlier this month, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard suggested the central bank should extend its bond-buying program.

  

Stocks have risen in nearly every session since Bullard's comments on Oct. 16.

Stock Market Falls Despite Jobs Report; Putin Move Boosts These Groups
=======================================================================

The stock market ended the week lower after a gas supply move by Russian President Vladimir Putin hit sentiment. It appeared to cause early gains fueled by the latest jobs report to evaporate.




The Nasdaq composite was once again the worst out of the major indexes. It extended its losing streak to six sessions as it fell 1.3%. Worryingly, it is now below its 50-day moving average.


The key benchmark could now act as a resistance level. The index is now down nearly 27% so far this year, though it remains off the year's lows for now.

One small crumb of comfort is the fact that volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to also fall on the NYSE. But both major indexes are carrying five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which means the current uptrend, already under pressure, is on perilous ground.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) also disappointed, with all but one closing in negative territory. Only energy managed to make some progress.


Blue chips were also pounded by the bears, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1.1%. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) was the only component to turn in a decent gain as it rose 1.5%. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) were among the laggards.


IBD 50 Shines; Jobs Report Fails To Calm Fed Fears
--------------------------------------------------


Small caps spent much of the session in positive territory, but the Russell 2000 ended down 0.7%. But the rich smattering of energy names in the index helped the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) close up 1%.


The stock market rose early after it emerged that the economy created 315,000 jobs in August, above the Econoday consensus forecast of 293,000. Net job growth over the prior two months had been revised lower, a balm. The unemployment rate increased to 3.7% from 3.5%.


Given Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish tone at Jackson Hole it remains to be seen whether the economy is cooling enough to slow the pace of interest-rate hikes.

Putin Cuts The Gas; These Stock Market Groups Flourish
------------------------------------------------------


Stock market indexes started to reverse lower after it emerged that Russia was moving to indefinitely suspend the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Europe.



Gazprom cited a problem at a compressor station in St Petersburg. But Russian president Vladimir Putin is keen to punish European nations for supporting sanctions amid the Russia-Ukraine war.


European nations are having to both cut demand for gas while also trying to find new supplies.


While the broader market suffered, energy-related industry groups flourished. Only gold miners and agricultural chemical plays stopped oil and gas groups from locking out the top 10.


Leaderboard stock **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) was a top performer, rising 3.6% in above-average volume. It is now once again extended from its last buy point.

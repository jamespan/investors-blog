Stock market indexes were quiet and dull for most of the day. Then came the final hour.




A wave of selling started shortly after 3 p.m. ET, a tumble that put a bearish note on a session that up to that point had lacked direction.


Stock Market Major Indexes All Lower
------------------------------------


At the close, the Nasdaq composite was down almost 1%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE. Higher NYSE trading meant the S&P 500 added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), though only its second in the past few weeks.


Even if the distribution-day count remains almost minimal, it doesn't mean the stock market is doing fine. It's entirely reasonable to think volume is lighter because institutional investors are reluctant to trade before Wednesday's consumer inflation report. Without that brake on trading, volume could easily have increased Monday and Tuesday, and we'd be looking at multiple distribution days now.


Bearish Shift Since Last Week
-----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP071222_2-251x300.jpg)After an encouraging bounce last week, buyers are suddenly drying up. The Nasdaq composite is meeting resistance at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The S&P 500 spent a whole two days above its 21-day exponential moving average before sinking back below it this week. The Dow is showing similar resistance at its 21-day line.


The IBD 50 fell 1.6% Tuesday. **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) slid below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) sold off 8%.


Some of the bloom of the past few weeks is getting stomped.


**Rollins** ([ROL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROL)) reversed lower and fell 2.8% Tuesday after a weak attempt to break out past a 37.07 buy point. There are no sell signals, though, and Rollins was [Tuesday's IBD 50 Stocks to Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-pest-control-leader-rollins-hits-new-buy-point-with-rs-line-at-new-high/) pick.


**Murphy USA** ([MUSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUSA)) eased back to its 262.68 buy point a day after clearing a cup base. **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) and **Otter Tail** ([OTTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTTR)) also are struggling to make progress.


Health Care, Solar Stocks Turn Around
-------------------------------------


Health care staffing stocks that had been a bright spot in the stock market are dimming. **AMN Healthcare** ([AMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMN)) reversed lower and fell nearly 5% Tuesday. **Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)) is trying to hang near its 24.06 buy point.


Solar, software and energy industry groups saw Tuesday's largest losses. **JinkoSolar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) sold off more than 7% in active trading. A gain of 16% from a 66.47 buy point is gone, triggering a [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/amazon-stock-amzn-triggered-key-profit-taking-rule-before-flashing-sell-signals/). JinkoSolar is still above a 60.10 alternative buy point.


**SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) closed just below its 50-day line. The Invesco Solar ETF ([TAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAN)) fell more than 3% and was removed from [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


However, in MarketSmith's list of recent breakouts, the majority of the 17 stocks are still above buy points. Granted, none are more than 5% above their entries.


Crude oil fell below $100 a barrel, in what traders are calling a reaction to recession worries.


Stock Market Awaits Inflation Report
------------------------------------


The stock market should get more clarity after Wednesday morning's June consumer price index report. [Economists' consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) is for an 8.8% increase on an annual basis, and 1.1% from the previous month.


There could be a [lagging effect in the CPI report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/the-cpi-inflation-rate-may-hit-9-dow-jones-rally-stalls/) because a decline in gas prices won't show up so soon.


Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally, says it wouldn't be a big surprise if CPI is modestly higher year-over-year. The market is anticipating that June will be the new peak.


"Within the details, service inflation will be the watch item. Prices have been rising for services over the past several months and (service) has exceeded goods inflation for the past four months," Bell said in a commentary. "The reading is likely to confirm what the jobs report on Friday told us — that the Fed will stick to their aggressive rate tightening timeline."

The stock market opened with modest gains Thursday, but it didn't take long for a 0.3% early gain for the Nasdaq composite to morph into a loss of 0.9% at 10:45 a.m. ET. But the major stock indexes ended in the top half of their intraday ranges ahead of what could be a volatile day of trading Friday.




Wall Street was spooked early after the U.S. manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) clocked in at 49.9. It's the first time the reading fell below the neutral 50 level since September 2009, according to IHS Markit. The stock market also pondered an inverted yield curve, plus [hawkish commentary](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chief-jerome-powell-jackson-hole-test-stock-market/) from a couple of Federal Reserve officials before Jerome Powell's speech in Jackson Hole Friday at 10 a.m. ET.


The Dow Jones industrials inched up 0.2%.Â **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) helped buoy the Dow with a 4% jump. Shares were strong after the company said it expects to resume normal production of its [737 Max jet](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-gets-a-lift-on-news-of-rapid-737-max-production-ramp-up-plan/) early next year. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite lagged, down 0.4%. Volume on the Nasdaq came in higher than Thursday, resulting in a mild distribution day for the Nasdaq. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume lower.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


With just two distribution days for the Nasdaq and one for the S&P 500, it's not a market showing blatant signs of institutional selling. That's good for the bulls, but the indexes still face a major technical challenge.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP082219-229x300.jpg)The Nasdaq closed in on its 50-day moving average Thursday but got turned away. A conviction move above the 50-day line would strengthen its technical picture dramatically, but it hasn't happened yet. The Russell 2000 small-cap index, meanwhile, is trying to conquer resistance at its 200-day moving average.


Stock Market Waits For Powell
-----------------------------


Powell isn't expected to sway much from recent commentary, although recent bullish earnings reports from **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) have Wall Street rethinking how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be with future rate cuts. The stock market wants Powell to make a strong case for a rate cut in September, but will it get it?


Kansas City Fed President Esther George told CNBC Thursday that the July rate cut was not needed. After that, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said he doesn't see the case for additional stimulus. It's a divided Fed, for sure, but market watchers still expect two more rate cuts by the end of the year, including a quarter-point cut at the September meeting.


Sentiment also weakened when the 10-year Treasury yield inverted with the two-year yield for the second straight session. Amid constant chatter of an inverted yield curve and the possibility of a recession for the U.S. economy, savvy growth investors are blocking out the noise and focusing on the price action in the indexes and leading growth stocks.


The stock market uptrend is still under pressure, but growth stocks continue to show generally positive action. The main issue now is finding actionable buy candidates.


Wednesday's session yielded a couple of solid breakouts from **Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)) and **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), but the breakouts faced selling pressure Thursday. Meanwhile, **Paycom**'s ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) [late-stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) breakout looked good for a while Thursday, but the software leader ended near its session low. Paycom early on gave up the 246.95 buy point Thursday but closed just above it.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Clearly, it's still a challenging environment for breakouts, although [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) component **Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) delivered a powerful one Thursday. Earnings and sales topped the high end of the company's guidance even though sales growth decelerated for a second straight quarter. But investors seemed to focus on double-digit order and sales growth at Keysight's commercial communications segment, which benefited from strong 5G orders.



Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), **Grocery Outlet** ([GO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GO)) firmed up after three straight lower-volume declines. It's still holding above the 39.66 buy point.


After the close, **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) jumped 5% after reporting earnings. Headed into the report, the software leader was holding above a 268.53 buy point and also getting support at its 10-week moving average.

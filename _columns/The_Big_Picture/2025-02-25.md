Major indexes extended losses on the stock market Tuesday as the relentless selling in leading growth stocks continued. The selling picked up the pace during the final half hour of trading.


After slumping 21% last week, former stock market leader **Robinhood** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)) is down another 11% this week and firmly below its 10-week moving average. Like Robinhood, group peer **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) has also succumbed to some institutional selling in recent days and is now about more than 2% below its 10-week line.




The Nasdaq composite suffered another distribution day, falling more than 1.3% in higher volume. The index came close to undercutting its Jan. 13 intraday low, but buyers came in and offered some support. At Tuesday's low, the Nasdaq was 6.8% off its mid-December all-time high. Based on Tuesday's close, the index would need to pull back another 3.7% to get down to its 200-day line.


After the close, the recent sell-off in Mediterranean fast-casual chain **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) picked up the pace. Shares slumped another 4% despite news of another strong quarter of growth. Earnings winners included **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) and **Coupang** ([CPNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPNG)).


Stock Market: S&P Slips In Higher Volume
----------------------------------------


The S&P 500 slipped 0.4%, also in higher volume, but closed off lows after undercutting its Feb. 3 low. Meanwhile, after a sharp break of its 50-day moving average Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%, while the Russell 2000 small-cap index slipped 0.2% and fell further below its 200-day line.


Despite the selling, breadth was negative by less than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq exchange. Winners had a slight edge over losers on the New York Stock Exchange.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP022525.jpg)The positive breadth on the NYSE was captured in the Invesco S&P 500 Equal-Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund, which edged higher and held support at its 50-day line. The First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) extended its losing streak to five sessions but held just above its 50-day line.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) pierced its 200-day line and closed near session lows ahead of Wednesday's earnings report. Results are due after the close. Nvidia is starting to face tough year-over-year comparisons, but adjusted profit for the January-ended quarter is expected to increase 64% to 85 cents a share, with revenue up 72% to $38.1 billion.


To be sure, the artificial intelligence trade is starting to look tired. Besides Nvidia, other big leaders in the space like **Vistra** ([VST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VST)), **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), just to name a few, have broken through key support levels.

The selling picked up the pace just after 10 a.m. ET after The Conference Board's latest reading on consumer confidence came in weaker than expected. The new data was consistent with Friday's soft reading on consumer confidence from the University of Michigan, which also showed increased inflation expectations.


10-Year Yield Plunges Again
---------------------------


The next big economic data point comes Friday with the release of the Personal Income & Spending report. Inside the report, the core personal consumption expenditures price index on a year-over-year basis, is expected to see a 2.6% increase in January. That would be slightly lower than December's reading of 2.8%.


Investors bought bonds again, sending the 10-year Treasury yield sharply lower to around 4.3%, its lowest level since mid-December. Futures traders over at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) are still debating whether there will be one or two more rate cuts this year. In afternoon trading, traders put the chances at 73.5% that the federal funds rate will be down to a range of 3.75% to 4% by the end of the year. It's currently at 4.25% to 4.5%.



While several defensive stocks like **Philip Morris** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)), **United Natural Foods** ([UNFI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNFI)) and **Waste Management** ([WM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WM)) continue to outperform, keep in mind that a weak market tends to take everything down with it.


Take **Boston Scientific** ([BSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSX)), which had been a pillar of strength before Tuesday's downdraft. The medical products firm slumped 3.5% in heavy volume, but it closed off lows and held support at its 50-day line.


Setups To Watch
---------------


There are still some interesting setups to consider, including Singapore-based **Sea** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)), which reports earnings next week. It's been an orderly pullback so far as the stock retests a prior buy area.



**RTX** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)), formerly Raytheon, broke out of a downtrend Tuesday and is close to retaking a prior 128.70 buy point. After five straight declines, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) extended losses. But it's holding support at the 50-day line after retesting a prior 638.40 entry.


But intriguing setups seem to be the exception and not the rule at this point. Having some exposure is fine, just make sure positions are small to start. Investor's Business Daily lowered its invested percentage to 40% to 60% after Friday's stock market rout.

Small-Cap Stocks, Nasdaq Lead Bullish Reversal; This Stock List Crushes The S&P 500
====================================================================================

After sharp losses last week, the major indexes needed a shot in the arm. And IBD readers needed evidence that institutional investors aren't giving up on the economy or on investing in stocks, even as coronavirus shows fresh cases of escalation across the U.S. and in other parts of the world.




From that point of view, Monday offered such relief. And small caps joined the Nasdaq in pacing the day's bullish rebound.


The Russell 2000 has been a laggard all year. Yet a 2.3% jump on Monday bested all the other key equity indexes. And that marked a good start by this broad index to recoup some of last week's harrowing loss of 7.9%, its worst since the market bottomed out in late March.


The Nasdaq, fortified by strength in enterprise software, gaming software, internet, e-commerce and social media companies, rallied 1.4%. (Go to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to see the entire performance of all 197 industry groups). The tech-rich index surrendered 2.3% last week during a historic post-coronavirus-crash run that got topped with the Nasdaq hitting all-time highs and closing above 10,000 for the first time.


As noted in this [Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-recovers-after-750-point-drop/) piece, buying accelerated in the stock market on news that the Federal Reserve, in its leave-no-stone-unturned approach to shoring up the credit markets, announced plans to buy large stakes in the bonds of individual corporations.


The Nasdaq 100, which encapsulates the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in that index, rose nearly 1.2%. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) jumped 3.1%, while the IBD 50 itself advanced more than 2.4%.

Market breadth proved positive on Monday as well. Winners led losers on the Nasdaq by a roughly 5-2 margin, and by roughly 2-to-1 on the NYSE.


Volume rose nearly 2% on the Nasdaq vs. Friday's level. That's another stamp of heavy institutional demand, even after the Nasdaq has just hit all-time highs. NYSE turnover edged 2% lower.


Covid-19 Will Remain An Issue, But What About The Economy?
----------------------------------------------------------


The S&P 500, which lagged on Monday with a 0.8% gain, still showed a bullish reversal. The index had fallen as much as 2.5% in only 15 minutes of trading Monday.



Yet the 500's action proves a timeless law of the market: In a strong confirmed uptrend, the market can start weak and finish strong.


This large-cap benchmark also remains an excellent index in which to see how big fund managers feel about the future of the economy. And judging by where the 500 stands today, it's pretty clear that Wall Street is expecting a rather slow recovery in the jobs market and normalcy in key sectors including airline transport, hotels and restaurants. Keep in mind that consumer spending continues to make up nearly two-thirds of the total U.S. gross domestic product.


In the first reading of Q1, U.S. GDP shrank by an alarming annualized rate of 4.8%.

S&P 500 Lags Most Stocks On This List
-------------------------------------


Meanwhile, please check out the [IPO Leaders stock list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).


You'll see two new developments. One, the list is a lot longer than back in March.


Two, you'll see that no fewer than a dozen companies on the list spanked the S&P 500 with gains of 2% to as much as 20%.


**Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) did not make the list headed into Monday's trading. But it got some air time on [Monday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).


Shares powered past a follow-on buy point of 30.69 after etching a [3-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/).



The midcap growth stock and member of IBD's enterprise software industry group also grabbed a spot in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as a quarter-size position.


A full-size position on Leaderboard would command roughly one eighth (12.5%) of a portfolio devoted solely to growth stocks.


Due to a lack of earnings, [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-cloudflare-inc-cl-a-net.aspx) shows a [weak Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/) of 22 and a decent but not great IBD [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 84. So although the stock has made a great run since its IPO at $15 a share in September last year, lack of profitability certainly raises investor risk.


In contrast, no fewer than a dozen names on the [two Leaders lists at Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) hold an EPS Rating of 97 or higher.


The Street sees Cloudflare losing 20 cents a share this year and posting a new loss of 13 cents a share in 2021. The San Francisco-based firm has 303 million shares outstanding.


Revenue jumped 48% in the first quarter to $91.3 million, the highest amount in any quarter in company history. The top line has grown on average 45% vs. year-ago levels over the past eight quarters.

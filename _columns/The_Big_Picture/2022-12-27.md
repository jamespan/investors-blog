The stock market kicked off a shortened week of trading with a mixed performance Tuesday as rising bond yields fueled more selling in the technology sector. Historically, the final trading week of the year is usually a good one for the stock market. But with the market uptrend under pressure, sellers are still dictating the action.




The 10-year Treasury yield gapped above its 50-day moving average, rising for the sixth time in seven sessions. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 3.85%, up 10 basis points.


The Nasdaq composite slumped 1.4% in higher volume, adding a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The index now shows five distribution days since Nov. 28. Declining stocks beat advancers on the Nasdaq by nearly 2-to-1.


The Nasdaq won a small battle by holding above Thursday's low, but several of its stocks fell sharply, including **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), **Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Moderna offers a good reminder of just how tough it is to make money in stocks these day. The biotech soared past a 188.75 buy point on Dec. 13 and followed through the next day. But sellers have been in the stock ever since, and MRNA slumped hard below the entry Tuesday.

Enphase fell below its 50-day line with conviction Tuesday after falling more than 7% below a 316.97 entry last week. IBD's solar group was one of the day's worst performers, down around 5.5%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


After making a stand at its 50-day line last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fared the best Tuesday, eking out a gain of 0.1%.


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) gained 1.4% and cleared a flat base with a 239.94 entry. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was another strong performer in the Dow Jones average, up 1.1%, after a positive response to [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-earnings-q3-nke-stock/) last week. Watch for Nike stock to form a new base above its 200-day line.



The Dow's outperformance came despite another sell-off for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which closed with a loss of 1.4% and hit its lowest level since June 2021. The widespread carnage among megacap technology stocks has been well documented as the stock market prices in weaker earnings ahead.


The S&P 500 halved an intraday loss of 0.8% to 0.4%, helped by strength in casino operators with a large presence inÂ  China, like **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) and **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)).


Wynn stock surged above its short-term moving averages as it approaches an alternate entry of 89.75. LVS stock showed similar action and closed just below a 49.83 entry.


Sentiment was positive around Chinese stocks after Beijing said it would end quarantine requirements for international travels starting Jan. 8. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF ([KWEB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KWEB)) jumped and closed just below a 32.08 buy point.


Preliminary data showed lower volume on the NYSE. Declining stocks on the NYSE only had a slight edge over gainers.

Mining and metal stocks also outperformed. Copper producer **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) rallied 2% as it approaches a 41.26 buy point.


Oil Rises
---------


Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) topped the performance again, up 1.1%. But it's been rallying in light volume after falling below the 50-day on Dec. 6 in higher volume.


While sellers have knocked top-rated oil and gas producers like **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) below key support levels, the field services group is home to several strong performers like **ProFrac Holding** ([ACDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACDC)), which is quickly forming the right side of a cup base.


While ProFrac is fast approaching a 27.10 entry, don't chase the stock. Headed into Tuesday, it was up in four of the past five trading sessions. Instead, watch for a handle to form. That's where the last remaining sellers often get shaken out of a stock before a breakout.


The two giants in the field services group are **SLB** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) and **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), which are also very close to entry points with [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) near highs.


Meanwhile, amid plenty of concerns about a recession for the U.S. economy next year, retailers like **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) are still showing technical strength.


Tractor Supply soared above the 220 level as it forms a cup-with-handle base with a 229.91 entry. After a breakout from a bottoming base in late October, Five Below is close to making a first test of its 10-week moving average. Ulta stock is still in a buy zone after a test of its 10-week line last week.


Other pockets of strength in the stock market worth noting include defense stocks like **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) and **Raytheon** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)). All three continue to trade tightly near highs while holding support at their 10-week lines.

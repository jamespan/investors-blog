Technology leaders bounced Tuesday, a move that helped the Nasdaq more than the other indexes and gave the market a dose of encouragement.


The Nasdaq climbed 1.1%, closing near session highs. Many of the major techs that were bruised the past several days rebounded. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) climbed 1% to more than 3%.


All except Apple had the type of above-normal volume that would indicate institutional investors were buying on the dips. While Tuesday's gains brought a measure of relief, the fact remains that these tech heavyweights remain in troubled charts.


The Nasdaq itself, however, rose back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). That's where it should be if the composite has any aspiration to extend its uptrend. That's no sure thing, but a victory for those watching technical signs.


![mp111516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP111516-163x300.png)The S&P 500 added 0.7% and closed above its 50-day line for the fifth day in a row.


Volume was lower, according to preliminary indications. A significant move like the Nasdaq's rise above the 50-day line is most welcome when it comes in higher volume. Still, that was a minor complaint given the day's results. The Oct. 11 distribution day is now too dated, so it's been deducted from the [distribution-day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) count. Still, the eight distribution days on the Nasdaq remain a drag.


Eventually, it may not matter much if the tech giants end up foundering more. There's a sector rotation unfolding, which is giving rise to a new market leadership. Construction, financial and some health care segments of the market are drawing the most interest. In the case of banks and medicals, investors expect government regulations to ease for those industries after Republicans secured the White House and control of Congress.

As the market has picked itself up, no group of stocks has shined more than small caps. The Russell 2000, up 0.3% Tuesday, is at record highs and up an astonishing 9% since the election.


Where exactly are small caps getting their strength? Of more than 200 stocks in the Russell index up at least 20% since the election, about 80 are biotechs. That's a huge chunk of the small-cap rally. About a dozen regional banks are in the same list, in addition to a number of savings and loans and other financials.


Leading stocks kept abreast of the broad market. The IBD 50 rose 1.1%, with most of the best price increases occurring among technology companies.


Some important earnings reports came out Tuesday, and caused big moves.


**Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) gapped down to a 7% loss in heavy volume. Just one day earlier, the stock cleared a cup-without-handle base but closed below the entry. Tuesday's rout caused a sell signal. The retailer warned of a weak holiday quarter.


**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) fell 2.6% in big volume after it also gave lukewarm guidance.


Retail stocks were mixedÂ after the government reported that retail sales rose 0.8% in October, a new sign of consumer strength. Department stores fell more than 2% but retail internet rose almost 3%.

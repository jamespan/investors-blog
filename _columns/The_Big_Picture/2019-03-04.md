  Leading Stocks Rattled As S&P 500 Today Hits This Trouble Spot

Stocks reversed lower, as many top-performing stocks suddenly veered off their upward course and the S&P 500 today ran up against a key obstacle.




The losses Monday likely had more to do with the market's charts than any news events or earnings reports. U.S. and China negotiators are said to be putting the [final touches on a trade agreement](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-deal-may-keep-some-trump-tariffs-in-place-heres-why-it-matters/), but the market has been rallying this year in expectations of a deal.


Instead, investors could find explanations for Monday's selling in the [daily chart of the S&P 500 itself](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nyse-s-and-p-500-index-0sandp5.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily). The index, down 0.4% Monday, fell back below 2800. That's been a persistent resistance level, bringing out sellers in October, November, December and last week.


In the context of the strong market advance since Boxing Day, the S&P 500 and other indexes seem due for a pause. After an amazing 10-week winning streak, the Nasdaq composite is also meeting resistance roughly around 7575.

Indexes trimmed losses in afternoon trading. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 held above their 50-day moving averages. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) actually rose a fraction. Those are reasons to remain invested in stocks, but also to be guarded in the coming days.


Small caps got hit harder, with the Russell 2000 down 0.9%.


The Nasdaq's 0.2% drop in higher volume gave the composite a mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), its third in the past several weeks.


The Dow fell 0.8%, with two health care stocks doing most of the damage. **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) lost 4.1% and extended a vertical-like descent. The health insurer and its peers have been under pressure since a group of Democrats last week proposed a broad expansion of Medicare.


NYSE volume fell mildly.


**Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) fell 2.8% and extended losses to more than 9% in the past two sessions. On Friday, the company warned of reimbursement woes. On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called out Walgreens Boots Alliance pharmacy stores as the "top violator" among pharmacy chains illegally selling tobacco products to minors, and has sent a letter to management requesting a meeting.


Leaders Noticeably Weaker
-------------------------


More troubling than the indexes was the selling in leading stocks. For many, it was the first palpable sell-off of the year and a change in character.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) dropped 1.3%.


Selling was [focused on software leaders](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/enterprise-software-cybersecurity-stocks-fall/). The No. 1 sector in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables, Software had rallied 23.6% as of Friday. On Monday, iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)), the [largest software ETF by assets](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etf-leaders/ishares-etf-hot-software-sector/), slid 4%. It was the ETF's worst day since Nov. 19.


**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) fell 5.6%, disrupting a nearly six-week advance. **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) lost 4.2%; combined with Wednesday's bad reversal, the stock seems fatigued. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) reduced much of its gain from the Feb. 6 breakout until it pared losses.


**Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) extended Friday's bearish reversal with a 5% drop in big volume. **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) slid to the 50-day moving average, erasing much of its double-digit increase from the most recent breakout past a 172.77 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/).


Outside software, **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) gapped down sharply and cut its heavy-volume loss to 3.4%.

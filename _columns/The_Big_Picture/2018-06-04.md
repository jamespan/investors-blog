Retail Stocks Walmart, Home Depot Lead Dow; Williams-Sonoma Jumps
==================================================================

Retail stocks outperformed Monday, but technology stocks weren't far behind. FANG stocks **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) hit new highs, and the Nasdaq composite scored an all-time closing high.




At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite rose 0.7%. The S&P 500 added 0.4%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 up 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Friday's levels.


Retail Stocks Lead Dow
----------------------


**Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) were strong performers in the Dow, with gains of 2.1% to 2.9%.


Walmart gained more than 2%. It's selling 80% of its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International. As a result of the deal, Walmart is taking a $4.5 billion noncash charge.

Nasdaq Nears All-Time High
--------------------------


The Nasdaq composite came to within 31 points of its all-time intraday high of 7637 set on March 13. The index on Friday punched through the 7500 level, a significant technical accomplishment even though volume fell from Thursday's level.


The Nasdaq 100 added 0.8%, helped by strength in shares of **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). It added 2.8%, while [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) names **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) ended with gains of 3% to 3.5%. But the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) eased 0.2%, weighed down by weakness in **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)).


The Dow still has the 25000 level to conquer, while the 2800 level for the S&P 500 is a potential resistance level to watch.


Other Retail Stocks Outperform
------------------------------


Eight of the day's 10 best-performing industry groups were retail related. Department-store operators led the way. **Dillard's** ([DDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDS)) cleared a cup-with-handle base with an 84.34 entry. Shares popped nearly 6% to 87.85.


Also in the retail space, **At Home** ([HOME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOME)) bounced off its 50-day moving average ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. Shares jumped 6% to 37.04. At Home was featured in the latest Earnings Preview column. Results are due Thursday after the close.



Group peer **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) soared 7% to 58.61. The stock cleared a 56.48 entry in a lopsided pattern.


**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) also outperformed ahead of its earnings report Wednesday after the close. Shares vaulted 8% to 77.24. It's near the top of a later-stage flat base with a 78.38 buy point.


Oil Weak Again
--------------


U.S. crude oil futures for July delivery settled at $64.75 a barrel, down 1.5%, ahead of the OPEC meeting later this week, when the cartel is expected to ease crude production curbs that have been in place for more than a year now.


Five of the 10 worst-performing group were from the energy sector.


Signs Of Institutional Selling
------------------------------


Monday's strength came amid an elevated [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count for the S&P 500. Headed into Monday, the index showed seven higher-volume declines, with five of those days showing declines ranging from 0.7% to 1.2%. The other decline was 0.3%, and there was one instance of stalling where volume was heavy in the S&P 500, but it couldn't make meaningful price progress.


What trumps the elevated distribution-day count, however, is the overall good price action in leading growth stocks. There's little or no technical damage in charts of leading growth stocks. Until that happens, it's prudent to respect the current uptrend and continue to look for actionable setups.

The major stock indexes ended mixed Thursday following Wednesday's stock market sell-off. In a mostly positive session for growth and chip stocks, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rebounded sharply.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 easily outperformed Thursday, rallying 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. But the S&P 500 rose a mild 0.1% after sputtering into the close.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4%, weighed down by a 7.1% dive in shares of **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) that followed the company's [disappointing earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-disney-earnings-disney-plus-subscribers/).


The 10-year Treasury yield [remained at 1.56%](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-blows-up-to-30-year-high-dow-jones/) because the bond market was closed Thursday in observance of Veterans Day.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP111121-220x300.jpg)Leading growth stocks climbed sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 2.2%, recouping a big part of Wednesday's 4.3% tumble. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) rocketed 20% after the company's [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/applovin-stock-software-firm-beats-sales-target-but-misses-on-earnings/) came out late Wednesday. Shares are about 43% above an 80.32 buy point in a cup with handle.


Chip stocks were firm, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 1.9%. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) snapped back from Wednesday's weakness with advances of 4.4% and 3.2%, respectively. Both are well extended from buy areas.


Hot new issue **Rivian** ([RIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIVN)) soared for a second straight day, surging 22% Thursday. Investors should be disciplined about buying new issues. Wait for an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) to form and offer the stock's first buy point before considering a purchase.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, removing some of the session's bullishness. Volume appeared to be lower on the NYSE, too.

What To Do Now
--------------


The stock market rally put in a mixed performance Thursday with the Dow Jones industrials extending Wednesday's losses. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 recovered just a part of Wednesday's sell-off and also closed near their lows.


Despite the recent weakness, the Nasdaq still only has one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to lower volume during the recent declines.


The Nasdaq did see a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-sells-into-strength-with-stalling-signals/) on Nov. 5 that was previously uncounted. Going into that day, the Nasdaq already counted one day of stalling — on Oct. 26. That stalling day fell off the count after the Nasdaq rose 5% from the Nov. 5 close, the same day the index again stalled. The key takeaway is that today there is one day of institutional selling on the Nasdaq (that stall session), while the S&P 500 has two distribution days.


For now, the current pullback is completely normal, so investors should remain upbeat about the health of the uptrend. Continue to buy breakouts in top growth stocks. And watch for stocks that are holding up the best during this week's weakness; they could continue to be some of the market's leaders.


Among top stocks reporting earnings, **Affirm** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)) [pared huge gains](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/afrm-stock-affirm-stock-affirm-earnings-sept2021/) to 13.7% Thursday as volatile trading continues. **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) [surged as much as 16.5%](https://www.investors.com/news/dutch-bros-stock-q321-earnings/) before cutting gains to 5.9%. The top initial public offering triggered the [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/key-sell-signal-saved-stamps-com-stock-investors-from-posting-big-losses/) from an IPO base's 62.10 entry amid Wednesday's 3.5% loss.

The stock market rebounded sharply Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 posted strong gains. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock briefly sold off on a [report of weak iPhone demand](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-falters-on-report-iphone-demand-weakening-during-holiday-season/) before slashing losses, while **Danaher** ([DHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHR)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **Zim Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) are near new buy points.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.8% â€” boosted by a 7.5% surge in shares of **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). The airplane maker jumped after China's aviation authority issued an airworthiness directive setting the Boeing 737 Max up for a return to service in China, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/china-aviation-authority-issues-airworthiness-directive-boeing-737-max-2021-12-02/).


The S&P 500 rallied 1.4%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.7%. The Nasdaq followed up with a 0.8% gain.


Leading growth stocks climbed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) moved up 1.6%, recovering a part of Wednesday's 3.8% tumble. But it remained below the 200-day moving average. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Louisiana Pacific** ([LPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPX)) rallied 5.7%, ending back above its cup with handle's 68.93 buy point.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be slightly lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.

What To Do Now
--------------


The Nasdaq rebounded from its key [50-day benchmark](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) Thursday, while the S&P 500 reclaimed its own 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrials regained the long-term 200-day line, but the blue-chip index remains below its 50-day line.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP120221-237x300.jpg)Amid the recent weakness, the Nasdaq has three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), while the S&P 500's count dropped to five Thursday. The S&P 500's Oct. 27 distribution day expired due to time. Distribution days older than 25 sessions are considered no longer relevant to the today's market trend.


After [IBD downgraded](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dives-as-powell-comments-omicron-variant-stoke-fears/) the market outlook to an uptrend under pressure on Tuesday, investors should be focusing on stocks that are holding up the best. These leaders will have strong relative strength lines.


Hold off on most new purchases unless a perfect breakout materializes. Even those carry higher risk, as evidenced by **NXP Semiconductors'** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) faltering [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). The [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock climbed past a 227.60 buy point in a cup with handle Wednesday. Shares are about 2% below the entry following Thursday's slight loss.


Next, create a game plan for each stock that you own. Review them for potential sell signals, or profit-taking opportunities.


Lastly, be flexible. An uptrend under pressure means the current outlook is uncertain. While further weakness could trigger a correction, re-emergent strength could shift the market status back into a confirmed uptrend.

[Pfizer stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-pfizer-inc-pfe.aspx) has a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/), according to the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)


The stock's relative strength line hit a new high in recent sessions, indicating strong stock market outperformance.

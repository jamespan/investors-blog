Stocks Notch Small Gains, Keep New Uptrend Alive
=================================================

Stocks protected gains Thursday, a day after the Nasdaq's pop in higher volume confirmed an uptrend is underway.


The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each tacked on 0.4%. The IBD 50 inched up 0.1%.


Volume declined on both major exchanges.


Expectations are often minimal in the first few days after a market uptrend signal. Difficulties early can kill a new rally. Bulls, therefore, were likely happy with Thursday's small gains in quiet volume. At least the market did not show any signs of institutional selling.


The market had to shrug off bad news before the open. Initial jobless claims came in moderately higher than expected. Also, the eurozone reported zero GDP growth in the second quarter.


Most exchanges rose in Europe, suggesting the weak numbers were no big deal for now. U.S. indexes kept to a similarly nonchalant tone.


The market itself is keeping to a recent trend, at least as far as the put-call ratio is concerned.


Earlier this month, IBD pointed out that the put-call ratio closed above 1.0 on July 31 and Aug. 1. Four times this year through May, a put-call ratio above 1.0 preceded a short-term bottom in the Nasdaq by two to eight sessions.


This time the short-term low came five sessions after the July 31 signal. So unless the uptrend unravels, this will mark the fifth time this year that the put-call ratio has done its job.


Although the road up isn't always smooth, individual investors have tools to test the uptrend.


The standard drill runs like this: When a stock on your watch list clears a buy point in strong volume, open a half-position. If the stock advances 2% to 2.5%, add 30% to 35% of the planned full investment. If the stock rises an additional 2% to 2.5%, complete the purchase with a 15% to 20% buy.


If the stock stalls or retreats, do not buy past the partial position. Whether you sell or hold is a judgment call tied to how the stock is acting, your conviction level, whether any sell signals have been triggered and whether you have a cushion in your overall portfolio.


If the stock is working, repeat the procedure with a second stock's breakout.


The key idea is to let the market itself pull you in to greater exposure or push you back to the sidelines.


This procedure might seem overly cautious.


But think of it this way: If this uptrend rolls over, you will be grateful that you kept your exposure small. If the uptrend works, the insurance policy this approach buys will be small compared with your overall gains.

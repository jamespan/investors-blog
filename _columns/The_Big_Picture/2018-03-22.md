Stocks Dive On Trump Tariffs, But This Gauge Hints At Bounce
=============================================================

U.S. stock indexes stumbled Thursday as President Trump moved to slap tariffs on China. Meanwhile, China vowed retaliatory action.




The Dow Jones industrial average crumpled 2.9%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost 2.5% and 2.4% respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 sank 2.1%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.


Both major indexes suffered distribution, which involves a price loss in rising volume. Distribution points to institutional selling.

The uptrend remains under pressure.


Trouble for the market has been brewing for some time.


After knifing through resistance at the 7500 level about two weeks ago, the Nasdaq lost in sequence the 7500 level, then its 10-day moving average and Thursday its 50-day line.


The S&P 500 never overcame resistance at the 2800 level and lost its 50-day line Monday.


The put-call volume ratio closed at 1.17. Levels at 1.15 and higher often signal a short-term low. The last time the market hit that key level was March 1, just before a 6.3% rise in the Nasdaq. Previous to that was a close at 1.26 on Feb. 9. The Nasdaq followed with an 11% run-up.

This time the reading appears more uncertain, if only because one of the causes is more serious.


Trump's tariffs have created uncertainty in the stock market.


The stock market started off the year with a 7.4% advance in the Nasdaq in January, signaling confidence. The gains in January came via a steady climb. Daily moves involved fairly tight ranges. This is what bulls prefer to see.


But since then, price action in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 has been wide and loose.


Wide and loose action points to a stock market that is losing its confidence.


Tariffs: Bargaining Chip Or Folly?
----------------------------------


The tariff card has the potential to go one of two ways.


Trump could use tariffs as bargaining chips to gain better managed-trade agreements. (The so-called free trade agreements are actually managed trade, generally welcomed only because they are more free than the status quo they replace.) The stock market could handle that situation, perhaps even see it as an improvement.


But if Trump pushes too aggressively on tariffs it could lead to significant pushback and perhaps a trade war. That would be a lose-lose scenario for the stock market because it would lead to prolonged uncertainty as different countries join the skirmish.


Two Quality Winners
-------------------


Breakouts were scarce Thursday, especially among quality stocks.


In the IBD 50, declining issues outnumbered advancing issues by an almost 16-to-1 ratio.



**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) were two exceptions.


Retail discounter Five Below rose 4% in strong trade. Health savings account provider HealthEquity popped 2% in heavy volume.


Meanwhile, the [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) plus **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) have turned mixed. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), Apple and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) are each under their 10-week line. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) remain above the line.


Financial News
--------------


First-time jobless claims inched up to 229,000 vs. 225,000 estimated. The narrow miss was no cause for concern.


The flash composite Purchasing Managers Index for March rolled in at 54.3 vs. expectations for 55.2. Again, no worry.


Leading indicators for February were pegged at 0.6%, twice the 0.3% target.


The Kansas City Fed's manufacturing gauge for March was unchanged at 17. Readings at zero indicate neither growth nor contraction.


Coming Up
---------


On Friday, durable goods orders for February will be released before the market's open.


New home sales for February will be released at 10 a.m. ET.


Next week the second take on first-quarter GDP will be released Wednesday.

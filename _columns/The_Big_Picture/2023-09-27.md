  Stock Market Rebounds Off Lows After Nasdaq Tests 13,000; Oil Prices Jump, Gold Whacked

A week after IBD moved to downshift its market outlook to the [status of a correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gets-a-fresh-bearish-downgrade-after-fed-decision/), the health of stocks hasn't improved much at all. Yet indexes reversed off their intraday lows in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), hinting that institutional-class investors sought bargains.




Plus, oil and gas stocks continued to defy the bearish trend on Wednesday. And when crude oil futures make a new year-to-date high, it's easy to understand why investors have piled into that sector's equities.


Looking at the day's industry group action, at least six of the 10 biggest advancers hailed from the oil and gas patch. They included international and U.S. oil and gas exploration firms, as well as stocks in oil field services, drilling and machinery. These industry groups each rose at least 3% on a price-weighted basis, early data showed. Wednesday's best performer: coal, up 4.7%.

Light sweet oil futures, meanwhile, gained more than 2% and hit as high as $94.14 a barrel on Wednesday. That marked the highest level since late August of 2022.


These gains, however, somehow did not cause the key indexes in the stock market to stumble even further.

Stock Market Today: Small Caps Rebound
--------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP092723-2-256x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite fell as much as 0.8% intraday and briefly undercut 13,000, which may be viewed as a meaningful psychological price level.


After bottoming out at 12,963 in midafternoon trading, the Nasdaq stopped losing traction, hit the break-even level at around 2:30 p.m. ET, and finished with a gain of 0.2%.


That was in line with a 0.2% lift by the Nasdaq 100. However, the S&P 500 closed virtually unchanged, up less than 1 point. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%, although it had fallen as much as 0.9% in the early going. The Dow also finished in the upper half of the intraday range.


Volume rose on both exchanges.


Amid the slap-down in major large-cap indexes during much of the session, it was curious to see the Russell 2000 buck that decline virtually the entire day. Up 1% by the close, the small-cap gauge showed strength in select names in the energy and biotech sectors.


**MillerKnoll** ([MLKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLKN)) ($1.8 billion market cap, 75.7 million shares outstanding) also made an impact on the Russell 2000. Shares vaulted 28% in massive volume after reporting what, on the surface, looked like depressing results.


Earnings in the office furniture giant fell 16% in the August-ended first quarter to 37 cents a share as sales sank 15% to $917.7 million. But the company boosted its adjusted profit target for fiscal 2024 (ending in May next year) to a range of $1.85-$2.15. In July, MillerKnoll gave EPS guidance of $1.70-$2.


Small Caps Still Underperforming
--------------------------------



Nevertheless, the Russell 2000 has fallen into an intermediate correction — a 10%-to-19% decline from an index's 52-week high. The Russell 2000 has now fallen 12% from its July peak of 2003.62.


As the accompanying chart shows, the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund had already taken out its 50-day line. Recently, IWM has also made a move below its [long-term 200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/). In a healthy stock market, both major equity indexes and leading stocks are rising above their 50- and 200-day lines and even leading them higher.


Clearly, the stock market is relaying this message: While all stocks carry a higher risk of immediate losses, the case is even more bearish among smaller companies. Considering investors' fear about the economy after the Federal Reserve hoisted short-term interest rates from a 0%-0.25% target range in early 2022 to 5.25%-5.5% now, the stock market seems to be thinking logically.


Defensive Areas Weaken
----------------------


The stock market appears to keep getting its strength sapped by the rise in the cost of money. And this rise has been inexorable in recent days.


The yield of the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose sharply on Wednesday, up as much as 8 basis points to 4.64% before settling at 4.62%. That marked the highest point since October 2007.


Given how even shorter-term Treasury bills and notes command an even higher payout — 5.58% for 3-month Treasury bonds, 5.49% for one-year notes as of Wednesday afternoon — it's easy to understand how stocks are facing more competition with fixed income in the battle for reliable returns.


The Dow Jones utility average, hurt by a nearly 7% walloping in shares of **NextEra Energy** ([NEE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEE)), continues to slump badly. Down nearly 1% on Wednesday, the Dow utility index has fallen more than 14% since Jan. 1.


NextEra reportedly plans to sell its Florida City Gas utility asset to **Chesapeake Utilities** ([CPK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPK)) for $923 million.


This Asset Weakens
------------------



Outside the energy sphere, do you consider gold a defensive asset? If so, gold actually had one of its worst days in a while as the U.S. dollar climbed again. A higher dollar makes gold more expensive to buy among overseas banks and traders.


Gold futures contracts expiring in September on the Comex dropped 1.5% to $1,871.60, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Meanwhile, the SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) ETF fell 1.2% for its fourth drop in five sessions. It also hit a six-month low.


The dollar surged to almost 150 yen in Japan. The euro withered to $1.05.


Stock Market Earnings Yield Vs. Treasury Yields
-----------------------------------------------


A boost in the earnings yield for the S&P 500, one way to compare the yield of risk-free U.S. Treasuries, has made the stock market only a trifle bit more attractive.


Based on data compiled by Yardeni Research as of Monday, the analysts' consensus estimate for 2024 profits among S&P 500 firms stood at $247.29. With the S&P 500 closing Wednesday at 4274, the forward 2024 earnings yield is 5.8%.


And how about the prospect for the federal government to run out of money to pay its short-term bills by month's end?


Ned Davis Research (NDR) notes that a federal shutdown could subtract more than 0.1 percentage point from real U.S. GDP growth for every week it goes on. But "the full impact could be larger because of temporary disruptions to various activities, loss of consumer and business confidence, and increase in policy uncertainty," Veneta Dimitrova, senior U.S. economist, and Joe Kalish, chief global macro strategist at NDR, wrote in a note emailed to IBD.


Stock Market Sentiment Sours
----------------------------


Bullishness among newsletter pundits, meanwhile, has also taken a hit.


The latest Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter editors shows bulls tanked to 43.7% from 48.6% a week ago. It's now close to hitting the late-August level of 43.1% and down significantly from a peak of 57.1% reached earlier that same month. Meanwhile, bears rose mildly to 23.9% vs. 22.8% last week.


Comparing these two ratios, we clearly are not at a level of extreme fear.


Put another way, if the bearish ratio exceeded the bulls, then it would likely mean that a large majority of investors have thrown in the towel and virtually given up on stocks going higher. They've gone to cash, or even put on short sale positions, in the hope that stocks would fall further. This was certainly the case most recently in October 2022. Back then, the bears rose past 44%, well above bulls at 25%.

Puts Vs. Calls
--------------


Meanwhile, the put-call volume ratio has climbed sharply in recent days. But it has not reached the climactic levels seen when the Covid pandemic bear market intensified at the end of February 2020.


Back then, the put-call ratio exploded to 1.44 in mid-March 2020, just a few weeks before the stock market bottomed with a strong follow-through by the S&P 500 on April 2 of that year. A 1.44 ratio means as many as 144 puts traded for every 100 calls. Put options are generally used by bearish investors.


So far this week, headed into Wednesday's action, the put-call ratio rose to 1.13.

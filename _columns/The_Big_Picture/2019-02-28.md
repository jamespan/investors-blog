U.S. stock indexes faded late in Thursday's session, after showing little reaction to either bullish or bearish news.




The Nasdaq slid 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dittoed the loss. Small caps in the Russell 2000 also lost a bit more than 0.3%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


The day's action constituted distribution, which points to unusually heavy institutional selling.


GDP Beat Shrugged Off
---------------------


News before the market's opening bell showed a stronger-than-expected reading on [fourth-quarter GDP](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Growth rolled in at 2.6% vs. expectations for 2.2%. But the stock market seemed unimpressed.

Meanwhile, in Vietnam, President Donald Trump abruptly ended talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying "Sometimes you have to walk and this was just one of those times."


Democrats offered Trump rare praise for walking away from what they said would've been a bad agreement.


Stock Market's Real Concern
---------------------------


Some commentators said Trump's walk-off move could give him more leverage in trade talks with China, a bigger concern for the stock market than North Korea.


By walking away from North Korea, Trump has signaled to China that he is not desperate to sign just any agreement.


In Thursday's market, additional stocks powered ahead in gap-up moves. **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) leapt to an 8% gain. **Gray Television** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)), which has recently inhabited the [Stock Spotlight stock list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/), jumped to a 16% gain. **Nomad Foods** ([NOMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOMD)) popped to a 6.6% gain.


All three stocks staged breakaway moves, clearing legitimate patterns in heavy volume.


A gap up is a bullish move that involves a leap that clears the previous session's trading range and stays above the range.


Two IBD-Based ETFs
------------------


Two IBD-related exchange traded funds showed sleepy action that was more typical for the session. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF crept down 0.03 to 32.94. Volume was about 50% below average.


Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) inched 0.04 higher to 20.08. Volume was about 65% below average.


The two funds are outperforming the stock market in 2019. Innovator IBD 50 is up 19% so far this year vs. 14% for the Nasdaq and 11% for the S&P 500.


Innovator Breakout is up 15.5% year to date.


Among IBD's [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), medical and food stocks led the day's gainers. Travel bookers took the hardest hits.


**Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) stumbled 10% in heavy volume. The company, formerly known as Priceline, topped the Street's estimates on earnings and revenue but offered a weak outlook for Q1 2019.

Investors exhaled a collective breath of relief on Wednesday after President Donald Trump agreed to delay bruising tariffs on auto-related imports from Canada and Mexico for at least one month. All key indexes rebounded, and the Nasdaq led the way.


The Nasdaq composite gained 1.5%, snapping a two-day losing streak and narrowly beating a 1.3% rebound by the NYSE composite index. The S&P 500 rose 1.1%, a nose ahead of the S&P SmallCap 600's 1% lift. The Dow Jones Industrial Average matched the S&P 500's gain.




The Nasdaq And Stock Market
---------------------------


Volume fell sharply on both main exchanges vs. Tuesday's session. Rising stocks topped decliners by about 2-to-1 on the NYSE and Nasdaq, according to FactSet.

The economic and political news in recent weeks are treating the Nasdaq and the general stock market like stiff crosswinds hitting a sailboat. That is, the sailboat must tack back and forth to get from point A to point B. And such movement is not exactly the most pleasant for stock investors.


Consider that before the market open, investors absorbed a poor reading on monthly job creation in the private sector.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MP030525-254x300.jpg)The ADP private payrolls report came in at 77,000 net new jobs created in February. That fell well below the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 162,000 job additions. The lowest projection among economists polled was 144,000.


Perhaps that news, plus the initiation by the U.S. of 25% tariffs on various goods coming from the Mexican and Canadian borders, mainly drove the initial drop in equities. A slower economy puts pressure on corporate sales and earnings.


But at around noon ET, stocks bottomed out, then moved into higher ground after the White House officially announced that the auto sector would get a break. That news confirmed hints made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick the previous day.


Watch 200-Day Moving Average
----------------------------


Before Wednesday's gain, the Nasdaq appeared as if its impressive uptrend after bottoming out in October 2022 could be ending.


On Monday and Tuesday, the index closed beneath its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/). The Nasdaq had not done this since October 2023.



When an index or a stock trades below this long-term technical support level, it strongly suggests that the balance of supply vs. demand is greatly tilted to the former, not the latter. This means more sellers could come out of the woodwork. And all it could take is another piece of bad news that would draw more fear among investors, leading to more selling.


A sharp drop below the 200-day moving average, as seen in prior bear markets, serves as an edge-of-the-cliff scenario for the current bull market.


[A MarketSurge daily chart](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) of the Nasdaq shows how it made an impressive bounce off the 200-day line on Aug. 5. From that day's low of 15,708, the composite has sailed as much as 29% in the space of four months. Along the way, it marked all-time highs as well.


Check out a long weekly chart of the Nasdaq, and you'll see that the index got bullish support right after challenging sell-offs down to the 40-week moving average in March 2023, October to early November the same year, and once again in August of 2024. Also, over that time frame, the 40-week line transformed from going into a sharp downtrend in most of 2022 to bottoming out from February to May of 2023 to rising sharply for more than 18 months through today.

Industry Action
---------------



Certainly, auto-related stocks enjoyed gains on Wednesday.


Looking at the performance of IBD's 197 industry groups, automakers, auto and truck replacement parts, and auto and truck original equipment stocks rallied 2.4% to 2.6% on a price-weighted basis, early data showed. Yet plenty of other industries did just as well or even better.


Amid a weaker U.S. dollar and rally in precious metals futures, metal ores and gold mining stocks rallied 4.3% and 2.6%, respectively. Chemical firms really jammed on Wednesday: Plastics rose 4.2%, basic chemicals gained 3.5%, agricultural chemicals added 3.2%, and paints were up 2.6%. So, why did the Nasdaq do so well amid all of this solid performance by cyclicals and industrials? Fabless semiconductor firms rose 2.9% as a group, ranking within the top 10 industry groups on the day.

Finding The Rarest Gems In The Stock Market
-------------------------------------------


The best and brightest companies in the stock market do not all come from the technology sector, veteran fund manager Louis Navellier cowrote with David Evanson in the new book "The Sacred Truths Of Investing."


In a chapter entitled "The 100,000% Club," Navellier, a veteran in examining top growth stocks on fundamental and technical levels, listed 13 companies that produced 100,000% returns.



While the plurality of the list hailed from the tech sector, it also flagged **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), aerospace parts leader **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)).


Of course, it takes a tremendous amount of time and patience for companies and investors to achieve such a precious, life-changing gain. If you're a swing trader or day trader, the concept seems totally foreign, perhaps even unbelievable. But for those who like to play the long game, the list offers some key insights.


First and foremost, you need a healthy stock market that's able to go on secular bull runs. Most stocks, value and growth, follow the general market direction.


Second, you need a company to utterly dominate its market niche.


Third, you need a talented management team that steers the ship to new technologies, creates new products to satisfy insatiable demand, and does what it takes to keep the company even more profitable.



"It doesn't always take breakthroughs in technology to create and then dominate new markets," Navellier wrote in a section covering burger chain McDonald's. "Sometimes continuous improvement in processes will deliver continuous improvement in profitability and, over time, a return of 100,000%."


Reno, Nev.-based Navellier & Associates has $1.4 billion in assets under management.

Beyond The Nasdaq
-----------------


Major China equities and related benchmarks continue to outperform their U.S. counterparts so far in 2025.


One proxy, the iShares China Large Cap ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) exchange traded fund, jumped 5% to 36.79 in more than twice its average volume. [The new member of IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) is extremely close to a potential breakout past 36.82 within a five-month [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).



The ETF is not alone. The iShares MSCI China fund ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) also had a great Wednesday, rising 4.9% in above-average turnover. It has constructed a decent-looking cup with handle of its own. The handle shows a mild drift lower and presents a 56.46 buy point. The ETF's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) has broken out of a funk in late January and risen sharply in recent weeks. This means it's sharply outperforming the S&P 500.


The ETF was a late-afternoon addition on [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/).


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) — whose founder and former CEO Jack Ma and Chinese President Xi Jinping shocked the world recently by shaking hands at a government meeting with the country's tech executives — is a top-three holding in both China ETFs. Gaming titan **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) also holds big sway over both funds.


In fixed-income markets, traders took some profits in long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the key 10-year government note rose five basis points to 4.26%.

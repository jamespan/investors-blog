The stock market halted a three-day slide Tuesday as the Nasdaq led a bounce in the major indexes.

  

The Nasdaq surged 0.8% and the S&P 500 0.4%. Both closed near session highs, a positive sign.

  

It was an uncharacteristic day of leadership for the Nasdaq, which has watched the S&P 500 emerge as the leading index.

  

At just 2% off its prior high, the S&P 500 has fared better , thanks to relative strength in foreign banks, steel, energy and utilities the past four weeks.

  

The index also has been less volatile and on Tuesday found support at the 50-day moving average.

  

By comparison, the Nasdaq has had to contend with decay in biotech, Internet and other technology stocks that make much of its base of support. Internet stocks did help lead the market Tuesday. Some of them were Chinese firms that had sold off: **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)), **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)).

  

Volume fell across the board, which showed that institutional investors weren't betting on the market bottoming.

  

It may not mean much at this stage of the market correction. More important will be how volume behaves if the indexes continue to rebound.

  

The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the major indexes have sunk to dismal levels, so there's no underlying buying showing up.

  

Energy stocks rose as crude oil prices jumped. But higher oil hurt transportation stocks.

  

Truckers and airlines — two industries that have been market leaders — lagged the market Tuesday.

  

Airlines also weakened after **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) warned that thousands of weather-related flight cancellations in the first quarter would cut revenue by about $115 million and operating profit by some $60 million in Q1.

  

Earnings season, meanwhile, is just getting started.

  

After the close, **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) beat profit expectations for the first quarter, but revenue was below estimates. The stock rose modestly in extended trading.

  

Leading stocks had a solid day. The IBD 50 rallied 1.3% in a respite from three straight days of losses — 1.8%, 3.6% and 2%.

  

But it's premature to think the leaders are ready to rally back.

  

About half of the IBD 50 stocks are trading below their 50-day moving averages. An updated list published late Monday in IBD Leaderboard saw a half-dozen other leaders testing that key level of support.

  

If stocks cannot hold their 50-day lines, the next level of support often is the 200-day moving average.

  

Three IBD 50 stocks — **KapStone Paper** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)), **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) and **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) — found support there Tuesday.

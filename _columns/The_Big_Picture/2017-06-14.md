  Equities Decline Mildly After Rate Hike, But This Sector Got Body-Slammed

 If you are long on oil or are betting on rising inflation, you were sorely disappointed on Wednesday.


But if you are a generalist in the stock market and focus on the leading stocks, then you likely weren't too perturbed by what U.S. equities did after the Federal Reserve raised the cost of money for the third time in seven months.


Major indexes showed mixed action but the stock market showed a downward slant overall — not a surprise, given that IBD's current outlook got downgraded to "Uptrend under pressure" from "Confirmed uptrend" following Friday's rush of selling.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MP_3x3_061417-1-193x300.png)On that day, the Nasdaq composite fell like a rock, sinking 1.8%, tying for its second worst decline of the year. On Wednesday, the 0.4% decline was blunted by a mini-rally during the final 40 minutes of the session.


The S&P 500 edged just 0.1% lower, while the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.2% thanks to 1-point-plus advances from the likes of **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and two more of the 30 components. The small-cap S&P 600 sank 0.6%.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and higher on the NYSE. The drop in turnover on the Nasdaq meant it avoided logging an additional [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), or session of heavy professional selling. Meanwhile, the S&P 500's drop was not large enough to warrant a distribution day on that index.


Yet the sell-off in the energy complex was crystal-clear, as near-term U.S. crude oil futures collapsed nearly 4% to $44.73 a barrel. The 13% slide from crude's short-term peak of $51.47 on May 23 is nothing short of stunning, but perhaps not surprising given the strength of U.S. production and OPEC's limited ability to influence both supply and the price of oil the way it did during the stagnant 1970s.


Seven of the eight worst industry groups of the day came from the oil patch, including oil drilling (down more than 4%), machinery and equipment (-3.6%) and U.S. exploration and production (-3.3%). Ship transport, gold, metal ores and steel stocks also got slammed.


Have you seen the latest IBD 50? Have you seen the glaring absence of companies from the commodity sectors?


Indeed, the market's slowing action, from the prism of the major indexes, is due in part to a slaughter of market values in not only oil and gas firms but also big-box retailers and even specialty retail companies. These two sectors have a mammothlike impact on the stock market.


Among the 20 worst-performing industry groups out of the 197 that IBD tracks, most hail from the laggard energy sector; the others are in metals, certain retail and media, and defensive food industries.

However, keep in mind that both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 are market-cap weighted. So as FANG stocks keep growing in value, so do these two important equity gauges.


Everyone expected a 25-basis-point increase in the fed funds rate to a target range of 1%-1.25%. That's up from a 0%-0.25% range not too long ago. It is certainly a mark of the U.S. central bank's confidence in the current economy, and the Federal Reserve expressed it in its statement. One notable change in its news release: "Household spending has picked up in recent months, and business fixed investment has continued to expand."


The Fed also surprised few people by announcing plans to "gradually reduce" its holdings in mortgage-backed agency debt and U.S. Treasury bonds on its humongous balance sheet, currently at $4.5 trillion. But the timing of that plan will no doubt depend on how the economy does. On Wednesday, the newest set of data gave investors and bankers a sour taste in their mouths. Not only did consumer prices fall in May, but so did retail sales, missing expectations by a mile.


Chris Gaffney, president of the world markets division at EverBank, notes that the Kansas City Federal Reserve bank reported that a $675 billion reduction in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet "equates to a 0.25% interest rate increase." To get the Fed's balance sheet to "normal levels before the 2008-09 Wall Street crisis would mean jacking up the fed funds rate to just over 5%.


Savers across the land would likely enjoy the boost in interest income in their bank accounts. But how would the rest of the economy fare? Gaffney's opinion: "Definitely not something which our fragile economic recovery could handle," he told IBD. "The Fed knows this, and will be very careful in balancing the reduction of the balance sheet with stated increases in the official interest rates."

U.S. stock indexes edged down Friday, keeping their losses small for the week.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sanded off 0.1% Friday, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose less than 0.2%.




Volume was lower on the Nasdaq nd on the NYSE.


For the week, the Nasdaq lost 0.2%. The S&P 500 was off less than 0.1%. But the Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 1.2%, thank to two high-priced gainers — **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), up 14% for the week; and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) up 7%.


The Dow is a price-weighted index.


The technical picture for the stock market improved during the week but in an unusual way.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP_2x3_072817-174x300.png)During the week, the Nasdaq suffered a stalling day and a regular distribution day, even as the overall count of higher-volume declines fell. Cumulative price gains helped the Nasdaq shake off several distribution days, even as the indexes sold off Thursday.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the top gainers for the week were consumer electronics retailers and the financial mortgage group.


**Aaron's** ([AAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAN)), an operator of stores offering rent-to-own appliances and furniture, jumped 17% in heavy volume Friday. The buy opportunity actually emerged Thursday when the stock crossed above a 40.43 buy point in volume 63% above average.


Aaron's reported earnings that trounced the consensus by 17.2%.


Other retailers in the same group delivered solid gains for the week. **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) rose 6%; **Conn's** ([CONN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CONN)), 2%; and **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), 3.5%.


In the financial mortgage group, **LendingTree** ([TREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREE)) leapt 19% for the week. **CoreLogic** ([CLGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLGX)) rose 5%.


Economic reports were good but didn't move the market much.


Q2 GDP growth came in at 2.6%, matching expectations. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge rolled in at 93.4, slightly above views for 93.1.


News of the Republicans' failure to pass even a partial repeal of ObamaCare also didn't appear to affect stocks much.


Coming up: Earnings season will continue with reports from restaurant chain **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) on Monday; **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) on Tuesday; chip designer **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) on Wednesday; **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) on Thursday; and a December initial public offering, the online hotel-search operator **Trivago** ([TRVG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRVG)), on Friday.

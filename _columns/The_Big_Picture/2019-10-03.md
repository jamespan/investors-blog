  Stock Market Battles Back After Early Drop; Software, Chip Stocks Lead Nasdaq

Thursday was shaping up to be another rough session for the stock market when the Dow Jones tumbled 335 points early in the day. Sentiment was weak early after the ISM services index came in below expectations. But stock market bulls got a nice present as major stock indexes rallied sharply off lows and ended near session highs.




The ISM services data came after the ISM Manufacturing index on Tuesday notched its second straight monthly reading below 50, indicating contraction. The odds of another quarter-point interest rate cut at the Oct. 30 Federal Reserve meeting have risen substantially this week. Futures traders late Thursday pegged the chances of a 25-basis-point cut later this month at around 90%, with a 53% chance of another quarter-point cut at the Dec. 11 meeting.


The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.1% after touching its 200-day moving average. The Dow Jones industrials also paid a visit to the 200-day line and then rallied 0.5%. The S&P 500 picked up 0.8%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Wednesday's levels, continuing a weak trend of higher-volume declines followed by lower-volume gains. While Thursday wasn't a day of conviction buying in the major stock indexes, the reversal of lows and support for the Dow and Nasdaq at their 200-day lines was a welcome development for the bulls.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP100319-226x300.jpg)Thursday's gains were good to see, but not a total surprise after the [put-call volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-options-activity-tell-you-theres-too-much-complacency-read-this-first/) clocked in at 1.24 Wednesday. It was a fearful reading in the options market, as traders bought more bearish puts than calls than normal. Elevated put-call ratios, indicating excessive fear, have been seen near market bottoms in the past.


But the stock market isn't out of the woods yet. The [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is still daunting, particularly on the Nasdaq. Of the Nasdaq's six distribution days since Sept. 3, five came with declines of 1% or more. But the stock market often works in counterintuitive ways, so investors should stay open to the possibility of a tradable rally before the end of the year.


The September jobs report, due Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, could be a market mover. It hasn't been in recent months as the stock market has gotten used to steady job growth, but a weak number could fuel more fears of an economic slowdown.


Stock Market Today: Software Stocks Rally
-----------------------------------------


Many of Thursday's top-performing groups hailed from the beaten down software sector. IBD's enterprise software group rallied 3% as it tests support at the 200-day moving average. **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) reclaimed its 50-day moving average, rising 6%. Group peer **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), Thursday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), rallied more than 2%. It's near the top of the 5% buy zone from a 59.72 buy point.


In the security software group, **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) snapped back bullishly after two days of volatile trading. It's back above a 128.98 entry, but it's one of the few stocks left standing in the group after a nasty sell-off in [software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/). Headed into Thursday, the group ranked a weak No. 137 in IBD's 197 industry group rankings, down from No. 27 six weeks ago.


Semiconductor stocks also outperformed Thursday, with VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) up 1.5%. The exchange traded fund reclaimed its 50-day line and is only 4% off its high.


Other solid movers included [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)). The maker of artificial heart valves bounced off its 50-day moving average with conviction, rising 3.6% in solid volume. **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) was another conviction gainer on Leaderboard Thursday, rising 2.3% in strong turnover.


In other news, **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) slipped in early after-hours trading after reporting [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/costco-earnings-q4-2019-due-costco-stock-in-buy-zone/). Headed into the report, it was holding above its 50-day moving average and a 284.41 buy point.

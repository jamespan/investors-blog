The stock market surged into the close Wednesday on rising coronavirus optimism, as U.S. Covid-19 cases topped 423,000. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the session with a 2.6% gain.




The S&P 500 advanced 3.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also ascended 3.4%, or 779 points. Leading growth stocks traded more in line with the Nasdaq: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) gained 2.2%. Volume on both main exchanges was sharply lower vs. Tuesday's session. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 led the way with a 4.6% rise.


Stock Market Rally Continues
----------------------------


With the new stock market rally nearly one week long (IBD [upgraded the outlook into a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) on April 2), investors should continue to look for top stocks breaking out past proper buy points. After Tuesday's mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq, the major stock indexes restrengthened Wednesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP040819-236x300.jpg)But discipline is still key. Don't plunge into the market all at once. Only deploy more capital if your portfolio is making progress. Many recent breakout stocks now show losses, including **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)). These three growth stocks are some of the best names in the stock market and if they can't make progress, then it's still time to remain cautious.

The coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the U.S., with confirmed cases topping 423,000, along with 14,000 deaths by Wednesday, according to [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) data tracker. But the pace of growth has slowed, creating optimism that the worst of the outbreak has passed. Meanwhile, global Covid-19 cases topped 1.5 million with over 87,000 deaths.

Top Stocks To Watch: AMD, Amazon, Microsoft
-------------------------------------------



Top stocks approaching new buy points in the current stock market rally include **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Chip leader Advanced Micro Devices is moving up the right side of a [cup base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) 59.37 buy point. Shares regained their 50-day moving average this week. AMD stock rallied 2.6% Wednesday.


With the stock still far from its old highs, be on the [lookout for a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) to offer a lower buy point.


Amazon stock gained 1.6% Wednesday, extending a win streak to three sessions. Shares of the FANG leader are about 7% away from a 2,186.05 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a cup-shaped base, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Look for a potential handle to provide a more risk-optimal buy point.


Microsoft stock rallied 1% Wednesday, as it tries to hold above its key 50-day line. The software giant is moving up the right side of a new cup base, sporting a 190.80 buy point. The stock's [RS line hit a new high](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) Monday and remains around that level. Microsoft [ranks No. 9](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) on the IBD 50 list.

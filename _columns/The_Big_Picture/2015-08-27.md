Stock Indexes Rally In Last Hour, Post Hefty Gains In Falling Volume

Stocks built a case for the bulls Thursday, but lower volume took away some of the conviction. The Nasdaq booked a 2.5% pop after seeing the gain fizzle to 0.5% in the late afternoon. The S&P 500 posted a 2.4% gain, also thanks to a last-hour surge.

  

The IBD 50 rose 2%. Volume fell on both major exchanges.

  

The late rally was encouraging, but higher volume would've made it more convincing. Overall, the action was not enough to change the market's condition.

  

The market remains in correction, and breakouts carry a high risk of failure. Holding any stock has higher risk, for that matter.

  

Economic news Thursday was mixed, but the headline event provided a surprise. The second take on Q2 GDP was much stronger than expected; it rose 3.7% vs. the Street's 3.2% estimate.

  

First-time jobless claims were roughly in line. Pending home sales for July, though, rose only 0.5% vs. estimates for 1%. The Kansas City Fed's manufacturing index was weaker than expected.

  

In this stormy climate, individual investors might want to take a look at various secondary factors and possibilities.

  

• **New lows**: Combined new lows hit 1,765 Monday, an astoundingly high number. They faded Thursday but remain a concern. New highs are scarce.

  

• **Percentage of NYSE stocks** above the 200-day line: The portion sank to 13% Tuesday, which bulls are hoping is the low. This too is extreme.

  

• **Big one-day gains**: The major indexes posted gains in the 4% neighborhood Wednesday. However, this isn't necessarily a good sign. History's biggest one-day gains have come in bear markets, not bull markets.

  

• **Distribution**: The major indexes began Thursday's session at a worst-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating. It could be constructive, though. Weak holders need to be flushed out, and many of the best follow-through days have come with the Acc/Dist at E.

  

• **Stock buybacks**: If companies resume share buybacks, they could make life tough on bears. Companies suspend buybacks during the five weeks before they report results. Q3 reports won't get busy until mid- to late October. The five-week factor means that firms might do some buying in early to mid-September.

  

• **News**: China's slowdown has been the big worry lately. But with consumer spending accounting for about 70% of the U.S. economy, don't count America out.

Stock Market Bulls Charge Late As Momentum Builds; These Groups Lead As Volatility Eases
=========================================================================================

The stock market moved higher once again as the bulls made a late charge. After two sessions of strong gains, Tuesday's more-modest gains could be considered constructive.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq enjoyed another positive day, closing up 0.7%. Indexes reversed higher, and the fact that they managed to avoid a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) so soon after [Monday's follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-positive-move-as-nasdaq-again-rallies-more-than-3-percent/) rally confirmation was positive.


The broader S&P 500 also impressed, rising 0.7%. The index is now closing in on the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), less than 2% from it.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day virtually neck-and-neck with the other indexes, with a 0.8% gain. It is near its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and 50-day line.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP020122-232x300.jpg)Monday's strong performance for tech stocks gave way to cyclicals Tuesday. A majority of the [S&P sectors moved higher,](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) with energy, materials and financials making the best gains. Technology turned in a slim gain, while real estate and utilities were the worst performers.


A key positive was another easing in volatility, with the Cboe Volatility Index dipping 11.2%. Breadth was also encouraging, with gainers outnumbering losers by nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE and Nasdaq.


Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note inched up a couple of basis points to 1.80%.


Oil closed up slightly, with West Texas Intermediate rising 0.3%. Energy has been running hot so far in 2022, with the Vanguard Energy Index Fund ETF ([VDE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDE)) up about 21%.


Small Caps, Growth Stocks Excel
-------------------------------


Small caps managed to leave the major indexes in the shade, as the Russell 2000 closed up 1.1%.



But it was growth stocks that managed to make the best strides for the day. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), a bellwether for growth stocks, rose 1.4%.


Nevertheless, a look at the fund's daily chart underlines how badly it has been beaten down. It currently sits well shy of its 50-day moving average, which itself has slumped below the 200-day line.


Investors will want to see the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) pick up some momentum, not to mention the index itself.


These Industry Groups Shine
---------------------------


It is always key to keep a close eye on the top-performing industry groups.


Coal stocks, airfreight names, oil and gas drillers and steel producers turned in the best gains Tuesday.


**Alpha Metallurgical Resources** ([AMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMR)) and **Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) were two of the top-performing coal names, rising 16.5% and 9.1%, respectively.


On the downside, newspapers, health care services, dairy products and water utilities struggled most.


UPS Stock Surges; This Name Eyes Entry
--------------------------------------


Breakouts were thin on the ground, which is disappointing. Many growth stocks remain mired in correction territory, leaving relatively few choices for investors.


**United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) stood out by surging into a buy zone following strong earnings. It remains actionable above a flat-base entry of 220.35. It gapped up in high volume [after posting record earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/ups-stock-ups-earnings-supply-chain-woes/). Higher shipping rates and e-commerce demand were key drivers.



It painted a bullish picture with strong 2022 guidance, while a 49% quarterly dividend hike to $1.52 a share was another positive.


UPS' overall performance is strong, but not ideal. This is reflected in its [IBD Composite Rating of 87 out of 99](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/).


**Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) also made a bullish move by surging toward a consolidation buy point of 24.71.


The Greek shipping company boasts strong earnings and market performance. It is also a member of the highflying Transportation-Ship industry group, ranked No. 7.


What To Do Now
--------------


With the market back in an uptrend, now is the time to be buying stocks again, but make sure to take a measured approach.


Given the market's volatile behavior so far in 2022, it's best to increase exposure gradually to help limit the extent of any snapback losses.

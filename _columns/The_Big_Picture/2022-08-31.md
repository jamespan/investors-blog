Stock Market Ends August On Sour Note; Will These 7 Stocks Lead In September?
==============================================================================

Judging by how the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) closed the month of August, it seems like investors are still quaking in their boots from last week's jolt from Jackson Hole.




On Friday, stocks got trampled by sellers after an eight-minute speech in Wyoming by the Federal Reserve's Jerome Powell shocked Wall Street. The central bank chief's sudden change in stance back to a highly hawkish tone on inflation and monetary policy sparked a big sell-off that session.


And since then, the market has yet to dig in its heels.


Tuesday's [JOLTS survey](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of July net job openings and labor turnover trumpeted a message to equity portfolio managers that the jobs market is still tight as a drum. This means wages overall could keep going up, keeping inflation gauges high for longer than previously thought. Meanwhile, Loretta Mester, head of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank, declared that the fed funds rate stands a very good chance of hitting 4%. That's a long cry from the 0%-0.25% target range seen during the Covid pandemic.


If achieved later this year, a 4% interest rate on overnight loans to large banks would mark the highest short-term cost of borrowing money since a 4.25% reading in December 2007.


Right now, the [CME's Fed Watch survey of futures activity](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) shows a 65% probability that the fed funds rate will reach 3.75%-4% by the Dec. 14 Fed meeting.


Indeed, Wall Street may be bracing for another surprise on Friday, when the August nonfarm payrolls report hits the wires. The July report highlighted a red-hot rate of net new hires; will last month's numbers also encourage the U.S. central bank to believe it's still behind the curve in taming inflation?


On Wednesday, the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yielded 3.13%, up 2 basis points.


Stock Market Today: Weak Summer Finish
--------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP083122_4-263x300.jpg)On Wednesday, the market never really broke wide-open in bearish fashion. However, early gains got drenched with selling. A cascade of end-of-month selling orders "hitting the bids" across the market led to a weak close — typical for a bear market rally. The Nasdaq, at one point up as much as 1.2%, slumped 0.6% lower by day's end. At 11,816, the composite index closed August with a 4.4% slide. That's quite a chunk of July's 12.3% rebound.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500, down nearly 0.8% on Wednesday, ended the month off 4.2%.


Notice on a daily chart how the large-cap benchmark closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time Tuesday since July 18. At 3955, the S&P 500 is clinging on to a 1.1% gain since the [June 24 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gains-pace-as-these-hopes-rise-casino-stocks-hit-the-jackpot/).


That's kind of like seeing the waiter switch your Maine lobster dinner plate to a small plate of popcorn shrimp.


Nasdaq volume expanded on the final trading day of the month. Trading jumping on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


This meant that both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 got knocked with the fifth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) in just nine sessions. Often times, such clustering of intense professional selling pinpoints the end of a tradable rally.


At least eight members of the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2 points or more, leading the blue chip gauge to an almost 0.9% slide. Small caps fared only a touch better; the Russell 2000 slid 0.6%. Crude oil futures slumped 3.1%.


Portfolio managers at Sadoff Investment Management of Milwaukee, Wis., wrote in their latest monthly market commentary that the central bank's rate hikes have been effective in helping the economy and inflation cool. For instance, gasoline futures, falling more than 4.3% on Wednesday to $2.42 a gallon, have plunged 44% from their June 6 peak.


Market Internals Softening Too
------------------------------


Meanwhile, the Economic Cycle Research Institute's highly watched index of leading economic indicators has dropped 10% in recent months. Plus, the Sadoff team notes, limp economic activity in Europe and a "rapidly softening" China economy underscore the fact that "inflationary pressures are quieting worldwide."


"So it was quite surprising that the Fed Chair has not acknowledged the dramatic continuing success against the forces of inflation," Bryan and Michael Sadoff wrote.


As the latest [Stocks On The Move table](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) shows, more stocks have been falling in heavy volume than those rising in above-average turnover. That's totally the opposite of what the bulls want to see.



New highs have shrunk a lot since last week. Remember, only when a stock is making new 52-week or all-time highs is the moment when all shareholders are happy. Plus, as seen by the likes of **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), fertilizer and clean hydrogen play **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) and **Photronics** ([PLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAB)), round trips of gains or sell-offs from [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) have been painful.


On another disappointing note, the breadth of advancing stocks vs. declining ones continues to deteriorate.


At the peak of the recent two-month rebound, the NYSE's advance-decline line, during the week of Aug. 15, climbed to a six-month high. During the same week, the S&P 500 rose to 4325, an impressive gain of almost 19%. Yet the A-D line has sloped lower since then.

Seven Stocks For September
--------------------------


Meanwhile, the Sadoff team notes that the latest stock market rebound has created this silver lining: More than 90% of issues in the S&P 500 jumped back above their respective 50-day moving averages.


So, why is this bullish? According to Sadoff Investment research covering the past 20 years, one year later the index has risen an average 17.3%. Only one time did the S&P 500 actually fall, a 3.2% dip.


"Even more impressive is when the percent of stocks in the S&P 500 above their 50-day moving average was below 15% and then within 50 days rose to above 90%," the Sadoff team wrote. "Since 1957, the S&P 500 rose an average of 22.6% a year later. In the previous 17 signals, there was never a decline one year later."


If this pattern continues, will growth stocks with [superior CAN SLIM characteristics](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) serve as the vanguard of a future bullish move?


IBD searched for excellent stocks via the [MarketSmith screen engine](https://marketsmith.investors.com/ms-platform/) that met these characteristics: EPS Rating and Relative Strength Rating of 90 or higher; An SMR grade of A; a Composite Rating of at least 80; year-over-year earnings growth of at least 40% in the latest quarter; and a return on equity of 30% or more. Just 22 issues made the cut.


Only seven of the 22 showed a market value of $15 billion or more. The median market cap was $6.9 billion, squarely in midcap territory.



Here are those seven names:


* **Envela** ([ELA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELA)): The low-priced AMEX name has found support near its 50-day line since clearing a 5.74 entry in June.
* **Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)): The nurse staffing firm is rebounding after trying to break out of a cup base in July.
* **Catalyst Pharmaceuticals** ([CPRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRX)): The ethical drug firm focuses on neuromuscular and neurological diseases. Shares are extended.
* **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)): Don't forget about the extra risk in overseas companies. The stock is basing.
* **World Wresting Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)): [IBD founder Bill O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) has said that every bull market features at least one great entertainment firm.
* **Southwestern Energy** ([SWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWN)): The fracking innovator was a huge winner during the 2000s commodities boom.
* **ON Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)): It's one of largest stocks making the screen with a $29 billion market value.

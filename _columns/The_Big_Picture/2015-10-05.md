With just one day after the S&P 500's bullish follow-through signal, Monday's action could be summed up as "pretty good so far" for the new uptrend. Energy and material stocks helped the S&P 500 to a 1.8% gain. The benchmark index has now climbed for five straight sessions, marking its longest win streak of the year.

  

The Nasdaq rallied 1.6% and has now erased nearly all losses from a six-day slide from late September. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.8%. In a sign that risk-taking is back on, the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 2.5%. The index had been largely lagging the Nasdaq's gains.

  

And the IBD 50 rallied 1.2%, with 42 names finishing higher.

  

Unlike last week's action, which was filled with lots of intraday price swings, stocks were strong out of the gate Monday and strengthened throughout the day, despite disappointing service-sector data.

  

Volume fell on both major exchanges from Friday's busy pace, a letdown. But market internals were strong. Winners trounced losers by more than 7-to-1 on the NYSE and by greater than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

  

Also, the pace of new 52-week lows slowed dramatically Monday. (See Page B1.) New lows had been in triple-digit territory for many sessions.

  

For growth investors, the freshly minted uptrend is providing buying opportunities. A number of leading stocks cleared bases Monday. **Verisk Analytics** ([VRSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRSK)), **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) and **Fleetmatics Group** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) were a few that broke out in hefty turnover.

  

Monday marked a good follow-up to Friday's rally confirmation, but it's tough to tell whether there's clear sailing ahead. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have potential resistance to deal with. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has to contend with its 50-day moving average, which acted as a wall back on Sept. 17. For the S&P 500, resistance lies at not only its own 50-day line but the 2000 price level as well.

  

While uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates has taken center stage lately, the stock market will have another risk to digest in the form of third-quarter earnings reports.

  

Top-notch profit growth is a key driver of stock prices. But corporate earnings in the S&P 500 are slated to fall 4.2% from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters. Reports have already started trickling in this week. A much larger number of companies will start reporting next week.

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 halted two-session slides Tuesday after the stock market got some Federal Reserve-friendly economic data.


After a bullish rally off lows Monday, the Nasdaq composite climbed back above its 50-day moving average and rose nearly 1.4%. But the index stopped short of reclaiming its 10-day line. The S&P 500 picked up 0.7% and retook the 6,000 level.




Sentiment was positive in technology stocks again after **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), a true stock market leader, reported bullish earnings and gave [strong revenue guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-pltr-stock-palantir-earnings-q42024/). Palantir soared more than 20% and was the top gainer in the Nasdaq 100. Other technology stocks moved well in the Nasdaq 100, including **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) as well as [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). Gains ranged from 2.5% to 4%.


But after the close, Alphabet slumped more than 6% after the company missed revenue estimates. Chip designer Arm reports Wednesday after the close. On Jan. 22, Arm broke out with conviction over a 164.16 buy point. But sellers quickly knocked the stock below the buy point. AppLovin is basing and less than 10% off its high ahead of next week's earnings report.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Friday's levels. Winners beat losers on the Nasdaq and NYSE by just over 2-to-1.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% after a nice test of its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) Monday. An earnings sell-off for **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) was offset by healthy gains for **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).

Apple recovered more than 2%. Last week's earnings report knocked the stock below its 50-day line after a brief move above it. Amazon is near the top of the 5% buy zone after clearing a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) last month with a 233 buy point.


The Russell 2000 jumped 1.4%. But the small-cap index is still below its 50-day line after getting turned away at that level last week.

Stocks strengthened and bond yields fell after the latest report on job openings came in much weaker than expected. The JOLTS report showed job openings of 7.6 million in December, well below the 8 million consensus estimate. November job openings were revised slightly higher to 8.156 million from 8.1 million. The 10-year yield traded as high as 4.57% before the JOLTS data came out, but then quickly turned lower. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 4.52%, down two basis points.


The job openings data comes ahead of Friday's employment report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up 158,000 in January, down from 256,000 in December. The Federal Reserve is still in a position where it wants to see job growth that's not too hot and not too cold. At the conclusion of last week's Fed meeting, Chair Jerome Powell noted some recent softness in the labor market, which should help the Fed in its fight to get inflation back near 2%.


According to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), futures traders expect the Fed to continue to pause at the March and May meetings. At one point Tuesday, there was a 64% chance that the next quarter-point rate cut would be at the June meeting.


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials are holding near highs in anticipation of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. That's when the economy slows, but not enough to knock it into a recession.


That said, it's still important to monitor [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) in the stock market. Headed into Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite showed eight distribution days, with five of those days showing declines of at least 0.9%. Of the S&P 500's five distribution days, three showed declines of at least 1.1%.


Despite some headwinds for the stock market, including President Donald Trump's tariff plans, the action in individual growth stocks has generally been strong.


IBD's invested percentage was lowered to 60%-80% last week. That means it's OK to take some gains in your big winners, while still maintaining adequate exposure to stocks. As always, keep losses small if a new buy doesn't work out.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) joined the breakout ranks and topped an entry at 378.48. But after six straight gains, the stock already looks stretched. A low-volume pullback could help keep the stock out of big trouble.

Retailer **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) followed through and gained another 1.6% after reversing higher above a 1,008.25 entry Monday. It's still well within the 5% buy zone.



Chip designer **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)), with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) of 98, jumped nearly 7% in heavy volume after reporting strong Q4 results. Adjusted profit increased 49% to 55 cents a share. Revenue rose 32% to $161.1 million. After clearing a 60.84 handle buy point in light turnover, Rambus closed just below an alternate handle entry of 65.07.


Meanwhile, several top-performing asset managers in IBD's investment management group lagged, weighed down by earnings declines for **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)) and **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)).


Apollo gave back nearly 3% and is trading below its 10-week line as it forms a nine-week consolidation. KKR swooned 8.5% and slumped below its 50-day line. After falling 2.4% Monday, the group slid another 0.5% Tuesday and triggered a [stop-loss sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from its 163.68 buy point.


Food distributors like **U.S. Foods** ([USFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USFD)) and **Performance Food Group** ([PFGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFGC)) are back near highs as they form bases. Names like these are a good way to diversify amid some whipsaw action in the technology sector.

Earlier this year, it looked as if 2016 might become the year of tobacco, soup, electric utilities and hogs.


Defensive plays such as cigarette giant **Reynolds American** ([RAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAI)), **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) and pork supplier **Hormel Foods** ([HRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRL)) seemed to move like superheroes, skirting widespread damage seen throughout the stock market in January to early February.


Wednesday's broad market rally seemed to blow another hole through that thesis.


The Nasdaq composite rose 1.5% on Wednesday, closing almost at session highs and pacing a solid rebound that began with Tuesday's nifty reversal. The Nasdaq's gain easily outmatched a 1% lift for the S&P 500. Volume grew on the Nasdaq but fell on the NYSE.


![MPa041316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MPa041316-3-177x300.jpg)The small- and midcaps also helped make Wednesday's rally extra special. The S&P MidCap 400 gained 1.7%; the S&P SmallCap 600 thrust 2.2% higher. That rally boosted the S&P 600's year-to-date gain to nearly 3.2%. Winners trounced losers nearly 3-to-1 on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The Nasdaq composite's rally was strong enough to zap the March 10 distribution day, cutting the total to four. Three of the remaining instances of heavy professional selling were in the 1%-plus range, clear evidence that equity trading desks up and down Wall Street have clearly raised cash in recent weeks. However, the improved climate for growth stocks trading near or at highs, plus the Nasdaq's ability on Wednesday to rise above its recent congestion area and post a new closing high for the year, makes a solid case for changing IBD's current outlook to "Uptrend resumes" from "Uptrend under pressure."


When the IBD outlook on the Feb. 5 edition downshifted into "Uptrend under pressure," the Nasdaq suffered another heavy sell-off the very next session, prompting a change to "Market in correction." In contrast, the "pressure" outlook lasted just three sessions after the latest change on April 7.


Surely, beaten-down stocks in various sectors -- from steel to health care to finance -- are rising sharply, helping to hoist the major indexes. But for the [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) enthusiast, the real piece of encouraging news has to be found in the fact that breakouts are beginning to produce better returns.


Buying at the breakout definitely entails higher risk. After all, you are venturing on a stock that is already near or at 52-week highs yet has the power to muscle higher. But that's what great stocks do. You can see examples within the IBD 50, [Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) (on Tuesdays) and [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), which now has 14 names, only one of which is a pure defensive play.


Optimism is nowhere near excessive levels. As seen in Wednesday's IBD, the put-call volume ratio, which accounts for options trading on all five key exchanges, has hovered over the 0.8 level for some time. A ratio below 0.6 would indicate a lack of bearishness among options speculators. Bearishness is good for stock market rallies, because it implies that some investors have not yet decided to deploy cash into stocks. The latest Investors Intelligence survey reports pundit bullishness at 41.2%, which is tame.

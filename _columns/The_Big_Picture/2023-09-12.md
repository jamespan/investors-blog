  Stock Market Fades Late Ahead Of Key Inflation Report; Software Stocks Slide After Oracle Earnings

The stock market weakened in afternoon trading Tuesday as a sluggish earnings report from **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) fueled more selling in the technology sector.




The Nasdaq composite was under pressure for most of the session as software stocks bore the brunt of the selling. The index fell 1% in higher volume, giving the Nasdaq another distribution day â€” its third in eight sessions. The Nasdaq closed below its 50-day moving average after reclaiming it just Monday. The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, gave back 1.1% and closed just above its 50-day line.


It was a sizable percentage decline for the Nasdaq, but breadth wasn't too bad, with declining stocks having a slight edge over advancers on the Nasdaq.


ORCL stock plummeted 13.5% as Wall Street frowned on [revenue that was mostly in line with expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oracle-stock-earnings-report-q1-2024/). Revenue guidance for the current quarter was also a bit soft.

Several software-related industry groups were among the day's worst performers. Oracle's database software group fell around 2%.


**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) slumped nearly 4% ahead of its earnings report due Thursday after the close. ADBE closed a hair below its 21-day exponential moving average.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 gave back 0.6% in higher volume, marking its third [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) in six sessions. Of those three days, though, the percentage declines ranged 0.3% to 0.6%. So it's not an index under heavy distribution at this point. Breadth was slightly negative on the NYSE as well.

But the stock market uptrend remains under pressure, with IBD's recommended invested percentage at 20% to 40%. Why such a cautious stance? For starters, the Nasdaq composite suffered a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) on Aug. 31, just two days after the follow-through day. That was a clue that the uptrend might not have staying power.


It's OK to have some exposure to stocks at this point because there's still a reasonable amount of healthy setups to consider. But a defensive posture still makes sense. Keep new buys on a tight leash and don't be afraid to cut stocks loose that aren't working.


Oil and gas related industry groups carried the leadership baton again. The drilling group was one of the day's best performers, rising around 3.5%. **Diamond Offshore** ([DO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DO)) was a standout performer, rising 4%. DO cleared a shallow consolidation with a 16.52 buy point.


Group peer **Helmerich & Payne** ([HP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HP)) rallied for the third time in four sessions. It closed just below a 45.46 entry. Six out of the day's 10 top performing groups hailed from the oil and gas sector.


In the oil machinery and equipment group, **NOV** ([NOV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOV)) has pulled back into buy range from a 20.98 handle buy point.


Uniform maker **Cintas** ([CTAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTAS)) gave an early buy signal Tuesday with a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) breakout.


Key Economic Data
-----------------


The stock market now turns its attention to some key economic reports. The Consumer Price index will be released Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. On a year-over-year basis, prices are expected to be up 3.6%, above July's reading of 3.2%. Core prices are seen increasing 4.4%, also above July's reading of 4.7%. The latest reading on wholesales prices will be out Thursday along with August retail sales.


The 10-year Treasury yield held near highs but didn't move much. The yield was trading around 4.26% just after the stock market close, down 2 basis points.

The [Federal Reserve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-is-heating-up-again-why-the-fed-will-stay-cool/) is widely expected to leave the federal funds rate unchanged at the Sept. 20 announcement. Another 25-basis-point hike is still in the cards before the end of the year, but odds are still better than 50% that the fed funds rate will be right where it is now at the end of the year.


Sellers Hit Apple
-----------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) got turned away near the 180 level for the third straight session after the company unveiled the iPhone 15 along with new AirPods and Apple Watch models. AAPL stock remains under distribution after a sharp break of its 50-day line last week.


With the stock market uptrend under pressure, recent breakouts have been a mixed bag at best. Just look at **Sprinklr** ([CXM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXM)) in the enterprise software group. The stock cleared a cup base last week, one day ahead of its earnings report. It followed through after earnings, but sellers quickly knocked the stock off highs. Shares are down 8% so far this week and below a 15.50 entry.



Other breakouts from the likes of **PDD** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) continue to work well. After a July breakout, Caterpillar is basing again.

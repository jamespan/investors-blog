The stock market raced higher Thursday, as investors awaited Friday morning's release of the pivotal June payrolls report. In a sign of an improving market, **Clearfield** ([CLFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLFD)), **Evolent Health** ([EVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVH)), [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Funko** ([FNKO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNKO)) and top biotech **Halozyme Therapeutics** ([HALO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HALO)) climbed into buy zones.




On the economic front, the Labor Department said first-time unemployment claims rose to 235,000, above estimates and ahead of the prior week's 231,000. Meanwhile, U.S.-based employers announced 32,517 job cuts in June, a 58.8% increase from the 20,476 cuts announced in the same month last year. It was 57% higher than the 20,712 cuts announced in May, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.


Those reports preface [Friday's U.S. jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/job-openings-fall-but-big-federal-reserve-rate-hike-still-on-tap-dow-jones-jobs-report/). The Econoday consensus estimate is for an increase of 270,000 jobs in June, a sharp drop from the 390,000 jobs added in May. The unemployment rate is the number to watch. After three months at 3.6%, a move higher might raise the odds of a soft landing, while a move lower will keep the Fed on guard for outsized wage gains. Economists expect another 3.6% reading for June.


The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 3%, rallying sharply for a second straight day. Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices rebounded nearly 4%, with West Texas Intermediate trading back at $102 a barrel after trading as low as $95 a barrel on Wednesday.

Stock Market Trend
------------------


After some struggles, the stock market uptrend received a boost Thursday, as the major indexes ended with strong gains. While the last few sessions should offer reason for some optimism, uncertainty over interest rates, inflation, economic growth and other factors should keep traders more on the conservative side.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP070722-237x300.jpg)Still, the Nasdaq moved further above its [21-day exponential line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which had been a resistance level since May. The next test for the Nasdaq will be the 50-day line, which the tech-heavy composite has traded under since early April. A decisive retake of that level would further increase investor confidence. Meanwhile, more and more actionable ideas across top-notch stocks would be another sign of a strengthening uptrend.


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq extended win streaks to four sessions, rising 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Another positive note: The Nasdaq's June 30 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) dropped off because of a 5% increase from that day's close. Finally, the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.4%. Volume dropped on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Top growth stocks ended squarely higher as well, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) advanced 1.5%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) soared nearly 15%. Solar stocks continue to perform well in today's market environment, which resulted in the Invesco Solar ETF ([TAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAN)) addition to [IBD SwingTrader.](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader)


Chip stocks received an early boost after [South Korea-based Samsung Electronics](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-stocks-called-oversold-rise-after-samsung-report/) reported better-than-feared earnings guidance for the second quarter. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) jumped 5.2% and 4.8%, respectively. Both former stock market leaders remain more than 50% from their 52-week high.

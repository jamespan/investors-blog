title: Nasdaq 100 Up, Small Caps Dip; Avoid This Trap In Growth Stocks

Sometimes, a tiny drop in an index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the Nasdaq composite just does not tell the real story. Tuesday felt like such a day in growth stocks.




After an 8.5% catapult higher from a near-term low of 7292 six days ago to Tuesday's intraday high, the Nasdaq surrendered all of 0.6 point, or down 0.01% for the day. The S&P 500 eased 1 point. The Dow Jones industrials? After rising more than 1,500 points since last week's low of 24,680, the blue chip index gave back 14 points.


The Nasdaq 100 rose almost 0.2%.


Volume edged roughly 3% to 4% higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the prior session. So, given that the index had at one point rallied 1.1% just minutes into the session but finished near the intraday low, Tuesday had the [strong smell of stalling action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/). But the Nasdaq did not officially meet the [textbook definition of stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), a rare and sometimes fuzzy type of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


Don't Fall Into This Trap
-------------------------

Even though a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-posts-big-gains-ushers-in-positive-signal/) just occurred, be choosy in what stocks to focus your hard-earned money. [Don't treat every base as equal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Given that numerous stocks have already staged hefty gains since the prior [follow-though](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) that took place on the S&P 500 on Jan. 4, be wary of those that have moved into [later-stage base territory](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/).


Also, avoid stocks that show [wide and loose action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/too-much-distribution-in-a-base-can-hurt-a-breakouts-chances/), usually the product of unusually strong institutional selling.


The weekly price action by former big cap leader **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) in the first six months of 2018 offers a textbook example of sloppy base building. The China search engine titan remains a laggard on Wall Street; Stock Checkup shows a lowly [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 6.


Over the past 15 months, **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) has shown quite a few plunges in price in intense turnover. Not good for growth stock hunters. But lately, the weekly price action has grown tighter, a positive. The Monster energy drink maker now ranks [No. 32 in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


Monster also owns a spot in [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).



More recently, **Guidewire Software** ([GWRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWRE)) showed no fewer than six weeks in which the stock swung more than 10% from intraweek low to intraweek high — and that was just on the left side of its seven-month [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/)! Guidewire glided past a 104.87 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in its narrow handle (add 10 cents to the handle's high during the week ended April 19 to get the correct buy point), but managed only a 4% advance before rolling over.


Guidewire made the down-in-price list of the Weekly Stocks On The Move table, found on page B2 of the latest IBD Weekly print newspaper. The expert in cloud-based insurance billings and claims management now shows a 97 Composite Rating on [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-guidewire-software-inc-gwre.aspx), but the Relative Strength Rating has fallen to 75 on a scale of 1 (wretched) to 99 (wondrous). Four weeks ago, the RS stood at 90.


Small Caps Lag
--------------


The Russell 2000 fell 0.3%, while crude oil edged up nearly 0.4%, gold up 0.1%. Clearly, concerns linger over how the spate of White House-led tariffs on goods from China will impact the economy.


The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond still shows a yield that has sunk below 3-month T-bills (2.15% vs. 2.27%). But 30-year Treasurys, ending the day unchanged at 2.62%, still help lend some relief to banks that make their living based on the spread between short and long-term interest rates.


Stingy declines after powerful gains are an ideal scenario, especially when we're in the early innings of a potential new market rally after Friday's Day 4 follow-through by the Nasdaq composite.


So, at least for some readers, why did the session perhaps sting a lot more than what the major indexes suggested?


One need to look only at the software sector, a longtime leader since the start of 2019.


The Pause That Refreshes, Or Worse?
-----------------------------------


One of the darlings of the bull run in recent years, IBD Sector Leader **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), got beaten down hard for the second straight day. Shares fell nearly 3.7%. Volume grew just 18% above average. The day's action by itself does not constitute a defensive sell signal. Last week's reversal? Stunningly good. Plus, shares in the human capital management expert are trading just 7% off a new all-time high. The 10-week moving average has acted like a floor of institutional buying support.


The problem, then? Paycom did not fall alone.


Looking at IBD's [daily monitoring of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-11-2019/), Tuesday saw a more than 2% slide in both the enterprise software (ranked No. 3) and database software (No. 47) groups on a price-weighted basis. Specialty enterprise (ranked No. 16) fell 1.4%, financial software (No. 14) 1.2%.


**Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) and **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) recently joined [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and hail from the software sector. On Tuesday, they joined Leaders List name **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) with losses of 3% or more. Upland swung below a 50.74 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a rare [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/). Volume more than doubled usual levels, but was lower than Monday's big blast up.


A popular ETF, iShares Expanded Tech Software ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)), gave up 1.2%. That drop proved big enough to drag the ETF back underneath its 50-day moving average.


So, was Tuesday's heavy selling in this area of the market a one-off deal? Or a sign that the big money on Wall Street is taking profits heavily?


One way to answer that question: Watch how other sectors do.


Will These Laggard Sectors Turn Around?
---------------------------------------



For a long time, the banking sector has shown dismal performance. Headed into Tuesday's session, S&Ls ranked a lowly [31st out of 33 broad industry sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jun-10-2019/) in terms of mid- to long-term price performance. Banks held the bottom rank and showed a year-to-date gain of 4.8%. After Tuesday's trade, the two edged up a notch in the [IBD stock tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jun-11-2019/). Computer fell to dead last at No. 33.


Yet **Synchrony Financial** ([SYF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYF)) also bucked the day's micro-drop. The expert in private label credit cards has straddled its 50-day line for a few weeks now. Yet the big cap shows handsome gains both for the quarter (up 6.6%) and the year (up 45%). Synchrony has formed a [mammoth-sized cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/), offering a 35.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The annualized dividend yield for Synchrony of 2.5% blasts the S&P 500 at 1.9%.


Another Sector To Watch In Growth Stocks
----------------------------------------


Will retail also regain more leadership status? Here again, watching the true market leaders will help you answer that question.



**Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and a few other brick and mortar chains have certainly paused in their current run-ups. But they also continue to act well. Two of the three above firms show wild success in e-commerce as well.


Lululemon reports fiscal Q1 results after the close Wednesday. Read more about what to expect in the latest [Investing Action Plan](https://www.investors.com/category/research/investing-action-plan/).


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) also showcased some more bleeding in high growth stocks with a loss of slightly more than 1%.

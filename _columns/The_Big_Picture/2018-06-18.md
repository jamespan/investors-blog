Lingering trade-war fears carried over to the stock market early Monday, but it ended up being a pretty good session for the bulls. Selling was concentrated mostly in blue-chip stocks, while the Nasdaq composite significantly pared an intraday loss of more than 1%. Small caps outperformed nicely.




**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, along with FANG names **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). Software companies **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) and **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) also ended with solid gains.


The Nasdaq composite rose fractionally, ending near the top of its intraday range. The S&P 500 eased 0.2%, while the Dow extended its losing streak to five sessions, falling 0.4%. Small caps outperformed as the Russell 2000 rose 0.5%. The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) added 0.2%, helped by a 6% rise in **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)). The apparel firm followed through after Friday's earnings-inspired gap-up.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MP061818-231x300.jpg)Volume on the Nasdaq came in lower than Friday's levels and was indicated lower on the NYSE. But turnover was very heavy Friday due to options and futures expiration.


Tesla gained ground for the eighth time in nine sessions, rising 3.5% to 370.83. Over the weekend, CEO Elon Musk tweeted that short sellers of Tesla stock have "about three weeks before their short position explodes." That's around the time the company will release Q2 production numbers, including Model 3 deliveries. Tesla is only 4% from its all-time high of 389.61.


Blue-Chip Stocks Take Heat
--------------------------


Eight blue-chip stocks in the Dow fell 1% or more. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) took the hardest hit, falling 3.4%. The chipmaker slumped below the 50-day moving average after Northland Securities downgraded the chip giant to underperform from market perform.


Headed into Friday, the bears liked the look of six [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in the S&P 500. History shows that an elevated distribution-day count like this has preceded plenty of market pullbacks in the past.


But the bulls have a lot to like, including a light distribution-day count for the Nasdaq as well as the overall strong price action in many leading growth stocks. With little in the way of technical breakdowns among top-performing growth stocks, the market remains in a confirmed uptrend.


Dow Nears Test Of 50-Day Line
-----------------------------


After five straight declines, the Dow Jones industrial average is close to a test of the 50-day moving average, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite are still comfortably above the key support level.


Among the day's movers, **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) gapped out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/), rising more than 6% to 220.44. It's set to join the S&P 500 early Wednesday, replacing Time Warner, which just completed its merger with **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)).


Meanwhile, you'd think news of a $550 million investment by Google would've been good news for China-based **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)). It was a for a while, as shares rose more than 3% early in the session. But JD.com ended near its session low, up only 0.4%.


Dropbox Shows No Quit
---------------------


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) continued its torrid ascent after breaking out of an IPO base last week. Shares rose 6% to 42 after soaring 32% last week. It's well-extended from a 34.93 buy point.


**Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) bounced back after Friday's gap-down. Shares rose 1.5% in heavy volume. It's still near highs on the heels of its earnings report last week. Adobe remains well-extended in price after a big run-up. Its last breakout from a proper base was all the way back in January. It's been riding its 50-day moving average higher ever since.

Micron Firms Up Ahead Of Results
--------------------------------


**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) ended a four-session slide, rising 0.4%, ahead of its [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/micron-technology-shares-pressured/) Wednesday after the close. It's been a mild pullback so far after a short-lived breakout over a 63.52 buy point. Keep in mind that Micron's latest breakout attempt was from a [later-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/) after a big move already.



[Oil and gas stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) outperformed ahead of Friday's OPEC meeting. U.S. crude oil futures fell for the fourth straight week last week on expectations that OPEC will hike output. Russia reportedly wants a big increase, while Iran thinks no change is needed. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark U.S. crude oil futures were trading around $65.79 a barrel, up 1.1%.

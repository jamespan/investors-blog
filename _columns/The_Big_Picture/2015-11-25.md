Key stock indexes made piecemeal moves in thin trade Wednesday. But beneath the hood, the action was surprisingly bullish ahead of Thanksgiving.


The Nasdaq composite pushed up less than 0.3%. The S&P 500 drifted within a tight trading range before finishing down less than a point. Volume fell sharply on both main exchanges.


Small-cap stock traders were far more peppy.


The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.6%, good for a fourth straight gain. The Russell 2000 rose 0.8%.


![MP112715](http://ibdcmsprod10/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MP112715.jpg)Due to the past several days of catch-up-style buying, small caps are now mildly outperforming large caps, at least from the prism of the S&P indexes. The 600 improved its year-to-date gain to nearly 1.8%, vs. 1.5% for the 500.


That's indeed a tiny difference. However, the subtle significance for CAN SLIM-style investors lies in the fact that when small caps rally, large institutions are essentially more comfortable taking on market risk.


View the Market Pulse today, and you can quickly spot healthy action among small caps that have broken out.


**Blackhawk Network** ([HAWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAWK)), a former Sector Leader, gapped up Wednesday morning and rose 2.5% to new highs and almost 5% past a 45.88 cup-with-handle entry in heavy trading. The gift card supplier shows an RS line vaulting into new high ground. Earnings per share have grown on average 105% over the past six quarters.


Blackhawk's market cap is $2.6 billion. **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)) is valued at $3.5 billion. **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), a relative newcomer to the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/), weighs in at $2.4 billion. The organic LED maker is approaching a potential 55.93 entry fast.


Pay attention to the "Leaders down in volume" portion of the Market Pulse as well. In a poor market, sell signals have likely emerged. But in a solidly uptrending one, new entry points may pop up. Chinese wealth manager **Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)) (96 Composite Rating) fell 1.6% to 32.28 in heavy trade. Yet the action did not at all harm the stock's current work on a new cup base.


Other market indicators show that the current stock action remains healthy. In Wednesday's paper, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 showed an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C, a neutral grade. (Track it at the top left corner of each graph on Page B2.) That's up from Nasdaq's E and the S&P 500's D- on Oct. 2.


Winners beat losers nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq Wednesday and 3-to-2 on the NYSE.

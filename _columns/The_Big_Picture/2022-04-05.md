The stock marked ended firmly in the red Tuesday as Wall Street got another reminder that the Federal Reserve is intent on fighting inflation aggressively with interest rate hikes and balance sheet reduction.




The Nasdaq composite fared the worst in the stock market today, down 2.3%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index fell mostly in-line with the Nasdaq, down 2.4%.


Preliminary data showed higher volume on the Nasdaq, giving the index its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) since the March 18 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/). Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by 3-to-1.


Preliminary data also showed a distribution day for the S&P 500, which fell 1.3% in higher volume. It was the index's second distribution day since the March 16 follow-through day. Losers topped winners on the NYSE by nearly 7-to-1.

Even with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq still in confirmed uptrends along with a light distribution day count, it's a challenging environment for growth investors. With growth screens not yielding much in the way of prospects, it's OK to look for bullish charts in other sectors; just make sure you're not chasing performance and buying extended stocks. Keep new purchases small and don't be afraid to cut losses short if a trade doesn't go as planned.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8%, but **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) bucked the trend, up 1.5%. It's tracked in the managed-care group, which is home to other top-performing stocks like **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)).


IBD's managed care group was among the top-10 performers in IBD's 197 industry group rankings. Three utility-related groups also found their way into the top-10 performing groups.


Selling picked up the pace in the Nasdaq after Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, widely regarded as one of the more dovish Fed members, said she expects rapid reductions to the Fed's bloated balance sheet starting as early as May. Brainard's comments came ahead of the release of the minutes from last month's Fed meeting. They'll be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.



The Fed's balance sheet currently holds about $9 trillion in bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Selling off these holdings will put upward pressure on interest rates, along with increases to the federal funds rate, the Fed's key lending rate. As it stands now, fed funds futures traders think there's a pretty good chance of a half-point hike at the May meeting and another one at the June meeting.

The hawkish comments from Brainard fueled a big spike in the 10-year Treasury yield, which has inverted with the two-year yield in recent days. Just after the market close, the 2-year yield was trading around 2.53%, up 10 basis points. The 10-year yield was up 14 basis points to 2.55%. Clearly, the bond market is worried about a slowdown for the U.S. economy. The question is: how much of a slowdown?


Semiconductor Stocks Take Heat
------------------------------


The Nasdaq is currently waging a battle near its 10-day moving average. If support doesn't hold here, a trip to the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) could be in the cards. The Nasdaq's 21-day line sits pretty close to the 14,000 level, so it's a logical support level to watch.


After a brief stay above its 200-day line, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) slumped 4% in heavy volume. Chip stocks dominated the downside in the Nasdaq 100, with names like **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) all down around 6%.


Top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included **Automatic Data Processing** ([ADP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADP)), which is forming a nice cup base. Group peer **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)) ended nearly flat. It's trying to clear a cup base after a bullish earnings report last week.



But it wasn't just technology stocks that got hit Tuesday. Leading mining stocks like **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) and **Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) ended with losses of nearly 4%, but both stocks continue to hold above short-term support levels.

Leading coal stocks reversed hard after early strength. Coal stocks got a lift early Tuesday after the European Union proposed a ban on Russian coal, but a 7.5% intraday gain for **Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) faded to a loss of 1.1%.


And market-leading shipping stocks fell hard, fueling a 5% drop for the group. **Zim Integrated Shipping**'s ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) plunged 8% in heavy volume. ZIM stock is down more than 13% for the week as it makes another test of its 10-week moving average.

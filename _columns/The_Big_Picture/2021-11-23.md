As households across the United States began deciding what to place inside their roasted birds for Thanksgiving, some investors stuffed their coffers with profits from certain tech stock leaders for a second straight day. And yet on Tuesday, the Nasdaq showed a little more fortitude.




Compared with Monday's 1.3% slap-down, the composite index lifted off its intraday low to trim losses to 0.5%. Volume remained heavy, signaling intense profit taking by mutual funds, banks, hedge funds, pension plans and the like.


Nasdaq turnover declined slightly. Thus, the index avoided a second straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/).


And the careful IBD reader would not be surprised, given that the premier index for growth stocks had just scored one of its biggest rallies of the year.


Some Nasdaq Stocks Drown In Sellers
-----------------------------------


One need only look at the damage seen in enterprise software firms including **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)) — a longtime stalwart member of the IBD 50 — **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) lately to understand how quickly top growth stocks can surrender gains.



All five stocks have crossed below their key [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), a sign of sudden weakness and a potential sign of a serious change in character.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP112321-251x300.jpg)Atlassian acted marvelously since it jumped out of a 4-1/2-month [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) at 262.50 in June. Gains reached 84% in the space of just four months before shares produced what in obvious hindsight appears to be an exhaustion gap on Oct. 29.


An exhaustion gap is one form of [climactic action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/).


With [support at the 21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and a still big cushion above its still-rising 50-day moving average, the Nasdaq still looks healthy. At 15,775, the index is certainly feeling some bumps on its head as it tries to crack the 16,000 price ceiling. But the distribution count remains on the low side, as seen in the Market Pulse; and the Nasdaq stands a mere 2.7% beneath a new all-time peak of 16,212.


Meanwhile, other indexes revealed enough brawn to curry early losses into small gains.


Outside The Nasdaq: Bullish Business As Usual
---------------------------------------------


While the S&P 500 edged up 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average pumped nearly 0.6% higher. The Dow's financial, cyclical and health care components did the heavy lifting. The Russell 2000 failed to reverse higher but trimmed an early drop of 1.2% to a decline of less than 0.2% at the close.


Small and medium-sized banks enjoyed healthy gains as institutions took more profits in the long-dated side of the U.S. Treasury bond market. As the benchmark 10-year note jumped 4 basis points to 1.66% on the Cboe, a four-week high, SPDR S&P Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) rallied 1.6% to notch a new all-time closing high. KRE is up 45% year to date.


Watch to see if financial, industrial and commodity companies can retake the baton again from their tech peers to help sustain the current uptrend, confirmed with a Day 8 follow-through by the Nasdaq on Oct. 14.


The Fed And Bitcoin
-------------------


It looks like 2021 will stand out as an outstanding year for lenders as the U.S. economy continues to recover and the Federal Reserve begins to dismantle "QE," or quantitative easing.


As messaged last month, the U.S. central bank began reducing its $120 billion in monthly purchases of U.S. Treasurys and mortgage-backed agency debt securities in November by a total of $15 billion. It will do the same in December. The strength of the economy at that point will help the Fed determine whether to accelerate its reduction in the early months of 2022.


Bitcoin got a selling reprieve, gaining 2.6% over the past 24 hours as of 5 p.m. ET to $57,706. Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ([BITO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITO)) ETF bounced 3.7%. At 37.01, it still lies nearly 17% below its 44.29 peak. **Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)), which debuted on the Nasdaq at $250 in April, is trying to flesh out a new base. Shares rose just 0.6% after getting throttled for a 5.1% loss Monday.


William Je, a London-based veteran banker and CEO of Hamilton Investment Management, notes Bitcoin and other digital currencies are gaining popularity among high-net-worth investors in China. The reasons: Like paper currencies such as the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin and other blockchain-based currencies are easily transferable; they are secure; and they offer their owners privacy.


"The takeup rate in Bitcoin today is very similar to the takeup rate of the internet 20 years ago," Je told IBD in a video interview on Microsoft Teams. "With equities, you have dividends as a return. In bonds, you get the coupon. For Bitcoin, the value comes from the expanding network effect and the verification of data. At the end of the day, it's all about trust. And more and more people are trusting the use of Bitcoin."


Based on his company's analysis and communication within his professional network, Je believes China is currently the largest holder of Bitcoin.


China Equities: Still Lagging
-----------------------------


Wealthy Chinese investors likely are not too happy about their mainland China equity investments.


The iShares China Large Cap ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) exchange traded fund sank 0.5% on Tuesday to expand its year-to-date loss to 14.2%. X Harvest CSI 300 China ([ASHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASHR)) finished virtually flat and is down 3% since Jan. 1. ASHR shows a lowly 31 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/).

title: Stock Market Gets Wet With Selling; Fear Lifts These Investor Sentiment Gauges

The "Sell in May, go away" saying evidently did not hold water for growth stocks this year. The stock market proceeded to make all-time highs into the summer.




So, should investors take cover from a developing "September storm" of selling?


That question may be on every reader's mind, especially after Monday's sharp sell-off. And a strong rebound in the final 45 minutes of trading seemed to make the overall picture a lot cloudier.


Spurred by a 3% thrashing of stocks in the Hang Seng benchmark in Hong Kong, U.S. stocks took the cue that the potential collapse of China's real estate giant Evergrande served as a reason to take profits. The S&P 500 gapped lower at the open. After a brief spell of buying, the index resumed its sell-off. It sank as much as 2.9%. Yet the late-hour drive of buyers cut the day's loss to 1.7%.

Still, that loss was no doubt the worst during the current quarter. And it marked the biggest one-day drop since a 2.1% drubbing on May 12.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP092021-217x300.jpg)Other indexes behaved the same. The Nasdaq composite, off as much as 3.4%, ended down 2.2%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) backtracked 2.7% for its fourth decline of 1% or more in less than three weeks. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund slid 2.3% as the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.8%.


So, for at least a short while on Monday, many of these stock market indexes had the look of a [vertical violation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/).


Were utilities a safe haven on Monday? Nope.


SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) fell 0.9%, good for its eighth straight drop. The ETF came closer to [testing its 200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


Gold rallied some. SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)), up 0.7%, snapped a vicious three-day selling streak. Long-dated U.S. government bonds also rallied, sending the cost of money down. According to Cboe data, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note edged 2 basis points lower to 1.30%. (See the chart on [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) by typing in zero-TNX.)


U.S. Treasury data shows the 10-year bond yield sinking 6 basis points to 1.31%, even with its level on Sept. 1.


Stock Market Today: Damage Continues
------------------------------------



Volume fell on both major exchanges. So, technically, Monday's action did not add a [fresh distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). However, the action featured multiple elements of damage to both the general market and leading stocks.


Consider, first, how now virtually all of the major stock market indexes have slumped below their 50-day moving averages. In a healthy market, that's a no-no. In a confirmed uptrend, you want to see the key averages rising above their 50-day lines, leading them higher.


Instead, the [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) of the Dow, Russell 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400 have all flat-lined for weeks to months. The Nasdaq's and S&P 500's 50-day lines, meanwhile, continue to climb presently.


This turn perhaps came as no surprise for daily readers of this column.


[Just on Friday, IBD's market outlook got downgraded](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/sp500-closes-below-key-support-level-apple-stock-sells-off-sharply/) to "uptrend under pressure" from "confirmed uptrend" after leading stocks showed another day of greasy activity. Plus, the S&P 500 closed beneath its 50-day line for the first time in three months.


At one point Monday, the S&P 500 showed its first 5% pullback from an all-time high this year.

No wonder, then, that some investor sentiment gauges showed a clear rise in fear.


[The put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) rose to 0.88 — easily the highest level so far in 2021. This means for every 100 bullish calls traded on Monday across the nation's options exchanges, 88 bearish puts changed hands.


The Cboe Market Volatility Index, also updated in [IBD's Psychological Market Indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) section, rose 20% and intraday got as high as 28.79. That marked the highest level since 28.93 on May 13.


Watch for an update to the weekly Investor Intelligence survey on Wednesday. Last week, bullishness among newsletter editors dipped to 50% — down sharply from a recent peak of 61.2% on July 16.


Inside The IBD 50
-----------------


Monday's selling carnage within [the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10) intensified vs. prior weeks.


The median drop within this list of outstanding stocks: almost 2.2%.



Perhaps **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), the maker of innovative drinks that the company says burn fat, offers a new example of how selling can get tricky.


First, check out the move from a Nov. 12, 2020, breakout from a nearly three-month base. Gains were strong at the get-go, and the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) never got touched by the stock until Jan. 27 this year.


That's a full 10 weeks' worth of run-up without a test of this important technical support level. Celsius' gains reached as much as 189% from a 24.44 early entry within that base.


Slippery Gains Lately
---------------------


On Aug. 31, Celsius flashed another breakout. Shares rolled past an 80.10 entry in another odd-looking base. Clearly, gains have not been as hot. And on Friday, Day 13 of the new rally, the stock briefly hit the 20%-25% profit zone, then reversed sharply.


In short, CELH has quickly turned from a play in which a 20% profit looked like a sure thing to a stock that on Monday nearly gave back nearly two-thirds of that paper gain.


Only six companies within the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10) defied Monday's sell-off with gains: **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)), sofa maker **Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)), **Gartner** ([IT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IT)), enterprise software group leader **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)), cannabis play **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) and **Inspire Medical Systems** ([INSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSP)).

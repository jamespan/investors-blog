The Nasdaq composite on Wednesday marked the first day of distribution since the stock market went back into a confirmed uptrend last Thursday.


The "distribution" was technically as mild as you can get.


The Nasdaq rose less than 0.1%. Volume crawled higher. Yet because the Nasdaq finished in the lower half of the day's trading range and met other criteria, Wednesday was a stalling day, a subtle form of distribution.


One stalling day hardly means the market is suffering a flood of institutional selling. In fact, Wednesday's session also showed decent gains by biotech, leisure product and telecom stocks. (See the Industry Groups table at the bottom of Page B2.)


The S&P 500 edged less than 0.1% lower as NYSE turnover cooled. This index has yet to see a day of unequivocally heavy selling by the professionals.


Few of the market's true leaders saw serious trouble on their stock charts. The Leaders down in volume portion of today's Market Pulse table shows few names are making the list.


The small-cap S&P 600 and the IBD 50 both rose nearly 0.1%.


Stocks wiped away trifling losses after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its April 28-29 policy meeting at 2 p.m. ET. But the rally sputtered.


Observers concluded from the minutes that the U.S. central bank will not hike interest rates at the June 16-17 meeting.


The market remains in decent shape. Pullbacks after a follow-through on Oct. 21 have been mild.


Many stocks in the IBD 50 are in solid uptrends. Medicals and techs continue to dominate the upper half of the list.


The Dow transports, best used as a sector index, collapsed nearly 2% after airline stocks dropped hard. **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) and **Spirit Air** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) led the decline.


While Wall Street is concerned over expanding seat capacity at major U.S. airlines, one should not forget just how big a run these stocks have had.


A weekly chart of Southwest shows that back in the week ended Dec. 14, 2012, it ended a long downtrend with a breakout past a 9.92 flat-base buy point.


Southwest carved out numerous bases en route to a 376% ramp-up to the recent high of 47.17. From January to March of this year, the stock failed to complete a late-stage base.


Southwest was added to [Leaderboard Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/) as a short sale candidate near 42-43 on April 15. On Wednesday, it fell 9% to 37.19.

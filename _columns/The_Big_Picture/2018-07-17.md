  Netflix, Major Stock Indexes Resilient Amid Powell Testimony

What a difference a day makes. Late Monday, a weak earnings report from **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) fueled a 13% decline for the stock in after-hours trading. The weakness carried over into Tuesday's session as the Nasdaq 100 slumped 0.9% early. But Netflix, the Nasdaq 100 and the major stock indexes turned in resilient performances by the close. Chalk up a win for the bulls.




Inside the Dow, an earnings-inspired gap down for shares of **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) didn't look good at the open, but it ended up being a solid test of support. Shares fell 2.6%, but the stock ended firmly above the 50-day moving average.


The Nasdaq 100 ended with gain of 0.6%, good for an all-time closing high, while a 0.7% intraday loss for the Nasdaq composite morphed into a gain of 0.6%, also good for an all-time closing high. The S&P 500 added 0.4% and the Dow Jones picked up 0.2%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Monday's levels.

The Nasdaq's [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count might seem elevated at five, but three of those days showed tiny declines of 0.3%. The S&P 500 shows three distribution days, with two declines of 0.4%. So it's not a market under meaningful distribution. This is also the case with leading growth stocks. Most charts are holding up just fine.


The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed nicely, up 1.1%, helped by strong showings from **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) and **TechTarget** ([TTGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTGT)), among others. Headed into Tuesday, the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index was up 17% year-to-date, compared to a 4.7% gain for the S&P 500.


Netflix, Amazon Pares Losses
----------------------------


After plunging 14% early, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name Netflix recovered impressively. Shares lost 5%, but the stock ended near its session high and firmly above the 50-day moving average.


Besides Netflix, another FANG stock made headlines. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) reversed higher and notched an all-time closing high after the company said its [Prime Day sales event](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-prime-day-sales-glitch/) is outpacing last year's numbers. Coresight Research predicted sales of at least $3.4 billion.


Amazon's strong performance showed that the bulls are still in control. And even though Netflix ended lower, big buyers were clearly influential in lifting the stock off session lows.


Powell Addresses Congress
-------------------------


The Federal Reserve was also in the headlines as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appeared on Capitol Hill to start two days of congressional testimony. He acknowledged a strengthening economy and stable inflation and said the central bank is on track for gradual rate hikes. The market seemed to like a still-dovish tone as the Fed takes a flattening yield curve in stride.


The incessant talk of a flattening yield curve leading to an inverted yield and possibly a recession could actually be good news for the bulls. When the crowd slants one way in the market, the opposite usually happens, so a recession might not be in the cards. According to Bloomberg, [a survey of fund managers earlier this month](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-17/treasury-yield-curve-is-heading-for-inversion-fund-managers-say) by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that investors' expectations for a steepening yield curve sank to the lowest level in more than seven years.


The Fed has hiked interest rates two times this year and expects two more before the end of the year. Futures traders have pretty much baked in another quarter-point hike at the September meeting. But a rake hike in December isn't as clear. Traders see a 56% chance of another rate hike at the December meeting.


Online Brokers On Move
----------------------


**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) was an earnings winner, up 3.5%. The stock gapped above the 200-day moving average, but it hasn't broken out of a downtrend yet. That will happen if Schwab can get above its 50-day moving average, currently around 55.50. Group peer **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) added more than 1% in Tuesday's after-hours session as investors digested its [Q2 report](https://www.investors.com/news/charles-schwab-stock-interactive-brokers-earnings/).


Other gainers included **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)). It cleared a double-bottom base with an 80.80 buy point. Shares rose 3.7%. Volume rose from Monday but was below average. Fellow enterprise software name **Mindbody** ([MB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MB)) also broke out, clearing a 43.45 entry in strong turnover.

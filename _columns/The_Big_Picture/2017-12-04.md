For a good portion of Monday's session, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small-cap index showed solid gains, but the three indexes looked a lot different by the close.




 The Nasdaq composite, well, it picked up where it left off last week, with more selling in leading growth stocks. Money flowed into financial, retail and transportation stocks Monday, although gains in several financials faded by the close.


The Nasdaq rose nearly 0.8% early, but quickly erased gains as selling picked up in semiconductor and other technology stocks again. It ended with a loss of 1.1%. After slumping nearly 6% last week, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index gave back another 2.5% Monday.


The Dow gained 0.2%, giving back a good chunk of a 1.25% intraday gain. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) was a bright spot, rising nearly 5%. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that Disney is in talks again with **Twenty-First Century Fox** ([FOXA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXA)) about a possible deal for some of Fox's assets. Other solid gainers in the Dow included **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), with gains of around 2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MP_new_120417-157x300.png)The S&P 500 lost 0.1% and the Russell 2000 gave back 0.3%. Volume on the Nasdaq rose from Friday's level, giving the index its fifth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). Today's Market Pulse shows no shortage of leading stocks down in heavy volume. Volume on the NYSE came in slightly higher than Friday.


There are still i's to dot and t's to cross, but the U.S. Senate passed the GOP tax bill, which had Wall Street in a good mood in early trading. So did news of merger between **CVS** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) and **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)), in which [CVS agreed to acquire the health insurer](https://www.investors.com/news/cvs-aetna-deal-approval-may-hinge-on-trump-antitrust-approach/) for $67.5 billion, or $207 a share. Shares of Aetna closed Monday at 178.70, down 1.4% and well below the offer price, leading some to believe that regulatory approval might not be a slam dunk.


Wall Street sure isn't short on positive sentiment these days, perhaps even more so now that tax reform has cleared some significant hurdles. While the debate will continue about the impact it will have on lower, middle and upper class earners, lower tax rates for publicly traded firms is what has Wall Street the most excited.


A couple of little-known retail names rose in heavy volume. **At Home** ([HOME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOME)) rose for the fifth straight session in fast turnover, although it closed well off session highs. Shares gained 0.5% to 28.39 after breaking out last week over a buy point at 26.50. **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)), meanwhile, jumped 6% to 43.99. It's working on the right side of an undefined base.


In the airline group, [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) picked up 3.5% to 62.03. It's just above a 58.99 entry, but the well-run airline still has its all-time high of 64.39 to conquer.


Among regional banks, **Huntington Bancshares** ([HBAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HBAN)) gained 1.8% to 14.70. It still looks to be in the early stages of breaking out of long consolidation that started in March.


There's no need to try to predict where the stock market is going from here. While it's important to recognize the yellow flags that are out there, it's more important to learn how to recognize unequivocal sell signals when they arise, whether it's in the major stock indexes or individual stocks.


In this vein, things still look OK — but not great. The bear camp is certainly watching recent heavy-volume declines in the semiconductor sector. When leading stocks in leading industry groups start to crumble, that's reason enough to be defensive.


Keep a close eye on chip stocks that have broken below their 50-day lines like **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). Remember that after big price runs, it's not unusual for big market leaders like these to pull back up to 30% as new bases take shape. The pullbacks for each so far are in the 15% range.


**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) has proved its mettle, holding above the 50-day line and only 6% off its high, ahead of its earnings report Wednesday after the close. It was featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/ollies-bargain-outlet-broadcom-earnings-options/)  column as a possible call-option trade in anticipation of solid results.


While the weakness in chip stocks has been well documented, leading growth stocks in China have also come under pressure. For-profit school stocks like **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), as well as online retailer **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), have given up support at the 50-day line.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), 22 components fell 2% or more, but for names like **Cognex** ([CGNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGNX)), **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), it's nothing more than a test of the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/) at this point. For the day, the IBD 50 slumped 3.1%.


Meanwhile, geopolitical headlines remain a risk for investors. Bloomberg reported Monday that the U.S. and South Korea commenced a five-day joint air exercise on the Korean Peninsula involving 230 aircraft and 12,000 American troops. The news comes after North Korea last week launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile.

  Stock Market Extends Rebound, But Is A Bottom In Place? Many Leading Stocks Acting Better

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 had their best days in nine months as the stock market extended its rebound Tuesday, and buyers propped up many of the beaten-up leading stocks.




The two-day surge for the Nasdaq was the largest since February and the largest on the S&P 500 since November 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The Nasdaq surged 3%, closing near the session's high. The index gapped above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), making a bullish turnabout on its chart.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed back above its 50-day line. It added 1.4% as **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) jumped more than 3%. The chipmaker said it is [taking public its Mobileye self-driving auto business](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-stock-climbs-on-mobileye-ipo-plans/).

With Tuesday's 2.1% rally, the index is now a more comfortable 3% above the 50-day average. As a practical matter, the S&P has wiped out nearly all losses since Nov. 24, the eve of a six-session swoon in which the index lost as much as 4.4%.


Stock Market On Better Footing
------------------------------


With two solid gains this week, much of the stock market's damage from the previous couple of weeks is patched up. The Nasdaq sank almost 8% from its Nov. 22 peak and is now 3.2% from new highs.


Advancing stocks topped decliners by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and nearly 4-to-1 on the NYSE.


Still, [IBD's market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains "market in correction," requiring investors to continue in defensive mode. While indexes are quickly improving, the big moves are part of a volatile period in the market.


Despite back-to-back index rallies, Nasdaq and NYSE volume fell both days. In an ideal scenario, index gains come in higher volume â€” an indication that institutional investors are buying heavily into the rebound. So far, that's not so clear.


Market indexes are bouncing off levels that by some measures were oversold.


If the stock market continues to climb, a rally confirmation could come as early as this week. As such, investors should be preparing to get reinvested in stocks. Watchlists should already have some institutional-quality stocks in or near buy areas. IBD's [market coverage](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) has been highlighting examples.

Stock Market Leaders Acting Bullishly
-------------------------------------


Many stock market leaders are acting as though the correction is over.


The IBD 50 rallied 3.9% and climbed back above its 200-day moving average.


Leadership is emerging in some unlikely places, such as self-storage. **Life Storage** ([LSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSI)) broke out of a base Tuesday. and **Public Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)) tried to, adding to a broad rally in the industry.



Some tried and true market leaders are finding support at the 50-day moving average.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) climbed 4.2% after getting support around its 50-day moving average. UBS raised its price target on the EV company to 1,000 from 750 and maintained a neutral rating.


**Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)), **KKR & Co.** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)), **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Tandem Diabetes Care** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) and **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) are also bouncing off their 50-day averages.


**Silicon Motion** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) broke out of an 18-week base, gapping above the 81.97 buy point in heavy volume. Shares are extended from a buy range that went to 86.07. The data storage company set a $200 million share repurchase plan and reaffirmed its fourth-quarter guidance.


New Patterns Form In Stock Market
---------------------------------


There are also some leading stocks that formed three-weeks-tight or four-weeks-tight patterns. Those are bullish in any market and especially now in a volatile trend.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/google-stock-why-it-is-eyeing-multiple-entries-and-outperforming-other-fang-stocks/), **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) and **SGH** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)) formed tight patterns.


The rest of this week should provide important signals for the stock market. While indexes are now well off their correction lows, further gains (hopefully in higher volume) could be enough to shift market direction.


To a large extent, the market has been moving on headlines. On Friday, the U.S. consumer price index comes out. And inflation is one of the market's main worries.

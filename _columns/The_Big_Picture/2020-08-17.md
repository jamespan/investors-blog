While Nasdaq Makes Headlines, These Top Stocks Form New Buy Points
===================================================================

The Nasdaq composite made a record high and the S&P 500 came an inch away from a new high in the stock market. Not to be left out of the party, some top stocks formed [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




The Nasdaq rose 1%, making new highs for the first time since the initial week of August. The S&P 500 came only 6 points away from a record high after adding 0.3% Monday.


The stock market has sailed through earnings season, the coronavirus pandemic, trade tensions and other worries. It's often said that the market climbs a wall of worry. If so, this market is doing it like Spiderman.


Index gains moderated starting in mid-July. That served to keep the market from overheating and to put leading stocks in [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). After consolidating for several weeks, many of the leaders that had become too extended now offer fresh opportunities.


**![MP082420](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP082420-228x300.jpg)Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) — three members of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) — along with **ASML Holding** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) and **Akamai** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) now have [flat bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/).


These Leaders Are Forming Key Patterns Too
------------------------------------------


**PerkinElmer** ([PKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKI)), **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)), **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDSN)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Danaher** ([DHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHR)) have formed [three-weeks-tight patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). These formations are best used to increase the amount of shares in already profitable holdings. **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), today's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/lam-research-stock-in-the-semiconductor-space-is-near-a-new-buy-point/) pick, also formed a three-weeks-tight.


Most of these leaders are in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), which jumped 1.6% Monday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% after **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and the Dow's trio of financial stocks dropped more than 2%. But consumer plays **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) performed best in the Dow. Both rose more than 2%, and both will announce earnings Tuesday morning. It's a [big week for retail earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), with **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) and **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) also reporting this week.


In fact, consumer stocks led the market Monday. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)), already one of the best performing ETFs this summer, climbed 2.3%. Select Sector SPDR Consumer Discretionary Fund ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) rose 1.3%. Both made new highs. Select Sector SPDR Consumer Staples ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) added 0.6%.


Retailers **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) broke out of bases, though volume did not impress. TJX, which reports results Wednesday, topped the 58.63 buy point of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Dollar Tree closed above a 99.92 entry.


Housing Lifts Stock Market
--------------------------



Four of the 15 best-performing industry groups were in housing and building after positive economic news. The National Association of Home Builders index of market conditions rose in August to one of the highest levels ever. Indexes of present conditions, future conditions and traffic also were strong. "These results support the findings of Realtor.com that the market is strong as prices continue to rise, while listings are coming back, though they are still down from last year," economist Joel Naroff said in an analysis. "Both the new and existing housing markets are doing well and that is good news for economic growth going forward."


**Hovnanian Enterprises** ([HOV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOV)) soared past the 29.88 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) in heavy volume. The New Jersey-based homebuilder is already extended, joining 13 other stocks in the homebuilding industry group trading at or near highs. With 21 companies in the group, that's a great batting average for new highs. **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) is trying to break out past a 37.43 buy point.


Gold stocks and gold ETFs also led. **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)), Warren Buffett's investment firm, late Friday [disclosed it owned shares](https://www.investors.com/research/gold-stocks-investing-price/) of **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)), one of the largest gold mining companies. Barrick shares jumped 11.6% to a new closing high.


Gold prices rose also on a weak reading in the New York Fed's [Empire State Index of manufacturing activity](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). The overall index fell sharply, though it still was in positive territory.


The Nasdaq needed help from outside its tech stronghold to outperform Monday. One big help came from **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which raced 11% to a new high after a bullish note from a Wedbush analyst. Biotechs and semiconductors also contributed. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 1.2%.

Stocks ended almost flat Thursday on news that President Obama would dispatch military advisers to Iraq.

  

The Nasdaq lost 0.1%, while the S&P 500 added 0.1%. The IBD 50 was flat.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

Early in the session, the indexes were down modestly but slid further after the announcement that Obama would have a statement on Iraq. Word soon leaked that special forces would be sent to the war-torn nation, and the market began selling off even before the president confirmed the rumor.

  

The decision raised brief jitters on Wall Street. The Nasdaq had found support in the morning around 4,350 but broke the support on the rumor in early afternoon trade.

  

However, the worries were short-lived. The Nasdaq fell only a little before buyers stepped in to support the stock indexes.

  

The Nasdaq's 0.5% loss at the day's low was cut to less than 0.1% at the close.

  

A weak market might've tanked on news of a shift in the U.S. role in Iraq's war. This market handled the news well and remains in a confirmed uptrend. The number of distribution days in the current uptrend remains low.

  

Among top-rated stocks, **GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)) broke out in strong volume. The stock cleared a 28.99 buy point in a cup-without-handle base.

  

**Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) followed up on Wednesday's breakout in mediocre volume with a pop Thursday on trade 36% faster than average. The stock is 2% above a 84.58 entry.

  

**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) broke out in volume 54% above average, passing a 163.60 entry.

  

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) gapped up in 44% faster trade, clearing a low handle in a double-bottom pattern. A low handle is prone to failing. But the stock isn't far below a buy point at 78.74, and the base is first stage.

  

Electric utility and IBD 50 member **ITC Holdings** ([ITC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITC)) broke out from a flat consolidation but then reversed lower to close below the pattern, down 4% for the day. Volume was heavy.

  

Economic news was mostly positive Thursday. Initial jobless claims were slightly less than expected; the Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing gauge for June trounced views; and leading indicators in May were a tick weaker than the consensus number.

  

The biggest winner Thursday was gold, which rose more than 3%. Gold-mining stocks also did well. Many have formed bases or have broken out, but their fundamentals are spotty.

  

**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) dropped sharply in after-hours trade on quarterly results that missed estimates. The stock has an almost 1% weighting in the S&P 500.

  

Friday is a quadruple witching day, which involves expirations of index and single options and futures, and often boosts volume.

The stock market rallied Monday in a positive start to a potentially tense week in which **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) earnings, a Fed decision and the October employment report are all converging.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 jumped 1.2%. The Nasdaq closed slightly below the 200-day moving average after rising above that level twice during the session.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.6%, its first gain of more than 1% in nearly three months. Dow component **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) rose 1.7% after third-quarter results and same-store sales [surprised Wall Street](https://www.investors.com/news/mcdonalds-set-to-extend-rebound-on-q3-sales-surprise/).


The long-suffering Russell 2000 rose 0.6%. The small-cap benchmark is testing its 2022 lows, where it found support in June and October of that year. Watch for another possible low at these levels.


The IBD 50 index rose 1.1%, with nine of the 50 stocks up 2% or more.


There was a rough correlation between the 10-year Treasury yield and the major indexes in Monday's trading. Indexes bottomed around 10:45 a.m. ET, just as the yield hit its high for the day. The stock market started an afternoon rally around 1:25 p.m., as the yield began easing. The yield was up 3 basis points to 4.87% late Monday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP103023-230x300.jpg)Volume fell on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. But breadth was bullish, with advancers over decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


Still, many stocks have a lot of work to do before they can dig themselves out of holes. Last week, [the number of 52-week highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-27-2023/) was in the teens or single digits, while new lows were in the hundreds.


Fed, Apple, Jobs Highlight Stock Market Week
--------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq is now two days into a rally attempt and the S&P 500 just started one. On the fourth day of a rally attempt, it is possible for a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) to occur. That possibility adds some drama to this week's market.


Headlines start to heat up Wednesday, when the Fed releases its policy statement. There's [almost zero chance](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) of a change from the current 5.25%-5.50% fed funds rate, and about 25% odds of a hike in the December meeting. More important will be Chair Jerome Powell's indications on future rate policy. Some economists believe [the tightening cycle is ending](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/higher-bond-yields-could-end-the-feds-historic-rate-rises-f54b65d3?mod=economy_lead_pos1).


Apple — the largest stock by market cap — will [announce quarterly earnings Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-wall-street-cuts-december-quarter-estimates/) after the close. Its results have ripple effects across many parts of the stock market, making it a true bellwether. Apple stock climbed 1.2% Monday as it tries to climb back above the 200-day line.


The company scheduled an unusual event for 5 p.m. PT that was expected to showcase updates to its Mac personal computers and other devices.


On Friday, the October employment report will indicate if the job market is cooling — as the Fed hopes. Hundreds of earnings reports are scheduled throughout the week, too.


S&P 500 Earnings Set To Rise, Finally
-------------------------------------


Speaking of earnings, the stock market may not be able to blame them for a weak stock market.


With half the S&P 500 companies' third-quarter results already announced, 78% have beaten profit expectations. That's above the five-year and 10-year averages, says FactSet Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters.


Earnings are running 7.7% above analyst estimates, which is below the five-year average of 8.5% but above the 10-year average of 6.6%.


On the whole, S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise 2.7% in Q3, which would be the first quarter with an increase in per-share earnings since Q3 2022. Third-quarter revenues have been 0.8% above estimates so far. That's below the five-year and 10-year averages, FactSet says.


In other corporate news, **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) [reached a settlement](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/gm-uaw-reach-new-tentative-labor-deal-to-end-strike-afe5e197) to end the strike by the United Auto Workers. The deal follows others at **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) and **Stellantis** ([STLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLA)).


Wall Street isn't pleased with the new contracts. Ford fell 1.9% after Friday's 12% rout. Stellantis fell for a third day in a row. GM shares reversed higher 0.5% after a two-day slide.


Geopolitical risk remains high amid the Israel-Hamas war. But so far the conflict seemed to remain contained, even as Israeli troops [made a push into Gaza](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-makes-major-advance-toward-gaza-city-2339a2b6). Crisis assets such as gold and crude oil fell Monday.

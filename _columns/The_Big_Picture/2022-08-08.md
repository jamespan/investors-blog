The fun in the stock market lasted about a half-hour Monday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rallied to gains of at least 1% at the open. From then on, sellers took control.




The stock market faded and closed near session lows. The bearish reversal marked a swift change in character from Friday: The surprisingly strong July jobs report boosted odds of a 75-basis-point rate hike in September. Yet, the market regained its composure and closed near session highs.


That bubbly optimism disappeared 30 minutes into Monday's session.


The Nasdaq wiped out a 1.6% increase and closed 0.1% lower. The S&P 500, up as much as 1%, also lost 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average got away with a 0.1% increase.


But small caps outperformed. The Russell 2000 index climbed 1%, even after it pared gains. The IBD 50 fell less than 0.1%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be slightly higher on the NYSE. Advancers sharply outmatched decliners on both exchanges, ThinkOrSwim data showed.


Stock Market Uptrend May Pause
------------------------------


For now, the stock market continues an uptrend that began in mid-June. The Nasdaq has rallied about 20% in that period, so a rest is entirely reasonable at this stage.


As for market signals to watch, investors can keep an eye on the Dow's 10-day moving average. The index is holding above that line so far. The same moving average deserves a look on the Russell 2000. The S&P 500 is holding above a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/?refcode=BBB-04262022-2-B-9:04:2022:2Q:NewsLetter:Email:BBB-04262022:na:na:na:na:26:10:2:B:9&j=1566189&sfmc_sub=172274927&l=222_HTML&u=20328680&mid=100016628&jb=1) from the July 14 low; a break below it could signal a change in direction.

Yet that didn't remove a bearish taste from the market. The ease with which buyers vacated trading pits left a lot of room for sellers.


As always, use the major indexes and leading stocks as your primary guide.


Beyond that, interest rates, earnings and geopolitical squabbles are some of the stock market issues that need to be watched.


Interest Rate Outlook
---------------------


CME Group's [FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html), which tracks the probabilities of rate hikes, now shows two-thirds of traders are betting on a 75-basis-point increase in the September Fed meeting. That's up from less than 30% about a week ago, before the jobs report. For the November and December meetings, the odds are for quarter-point hikes both times.


That suggests the bond market believes the Fed will slow its tightening pace. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 7 basis points to 2.76% Monday. The drop cut into last week's jump of about 20 basis points in the benchmark yield.



The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.6% as semiconductor stocks weighed on the market. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) gapped down in heavy trading after the graphics-chip designer [cut its current-quarter sales forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-falls-as-graphics-chip-maker-warns-of-weak-gaming-sales/). It was a setback for Nvidia's nearly five-week rebound from 52-week lows.


Nvidia shares fell 6.3% for the day but still range above the slowly rising 50-day moving average for now.


IBD's chip design industry group fell more than 1%, and the chip equipment group lost about 2%. Both were in the bottom 10 of 197 industry groups in the day's performance.


Earnings Season Mixed, But Stock Market Forgives
------------------------------------------------


Most second-quarter earnings reports — including most key companies — already have been announced. That makes earnings less of an investing risk.


As of Friday, 87% of S&P 500 companies had announced results. Of those, 75% beat EPS estimates. That's slightly below the five-year average of 77%, according to FactSet. Earnings exceeded estimates by 3.4%, which is also below the five-year average.


Nonetheless, investors have been in a forgiving mood.


So far, the S&P 500 companies that missed the consensus profit estimate for Q2 saw on average no price change at all in the few days immediately before and after the earnings release, says John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. That's well above the five-year average drop of 2.4% in such cases.


Also, S&P 500 companies that beat views are rising an average of 2.1% in the few days before and after earnings. The five-year average gain is 0.8%. At the current rate, it will be the largest average price gain for earnings winners since the third quarter of 2019.


Q3, Q4 Estimates Lowered
------------------------


Looking ahead, third-quarter earnings estimates among S&P 500 firms now stand at $57.02 a share, down 4.2% from the start of the quarter. And Q4 estimates have eased to $58.97 per share, 2.8% lower from the start of Q3.


"The Street now expects essentially no sequential S&P 500 earnings growth from Q2 ($56.82/share) to Q3 ($57.02/share, up 0.4% from Q2)," Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in a commentary. "Analysts are also busy cutting their Q4 estimates and, to a lesser extent, 2023 numbers as well."


"Now that we are mostly through Q2 earnings season, these revisions should start to slow down," Colas continued. "Whether they are enough to have accurately reset expectations remains to be seen, of course."

Nasdaq Leads Stocks Higher; The Market Outlook Has Changed, Again
==================================================================

Accelerating inflation is bad. No, wait! It's actually not that bad.


 In what turned out to be a mini-lesson in how to view the market action, the major indexes erased early losses, spurred by a bigger-than-forecast jump in January consumer prices, then thrust sharply higher in a sharp increase in trading volume. The bullish action triggered a shift in the current outlook for stocks back to "confirmed uptrend" from "market in correction."


The mini lesson for all investors, both new and veteran? Watch the market not just at the open, but during the middle and the close.

The Nasdaq composite led the impressive bounce, going from a 0.5% drop right after the market open to a 1.9% lift by day's end. Volume rushed more than 21% higher vs. the prior session, clear evidence that equity trading desks across the country got busy scooping up stocks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP02141818-237x300.png)The strong gain in higher volume came on the fourth day of a market rally that began with an even more impressive reversal on Feb. 9. Such action is a textbook example of the [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). IBD, ever since its founding in 1984, has noted the follow-through as the most timely indicator that a market correction has ended and a new uptrend may in fact be in place.


A [confirmed market uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) is the best time to begin actively building your watch list and get ready to buy stocks that show high relative strength, good fundamentals, and break out of well-formed bases that do not show excessively wild swings. If you've been reading IBD for a while, then you know that it's actually even better to update your watch list during a market correction, then get ready to buy a stock or two even on the follow-through day itself.


Bill O'Neil, founder and chairman of IBD, has repeatedly said in various IBD seminars that he likes to buy at least one stock on the follow-through day. Why? Get your toes wet and use the new stock buy as a way to test the waters. Your action also keeps your opinions at bay.


Remember the 2000-2002 technology bear market? Numerous investors vowed never to buy a tech stock again. Well, such an attitude cost investors dearly as tech stocks roared back after follow-through rallies occurred in October 2002 and in March 2003.


The S&P 500 notched a follow-through of its own on Wednesday. Despite a summary sell-off in utility stocks, the large-cap benchmark still rallied more than 1.3% on Day 4 of the S&P's rally attempt.


Gains by a bevy of [industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), from jewelry retailing to oil and gas firms, from homebuilders to metal ores, and from chip equipment to superregional banks, more than offset declines in electric, water, diversified utility and other defensive stocks. (Go to IBD Data Tables, then click on "Industry Sub-Group Rankings" to see the daily changes in all 197 industry groups.)


The Dow utility average sank 1.2%.


Interestingly, the Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX, actually slumped just as the S&P 500 and other indexes dived at the market open. Volatility among options traders tends to rise when stocks fall. This divergence suggested that not all traders were ready to bail out of stocks following the inflation news ahead of the market open.


You can track the VIX by going to IBD's [Psychological Market Indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) feature in the Market Trend section. The recent spike to over 50 on Feb. 6 was actually a bullish, not bearish, development amid the latest correction in stocks. Why? It hinted that pessimism among investors was still relatively high. Pessimistic traders usually are sitting on cash, which at some point could flow back into stocks.


Small caps participated in the rally, thanks in part to strength in the banking sector. The S&P SmallCap 600 gained 1.8%. But at 929, the S&P 600 is still lagging its large-cap sibling. The S&P 600 is still down nearly 0.8% since Jan. 1 and still needs a significant rally to return back above the key 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 is also on the south side of its 50-day line, but it's now back in the black, up 0.9% year to date.


Numerous highly rated companies from the tech, internet, retail and other sectors broke out or moved back above recent new buy points. When stocks from multiple sectors rise in heavy volume at the start of a potential new market uptrend, even when the overall secular bull run is long in the tooth, it's bullish.


IBD's new highs list had been depressed over the past two weeks as stocks went into a near free fall. But the [new highs list on Wednesday](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/) likely showed signs of life. (See the entire list, divided by sector, by going to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the "Stock Lists" section.)


Concerns were legitimate. Is a sharp rise in inflation going to lead to a change in how quickly the Federal Reserve acts to restrict the money supply? Will 2018 be the first time in a while that the U.S. central bank hikes the fed funds rate by a full percentage point (via, say, four quarter-point increases) in a single year?


The bigger-than-expected jump in U.S. consumer-level prices in January (up 0.5%, vs. the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for a 0.3% rise, and a 2.1% increase year over year) appeared to accentuate such concern.


However, keep in mind that the market is the ultimate indicator of where the economy is going. And Wednesday's fourth straight up day suggests that market participants continue to like the prospects for continued economic growth, rising corporate profits, a strong jobs market, and the high possibility that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will engage in a gradual normalization of interest rate policy.


Not all follow-throughs work.


After market corrections in 2010, 2011, 2015 and even 2016, the first follow-through that took place after the major indexes gouged their 50-day moving averages in a vertical-like fashion tended to fail. In other words, the indexes immediately declined in the following days and weeks and undercut the low of the first up day in the new market rally.


When such negative action happens, though, it doesn't mean you should take a monthlong cruise and ignore the market. The second or third follow-through rallies often turn out to be exciting new opportunities to make profits in stocks.


Don't forget this as well: No major market bottom emerged in the absence of a genuine follow-through.

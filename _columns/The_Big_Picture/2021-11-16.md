Does the stock market have, in the words of fictional soccer coach Ted Lasso, the memory of a goldfish?




Last week, stocks got pounded over concerns on accelerating inflation. The big [upside surprises in the U.S. consumer price index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for October last week testified to that. A Nov. 9-10 sell-off saw the Nasdaq composite slide more than 2.2%. It narrowly escaped a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the first of those two sessions.


Yet the stock market seems to have absorbed that shock. And some institutional money managers see a pathway to a cooling of prices in the first half of next year.


Less Inflationary Pressures Coming?
-----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP111621-230x300.jpg)"The U.S. dollar is steadier and strengthening, and so it's harder to see the current inflation trend continuing," Rich Sega, global chief investment strategist for Conning, told IBD in a phone interview Tuesday. Conning manages $209 billion in mostly fixed income assets for pension plans, insurance firms and other institutional clients. It also focuses on dividend-rich, free-cash-flow-loaded equities.


Sega acknowledges that big spending at the federal government could always help "step up inflationary pressures." But the veteran investment pro points out that China may also have a role in helping calm the rising inflationary tide. How so? In trade-weighted dollar terms, the Middle Kingdom makes up roughly a third of all global trade transactions. So, in Sega's view, the world's economic superpower has the ability to effectively "export dis-inflation" to the global economy.


Put another way, lower-priced goods made in China still weigh powerfully on consumer spending habits.


"If you have good growth and low inflation, that's the opposite of stagflation," Sega adds.


Still The King Of Stock Market Indexes
--------------------------------------


On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite led the broad advance. A nearly 0.8% gain to 15,973 puts the tech-enriched index within an arm's grasp of its all-time high of 16,053.


The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, rallied 0.7%. That surpassed gains of 0.4% by the S&P 500 and roughly 0.2% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared higher on the NYSE.


Such solid gains in higher turnover reflect [institutional accumulation](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-powers-up-these-four-top-growth-stocks-in-or-near-buy-zones/).


So does the accompanying Market Pulse. In this table, you can see more true market leaders rising in intense activity than those falling significantly in price.


Other broad measures of the stock market also point to improving breadth. That's bullish.


[On MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), 302 stocks gained in above-average volume while 301 fell in heavy turnover. That's unusually evenhanded. But the pattern recognition tool also displayed no fewer than six companies making the breakout screen and 14 "near a pivot," i.e., buy point. [New highs making IBD's screen](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-nov-15-2021/), organized by top sectors, continue to outweigh new lows.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line remains in the solid upward path its trod since late September.


Headed into Tuesday's action, [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) hosted nine companies. That's a meaningful jump from the days and weeks earlier in the year when this highly stringent screen for [CAN SLIM movers](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) had one or two at most.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), meanwhile, continues to highlight a healthy number of top performers. Seven issues hold a slot in the [Leaders Near A Buy Point list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), while another seven are [extended from proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/). But these latter seven could eventually produce new bases or establish follow-on entries.



Swiss shoemaker **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) gave a gold-medal performance Tuesday. A Leaderboard earnings options play and [Monday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/onon-stock-sets-up-as-options-play-with-on-holding-earnings-due/), On streaked 25% higher in the second highest volume since its Sept. 15 NYSE debut. Shares catapulted past a 39.90 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [pretty cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


The decline within the cup showed a normal 31% correction from head to toe. And the handle? A tightly wound 10.7% decline is exactly what you want to see.


Beyond The Stock Market
-----------------------


The upward push in long-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields still appears to have a measured look to it. U.S. Treasury data shows the benchmark 10-year bond yield rising from 1.58% on Nov. 1 to 1.63% on Tuesday. Yield on the 30-year bond has inched up 4 basis points. Three-month T-bills have been rock-steady at 0.05%.


Put all together, these rates correspond to a positively sloping yield curve. That's great for banks.


As the [IBD stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-nov-15-2021/) indicate, bank and finance stocks continue to provide the stock market a critical leg of strength.

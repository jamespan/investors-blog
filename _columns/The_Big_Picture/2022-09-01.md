The stock market ended mixed Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 reversed higher from sharp declines and the Nasdaq pared losses. Up next, investors will shift their attention to Friday's jobs report.




Amid a struggling stock market uptrend, these three market leaders — **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) — are holding up.


Jobs Report Before Market Opens
-------------------------------


Early Friday, the Labor Department is poised to release its August jobs report. Wall Street economists expect the U.S. economy to add 293,000 jobs in August, down from July's 528,000 bulge, according to Econoday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP_090122-249x300.jpg)Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.4% on the month and 5.3% year over year. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.5%.


Earlier this week, ADP's private payrolls report said that payrolls increased by 132,000 in August, below estimates that called for growth of 225,000. Investors are paying close attention to jobs data because a firm job market will encourage the Fed to continue raising interest rates.


Economic Data, Earnings Movers
------------------------------


First-time jobless claims unexpectedly dropped to 232,000, below estimates for a rise to 246,000. Claims stood at 243,000 a week ago.


[S&P Global delivered](https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/4a630bc3c76342e1b104ad2a125051e9?s=1) its August manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index right after the market open. The PMI dropped to its lowest level since July 2020 amid further declines of new orders.


Lastly, the Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing index came in at 52.8, topping estimates that called for 52. Business activity continued to expand in August, while the prices that companies reported paying dropped more than expected.



Key earnings movers Thursday included **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).


The market reaction to some of those was severe.


Ciena slid 10% as Five Below shares rallied 6.3%. MDB stock dived 25%. [Okta stock plunged](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/okta-stock/) 33%. Ollie's slashed losses to less than 1%, as Pure Storage shares lost less than 3%. And [Veeva stock crumbled](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/veev-stock-veeva-earnings-q2-2023/) 14%.

Dow Jones Today
---------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5%, while the S&P 500 — which had been down as much as 1.3% — closed 0.3% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slashed losses to just 0.3% after tumbling as much as 2.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slid 1.2%. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 extended losing streaks to five sessions.


Volume eased on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, so the Nasdaq avoided another distribution day. Volume appeared to be slightly higher on the NYSE.


Chip stocks were the session's laggards, as industry giants **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) declined 3% and 7.7%, respectively, after the companies said the U.S. government imposed restrictions on certain chip sales to China.


Chipmaker **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was one of the worst performers among Dow Jones stocks, down 0.5%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) showed a 2.2% loss.


Top growth stocks underperformed Thursday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) skidded 3.1% to break down through its 50-day line. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Murphy USA** ([MUSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUSA)) was one of the few bright spots, rising 0.2%. Shares are extended past a 262.68 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Stock Market Trend
------------------


In a struggling market uptrend, investors should be playing a ton of defense. Instead of looking for new breakouts, you should have a game plan for your existing positions. Make sure you have an exit strategy in a market that now shows little ability to rebound. If the market is able to stabilize, then it would be time to look for breakout stocks.


With the indexes below their key support levels, a healthy cash position is a solid strategy.

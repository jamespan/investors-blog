The Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes advanced to fresh 2023 highs Thursday on the heels of more cool inflation data, with the early release of the producer price index. The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled further below the 4% level.




As the stock market extends this year's gains, these four leaders are in or near buy zones: [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)), Dow Jones leader **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) and chip giant **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Early Thursday, the Labor Department said that producer prices barely rose in June. The PPI edged up 0.1% last month, cooler than estimates. Year over year, producer prices gained just 0.1%, below Wall Street's expectations for a 0.4% rise.


The cool inflation data pushed the 10-year Treasury yield further below 4%, settling at 3.76% and closing at its lowest level since June 28. Despite [Wednesday's cool consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-slides-to-3-easing-fed-fears-sp-500-futures-rally/) and Thursday's wholesale price data, investors still see a more than 92% chance of a quarter-point hike at this month's Fed meeting, per [CME FedWatch Tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)


On the earnings front, **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), **Fastenal** ([FAST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAST)) and **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) reported Thursday and made big moves.


[Delta stock](https://www.investors.com/news/delta-air-lines-hikes-full-year-guidance-after-earnings-fly-86-in-q2-airline-stocks-rally/)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP071323--248x300.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/news/delta-air-lines-hikes-full-year-guidance-after-earnings-fly-86-in-q2-airline-stocks-rally/) reversed from big gains to close 0.5% lower Thursday, even though second-quarter results came in better than expected. Fastenal slid 3.5% in fast turnover but is still above a rising 50-day moving average. And PepsiCo shares rallied 2.4% after the company beat estimates and raised its outlook. PEP stock regained its 50-day line and is building a flat base that has a 196.88 entry.


Quarterly reports from big banks on Friday mark the first heavy day of earnings season, with **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) andÂ **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) [set to announce](https://www.investors.com/news/jpm-stock-wells-fargo-near-buy-points-with-q2-earnings-fuse-lit/).


Stock Market Today: S&P 500 Hits 2023 High
------------------------------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%. In the Dow 30, **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) climbed 0.9% and remains in buy range above a [250.89 cup-with-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cat-stock-rolls-past-buy-point-amid-industrial-renaissance/).


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite both sharply outperformed the Dow 30, hitting new 2023 highs. The S&P 500 advanced nearly 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite jumped 1.6% and sailed above the 14,000 level. The small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 0.9% for a fifth straight gain.


Volume dropped slightly on the Nasdaq and NYSE from the prior session.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 1.5% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Allegro MicroSystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) surged more than 9%, breaking out past a 48.82 cup-base buy point.


With the stock market at new 2023 highs, IBD's recommended market exposure remains at 80%-100%. Still, investors should be prepared for any potential market pullback. Make sure you take some profits into strength and quickly sell any losers.


There are three distribution days on the Nasdaq and four on the S&P 500, which is a serviceable number.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: On, Salesforce, Nvidia
-----------------------------------------------------



On Holding is trying to break out past a 33.68 buy point in a cup with handle, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares closed just below their entry. If ONON stock retakes the buy point, the 5% buy area will run up to 35.36.


[In IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), On's exposure was increased by a quarter to three quarters. The stock gained promotion from the watchlist as it crossed a trendline near 30.


Salesforce hit two buy triggers this week. First, CRM stock decisively rebounded from its 50-day line Tuesday, entering a new buy area. Shares then broke out past a flat base's 225 buy point during Wednesday's 2.8% advance.

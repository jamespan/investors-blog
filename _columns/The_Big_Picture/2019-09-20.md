Stocks looked poised for a quiet and orderly session Friday as major stock indexes traded in a tight range. But a wave of selling hit the stock market just after 1 p.m. ET after a Chinese delegation, in the U.S. for trade talks, canceled a trip to visit U.S. farmers in Montana and Nebraska.




The Nasdaq composite rallied off lows but lost steam into the close, ending with a loss of 0.8%; the Dow Jones industrials gave back 0.6% and the S&P 500 eased 0.5%. Small caps sidestepped most of the selling, with the Russell 2000 down just 0.1%. Volume came in much higher than Thursday as options and futures contracts expired. That raised the [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count to three each for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Stock market bulls liked the fact that Friday's weakness didn't cause much technical damage. The Nasdaq marked its 12th straight close above its 50-day moving average and remains only 2% off its high. Among individual stocks, healthy charts still have the upper hand over unhealthy ones.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Top gainers Friday included **Teladoc Health** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)). Shares jumped 5% to 72.15. The stock is near the top of a cup-shaped base with a 74.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). With the stock market still in a confirmed uptrend, it makes sense to focus on technically healthy stocks like Teladoc.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP092319-237x300.jpg)Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) cleared a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) with a 50 buy point. Shares closed at 51.37, up nearly 4%.


**Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) is a potentially actionable chart in the MarketSmith Growth 250 as it works on a flat base with a 66.66 buy point.


But recent [breakouts have been a mixed bag](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/growth-stocks-climb-wall-of-worry/) at best. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) tried to break out Thursday, but it ended below the 141.47 buy point. Other recent breakout attempts by **Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)), **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Air Lease** ([AL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AL)) have struggled.


Are the FAANG Stocks Still Relevant?
------------------------------------


Among the five [FAANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/), the two left standing at this point are Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Alphabet is near highs and not far from a 1,268.49 buy point. And Apple's chart is still intact as it trades just below a 221.47 entry.


But don't expect **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) to resume market leadership roles anytime soon. Amazon is flirting with another test of its 200-day moving average. Netflix gapped below key support levels in mid-July, and sellers remain in control.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) still has a chance to form a new base, but it got turned away at its 50-day moving average Friday.

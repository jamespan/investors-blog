  Why Another Day Of Flat Stock Market Moves Should Be Considered Positive

Major indexes were steady for a second day in a row as the stock market continued to moderate from a fast advance. Consider that a good sign.




The Nasdaq composite eased 0.1% and the S&P 500 rose less than 0.2%. While both changed direction a few times during the session, overall price action was dull.


The Nasdaq surged 5% from the close on March 30 to Monday's close. So a couple of days of rest seem adequate. The narrow price ranges of the past two sessions may not telegraph much to chart readers, but it's considered positive action because the stock market refuses to give back its advance.


That should provide some encouragement for investors to continue seeking out opportunities in breakouts and other bullish stock chart patterns.


![MP040721](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP040721-252x300.jpg)Neither the Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 seem overexerted. The S&P 500 is about 4.5% above its 50-day moving average. That's mostly within the range of moves above the 50-day line since the November peak, another indication that the S&P 500 is pacing itself.


Volume edged higher on the Nasdaq and was indicated lower on the NYSE. Declining stocks led advancers by about 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by 9-to-7 on the NYSE.


Small Caps, Leading Stocks Drag Stock Market
--------------------------------------------


It was an off day for small caps and leading stocks.


The Russell 2000 fell 1.6% and erased all it had gained since last week. Industrial, technology and materials were weakest among small caps.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.2%, snapping a five-day win streak.


**Green Brick Partners** ([GRBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRBK)) cost the IBD 50 some performance points after the homebuilder slid more than 5% and came to rest near the 25.15 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). (Another proper entry was at 23.69 from a handle.) **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) and **MarineMax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)) also slid 4% to 5%.


**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) led the IBD 50 with a 3.6% price increase. The payments services company is forming a base, and was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Wednesday on a move above a trend line.



It wasn't necessarily a bad day for growth stocks. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 0.2% while iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) dropped 0.2%.


**Perficient** ([PRFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRFT)) climbed above the 63.05 buy point of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), but closed below that price level. The digital consulting firm is part of the technology services industry group, where **Epam** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)), **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)) and **DXC Technology** ([DXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXC)) have made bullish moves.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up less than 0.1%.


Market Readies For Earnings Season
----------------------------------


The stock market is starting a new earnings season, a period of potential volatility for stocks and indexes. On the surface, the stock market is looking at another strong quarter.


According to FactSet, first-quarter earnings per share for the S&P 500 are estimated to surge 23.8%. That would make it the highest earnings growth rate since Q3 of 2018, when it jumped 26.1%.


Analysts are busy raising Q1 estimates, with the average EPS estimate for the S&P 500 up 6% since Dec. 31. Normally, earnings estimates decline leading up to the start of earnings season. Not this year.


"In fact, the first quarter of 2021 marked the largest increase in the bottom-up EPS estimate (the aggregate of median EPS estimates) during a quarter since FactSet began tracking the quarterly bottom-up EPS estimate in Q2 2002," John Butters, FactSet senior earnings analyst, noted in a report. The previous record was 5.4%, marked in Q1 of 2018, after tax reform was passed.


The bullish earnings picture bodes well for the stock market. But remember that high expectations also could mean bigger disappointments if the results don't impress. Investors are always looking for companies to exceed estimates.

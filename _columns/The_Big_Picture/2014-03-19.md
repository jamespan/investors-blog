The major indexes fell broadly in higher volume Wednesday after U.S. central bankers agreed that the economy is now virtually healthy enough to grow without needing aggressive steps to keep interest rates near zero.

  

Leading stocks surrendered ground, but volume was below average among most names. That may have been due to the listless trading seen in the hours before the Federal Reserve made its announcement around 2 p.m. ET.

  

The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both lost 0.6%, giving back a sizable chunk of Monday's and Tuesday's strong gains. A late-hour rally shaved the losses. Volume rose on both exchanges, further raising the distribution-day tally.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 slipped 0.8%. The IBD 50 fell 1%. Less than a handful of members of the elite growth-stock list dropped in heavy trade.

  

A heavy load of distribution days, or sessions of unequivocal selling by fund managers, is currently weighing on the market as top growth stocks have mostly shown small gains so far this year. IBD's market outlook has remained at "Uptrend under pressure" for one week.

  

No matter how quickly the Fed removes its stimulus measures, the market will need time to consolidate its fantastic gains of 2013. The impending rise in short-term interest rates, likely to occur in early 2015, will be a head wind against future corporate profits and consumer spending because borrowing costs will rise.

  

At the Fed's first policy meeting headed by Janet Yellen, the bank pared its bond purchases down to a total $55 billion per month after recognizing that "there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions."

  

The massive asset purchase program, begun in 2012, involved $85 billion per month in purchases of long-term Treasury bonds and agency mortgage-backed debt. The two-day meeting that ended Wednesday marked the third meeting in a row that the Fed reduced the scale of its "quantitative easing" program to spur the economy.

  

For now, with the unemployment rate down to 6.7% despite just moderate monthly payrolls growth, the Fed appears convinced that labor conditions will continue to improve gradually. Some say the fed funds rate charged on overnight loans to banks will hit 1% by the end of 2015.

  

If that's true, you can expect the market to price that in along the way. Even at 1%, that's far below the 4.25% fed funds rate seen at the end of 2007, before the subprime loan crisis engulfed Wall Street and triggered a 58% slide in the S&P 500. Today, the large-cap benchmark has rebounded 179% from its March 2009 low.

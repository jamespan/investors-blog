Nasdaq Leads Advance Through China, Taiwan Conflict; Will Stocks Clear This Major Obstacle?
============================================================================================

In the second quarter of this year, the Nasdaq logged no fewer than 19 sessions in which it lost 2% or more. That's right. Nineteen big sell-offs. So, perhaps for some investors, a 2% move to the upside these days may feel a little foreign.




But that's what the stock market treated the bulls to on Wednesday. Traders had been bracing for the potentially negative impact on U.S.-China ties after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's historic visit to Taiwan the prior day. Instead, a 2.6% lift in the Nasdaq composite made very short work of minuscule losses seen in two prior sessions — in which the premier index for growth companies fell less than 0.2% each time.


For sure, even on such a bullish day, some Nasdaq-listed issues teetered in very bad fashion.


Just behold the 19% mauling of **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)). The inverter maker [missed Q2 earnings estimates by a mile](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/solaredge-stock-falls-as-second-quarter-revenue-short/). The stock gave back all gains from a breakout from a rickety cup with handle and its 314.62 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Volume exploded to 5.1 million shares, almost 10% of shares outstanding and the highest level since Dec. 17.



**Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)), the Danish diabetes care giant, looked poised for a breakout. But shares tanked 12.7% in massive turnover after its second-quarter report. A 1% dip in Q2 earnings clearly disappointed institutional investors. A 10% sales rise was the smallest year-over-year gain in five quarters.


Meanwhile, **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), suffered a 10% bruising in extended-hours trading after reporting second-quarter earnings after the close. After-hours trading lacks the same liquidity as the regular session. So, what happens after 4 p.m. ET does not necessarily translate into the same move the next day. Plus, some companies during the current earnings season have seen a boost in their stocks after management holds its conference call with analysts and fund managers.


Nevertheless, the examples of SolarEdge, Novo and Fortinet remind all astute IBD readers of this stark fact: We may be seeing the early signs of a stock market bottom. But volatility may stay high. Companies with disappointing results and poorly formed patterns will still get clawed.


Thus, one should still consider the risk of earnings disappointments as a short-term obstacle for further gains by the major indexes, Nasdaq included. Tons of companies in the retail and other industries have yet to report their second-quarter numbers.

Beyond Nasdaq: Advance Broadening?
----------------------------------


Volume bulged 19% higher on the Nasdaq vs. the prior day. That's bullish. You want to see institutions accumulating shares with abandon, especially during strong days such as Wednesday.


Not every up day needs to show above-average turnover. (IBD's charts show the 50-day moving average for both price and volume, making it super-easy to spot spikes in activity.) Yet if you closely look at the Nasdaq's price-and-volume action since July 1, you can count at least seven more instances in which the Nasdaq composite rose in either heavier-than-usual turnover or in more active trade vs. the prior session.


Megacap techs still wield enormous influence over the Nasdaq's daily action. Still, Wednesday's bullish session noted gains of 1.3% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 1.4% by the Russell 2000, and 1.6% by the large-cap S&P 500. Volume on the NYSE appeared to edge slightly lower.


OPEC's decision to raise oil output by another piecemeal amount appeared to generate a host of opinions on Wall Street. Yet the futures market made it clear that amid signs of a global economic slowdown, traders are responding to the prospects of bigger supplies down the pike. Near-term West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures got slammed, falling 3.7% to $90.92 a barrel.


This means the oil market has fallen as much as 30% below its year-to-date peak of $130.50.


Will the oil and gas plays provide further leadership to the market? Tough to answer now.


While companies such as **Equinor** ([EQNR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQNR)), a [Leaderboard Watchlist stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist), are trading just beneath all-time highs, others such as **APA** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)), **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) and **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) still have a long way to go before etching [complete, solid-looking bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).



APA is clinging to its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) on a daily chart, a good sign for now. But the weekly chart also shows that the current base is [third stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). This fact raises risk of a breakout fake out.


Through Wednesday's action, Devon is making the biggest decline within the IBD 50, down 9.8% for the week so far.


**Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) have cooled 5%.


Pundit Sentiment Today
----------------------


[Bullishness among newsletter editors](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) is rising. The latest Investors Intelligence survey noted the bullish ratio at 41.1%, up from 38.9% last week and well past a 30.1% bearish reading.


However, this means that nearly six out of 10 market pundits believe that a bull market is not in the cards for the rest of 2022.


A strong reading in the ISM services index in July at 56.7 vs. the Econoday view of 53 certainly raises the hopes that the Federal Reserve's actions to tame inflation won't whack the economy too hard.


But the possibility that the Fed will make a policy mistake and raise rates too hard, too fast, must always be kept in mind.

Beyond Earnings: What Could Also Dent The Nasdaq Rally
------------------------------------------------------


Economists at Los Angeles-based fixed-income fund management giant Payden & Rygel think it is no coincidence that the S&P 500's near-term bottom (on a closing basis) on June 16 occurred very close to the June 14 peak in long-term interest rates, or specifically 3.48% for the 10-year bond based on Cboe data. Also on June 16, futures pricing for U.S. overnight rates implied a peak in the fed funds rate of 3.7% by year-end, the Payden economics team wrote in a note sent to clients.


After the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by three quarters of a point for a second straight time to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, Fed chief Jerome Powell said that "as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation." Payden economists, however, warn of two potential scenarios that could hinder that plan.


One, the labor market remains strong.



"Typically, you don't find yourself in a recession when firms are adding 375,000 workers to payrolls (the three-month average). It's possible then that the labor market holds up over the next few months and inflation remains 'sticky.' Without the looming pressure of an imminent recession, the FOMC would not need to pause tightening, leading to more hiking than is priced in, not less," the team wrote.


No doubt the market will be monitoring Friday's July payrolls report very closely. [Econoday forecasts](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) a 250,000-job gain, slowing from June's 372,000-position increase; an unemployment rate of 3.6%, unchanged; a rise of 220,000 in private sector payrolls; and a 5% jump in year-over-year hourly wages.


Two, Payden and Rygel economists also warn about the possibility that growth keeps slowing and the jobless rate eventually rises, but inflation stays high.


As one example, the team points to the severe downturn in December 2007. Back then, core inflation, based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, did not fall below 2% until September 2008. It bottomed out in 2009. Payden also notes that on Friday, the core PCE index for June rose 0.6% month on month, the third-fastest monthly rise in 40 years.


"So, under this type of scenario, the Fed may still have more to hike," the team wrote.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note edged up less than 1 basis point to 2.74% on Wednesday. Midsession, the yield rose to as high as 2.84%.

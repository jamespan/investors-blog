Stocks scrubbed early losses but couldn't advance much Friday despite some heavyweight news that offered no bad surprises. The Nasdaq advanced 0.2%, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.7%, but the IBD 50 owned the day.

  

The elite list bounced 1.3% higher.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

With the market suffering stalling and distribution in three of the previous five sessions, Friday's session shaped up as critical. News on OPEC's meeting, Greece's debt and the U.S. employment situation report added to the tension.

  

However, the bulls pretty much got the minimum they wanted out of the news trifecta.

  

OPEC kept to its oil production plan, which was no surprise. Greece kept to its duck-and-delay strategy on unpaid debt, which also was no surprise.

  

The sole surprise was in the U.S., and it was a good one. Nonfarm payroll gains reached 280,000, which was 27% higher than expected. Discouraged workers dropped from 756,000 in April to 563,000 in May.

  

Good news is sometimes bad news in this peculiar game that the market plays with the Federal Reserve and interest rates. Any sign of economic strength is viewed as likely to move up the start of rate hikes.

  

But the market only played that game for 15 minutes Friday. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively, after the open and then patched over the losses.

  

Problems remain, though, in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today).

  

The biggest problem for aggressive growth investors is the lack of follow-up gains. The recent pattern: Top-rated stocks break out and then dawdle.

  

The few stocks making decent progress include:

  

**G-III Apparel** ([GIII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIII)), which cleared a 60.26 buy point Tuesday, finished the breakout Wednesday and then added gains the next two days.

  

Baby and children's apparel maker **Carter's** ([CRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRI)) has been rising steadily since a February breakout. The stock cleared a 101.80 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern in late May and has added gains since.

  

E-commerce giant **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), which has shown good price and volume action since retaking a 60.24 buy point May 28.

  

These stocks are showing better action than most recent breakouts, but it's the kind of action that deserves polite applause rather than rowdy cheers.

  

Stronger follow-up action is evident in stocks that broke out earlier this year.

  

For example, semiconductor designer **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) broke out in March and is up 63% from the 63.30 buy point. **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) broke out in late January and is up 21% from its Jan. 23 opening quote. **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) broke out in early January and is 60% above a 147.49 entry.

  

Gains like that can make for a good year in a concentrated portfolio, but capturing them hasn't been easy.

  

In the coming week, the four-day Apple Worldwide Developers Conference will get underway Monday in San Francisco. **Apple's** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock is forming a base with a buy point at 133.07.

  

The right kind of news could create a breakout.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 rose 1.4%, while the Nasdaq was virtually flat. The S&P 500 shed 0.7%.

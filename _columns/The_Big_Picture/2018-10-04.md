Bears Slam Bulls For Worst Beating In Three Months
===================================================

Bears came out of hiding Thursday, delivering the worst beating to stock market bulls in more than three months.




The Nasdaq staggered to a 1.8% loss, while the S&P and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 slid 1.2%. For the Nasdaq and S&P 500, it was the worst day since late June.


Volume accelerated moderately on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq pierced its 50-day moving average, but the S&P 500 held above its support line.

With the uptrend now running at school-zone speeds, individual investors should be careful about adding a stock to the portfolio.


Investors might study their holdings with the aim of taking profits and trimming losses.


If an investor does cash in a winner, he or she should probably sell a weak stock as well. Taking profits without touching the losers can eventually lead to a portfolio of losers.


On Thursday, finding stocks that resisted the sell-off was difficult.


Only three stocks in the IBD 50 rose — **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)), up 0.9% in slow action; **Health Insurance Innovations** ([HIIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIIQ)), up 0.6% in quiet trade; and **Progressive** ([PGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGR)), up a fraction in light trading.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, losers outnumbered winners by an 11-to-2 ratio.


The day's winners included banks, railroads and defensive issues such as food.


Losers included highly rated groups, such as biotechs and software.


Bank stocks chalked up gains as [interest rates continued to climb](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/5-reasons-treasury-yields-rising-stocks-sliding/). **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) rose 1.6%. **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) climbed 1.4%. The two also advanced Wednesday, when the 10-year yield jumped to a seven-year high.


Gains in the bank stocks came as something of a surprise. Rising interest rates have been known as an all but done deal for months. Market watchers would've appeared reasonable to conclude that higher rates were baked into the bank stocks. In 2016, superregionals rose 34%. In 2017, they added 19%.


So why the reaction in the past two days?


Investors seldom get absolute clarity in the stock market. The logic of the stock market rarely coincides with the logic of humans. If it did, there would be a lot of rich professors of symbolic logic.


The stock market had other concerns apart from the 10-year yield Thursday.


Another factor that found early traction may have been based on [a disputed report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/china-spy-chips-apple-amazon/). Bloomberg Businessweek reported that China hacked **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) servers used by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Amazon slammed the story as false, adding that "There are so many inaccuracies in ‎this article as it relates to Amazon that they're hard to count."


Financial Data
--------------


Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported 55,285 planned job cuts at companies, a 44% increase from the previous month. Half of the cuts were tied to Wells Fargo, which plans to chop 5% to 10% of its workforce.

Factory orders increased 2.3%, topping views for 2.1%. The prior reading of minus 0.8% was revised to minus 0.5%.


On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release data on nonfarm payrolls. The Street expects 180,000 jobs added in September.

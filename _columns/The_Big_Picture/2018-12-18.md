A day after one of the key measures of U.S. stocks hit bear market territory, you typically would expect any newborn rally attempt to bathe in volatility. Tuesday marked such a session.


  

Stocks nearly squandered all of a decent rebound that stuck for much of the 6-1/2-hour regular trading session, even as crude oil futures got massacred. Then sellers yanked the rug out from under the bulls' legs.


At one point, the Nasdaq saw its 1.3% gain wilt into a loss of nearly 0.4% with nary an hour left of trading. But a final push by buyers sent the tech-filled composite index to a mild gain of just over 0.4% by the close.


The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, rose around 0.6%. The beaten down Philadelphia semiconductor index, or the SOX, ran up 1.3%.

The S&P SmallCap 600 edged up less than 0.2%. While volume ran at a higher pace vs. Monday for most of Tuesday's session, total trade declined by the session's end.


West Texas Intermediate oil prices tanked more than 7%. On Tuesday, at one point futures dipped to as low as $45.79 a barrel. The bear market decline in oil has now nearly reached 40%.


The thin drop in volume on Wall Street probably comes as no surprise.


Nervous Action In Stocks Ahead Of The Fed
-----------------------------------------


On Wednesday, all eyes and ears will be on Jerome Powell & Co. at the Federal Reserve. The CME Group's futures market now predicts a 69.7% probability of a quarter-point jump in short-term interest rates, the fourth this year. That would send the fed funds rate to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, up from the cellar level of 0%-0.25% for many years until the end of 2015.


Higher interest rates, of course, make it more expensive for corporations and governments to borrow money. Will higher rates down the road discourage borrowing that has helped fuel capital investment, stock buybacks, acquisitions and payment of dividends? These questions make the announcement by the Fed all the more important. Traders will definitely pick apart every potential change in the language of the statement.


Even before Wednesday's key announcement, bond traders have sharply shaved their expectations of clockwork-like rate increases in 2019.


For a while, members of the Federal Reserve showed a likelihood to raise rates three times next year. But with inflation figures coming down lately and the stock market getting pancaked by sellers since October, the probability of even a single quarter-point hike by December of 2019 has shrunk to less than 34%.


As [The Big Picture noted on Monday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gave-important-signal/), the small-cap equity indexes, namely the Russell 2000 and S&P SmallCap 600, fell into bear-market territory. The S&P MidCap 400 has come awfully close. At Tuesday's intraday low of 1689, the S&P 400 has now fallen as much as 17.7% from its all-time peak of 2052.


At this point, numerous news events could help inspire new confidence among institutional investors to see stocks as hitting discounted levels. Such news could include a surprise agreement to reduce or nix trade tariffs between the U.S. and China; more clarity on the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy; a conclusion to Brexit talks; or stronger outlooks on corporate earnings in the next few quarters.


An individual investor cannot possibly guess when any of these positive elements would take place, or even if they will happen. But the market is still the "smartest investor" out there. Why? It contains the collective real-time money decisions of millions of minds. Sure, the algos have a big impact on intraday moves. Yet while the mood remains dark, dawn always arrives in the form of intense institutional demand.


5 Things To Watch In Stocks
---------------------------


Besides a [new follow-through rally](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), look for these five elements of the market to improve before seriously considering a new deployment of your hard-earned capital.


**One: Eye the NYSE advance-decline line.** Right now, this technical tool of market breadth has shown a pronounced downtrend since the end of August. With fewer stocks rising than falling, it means the potential for new breakouts by stocks is very low. (See the advance-decline line inside the S&P 500 chart of the General Market Indicators link at the bottom of every Big Picture story.)


**Two: Watch for sector rotation.** The [IBD NYSE + Nasdaq stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) help in this regard. Utility, Food and Medical sectors rank high, signaling the market's defensive stance. But when defensive groups fade and more growth-oriented sectors rebound in the rankings, it will reflect a change in the nature of the leadership. Also look for standout industry groups that hit the top 40 within IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups.


Right now, utility, food, soap and telecom stocks occupy most rungs of the top 40 ranks. But database software, ethical drug, medical research equipment, desktop software and fiber optics stocks also rank in the top quintile.


**Three: Wait for the new lows list to shrink.**Â Plus, watch for the new highs list to stabilize. Nowadays, more than 1,000 stocks making 52-week or all-time lows has become a common refrain. On Monday's [new lows list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-dec-17-2018/), 706 stocks on the NYSE and 555 on the Nasdaq struck new lows. Just 15 names on both exchanges hit new highs.


**Four: Study key stock lists.** Start with the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and other [key stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). If more stocks show big gains in heavy volume, it means fund managers' appetite for so-called risk assets is returning.


**Five: Monitor breakouts.** Right now, they seem to have the frequency of comets and shooting stars. But at some point, quality breakouts will burst out like popcorn kernels heating up in a stovetop saucepan.


Research From S&P
-----------------


In market news, research from Howard Silverblatt of S&P Global Market Intelligence shows that the third quarter of 2018 showed record share-buybacks among S&P 500 firms. Total buybacks crossed the $200 billion mark. The value of buybacks vs. cash dividends hit a 1.76 ratio in the third quarter. That beats the 1.22 ratio in the year-ago period and the 20-year average of 1.36.

U.S. stock indexes scored weekly gains, as two big-name biotechs, **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), popped roughly 10% each for the week.


The Nasdaq advanced 0.5% Friday, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat.

Despite struggles in the previous two weeks, the three chip-industry groups rose 0.4% to 2% for the week, according to early data.


However, it was clear that biotechs were the week's main show. The group checked in with a 10% thrust for the week, second only to the solar stocks.


The solar stocks rallied on President Trump's talk of making the southern border wall a solar wall that "pays for itself," as Trump said.


The solar stock group was caught in a nasty decline from late 2014 to March 2017.


Solar has rallied the past two or three months, though it's still about 70% off its 2014 high.


Solar stocks are mostly lowly rated. Also, it isn't clear if solar panels on a border wall would be economically viable.


Economic news Friday was mixed.


The flash composite Purchasing Managers Index missed the Street's consensus number, about 1.5% lower than expected.


New-home sales for May jumped to 610,000 which topped the consensus view for 590,000. The April figure was revised upward to 593,000 vs. the prior reading of 569,000.


The homebuilder stocks had a muted reaction. The group slipped 0.8%.


On Thursday, banks passed the government stress tests without a single failure among the 34 tested, but that didn't stop the bank industry groups from posting weekly losses.


Coming Up
---------


The week will be fairly busy for economic data. On Monday, reports will include durable goods and the Chicago Fed activity index.


The most important yardstick will be offered Thursday: The governmentÂ will report the third take on first-quarter GDP. The previous two readings came in at 0.7% and 1.2%.

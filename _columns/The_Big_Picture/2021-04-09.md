  Stock Market Shrugs Off Inflation Data, Rising Bond Yields; Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 Score All-Time Closing Highs

The stock market rallied nicely into the close Friday, resulting in all-time closing highs for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100.




Nasdaq 100 futures were poised for a lower open after the Producer Price Index, a gauge of wholesale inflation, came in hotter than expected in March. Wholesale prices also jumped in China, rising 4.4% in March vs. 1.7% in February. But the stock market shrugged off the data as well as another rise in the 10-year Treasury yield, which rose 3 basis points to around 1.66%.


The [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) count was wiped clean as a result of Friday's gains. Distribution days for the S&P 500 on March 18 and March 23 were removed because the index rallied more than 5% from the closing price on each of those days. The Nasdaq's March 23 distribution day was removed for the same reason.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Strong moves for **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) and **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) helped lift the Dow Jones to a gain of 0.9%. Honeywell, which was just above a 216.80 buy point headed into Friday, gapped up and rose more than 3% after Deutsche Bank upgraded shares to buy from hold. UnitedHealth bounced off its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and reclaimed a 367.59 entry, rising 3% to 376.30.


UnitedHealth is the second highest-weighted holding of the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)), which rose 1.1%.


![MP040921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP040921-252x300.jpg)The S&P 500 made another all-time high, rising 0.8%. The index was helped by strength in [homebuilders](http://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/) like **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)). IBD's homebuilder group was the day's top performer, up around 3%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in lower than Thursday.

Nasdaq Breakout?
----------------


After a solid move above its 50-day moving average, the Nasdaq composite rose another 0.5% and is only 1% off its high. The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, gained 0.6% to 337.11. It's in position for a breakout try over its Feb. 16 high of 338.19. But several lower-volume gains haven't done much to help its weak [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-new-stock-market-leaders/) of E.


Large-cap technology stocks like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are holding gains nicely after breakouts. And the stock market continues to serve up actionable stocks almost on a daily basis.



Retail stocks also outperformed. After moving above an early entry of 101.84, **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) jumped nearly 6% in heavy volume. It closed just above its all-time high of 108.54. **Buckle** ([BKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKE)), meanwhile, added 4% to 42.94. It closed just below an alternate entry of 43.21.


Small caps lagged. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) closed almost flat as it clings to support at the 50-day moving average.


Oil and gas stocks, biotechs and chip-equipment firms lagged, although chip-equipment stocks like **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) are holding gains nicely after recent breakouts.


Financial Earnings
------------------


The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) performed in-line with the S&P 500. Eight of the fund's top-10 holdings are scheduled to report earnings in the coming week, including [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) as well as Dow Jones components **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)).

**Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)), a standout performer since its December debut at 20 a share, ended with a bullish outside day, rising 3% to 127.29. The performance was impressive considering that Upstart priced a follow-on stock offering of 2 million shares at 120. The fact that Upstart closed considerably above the offer price is a sign of strong demand for shares.


Upstart stock gapped up powerfully in March after reporting earnings. It also announced plans to buy Prodigy Software. The acquisition could be a game changer for Upstart, which operates a cloud-based lending platform using artificial intelligence. The deal will accelerate Upstart's efforts to offer AI-enabled auto loans.

When market-moving headlines are a dime a dozen, it can often result in erratic price action in the major stock indexes, and that was certainly the case Tuesday. But stocks took a decidedly negative tone on one big headline after the market close.




 The bulls eventually won out, helped by a 0.6% gain for the Nasdaq composite thanks to broad-based strength in semiconductor stocks. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average rose less than 0.1%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index did well and retook its 50-day moving average with conviction, adding 1%.


Nasdaq volume came in higher than Monday, good for an accumulation day for the composite. NYSE volume was lower. Advancers led decliners by 11-to-5 on the NYSE and by 19-to-10 on the Nasdaq.


Wall Street's first headline that fueled early premarket gains of 0.4% to 0.5% was news of a summit next month between South Korea and North Korea. South Korea said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was open to talks with the U.S. about denuclearization of the north.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP030618-183x300.png)But gains faded after reports resurfaced at the White House that President Trump's top economic advisor, Gary Cohn, might resign due to proposed steel and aluminum tariffs. The European Union early Tuesday threatened retaliatory tariffs on range of U.S. goods, including consumer, agricultural and steel products, according to a report from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-06/eu-targets-u-s-shirts-to-motorbikes-in-tariff-retaliation-plan).


Those Cohn rumors proved true. The ["globalist" Gary Cohn](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-adviser-gary-cohn-out-steel-tariffs-in-trade-war-odds-grow-sp-500-dow-jones-futures-tumble/), a strong opponent of Trump's planned tariffs, announced late Tuesday that he will resign. [S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 futures fell](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/sp-500-dow-jones-dive-late-as-trump-advisor-gary-cohn-resigns-amid-steel-tariff-move/) 1% or more in late trading.


Back to the regular session. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.5% on Tuesday, helped by strength in chip names like **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **ASML Holding** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), which ended with gains of 2% or more.

Lam Research, Applied Materials and Nvidia are members of the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), which jumped 1.8% Tuesday. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) reclaimed its 50-day moving average, rising 1.9%.


Micron extended gains after clearing a 14-week pattern Monday. Some might interpret its latest base as a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) with an earlier entry at 47.08, 10 cents above its Jan. 4 high.


Applied Materials broke out of late-stage double-bottom base with a 58.83 buy point. Volume was above average. Note that Applied Materials' latest base showed more erratic price action than prior bases. It's best to see calm, orderly price action as a stock consolidates. Lam Research is approaching a double-bottom entry of 218.58.


While price action in both Nasdaq indexes has been mostly positive, the charts of the Dow and S&P 500 show a market that's not completely out of the woods yet. Both indexes remain below the 50-day moving average, a potential resistance level to watch.


The Nasdaq might look the healthiest from a technical perspective, but keep in mind that since the Feb. 14 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/), higher-volume gains had been nonexistent until Tuesday, when there seemed to be some conviction behind the buying.


So there's that, plus the fact that [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) have been clustering, with three occurring between Feb. 27 and Mar. 1. The count currently stands at four for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. That's not a reason to start aggressively raising cash but reason enough for caution and continued disciplined trading.


All that said, breakouts continue to emerge, giving the bulls comfort.


China-based internet retailer **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) gapped out of a lengthy consolidation on strong earnings, soaring 31% to 48.21. The stock's open price of 40.83 was a legitimate entry. Wall Street liked the look of a [133% surge in quarterly profit](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/baozun-soars-toward-buy-point-as-china-online-sales-specialist-earnings-top/) and sales of $240.4 million.


Among [top-rated financials](http://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansach/), **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) cleared a 263.19 flat-base entry in light turnover, while **East West Bancorp** ([EWBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWBC)) is vying for a breakout from a flat base with a 69.35 buy point.


After the close, **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) were both lower in extended trading after reporting earnings. Urban had been holding just above a 36.20 buy point, while Ross Stores was trading below its 50-day line amid a dry-up in buying demand.

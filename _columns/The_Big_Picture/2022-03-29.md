The S&P 500 made it four consecutive gains Tuesday as the stock market grew more confident and growth stocks outperformed.




Indexes closed near session highs, as they often have since the March 14 low. The S&P 500 added 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.8% in the first back-to-back gains since the index's March 18 follow-through day.


Both indexes topped their February highs, marking another step in the market's reconstruction from this year's correction.


And in a hopeful sign for growth and tech stocks, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) broke out of a double-bottom base. Shares closed above the 176.75 buy point although volume faded and ended at its 50-day average. Still, Apple's breakout was the first among major techs since [IBD's market outlook went to "confirmed uptrend"](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-as-fed-chair-powell-grasps-this-challenge-these-areas-shine-brightest/) March 16.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP032922-268x300.jpg)Techs and growth were among Tuesday's top sectors. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) jumped 2.1%. IShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 1.8%, nearly doubling the performance of iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% and closed above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/) for the first time since Feb. 10. Consumer stocks **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) led the Dow. **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) fell 0.5% on news that it plans to acquire home-care provider **LHC Group** ([LHCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHCG)) for about [$5.4 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-to-buy-home-health-firm-lhc-group-for-5-4-billion-11648550701?mod=hp_lead_pos1). LHC shares jumped nearly 6%.


Small caps had their best day since March 16 as the Russell 2000 rallied nearly 2.7%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE as well.


Russia, Ukraine Make Progress In Talks
--------------------------------------


While multiple reasons could explain Tuesday's stock market gains, the center of it all was the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. [Representatives of the two sides said they made progress](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-and-russia-hold-talks-as-zelensky-criticizes-west-on-sanctions-arms-11648549561) after talks in Turkey. Ukraine proposed a neutral status, while Russia said it would limit its operations near Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv in the north. Fighting continued as the talks went on.


After prior talks went nowhere, Tuesday's negotiations were constructive. The U.S. stock market seemed to see an olive branch appear.


The industries and stocks that had been rallying on the consequences of the conflict found themselves out of favor Tuesday.


The price of U.S. crude oil futures slid 1.6% $104.24 a barrel. It is down 8.5% over the last two sessions, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Fewer than 20 of the 197 industry groups fell, but most were in energy, metals, fertilizers and other food-related groups. **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) slumped 5% in higher volume, but buyers pushed the stock well off session lows as the stock made a stand at its 21-day exponential moving average.



Instead, consumer industries such as apparel, leisure products, consumer loans and RVs were in the top 10 groups.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell about 8 basis points to 2.4% — the largest one-day yield decline since March 4. Investors and economists remain worried about the flattening of the yield curve and possible inversion. The 2-year yield is at 2.35%, leaving a narrow spread, and raising concerns about a possible recession for the U.S. economy.


Stock Market Improves, So What's Next?
--------------------------------------


When the S&P 500 made its follow-through, IBD advised investors to get back into the stock market gradually. That's smart in any new uptrend and especially this year, when market leadership shifted largely to cyclicals and industrials.


With the uptrend now getting its sea legs (and it's still a volatile market), investors should be increasing exposure. The challenge is deciding where to invest. If this week's trends continue, growth could be preferable to cyclicals.


As with any trade, be sure to [buy in correct buy zones](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) and use moving averages to gauge your exposure. Focus on institutional-quality stocks. Remember the sell signals to avoid damaging your portfolio.


Nearly two weeks since the S&P 500 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), there hasn't been a single [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Yet, volume has been noticeably lower since the March 18 quadruple witching session. That trend is more apparent in NYSE volume than the Nasdaq.


Stock Market's Next Test
------------------------


The 200-day line is a potential resistance level for the Nasdaq, although the S&P 500 had little trouble retaking its 200-day line last week.


This month's Conference Board index of consumer confidence rose to 107.2% from 105.7% the previous month. It was the first increase in the index in three months, BMO Capital Markets economist Jennifer Lee said in an analysis. But while the "present situation" reading jumped to an eight-month high, the "expectations" index fell for the third consecutive month, to an eight-year low.


The present situation rose due to the labor market, which is strong, Lee explained. But expectations fell because of inflation.


The Case-Shiller 20-city adjusted home price index surged 19.1% in January from a year ago. And the Federal Housing Finance Agency index also rose sharply. Increases in Phoenix, Tampa, Miami, and Dallas saw prices climb more than 27% year over year, said economist Joel Naroff. "With rates rising as well, affordability is collapsing and that does not bode well for the future of the market."

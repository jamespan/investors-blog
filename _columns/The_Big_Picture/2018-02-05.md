Stocks Slaughtered As Fear Gauge Surges; More Downside Ahead?
==============================================================

Friday was certainly a bad session for the stock market, but Monday was downright ugly as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 1,175 points, its worst point drop ever. Twenty-eight of the 30 components fell 3% or more.


 While the headlines focused on the largest point drop ever for a single day, it only came in 25th in terms of the percentage losses for the Dow going back to 1960. As recently as August 2011, during fears of a global recession, there was a drop of 5.6% on Aug. 8 followed by a 4.6% drop two days later.


Those waiting for a good shakeout got one Monday in one of the more volatile sessions in recent memory. The Dow plunged 4.6%, the S&P 500 cratered 4.1% and the Nasdaq composite swooned 3.8%. All three indexes closed below their 50-day moving averages. Nasdaq and NYSE volume was higher than Friday's levels.


Decliners beat advancers by 17-to-2 on the NYSE and by about 13-to-2 on the Nasdaq.

The Nasdaq turned positive for a bit, but it didn't take long for sellers to regain control.


It wasn't rising oil prices, or a continued advance in the 10-year Treasury yield that fueled negative sentiment. It was follow-through selling after Friday's rout that saw the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 mark another [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). The three indexes notched declines last week ranging from 3.5% to 4.1%, the worst in about two years.


The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged 87% after jumping nearly 30% Friday. It was noteworthy action, to say the least. The high at one point was more than 100% above the previous day's close, the biggest surge since the Cboe revamped its calculation in 2003.


Extreme levels of fear usually are a sign of a near-term low. We've seen unusually low readings in the last couple of years. So the injection of fear was not unexpected. The question is where does it usually go from here?


Looking at a few dates with high fear spikes:


The flash crash on May 6, 2010: After a quick rebound, the market weakened again over the next three months before starting a powerful rally on Sept. 1, 2010.


What usually happens when a near-term bottom is made and after some choppy action, a rally of 10% or more ensues. That was the case on Aug. 24, 2015, where a mini-flash crash put an already weak market into a dive. That was the bottom of a 12.5% correction in the market. There was some choppy action for the next five weeks before a rally of over 10%.


In August 2011, fears of global recession led to a spike in the VIX. A near-term bottom was made but undercut two months later after choppy action. The market quickly rebounded and started a powerful rally into the first quarter of 2012.


On Feb. 27, 2007, Shanghai started a domino effect in world markets that dropped U.S. indexes more than 3%. The index drifted slightly lower the next couple weeks before starting a rally of more than 10%.


Most recently you had a dose of fear in a very short-lived pullback after the vote to end Britain's membership in the European Union. The correction lasted all of two days before a powerful rebound.


Meanwhile, the put/call volume ratio, a contrarian market indicator, notched readings of 0.97 on Friday and 1.10 on Monday. When investors are buying more bearish puts than calls in the options market, readings of 1.15 or higher indicate excessive fear and have been seen near market bottoms in the past.


Financials lagged Monday after the Federal Reserve on Friday levied harsh sanctions against **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), citing "widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns." Shares of Wells Fargo cratered 9% to 58.16.


IBD's money-center group, which includes Dow components **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), slid nearly 4%.


Among the FANG names, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) held up the best, falling 2.8%. The Nasdaq 100 leader is still holding above the 50-day line and a 1,213.51 buy point. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) took the hardest hit, falling 5%. The Google owner crashed below the 50-day line and closed near its session low.

**IBD's TAKE**: *The M, for market direction, is the last letter in the CAN SLIM acronym, but arguably the most important part of the investing method. Buying stocks when the market is in a distribution phase is an easy way to lose money. Instead, learn to read market signals and wait for a* [*follow-through day*](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/).

After a recent break of the 50-day moving average, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) [gave up support at the 200-day line](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-flashed-these-4-sell-signals-in-two-weeks/), falling 2.5% to 156.49. It tried to clear a flat base with a 176.34 buy point, but quickly found resistance near 180.


Increasing inflation fears, a trouble spot last week for the market but not yet for the Fed, has fueled bond outflows recently, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield above 2.80%. The yield on Monday tanked 12 basis points to around 2.72%.


U.S. crude oil futures settled at $64.15 a barrel, down 2%, as Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) extended losses, falling 4%. The exchange traded fund closed just above the 200-day moving average.

Stocks Reverse Lower, Damaging Outlook
=======================================

The stock market suffered a bearish reversal Tuesday, dimming an outlook that just a few days ago looked promising.

  

In a wild session, the Nasdaq rallied nearly 2% early on but sank as much as 0.9% before it closed 0.1% lower. The S&P 500 was just as volatile, closing with a loss of 0.3%.

  

Volume rose, making it two straight days of significant declines in higher volume for the S&P 500. Although the Nasdaq's drop was too small to count as a distribution day, the way bulls were so easily pushed aside was troubling.

  

Indeed, this week's sudden burst of institutional-sized selling and sharp volatility indicated the market uptrend is under pressure. The weakened outlook calls for a reduced exposure to stocks and generally a cautious approach to the market.

  

While there are some high-rated stocks breaking out past buy points, they need to be treated with suspicion. Already, some of the breakouts of the past couple of weeks have made little progress or have sunk back into bases.

  

Despite a follow-through just last week, the market remains dogged by volatility in the new year. Although the main indexes have notched few distribution days, they have occurred soon after the follow-through rally confirmation, and that is another reason to be guarded.

  

With the indexes getting whipsawed, leading stocks have been unable to make much headway from their breakouts.

  

It's tough to be a stock picker these days. That struggle is shown in the IBD Mutual Fund Index, which has made a successive series of lower highs and is lagging the broad indexes.

  

Despite all that, most of the IBD 50 stocks aren't exactly fraying. The number of leading stocks up in volume Tuesday was surprisingly high. Some leaders are just forming bases, and more than half are still within 5% of their prior highs.

  

The IBD 50 fell 0.6% Tuesday. The small-cap Russell 2000 actually rose a fraction.

  

That may offer some hope, but it's no reason to avoid preventative measures such as getting off margin or cutting losses short.

  

Some commodities sold off again Tuesday, which many on Wall Street are taking as a cue of a slowing global economy.

  

Crude oil slid to the lowest level in nearly six years, after the United Arab Emirates' oil minister said OPEC won't cut production. Copper prices slid more than 4%.

  

Earnings reports are starting to come in, and that brings some risk because it's a time when companies confess their troubles to Wall Street.

  

A good example of that was the homebuilders. **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) warned of shrinking margins, something the company said was the start of a longer-term trend.

  

The stock is not an industry leader, but its ominous warning was enough to send a chill across the group. For an industry that was emerging as a market leader, it was a damaging takedown.

  

**Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) rose past a buy point in a cup-shaped base but closed below it. The homebuilders group was one of the day's worst performing.

  Stocks Drift To Small Losses; Apple Luster Wears Off

There used to be time when a big day for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and its chip suppliers would lift the Nasdaq to a lofty gain, but that wasn't the case Monday.


The Apple effect was true, at least for a while, but faded as stocks ended with small losses in lower volume.


The S&P 500 lost 0.2%, the Nasdaq fell 0.1% and the Dow eased less than 0.1%. The IBD 50 barely budged.


The Nasdaq closed Monday below just below its converged 50- and 200-day moving average lines. It's still technically challenged. Watch the 4822 level as a potential resistance level. The S&P 500 ended just below its 50-day line at 2061.


A key skill for any successful growth investor is to know when to be patient. The past 18 months or so have been challenging, to say the least, and the market landscape hasn't changed much. Some breakouts are working but plenty of others are not. Simply put, the odds are not in growth investors' favor at the moment -- not with the distribution-day count as high as it is on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


![MP052316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP052316-193x300.jpg)Sentiment was positive around Apple on reports of strong iPhone 7 production plans. Shares rose 1.3% in light volume. That benefited a slew of suppliers like **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)), **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), but all four gave back the bulk of early gains by the close.


Broadcom got turned away at its 50-day moving average as it works on a new base. Earnings are right around the corner, due June 2 after the close.


IBD 50 name and Apple supplier **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) held on to gains, rising nearly 9% thanks to positive comments by Goldman Sachs. Goldman upped its rating to buy from neutral and raised its price target to 76 from 55, citing the potential of big demand from Apple for the company's organic light-emitting diodes. After triggering a sell signal from a 56.01 buy point, the maker of next-generation light-emitting-diode technology is back near highs.


Among the day's movers, IBD 50 member **BroadSoft** ([BSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSFT)) barely cleared a 42.16 buy point but ended just below it. Shares rose more than 2% to 42.08 in nearly double its average trade.


Elsewhere, small-cap **Ceva** ([CEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEVA)) made an appearance in Stocks On The Move on the home page of Investors.com. Shares picked up 0.63 to 26.83 in fast turnover.


Top-rated growth names **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)) and **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) are setting up in cup-with-handle bases.


Meanwhile, the growing possibility of a rate hike at the June Fed meeting is a front-burner topic for the market.


The latest Federal Reserve commentary came from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. He told the Financial Times that the conditions for the Fed's second rate hike were "on the verge of being broadly met."


Rosengren is widely known as a Fed dove, so the reported comments appeared to carry more weight. Early last week, the odds of a rate hike at the June Fed meeting were in the low single digits, according to CME Group FedWatch. Now they're at 30%.

If you watched how some of the largest technology companies acted in the [stock market Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), you might have thought it was time to dust off the cover of Lou Gerstner Jr.'s book, "Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?"


In that book, the former RJR Nabisco CEO recounts how he helped save **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) from further decline. And in the Go-Go 1990s, IBM joined the equity bulls party. The computer and tech services giant sprang off split-adjusted lows near 10 in August 1993 and stampeded 1,270% higher to a high of 139.19 in July 1999, a mark that would be left untouched for the next 11 years.


Wednesday's session felt like a flashback to those golden days. IBM joined a fistful of other elephant-size technology stalwarts with gains of 1% or more as the Nasdaq composite led a broad rally, rising 1.1%. The action further strengthened the case that the June 30 follow-through is producing, at the very least, a tradable rally.


This point manifests itself in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), where 11 companies currently make the Leaders List.


![MP-072016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP-072016-176x300.jpg)The Nasdaq 100, which traces the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the composite, rallied 1.2%. That's well ahead of a 0.4% gain by the S&P 500 and a 0.2% lift by the Dow Jones industrial average, both of which notched all-time highs.


Volume rose on both major exchanges. It hinted that equity trading desks across the universe of mutual funds, large investment advisory firms, banks and pensions busily deployed capital.


Speaking of another tech elephant, it was **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), known affectionately by some commentators as "Mr. Softy," and not IBM that sparked the strong buying in techland Wednesday.


As reported by IBD late Tuesday, the business software titan pounded Wall Street's profit estimates for the June-ended quarter. Earnings rose 11% to 69 cents a share, smashing the 58-cent consensus forecast and matching the biggest year-over-year increase over the past 11 quarters. Executives noted that cloud-computing businesses are picking up steam and should see higher gross margins going forward.

The stock, the third largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap, catapulted more than 5% to 55.91, finishing just shy of clearing a more-than-six-month consolidation that barely meets the definition of a flat base. The current buy point is 56.87. Turnover on down days and weeks within the base should be light. As Microsoft's weekly chart shows, that's not the case, in part due to the high-volume sell-off that followed the historic June 23 Brexit referendum in the U.K.


Vigorous top-line growth is still absent at Microsoft. The stock still holds a poor Composite Rating. Yet the market has a knack for discounting news and looking six to 12 months into the future. Does it means that it's all honey and roses for Microsoft shareholders? Of course, it's too early to tell. But clearly, Microsoft is just part of an emerging story showing leadership within the vast software sector.


On Wednesday, at least six IBD software industry groups gained 1.5% or more, outrunning even the Nasdaq. They included desktop, medical, security and database. (Go to the Industry Sub-Group Rankings, found by clicking on "IBD Data Tables" nested inside "Stock Lists" on the main navigation bar of Investors.com, to see how all 197 groups performed for the day.)


**Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), an October 2013 IPO, is part of IBD's medical software group and a member of Leaderboard. The specialist in sales and marketing software for the pharmaceutical industry has grown earnings 71%, 140%, 44%, 33%, 25% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Despite that torrid growth, Veeva is still expected to post a small double-digit jump in EPS in the fiscal year ending in January.
IBM -- which has been highlighted in IBD's Income Investor column at least three times this year due to its tremendously stable earnings and above-average dividend yield (3.5% as of Wednesday) -- is mounting a new comeback of its own. Draw a long-term trend line on its weekly chart, and it appears that for now, the stock has broken a chain of lower highs and lower lows. IBM reported another weak quarter as EPS fell 23% in Q2 on a 3% dip in revenue. But Wall Street currently sees a rebound in profit next year.


As is typical during bullish sessions, defensive issues dominated the market's downside. The Dow utility average fell 0.5%. Gold mining, steel, dairy, packaged food and soap stocks also slid.


The latest survey by Investors Intelligence showed that bullishness among newsletter editors rose to 54.4%, the highest since May 2015. Bearishness sank to 23.3%. Are the pundits getting too bullish?


IBD research has found that optimism can remain high for months before the stock market takes a serious break. For now, keep your eyes open for distribution days, which are still scant on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, as well as negative reversals by leading stocks following their breakouts.


For now, as noted in the latest [Inside The IBD 50 column](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), the action by market leaders is positive. That should give stock-pickers confidence in buying stocks on solid breakouts, mild pullbacks to the 50-day or 10-week moving average, or second attempts to surpass a prior buy point.

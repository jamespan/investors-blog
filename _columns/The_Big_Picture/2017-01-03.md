  Stocks Climb To Start New Year, But Breakouts Raise Questions About Market

The major indexes recovered from a midday slump and closed higher, although some doubts remained about the stock market's direction.


After early gains evaporated, the indexes traded with losses for much of the first session of 2017. But buyers stepped in the final hour, leaving indexes at about the middle of the day's trading price range.


The Nasdaq rose nearly 0.9% and the S&P 500 0.8%. Both are trying to snap out of a sluggish performance last week. The small cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.6%.


Volume rose sharply across the board. Trading picks up after the start of the year, as much of Wall Street returns from winter break.


![mp010317](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP010317-205x300.png)The Dow Jones industrial average — which is knocking on the 20,000 milepost — added 0.6%. The three indexes broke a modest three-day losing streak.


A pair of Dow components flirted with breakouts. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) climbed past the 106.36 buy point of a base, but shares faded. The stock had already topped the 100.39 buy point of a short handle. The 106.36 entry is a better-defined buy point. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) got close enough to taste the 245.67 buy point of a four-weeks-tight pattern but stalled.


Breakouts are normally a bullish sign, but lately those have been fizzling, leaving investors with little to show for their efforts. It also makes investors question just how strong the market is.


Of about 40 stocks in IBD's database that topped buy points within the past few weeks, most are either below the entries or stalled near them. Only a few, such as **Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) and **Radware** ([RDWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDWR)), have made any measurable progress from buy points. More than a dozen are back below their entries, while a couple dozen are stuck near their buy points.


That's a significant change in character for the market. In November, a flurry of breakouts quickly bore fruit and a fortunate few reached 20% gains. Profits of that size enable investors to at least think about taking profits. But the breakout activity of the past few weeks hearkens to a time earlier in 2016 when only a minority of breakouts had success.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain hobbled by a higher-than-normal number of [distribution days](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). But nearly half of those are due to expire in the next several days. By this time next week, distribution days could be back to normal, provided no new declines in higher volume occur.


The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) has some stocks forming well-constructed bases. (See, for example, **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)), **AMN Healthcare Services** ([AMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMN)) and **Primerica** ([PRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRI)).)


Because market hasn't had a significant correction in months, the new bases are the product of sector rotation. Construction is one area that's in favor.


Financials are at the crest of a wave in that rotation. That deep leadership is also shown in the sector rankings, where savings and loans are No. 1 sector, banks No. 2 and insurance No. 5. Financials account for seven of the 10 top industry groups in IBD's 197 industry rankings.


Oil prices reversed lower after hitting 18-month highs. Worries about OPEC's willingness to carry out promised production cuts and the stronger U.S. dollar weighed on crude prices. The energy sector was one of Tuesday's weakest. Utilities and transportation shares also lagged.

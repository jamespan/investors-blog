Stocks battled to decent gains Thursday, but volume shifted to a slower gear.


The Nasdaq popped 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively.


The IBD 50 tacked on 0.4%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


The S&P 500 closed above its 50-day line for the first time since late December. The line has been declining sharply, which dims Thursday's accomplishment.


![MP022616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP022616-249x300.jpg)The Nasdaq is still under its 50-day line.


Price-volume action has been generally good in the indexes since the Feb. 11 lows. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have avoided any signs of institutional selling, and the Nasdaq has posted three days of accumulation.


Accumulation involves a gain in rising volume. Such action points to institutional buying.


Bulls want to operate in an atmosphere where funds are creating a tailwind. This lets individual investors ride the trend.


The knock on the current uptrend so far is that, while the major indexes have bounced 7% to 8% off their lows, quality leadership has been hesitant to emerge.


However, breakouts took on a less-defensive tone this week, even if quantity was still a problem.


**Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)), the airline company, crossed above a 40.23 buy point Monday and saw strong volume kick in Tuesday.


The stock is now extended from its 5% buy zone.


**Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) staged a breakaway gap Tuesday. The stock is 4% above a 40.92 buy point.


**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) followed with a breakaway gap Thursday, gaining 13% in huge volume.


Breakaway gaps involve a jump at the open that is above the prior day’s close.


Sometimes these moves occur above the buy point. In those instances, the individual investor can buy the stock above the traditional buy point.


The reason for this exception: [A gap up is extremely bullish](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-when-stock-jumps/), provided the stock has strong fundamentals.


Junky stocks sometimes gap up within a sloppy consolidation. Those rarely work.


Firearms maker **Sturm Ruger** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)) broke out of an awkward-looking base Thursday and posted a new high.


Economic news was mixed, but the main headline was bullish: Durable goods orders in January trounced expectations.


On Friday, the second take on fourth-quarter GDP will be announced before the open. The Street’s consensus number is for a 0.4% rise. The range of estimates runs from up 0.2% to up 0.8%.

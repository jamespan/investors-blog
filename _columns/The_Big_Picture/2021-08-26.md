The S&P 500 and Nasdaq broke five-day win streaks Thursday, as the stock market appears to be following a predictable trend.




The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite both lost 0.6%. Both indexes are facing some resistance as they come up against key markers. The S&P 500 is testing the 4500 level, while the Nasdaq challenges the 15,000 mark.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5% and the Russell 2000 slid 1.1%. All indexes closed near session lows, as price action continued fading.


Defensive sectors — namely utilities and real estate — performed relatively better. Real Estate Select Sector SPDR ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) rose less than 0.1%, while Utility Select Sector SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) fell 0.3%.


On the plus side, volume fell narrowly on the Nasdaq and NYSE. That kept the number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) light.


Blasts Hurt Stock Market Sentiment
----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP_3x2_082621-225x300.jpg)The Pentagon said [two suicide bombings outside the airport in the Afghanistan capital of Kabul](https://www.wsj.com/articles/afghanistan-kabul-airport-explosion-11629976397) killed a dozen U.S. service members and at least 60 Afghans. Another 15 Americans were injured, along with dozens of Afghans who were trying to enter the airport to flee the Taliban.


The blasts hurt market sentiment and further complicated a difficult situation for the U.S. government. The attacks also raise the risk of global terrorism. President Joe Biden delivered a speech to the nation about the situation in Afghanistan at 5 p.m. ET Thursday.


The stock market has been turning cautious as it awaits a speech from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell [at 10 a.m. ET Friday available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/KansasCityFed). While the topic of Powell's speech isn't exactly known, investors are keen on details about the tapering of bond purchases, which are used to keep credit plentiful.


On Thursday, the pressure to taper grew after [three Fed officials voiced support for winding down the program](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kansas-city-feds-george-suggests-tapering-start-sooner-rather-than-later-11629982199). St. Louis Fed President James Bullard says he wants to get taper going and finished by the end of the first quarter. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Kansas City Fed chief Esther George also expressed support for reducing bond buys.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has climbed 8 basis points this week, to 1.34% late Thursday. That suggests the bond market is also expecting the Fed to dial down its bond buys.


Retail Weakest Stock Market Sector
----------------------------------


The retail sector was Thursday's worst performing after several chains reported earnings. SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) slid 1.8%. But consumer demand wasn't necessarily the problem. Rather, supply chain and other issues are hitting the industry.



**Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) gapped down to a loss of 9% and sank as much as 7% below the 336.53 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Earnings beat views, but the company warned of shipping costs, Dow Jones reported.


**Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) undercut a base it was forming. Shares plunged 12% in heavy volume after the company's sales guidance missed expectations. Merchandise shipping problems are hurting Dollar Tree, and the CEO says the discount chain is more sensitive to freight costs than other retailers.


**Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) gapped down after EPS fell, but the stock pared losses. Higher freight costs shaved margins. **Abercrombie & Fitch**   ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) plummeted more than 10% after quarterly sales missed views. The apparel chain plans to keep its inventory levels lean to avoid relying on markdowns, Dow Jones reported.



Other parts of the retail sector are doing much better, however. **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), for instance, rallied after the furniture chain went 4-for-4 on its earnings report: It beat expectations, raised guidance, lifted its dividend and announced a stock buyback. Yet, the stock trimmed gains and closed below the 194.79 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


Stock Market Rebound Moderates
------------------------------


[Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rises-again-but-are-bulls-getting-tired-what-indicators-say/) noted that the stock market's rebound that began last week may already be fading. Index gains had been moderating, and Thursday's losses suggest the market could be dipping again. It's part of a fairly predictable pattern in the S&P 500, especially, that's occurring this year.


That doesn't mean investors have to turn bearish. Be aware, though, that initial gains in stock and ETF purchases can vanish before you get meaningful profits. Of course, [don't let losses grow more than 7% or 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) on any stock. But remember that stocks may go back to their [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-growth-stocks-failed-breakout/) before mounting sustained advances.


Also, keep in mind that the stock market's general trend remains upward. As long as that's the case, investors have reason to stick with stocks.

Nasdaq Makes Its Biggest Gain Since Nov. 4; Is The Stock Market Ready To Remove Its Bearish Stripes?
=====================================================================================================

Tuesday's tech-stock surge tipped this thinking on Wall Street: A three-week Nasdaq sell-off has gotten a bit excessive, at least in the short term.




However, 2021 is no different from any other year in which the markets pounded by sellers for weeks, even months, then make one giant leap higher. Such action in no way means the correction is over.


Put another way, it takes more than one big up day to change a market trend.


The S&P 500 showed a respectable advance Tuesday, up 1.4%. The large-cap benchmark retook its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). But it had risen as much as 2.1% intraday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average made it three up days in a row. It poked into new high ground for a second straight day. But the Dow's finish higher by 0.1% hinted at a lack of institutional buying thrust.


As energy, bank and industrial stocks showed muscle, the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) pushed 2.1% higher. On Friday, it staged a bullish bounce off the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Nasdaq Today: 3 Key Points
--------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP_030921-203x300.jpg)Meanwhile, here are a few reasons to take the Nasdaq composite's 3.7% jump on Tuesday with a grain of salt.


One, Tuesday marked just the third day of a new rally attempt after a three-week sell-off. A 12.5% slide from the Feb. 16 peak of 14,175 completely justifies the market's status as in a correction. Remember, a bear market is an outsize correction of at least 20% from a 52-week or all-time peak. Any slide in the 10%-19% range gets this moniker: "intermediate correction."


Yes, it's possible to get a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) — the earliest signal shown by IBD research that the market has turned — on Day 3. But they're almost as rare as a white elephant. Many [good follow-throughs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) have arrived 10 to 15 days into a new rally, or later.


Looking back to Nov. 4, the S&P 500 marked a rare [Day 3 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/), rising 2.2% that day. However, the mild down day of Oct. 30, in which the large-cap benchmark finished in the upper half of the intraday range, arguably could have been counted as the start of the rally attempt. In IBD parlance, we call that a pink rally day, signifying the color of the price bar on an Investors.com chart or at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) for down days.


Two, the Nasdaq is still looking at its 50-day moving average as a potential ceiling of upward price resistance, not as a floor of price support.


Three, the far majority of Nasdaq-listed top dogs have been wounded badly in recent weeks. It's too early to say if many of the tech leaders that thrived soon after the market followed though on April 2 last year have truly bottomed out. And they are weeks, if not months, away from sculpting a [complete base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


Why The Market's Glass Is Also Half Full
----------------------------------------


Still, Tuesday's action flashed numerous technical positives. Breadth improved. Winners on the Nasdaq outnumbered losers 3-to-1. On the NYSE, gainers topped decliners by a 3-2 ratio. In the [top half of the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), only six names fell 1% or more; at least 13 stocks rallied 1% or more.


Furthermore, smaller companies in nontech industries continue to make new setups.


The [IBD Screen of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/growth-stocks-showing-rising-profit-estimates-williams-sonoma-brunswick-svb-financial-simply-good-foods/) highlights leisure equipment giant **Brunswick** ([BC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BC)) and **Simply Good Foods** ([SMPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMPL)). Together, their $10.4 billion in combined market cap is 0.6% that of **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).



Brunswick (95 Composite Rating, 91 EPS Rating, 83 Relative Strength) got bullish support at its 10-week moving average both in the weeks ended Jan. 8 and March 5 following a [splendid breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past 74.09 in a 3-1/2-month cup.


Simply Good (88 Composite, 94 EPS, 80 RS) is less than 2% away from clearing a [shallow base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with a 32.13 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The snack food and nutrition bar company has shown solid bottom-line growth lately; earnings per share rose 28%, 30%, 33% and 32% vs. year-ago levels over the past four quarters. The [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) of 2.2 hints at net institutional buying over the past 50 sessions. Plus, most of the base formed on the north side of the 10-week moving average.

Beyond Stocks
-------------


Meanwhile, the cost of money cooled. The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell for the first time in four sessions, sinking 5 basis points to 1.54%. When bond prices rise, the corresponding yield falls. Rising bond prices indicate less concern over inflation. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ([TLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLT)) exchange traded fund rallied 1.4%.


Pay close attention to the U.S. CPI data on Wednesday before the open. [Econoday calls for a 0.4% gain in February](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), month on month, vs. a 0.3% rise in January.

After a strong finish last week, sellers were back in the stock market Monday, with large-cap technology stocks under pressure again. Chip-equipment firm **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), along with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), ended with losses of 1% to 2%.




After slumping more than 2% last week, the Nasdaq composite traded in a tight range and closed off lows, but the index still lost 0.4%. The Nasdaq 100 fell 0.6% after nearly reclaiming its 50-day moving average Friday.


The Nasdaq's April 12 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) fell off the count because enough time has passed to make it irrelevant. The S&P 500's April 14 distribution day will fall off the count Wednesday. The distribution-day count remains elevated for both indexes, but clearly the S&P 500 has the upper hand over the Nasdaq composite in terms of its technical health.


Volume rose on the NYSE, making it seven distribution days for the S&P 500. Nasdaq volume was slightly lower.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP_7x4_051721-1-240x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 slipped around 0.2% each. The Russell 2000 small-cap index edged up 0.1%. But like the Nasdaq, it's on a downtrend, stuck below its 50-day moving average.


Drug distributor **McKesson** ([MKC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKC)) was a top gainer in the S&P 500, up 2.2% to 199.36. The drug distributor found support at its nearly converged 10-day and 21-day moving average lines and reclaimed a 198.53 buy point.


**Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) also outperformed in the S&P 500, up 2.4% to 61.52. The refiner staged a bullish upside reversal Friday, closing just above a 60.03 buy point.


As money rotates out of technology stocks, oil and gas stocks have provided good leadership. Among the oil and gas producers, **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) is near the top of the 5% buy zone after a breakout from a shallow [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 26.23 buy point.



The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) ETF is still near a 54.46 buy after a low-volume breakout attempt early last week. Of the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the energy sector led the way Monday, with the energy ETF up 2.3%.


Sector Rotation
---------------


With the Nasdaq still below its 50-day moving average, the troubled tech trade still hasn't resolved itself yet. But plenty of other sectors are attracting money, including metals and financials.


The best strategy now is to avoid what's not working (large-cap technology stocks) and go with what's working (energy, financials, materials).

Keep positions small to start. The market will tell you pretty quickly if your timing was right. Add to winning positions and cut your laggards loose.


Miners did well in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). After a four-session pullback and support at the 21-day line, **BHP Group** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) added 1.6%, to 78.70. Watch for the stock to reclaim a prior 81.92 entry or break out over last week's high of 82.07. Meanwhile, **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) is also near its 21-day line as it tests a prior 88.39 buy point.


The 10-year Treasury yield edged down 3 basis points to 1.64%. The minutes from the late-April Federal Reserve meeting will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Last week, a hotter than expected reading on consumer and wholesale prices raised inflation fears. The minutes may or may not be a market mover, but the Fed's next meeting in June could see the FOMC start to taper its monthly bond-buying program.

In the regional bank group, **Truist Financial** ([TFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TFC)) and **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)) are still in buy zones.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) has been showing good action around its 10-week moving average as it holds above the 100 level.


In the retail sector, **Children's Place** ([PLCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLCE)) soared out of a cup-with-handle base, rising 16% to 90.03. The buy point was 84.33. Shares were strong after Wedbush upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral. Wedbush also raised the retailer's price target significantly, to 150.


The timing of the upgrade is interesting because Children's Place reports earnings Thursday before the open. Children's Place is a turnaround story. In the company's latest fiscal year 2021, the company lost 99 cents a share, but it's expected to earn $3.95 in its current fiscal year ending next January, with growth continuing to pick up in fiscal 2023, up 27% to $5.02.


After five straight quarters of declining sales, the Zacks consensus estimate is for sales to rise 31% to $333.33 million.

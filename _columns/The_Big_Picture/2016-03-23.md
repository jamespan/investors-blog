Market Bull Takes A Break, But Some Growth Stocks Thumb Nose At Bears

Stock market bulls took a well-deserved rest Wednesday. A broad decline raised the distribution count on both major indexes.


Yet in a curious divergence, at least a handful of growth stocks that are not yet household names refused to quit going higher. As noted in today's Market Pulse table, far more market leaders actually rose in big volume than fell.


They included innovative teens-focused retailer **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) (it has surged past a 36.59 buy point), video processor designer **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) (up 4% past a 33.16 entry), small-cap telecom software champ **BroadSoft** ([BSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSFT)) (basing) and Taiwan's **Silicon Motion Tech** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) (extended past a 34.17 entry).


Excepting Nvidia, none is a large-cap household name.


![MP032316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP032316-199x300.jpg)Wednesday's sell-off was a classic example of profit-taking by institutional equity trading desks. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.1%; volume grew nearly 9% vs. the prior session, even though this trading week is shortened by the upcoming Good Friday holiday.


The S&P 500 sank 0.6% despite mildly good news on February sales of new homes in the U.S. NYSE volume rose. Small caps fell harder; the S&P 600 slid about 1.6%. It retreated back into a loss year-to-date of less than 2%.


Significant declines in heavier volume are a signal of heavy professional selling, or distribution. A spate of such days can mean the market has topped. The Nasdaq boosted its distribution-day count back to five, since both stalling days -- on Feb. 26 and March 4 -- get equally counted according to IBD Market School rules. The other two traditional distribution days took place on March 10 (-0.3%) and March 15 (-0.5%).


A large number of distribution days doesn't necessarily mean that a tradeable rally is over. Always consider *the quality* of selling. And today, the biggest decline among the four prior distribution days was the March 15 decline of just half a percent. Compare that with the Jan. 27-to-Feb. 8 period this year, when the market got pounded with five distribution days. They included sell-offs of 2.2%, 2.1%, 3.3% and 1.8%.


The S&P 500, meanwhile, has only one distribution on the books.


It still may seem quite surprising to some investors that the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have posted five up-weeks in a row. At this point, see if the Nasdaq, the Nasdaq 100 and the NYSE composite cross back above their respective 200-day moving averages. (See a daily chart at Investors.com.) Why does this matter? Healthy markets generally trade above this long-term support line, not below it, regardless of the news headlines.


The S&P 500 reclaimed its 200-day line on March 11, eased for a few days, traversed over it again on March 16, and kept going higher.


The broadening face of the rally certainly helped. As seen in the S&P 500 big chart on Page B2, the NYSE advance-decline line has sprinted higher for five weeks in a row. That's bullish. It's flattening now. On Wednesday, losing stocks topped winners on the NYSE by nearly 3 to 1.

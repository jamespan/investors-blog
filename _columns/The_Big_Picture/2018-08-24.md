  Bulls Have A Good Day, As Nasdaq Leads The Way

Nasdaq stocks rushed north Friday, digesting a mixed durable goods report and then picking up momentum as Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell spoke in Jackson Hole, Wyo.




Powell's speech held no surprises, which apparently was good enough for the bulls.


The Nasdaq climbed 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Small caps lagged the pack, with the S&P 600 rising 0.4%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE.


Durable goods orders for July fell more than expected. But core capital goods, a gauge of business investment, blew away views for 0.5% with a 1.4% blast.

Looking ahead, the Street will be awaiting Wednesday's second take on second-quarter GDP. The first take pegged growth at 4.1%.


On Friday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 posted new highs. While that fact can draw headlines, it has little actionable meaning, other than to confirm the market's uptrend.


The distribution-day count, which points to institutional selling or the lack of it, is far more useful to investors.


Last week, headlines swirled around the age of the current bull market, which many say dates to March 2009.


Actually, the action from May 2011 to October 2011 marked a bear market, if it's defined as a decline of more than 20%. The NYSE composite fell 26%. The S&P 500 lost 21% and the Nasdaq dropped 20.3%.


A new bull market then followed.


Interpreting this accurately at the time had consequences.


For example, when the bear market bottomed, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was about to shape a new base. A bear market resets the base count, so the base was stage one. If the bear market hadn't happened, the base would've been tagged fourth stage, too late to buy.


Apple broke out and rose about 51% in almost 14 weeks.


Understanding the overall market is critical.

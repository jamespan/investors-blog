Stock Market Falls On Tariff Scare; Lululemon Leaps After Hours
================================================================

The Nasdaq composite was on track Thursday for its fifth gain in a row but a Bloomberg report on tariffs sent stocks staggering south.




Blue chips, meanwhile, continued to lag. The Dow Jones industrial average has yet to make a new high since late January. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have had no such difficulties.


The Dow carved off 0.5% Thursday, while the S&P 500 sliced off 0.4%. The Nasdaq clipped less than 0.3%. The small-cap S&P 600 eased a bit more than 0.2%.


Volume rose modestly on the Nasdaq and preliminary data showed higher NYSE volume.

The stock indexes were quietly loitering just above or below the break-even line until a Bloomberg News report jolted the bulls.


Bloomberg News reported that President Trump is ready to slap China with additional tariffs. The report, however, was based on anonymous sources. The stock market sold off on the news, but the Nasdaq kept its loss moderate.


Part of what has kept the Nasdaq on track recently is the performance of some of the top weightings in the index.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which is 7.2% of the Nasdaq, has risen in each of the past seven sessions.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which is 6.4% of the weighting, rose in each of the past five sessions.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which is 5.8% of the Nasdaq, advanced in six of the past seven sessions.


Those three stocks alone make up almost a fifth of the Nasdaq's weighting.


Apple shows [no signs of losing energy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-record-iphone-event/). Daily volume has stepped up in each of the past four sessions. On Thursday, the stock gained 0.9% in volume that was about 101% above its usual pace.


Considering that Apple's average daily volume is almost 25 million shares, the 101% spike is impressive.


Apple has a Composite Rating of 99, putting it in the top 1% of all the stocks in IBD's database. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.


Amazon.com is another stock that [shows no inclination to correct](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock/). The online retailer also carries a 99 Composite Rating. Volume has been strong in the past two sessions.


Profit-Taking Levels
--------------------


Depending on where an investor entered any of these stocks, there's a possibility of taking some profits.


Microsoft broke out in mid-December and is up 29%. Amazon broke out in the first half of January and is up about 65%. Apple had choppy action for most of the first half of the year but rose almost 15% from an opening price on a gap up on Aug. 1.


Breakouts were hard to hold together Thursday, given the indexes' action. Apparel retailer **Guess** ([GES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GES)) soared 17% but then reversed with a 6% gain for the day. Guess reported quarterly results that topped earnings estimates by more than 12%.


High tech instrument maker **Bruker** ([BRKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKR)) poked above a 35.87 buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern but then retreated back into the handle portion. Volume was below average.


Oil and gas explorer **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)) climbed above a 68.41 buy point in a double-bottom pattern. The W-shaped pattern was just a pinch too deep to be a flat base. Hess closed the session just under the buy point. Volume was below average.


Crude oil rose 63 cents to $70.14 a barrel, according to Bloomberg News.


At this juncture, the market seems more of a profit-taking story than a market rich with fresh breakouts. For some stocks, taking profits should be a consideration. Research shows that after a stock climbs 20% to 25% past its buy point, the stock often consolidates.


After The Close
---------------


After the close, **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) reported quarterly results. Earnings jumped 82%, topping views by about 45%. Revenue climbed 25%. In extended trading, Lululemon rose 8%.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) also reported after the close. The specialty retailer beat the Street's estimate on earnings but guidance was weak. The stock fell 7% in extended trading.

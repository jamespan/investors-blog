The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to a record high and other major indexes on the stock market rallied broadly Wednesday after the Federal Reserve put interest-rate cuts closer to reality.




The Dow, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 all rose 1.4%, with the latter two making 52-week highs. The Nasdaq extended gains above a congestion area basically defined by the 14,000-14,425 range.


The S&P 500 padded gains above the 4,600 level, a breakout that took the index to its highest levels since January 2022.


For the Dow Jones industrials, it was the first record high since Jan. 4, 2022.


Volume jumped on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. In the Nasdaq, trading was busiest since the Sept. 15 [witching day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/options-expiration-witching-days-do-they-place-the-market-under-a-spell-or-not/). Advancing stocks clobbered decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by 6-to-1 on the NYSE.


The IBD 50 index jumped 1.3%. And small caps easily outperformed, as the Russell 2000 roared 3.5% higher, its best day since Nov. 14.


Fed Expects Rate Cuts In 2024
-----------------------------


To no one's surprise, the fed funds rate was left unchanged at a range of 5.25%-5.5%. But policymakers' new forecasts showed rate cuts amounting to 75 basis points in 2024.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP121323-207x300.jpg)Powell acknowledged that more rate hikes are unlikely and the Fed needs to [start thinking about a weaker job market](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-tees-up-three-rate-cuts-for-2024-sp-500/). But he refused to declare victory on inflation and added that policymakers still don't want to rule out further hikes. As in prior occasions, Powell said economic data will guide the Fed's decisions.


Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch, said the Fed's comment that "inflation has eased over the past year" and the downward revision to the 2024 fed funds projection send a strong signal that the Fed believes it is close to the peak in rates.


But while the tightening bias was softened, the Fed still appears concerned about "sticky services and wage inflation and tight labor market conditions. We expect the Fed Funds rate to end next year at 4.75% (upper range), significantly higher than current market expectations."


The 10-year Treasury yield slid 17 basis points to 4.032% late Wednesday, leaving the benchmark yield at a test of its 200-day moving average for the first time since June.


Stock Market Breadth, Breakouts Increase
----------------------------------------


Wednesday's Fed-induced volatility overshadowed a larger trend in the stock market, namely the improving breadth. While the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Alphabet and other megatechs — continue to control the bulk of the stock market, smaller stocks are participating in the uptrend.


On Wednesday, more than 80 S&P 500 stocks hit 52-week highs. That's the highest number in a single day since Nov. 5, 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


In the Nasdaq and NYSE, new highs have been outpacing new lows for a few weeks. And since November, stocks up in volume exceed those down in volume. That's a significant shift because decliners in volume had the upper hand since at least September.


Indeed, one reason why the stock market has surged since November is that buyers are spreading their wealth among a larger pool of stocks. Since the Oct. 27 low, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RPS)) is up more than 16%, outperforming the S&P 500's 14.3% gain. First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) is up nearly 18%, beating the cap-weighted Nasdaq 100's 16.8% increase.


Small caps, although more volatile, have shined, with the Russell 2000 up 19%.


IBD 50 Beating Stock Market
---------------------------


The IBD 50 Index has outperformed almost all those indexes. It is up more than 18% since the market low.


**Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)), **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) and **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) are some of the IBD 50 winners of the autumn rally.


While those stocks broke out early in the uptrend, more breakouts are refueling the stock market's appetite for growth stocks.


Just in the IBD 50, **Royal Caribbean Group** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)), **SentinelOne** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)), **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)), **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **GitLab** ([GTLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLB)), **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) and **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) have emerged in the past couple of weeks.


On Wednesday, new breakouts included **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) and **Freshworks** ([FRSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRSH)).


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Amphastar Pharmaceuticals** ([AMPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMPH)) are in a smaller group of breakouts that so far have made only modest gains from buy points.

  Nasdaq Hits Another High As Three Big Stocks Give Index A Boost

The Nasdaq composite closed the week with another record high, although Friday's 0.4% increase was narrower in participation.




Technology was the best S&P sector Friday, which figured prominently in the Nasdaq's gain. Overall, declining stocks led advancers by a 2-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. Biotechs, cybersecurity and software stocks dragged on the technology-stacked composite.


But a few of the Nasdaq's largest components rose sharply Friday, which offset the weak breadth.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) — which earlier in the week became the [first stock to top a $2 trillion market cap](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-hits-2-trillion-dollar-market-cap/) — jumped more than 5%. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) added 4.5%.


**![2MP082120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2MP082120-253x300.jpg)Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) climbed 2.4%, extending a phenomenal run that's taken shares up more than 43% just in the month of August. A dividend of extra shares for a 5-for-1 stock split taking effect Aug. 31 applied to shareholders of record as of Friday.


While Apple is the largest stock, Tesla is increasingly becoming more important for the stock market as its valuation swells. At close to $400 billion in market cap, Tesla more than doubles the next largest auto stock, **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)).


Tesla Grows In Stock Market Size
--------------------------------


At the start of the year, Tesla accounted for 0.5% of the Nasdaq's total weighting. By the end of April, it was 0.8%. Today, it has grown to 1.8% of the Nasdaq, making it the sixth largest Nasdaq stock. (Nvidia is the next largest Nasdaq stock.) Tesla is not in the S&P 500, where it would also have a sizable presence.


Tesla, Apple and Nvidia — all in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) — made new highs.


The S&P 500 continued its more moderate advance with a 0.3% increase. Small caps got left out, as the Russell 2000 lost 0.8%. It was another sign that buying was concentrated in big caps. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was rose on the NYSE.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7% as it also got a boost from Apple. Dow component **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) topped the 151.77 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a cup with handle base. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), however, lags for miles.


Homebuilding Stocks Rise
------------------------


The homebuilding industry group was in the top 10 of 197 groups Friday after existing home sales in July soared 24.7%, easily beating expectations. The 5.86 million units was the highest since December 2006.


"Homeowners are seeing the strong market and are listing their houses, but with mortgage rates low and demand jumping, the supply of houses, at 3.1 months at (the) current selling rate, is the lowest on record," economist Joel Naroff noted in an analysis. "That led to a sharp rise in prices, to its highest level on record. Amazing."


Nine of the 21 stocks in the industry group are within 5% of new highs. That includes **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), just above a 37.43 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), and **Taylor Morrison** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) near a [handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) at 26.05. Homebuilders suffered some of the steepest declines in the coronavirus bear market, but several have made successful breakouts.


The Nasdaq has climbed more than 5% from the close on Aug. 11, meaning the [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for that day is now off the books. The composite is left with three distribution days and the S&P has just two. That's reason to expect the stock market advance to continue.

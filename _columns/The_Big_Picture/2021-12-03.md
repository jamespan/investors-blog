  Stock Market Woes Return; Why Investors Have More Reason To Turn Defensive

If Thursday had the makings of a bottom in the current stock market pullback, Friday was a wet blanket.




The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite sold off for the fourth time in the past six sessions, closing with losses of 0.8% and 1.9%. In doing so, the indexes undid the promising action of the prior day, and in some ways worsened the stock market's picture.


On Thursday, both indexes reversed higher and closed back above their 50-day moving averages. But buyers didn't stick around Friday, not after [November U.S. job growth came in much weaker than expected](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-unemployment-rate-dives-hiring-slows-dow-jones/).


Opening gains quickly dissolved, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are right back below their 50-day lines. The Nasdaq undercut Thursday's low and now tries to stop its plunge at the 15,000 level.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average cut early losses to 0.2% but is trying to hold at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). The Russell 2000 slid 2.1% and is now more than 12% below its prior high. That meets the traditional definition of an intermediate correction.

Stock Market Outlook Weakens
----------------------------


With the stock market still tilting toward the sellers, [IBD's market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) is now "market in correction." This requires investors to avoid new stock purchases and take some profits to reduce market exposure. Sell signals become critically important.


While losses were broad, economically sensitive sectors suffered more. Technology, consumer discretionary and financial sectors fell the most.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note extended a decline, shedding as much as 10 basis points to 1.34%, the lowest yield since Sept. 23. The yield's swoon over the past week was the steepest since mid-June 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The 2-year note's yield remains near 52-week highs, which shows the yield curve is flattening. That could indicate investors are souring on the economy. If so, the stock market could be in for a long slough.


The stock market is weak but not hopeless. Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) is still above its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). The S&P 500 has a flimsy grip on the 4500 level. [The put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) — a contrarian indicator — spiked to 1.0, to the highest since May 2020. Indexes pared some losses late in the day.


Many Leading Stocks In Trouble
------------------------------


Some megacaps are still holding up, but the rest of the stock market is in poor shape. Scores of leading stocks are tumbling, some hitting [sell signals](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) triggered sell signals after it fell more than 8% below its 659.29 buy point and broke below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume. It was Adobe's largest loss since March 16, 2020, when it fell 14.8%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.



Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) plunged 3.4%. The ETF is below its 200-day moving average, not finding the same support it got other times this year at that level.


In the IBD 50, **MP Materials** ([MP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MP)) sank 5.7% and erased an 18% gain from the 40.78 buy point, which resulted in a sell signal. An alternative entry at 38.68 is still holding up.


**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **Ares Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and **Perficient** ([PRFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRFT)) closed below the 50-day line in active trading.

Brexit Back On Front Burner As S&P 500, Nasdaq Suffer Distribution

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 might have closed in the upper half of their intraday ranges Tuesday, but it wasn't a bullish session by any means as both indexes suffered a distribution day.


Brexit worries eased for a few days headed into the July Fourth weekend as investors focused on the likelihood that Janet Yellen and the FOMC won't be raising interest rates anytime soon.


But potential fallout of the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union was back on the front burner Tuesday after the Bank of England eased special capital requirements for banks in a bid to spur lending. The British pound hit a fresh 31-year low against the U.S. dollar.


The Nasdaq pared a 1.3% midday loss but still fell 0.8%. The S&P 500 gave up 0.7% and the Dow dropped 0.6%. Small caps took a hit with the Russell 2000 down 1.5%. The IBD 50 performed relatively well, on the heels of a strong performance last week, down just 0.2%.

While a higher-volume decline isn't great to see so soon after a follow-through (which occurred Thursday), it doesn't mean the nascent rally is doomed to fail.


Using the IBD 50 as a benchmark, growth stocks are starting to show signs of life, although market leadership remains fairly pronounced in defensive areas like gold, food, utility and real estate investment trust names. The bulls would like to see safe havens like these surrender their leadership and pass the baton to growth stocks.


IBD 50 component **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) rebounded after Friday's bearish reversal. Shares rose 1.4% to 165.90. It's trying to clear a flat base with a 165.91 entry.


Meanwhile, **Vantiv** ([VNTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNTV)) added 2% to 57.56 in light volume. The payment processor is trying to break out over a 58.19 buy point from a cup-shaped base.


Tuesday's session was a stark reminder of the skittish nature of the market, where a positive headline one day can be met with a negative headline the next.


No doubt the market's been grappling with a lot of headlines lately related to the Fed, the U.S. economy, Brexit and China. Rampant uncertainty is never a good recipe for consistent profits in stocks, either on the long side or short side.


On the home front, the 10-year Treasury note hit an all-time low just below 1.36% Tuesday, before ending at 1.37%, down 7 basis points. Meanwhile, energy and materials stocks were hit hard as benchmark crude oil slumped nearly 5% to $46.60 a barrel.


Some key events loom large on the horizon. The minutes from the June 15 Fed meeting will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, Friday's jobs report could be a market mover. After paltry job growth of 38,000 in May, economists expect June nonfarm payrolls to increase by 180,000.


Three straight bullish price gains for the S&P 500 last week in above-average volume put the market back in a confirmed uptrend, but resistance levels are still out there.


The S&P 500 jumped above its 50-day line Thursday in strong volume and still held above it despite Monday's drubbing. But the 2100 level, and its recent high of 2120, could still be a tough nut to crack. The S&P has repeatedly met resistance around that level.


The Nasdaq cleared a resistance level Thursday at its nearly converged 50-day and 200-day moving average lines, but volume was light. Bulls are hoping for a heavy-volume breakout over the 5000 level for the tech-heavy index, but it has more work to do to get there.

Bolstered by a Federal Reserve that signaled it's concerned less about inflation now and more about the overall economy, stocks ditched early losses to finish with decent gains Wednesday.


The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite logged gains of 0.6% to 0.7%. In a positive technical development, the S&P 500 closed well above its long-term 200-day moving average for the first time this year.


Small caps kept up; the S&P 600 jumped 0.7%. Volume grew, a nice shift from Tuesday's action that witnessed a fresh, albeit still mild, distribution day for the Nasdaq.

Some sector indexes outperformed. The Dow Jones utilities rallied almost 1% as the U.S. central bank decided to keep the fed funds interest rate at its current target range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Higher interest rates translate to higher operating costs for utilities. The Dow transports rose almost 1.1%. Truck, railroad and airline stocks all advanced higher despite Wednesday's big gains in the crude oil futures market.


It came as little surprise for the Fed to make no move on raising the cost of money. In fact, observers note that members in the committee on Fed rate policy now likely see the fed funds rising to 1% by the end of the year and 2% by 2017. This implies that it would need just two increases of 25 basis points in 2016 to hit that target. Future FOMC meetings will be held in April, June, July, September, November and December.


While the top performing industry groups of the day primarily came from the energy and metals sectors, traditional growth stocks also rallied. But volume was largely absent. That's partly due to the listless trade that took place in the first 4-1/2 hours of Wednesday's session.


Stocks with high Composite Ratings such as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) (99 Composite, 33.16 buy point), **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) (95 Comp, 222.95) and **Fortune Brands Home & Security** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)) (97 Comp, 32.70) have surpassed their respective proper entry points. The fact that all three did so in below-average trade is understandably unnerving.


True, in most cases, a great stock market winner rushes past its proper entry in a bullish stampede of volume. But in some cases, volume does not kick in until a day or two after the actual breakout. The message? Keep watching your top stocks on your watch list like a hawk. Thursday serves as the first full-day session in response to the Fed's "take-it-slow" move.

title: Nasdaq Paces Broad Gains On Fed Minutes; Is It Time To Take Profits In This Sector?

Usually, Wall Street's trading sessions heading right up to Thanksgiving lack zest, like a zero-salt stuffing. Yet investors got active on Wednesday. The Nasdaq-led advance hinted that the still-nascent confirmed uptrend is still, well, not a turkey.




So, what counted as the bullish ingredients of Wednesday's action?


For starters, the market ended near session highs for the second day in a row.


Initially, major indexes enjoyed mild gains during the first 90 minutes of trading, then backtracked to break-even levels. But the release of minutes from the Nov. 1-2 Federal Reserve meeting added credence to the belief among traders that the U.S. central bank will, for now, take a break from raising interest rates in three-quarter-point salvos.


"There is a growing concern among Fed officials that such an aggressive tightening cycle is pushing the envelope on financial instability and could unearth some cracks in the shadow banking system," Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, commented in an email sent to IBD. "Since rate hikes operate with a lag, it's best to throttle back and assess before making more extreme moves."


Indeed, [CME Group's FedWatch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) showed the probability of a half-point jump in the fed funds rate (to a 4.25%-4.5% target range) held firmly at 75.8% vs. a 24.2% likelihood of the fifth straight 75-basis-point raise. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note slipped 5 basis points to 3.70%. That marks a 63-basis-point slide from the year-to-date peak of 4.33%.


Second, energy stocks did not dominate the market's upside.


As crude oil turned out as the day's biggest loser, falling 4.4%, the decline among exploration, field services, and oil and gas equipment firms did not besmirch the overall picture in the stock market. In fact, winners overpowered losers on the NYSE — where a host of energy firms reside — by a 5-3 margin, early data showed. And on the Nasdaq, breadth turned out mildly positive as well.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP112322-217x300.jpg)Third, IBD's key lists — from [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) to the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), from the [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) to the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) — lately are appearing to house a few more quality growth stocks that are getting closer to their 52-week highs or are holding up after breaking out. Good news for stock pickers? Absolutely.


The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite rose 1%, pacing well ahead of gains of 0.6% by the S&P 500 and almost 0.3% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Another surprise by the Nasdaq? Volume on that all-electronic exchange expanded by nearly 7% vs. the prior day.


Decent gains in higher volume should give the alert IBD reader this news: Institutions are accumulating shares — both on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. Volume fell Wednesday on the NYSE, however.


On the 30-stock Dow, 2-point gains by at least six components — including beaten-down giants **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) — offset a 3-point pullback by new biotech industry group leader **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)).


Amgen has gained momentum on encouraging news from its efforts to develop an obesity treatment.


Only three other blue chip stocks on the Dow industrials fell 1 point or more.

Healthier Technicals?
---------------------


The S&P 500, at 4027, needs to rise only 0.8% from here to make another test of resistance at the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). Its August test at the 200-day line failed horribly. However, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund, a 0.4% gainer on Wednesday, generated a decent cushion above its own 200-day on Tuesday following a 1.3% jump on that session.



As a reflection of just how hard megacap and large-cap techs have fallen this year, the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), while rising 1% on Wednesday, still would need to rally an additional 6% just to meet its own 200-day moving average.

Will This Sector Vacate Its Throne?
-----------------------------------



Looking at IBD's industry group action, those industries rallying 1.5% or more and outperforming the general indexes came from the computer, retail, farm, software and transportation fields. Enterprise software, a laggard all year, jumped 2.4%. On the opposite side, more than half of the 15 industries that sank 1% or more were energy related.


Market observers note that energy still has a relatively light weighting in the S&P 500, even after strong gains since the fourth quarter of 2020. Some believe the U.S. will have to begin refilling the country's petroleum reserve next year, and that would boost demand for so-called black gold.



Yet, are leaders in that vast sector getting tired? Pockets of strength remain.


**Flex LNG** ([FLNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLNG)) muscled out of a three-month base with a 6.7% gain to 37.96. It finished in the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) from a 37.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in volume that jumped 90% more than usual. FLNG shares are now up 62% year to date.


Compared to its energy peers in the Dow industrials, FLNG is pint-sized. Yet the company, with a $2 billion market cap and 53.1 million shares outstanding, has seen immense growth in the bottom line in recent years. Earnings fell more than 50% to 15 cents a share in 2020, the year of Covid, but then soared to $2.80 in 2021. Wall Street sees earnings climbing another 7% to $2.99 this year and 6% in 2023.


So, its 98 [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is well deserved.


Other energy plays have given back recent gains yet are still etching uptrends on their charts.



**Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) is fighting to hold its 50-day moving average. Down 1.1% on Wednesday, the Oklahoma City-based oil and gas giant triggered the 7%-loss sell rule after a brief breakout past a 75.37 entry in a shaky cup with handle.


**Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)), down 6.2% on Wednesday, offers a good example. It's tested the 50-day line a fourth time in as many weeks. Notice how its relative strength line has been falling since early October.


This recent action indicates lagging performance vs. the S&P 500. Watch to see if Denbury can hold above a prior technical resistance level in the 84-to-88 price range.



Gold Lags Nasdaq, But Still Up
------------------------------


Among other key indexes, the Russell 2000 inched 0.2% higher. At 1863, the small-cap index has gained 13.5% from its Oct. 13 low and 6.9% since the [Oct. 21 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-roars-back-to-life-amid-new-fed-hopes-these-stocks-shine-brightest/).


SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) rose 1.1% for its fourth straight day of gains; SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) rose 0.6% yet remains well below its slightly downward-sloping 200-day line. [IBD Live panelists spent plenty of time on Tuesday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) assessing chart action within IBD's gold mining industry group.


Bullishness grew to 41.7% in the latest weekly [Investors Intelligence survey of market newsletter editors](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) vs. 38.6% the prior week. A significant jump from this year's low of 25%? Certainly. Yet the bulls ratio has parachuted from a multiyear peak of 64.7% seen in early December of 2020. The point: Bullishness is sharply down, which means that plenty of cash must be sitting on the sidelines.


The bears ratio edged down to 30.5% from 32.8%.

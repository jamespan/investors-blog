Stocks Skid, Turn Back To Correction
=====================================

Stocks skidded into an ugly U-turn Friday, erasing much or all of recent gains and kicking the market back into a correction.


The Nasdaq plunged 2.6%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.3%. The IBD 50 staggered 3.6% lower.


Volume rose sharply across the board.


The Nasdaq needed just two sessions to wipe out all of its gains from a four-day win streak. The S&P 500 has held onto about half of its four-day pop.


Overall, the bearish action was enough to send the market back into correction mode. The session left little doubt that institutions were selling aggressively.


While biotech and other medical stocks recently appeared to be the target of selective selling, losses spread to other top-rated groups Friday. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the top 40 groups were almost all losers. Only two of the top 40 groups rose for the day: Wholesale-Electronics and Building-Cement.


If money was leaving the hot medicals, where was it going? At least for now, one destination appears to be cash or cash equivalents. Institutions don't always put money immediately back to work. Building new positions can take time.


Few individual stocks were making headway Friday.


Of the 495 stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or better, nine of every 10 fell. About a third of the gainers were from the oil patch. The oils might be worth a position on a watch list, but this is no time to buy any stock.


With the market in correction, defense becomes the individual investor's No. 1 concern. Sell any stock that drops 7% or 8% below your purchase price. Sell any winner if it threatens to cycle into a loss. Take profits if the stock is up 20% to 25%. And do not buy stocks as long as the market is in correction.


So far, 2014 has provided a tough climate for making money in stocks. Moves in the major indexes haven't been dramatic, and the market hasn't given bulls or bears much to work with.


Accept that reality and react accordingly. Wait patiently for the sort of market circumstances that will make gains more likely.


Economic news Friday didn't give the bulls much to build a bullish case. Nonfarm payrolls missed the Street's consensus number by about 7%, and private payrolls missed by 11%. The jobless rate also missed, coming in at 6.7% vs. views for 6.6%.


For the week, the IBD 50 fell 1.2%. The Nasdaq lost 0.7%, but the S&P 500 tacked on a gain of 0.4%.


First-quarter earnings season will begin in the coming week.

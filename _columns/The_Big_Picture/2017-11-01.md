  Bulls Maintain The Upper Hand As Indexes Yawn At Fed Statement

The Nasdaq composite couldn't keep up with the NYSE indexes Wednesday, but all in all it was a quiet session as another Federal Reserve policy statement came and went without much fanfare.




The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 eked out gains of 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite eased 0.2%. Small caps lagged badly, with the Russell 2000 down 0.7%. Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The 10-year Treasury yield was around 2.36%, down 1 basis point, after the Fed statement signaled no change from the Federal Open Market Committee's commitment to gradual rate hikes. A quarter-point hike to 1.25% to 1.5% is widely expected at the December meeting. Late Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Fed Gov. Jerome Powell will be the next Fed chief. President Trump is expected to announce the decision Thursday.


Solid premarket gains for index futures Wednesday faded just after the open, after the closely watched ISM manufacturing index came in slightly below expectations at 58.7. A smaller drop was expected from September's reading of 60.8. It wasn't a bad number by any means, because readings over 50 signify expansion.

Exploration and production firms in the energy sector outperformed as benchmark crude oil touched its highest level on an intraday basis in more than two years. U.S. crude oil futures for December delivery settled at $54.30 a barrel, down 8 cents after hitting a high of $55.22. Oil reversed after government data showed U.S. production surged to near-record highs.


**Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) gapped above the 200-day moving average, rising nearly 6% to 39.08 and **Concho Resources** ([CXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXO)) broke out over a 137.38 buy point, rising 4.5% to 140.26. **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)), meanwhile, added nearly 2% to 27.06. It's fast approaching a 27.97 buy point.


The market can certainly be counterintuitive at times, and that certainly was the case Friday when the Nasdaq surged 2.2% in higher volume, helped by strong earnings from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), among others. The strength was a welcome sign for the bulls, but not so much for the bears who have been expecting a pullback for months now.


A growing number of [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) have come before every bear market in the past, so they're important to keep monitoring. Higher-volume declines started to cluster in the Nasdaq a couple of weeks ago, but the percentage declines certainly didn't have the feel of intense institutional selling. The market remains in a confirmed uptrend until proven otherwise, but the hard part now is finding stocks still in buy range that still have the potential to be big market leaders.


Dow component and tech bellwether **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) lagged Wednesday, falling more than 1% to 166.89, ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. It cleared a 160.97 buy point Friday in heavy volume.


Security software stocks also weighed on the Nasdaq, hurt by earnings and a weak sales outlook from Nasdaq 100 name **Check Point Software Technologies** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)). Shares plunged 12.5%, giving up the 200-day moving average, a longer-term support level. Group peer and [Leaderboard](http://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) lost 2% as it tests support at the 50-day line.



Casino operators with a strong presence in China rallied on news that Macau gaming revenue in October rose 22.1%, above the 15.9% Consensus Metrix estimate. Shares of **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) rose nearly 3%; **Melco Resorts** ([MLCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLCO)) jumped 5% and **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) picked up nearly 2%.


Wynn broke out Sept. 1 and just bounced off the 10-week moving average for the first time. Las Vegas Sands' weekly chart shows a [cup-with-handle](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) base taking shape with a 65.99 buy point. Melco is slightly extended from a 23.35 buy point.


Among China names, **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) gapped above the 50-day moving average in heavy volume, rising 5%. The bullish action put the stock in a secondary buy range after a breakout over a 97.89 buy point on Aug. 7.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) added 1% to 184.60 in after-hours trading after reporting another strong quarter of bottom-line and top-line growth. But the news wasn't so good at **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) as shares slumped 4% on an earning miss.

Dow Jones, Nasdaq Close Mixed Amid Late Reversal; Is The Correction In Bitcoin Over?
=====================================================================================

The Dow Jones Industrial Average waged a bullish reversal in the final hour of trading Friday to eke out a tiny gain. The Nasdaq composite almost did the same but closed with a 0.3% loss. Regardless, heavy selling damage marketwide led to the early death of yet another confirmed uptrend.




Just three days earlier, on Tuesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq marked a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-this-positive-turn-5-keys-to-a-vigorous-rebound/). For sure, the 2.8% advance in higher, albeit below-average, volume did not particularly stand out amid the heightened day-to-day volatility since January. Nonetheless, the session still qualified as an early potential signal that the correction was over.


On Friday, the S&P 500 mirrored the Dow's action. It turned a 2.3% early afternoon loss to a fractional gain by day's end. At the low of 3810, the large-cap index has now sunk 21% below its all-time peak of 4818. That prompted mediawide reports that we're in a bear market.


As further evidence that 2022 has become the year of defensive stocks, the Dow Jones' utility average gained almost 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.2%.


Dow Jones Reverses, But So Does Market Outlook
----------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP052022-300x253.jpg)Friday marked the expiration of weekly and monthly options. Yet volume on both main exchanges got just a minor boost, up 5% to 7% vs. the prior day.


IBD has repeatedly noted that [not every follow-through works](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). And Friday's early decline proved this principle of analysis still holds true.


At Friday's low of 11,035, the composite index undercut the May 12 low of 11,108 in its nascent rally attempt. Thus, IBD's market outlook was lowered to "market in correction" following Friday's weak action.


Plus, all week long, the market offered an arid landscape in terms of breakouts.


Take **Penske Automotive** ([PAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAG)). The car dealership chain ramped out of a six-month base at 114.44. It spent three sessions above that [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But by Friday, PAG dropped 6.8% for the week. It triggered the [golden rule of IBD investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).



This rally has been the shortest after a follow-through so far this year. A March 16 follow-through by the S&P 500 lasted 14 sessions before IBD knocked the outlook down to "uptrend under pressure" on April 6 and eventually to "correction" 11 trading days later.


What's climbing? Concerns on inflation, slower economic growth, Russia's war on Ukraine, China's economy, just to name a few. Thus, cash in the portfolio continues to act as a healthy buffer.


Outside the Dow Jones and other key equity indexes, long-dated safe-haven bonds kept rallying. Thus, the yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond slid 6 basis points to 2.78%. That's down from a May 9 peak of 3.16%, Cboe data shows.

Bitcoin Bust
------------


With Bitcoin falling more than 56% off its November peak of $67,707, you've probably seen plenty of opinions on what's the next move in the digital currency. Traders have come to learn that the history of Bitcoin has a strong boom-and-bust flavor.


But could it fall any further?

If history is any guide, Bitcoin's dramatic fall is not dissimilar to the 2000-2002 dot-com bubble. After peaking at 5132, the Nasdaq, weighted heavily in tech back then as it still is now, fell 79%. The Dow Jones industrials fell 39% from its then 11,750 peak.


IBD research into decades of the stock market's biggest winners shows that once a true leading stock has peaked, it falls on average 72% from the top.

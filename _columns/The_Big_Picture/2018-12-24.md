S&P 500 In Bear Market As Stocks Extend Losses; Washington Adds To Uncertainty
===============================================================================

The final ticks on the S&P 500 on Monday made history, after it sank more than 20% to become the latest index to reach bear market depths.




The S&P 500 lost 2.7% and closed slightly more than 20% below its prior high. In doing so, the S&P 500 joined the Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 as key indexes that had already reached declines considered to be the size of a bear market.


The Nasdaq lost 2.2% in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) to expand its current decline off a 8133 all-time peak to nearly 24%. The Dow Jones industrial average, down 19% from its Oct. 3 peak, lost 2.9%.


Small caps led the indexes into the bear market, and losses in that asset class have intensified in December. The Russell 2000 is more than 27% below its prior high, and 17 percentage points of that came this month.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MP_122418-247x300.jpg)Mercifully, the stock market [closed three hours early](https://www.investors.com/news/is-the-stock-market-open-christmas-eve-chistmas-day/) for a jump start on the Christmas holiday Tuesday. Still, indexes closed at the half-session's lows and continue to nose-dive. At this point, the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) is suffering its worst decline since the 2008 financial crisis.


There were few places to hide from sellers Monday. The Dow utilities average — despite the relative allure of dividends these days — plunged 4.2%. The index had been wilting the past week, but on Monday it slid to the lowest level since June.


On a day when all 11 S&P 500 sectors fell, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) lost only 0.4%. Holiday sales are expected to climb from last year, with unemployment near a record low and consumer confidence high.


The energy sector was the worst, adding to its troubles. The price of crude oil traded [more than 6% lower, at $42.68 a barrel](https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/delayed-quotes/energy.html), late Monday. Oil prices are more than 40% off their high.


The federal government remained in a partial shutdown, but that didn't prevent Washington from adding to the market's uncertainty.


Defense stocks sold off on news that President Trump [ordered Defense Secretary James Mattis to leave his post by Jan. 1](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-defense-stocks-pentagon-james-mattis-resignation/), two months earlier than planned. Trump and Mattis have been at odds over military policy in Syria and U.S. relations with allies.


On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin [called the nation's six biggest banks](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-mnuchin-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs/) to check in and make sure their operations were normal and that they had ample liquidity. But for Wall Street, it was an unusual round of calls that raised suspicions about the financial system.


Among leading stocks, there is little left with any semblance of a proper chart. It can take months for corrections to run their course and for stocks to shape decent patterns again. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.3%.


A few real estate investment trusts that were holding up [in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) are the latest to come undone. **Ladder Capital** ([LADR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LADR)) has slid below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages in the past two weeks. It plummeted 10.3% last week.


**Rexford Industrial Realty** ([REXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REXR)) slid 5% last week and lost 3% Monday, its lowest close since April 24. **Vici Properties** ([VICI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VICI)) has plunged nearly 18% in about two weeks. **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)) tripped 4.2% lower as it [made a sharp move below the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


In a bear market, hardly any stock escapes punishment. Investors should be mostly if not entirely in cash by now. Any stock purchase in these conditions is exceedingly risky, and the worsening picture, charts-wise, for even defensive sector stocks should tell investors to stay away and wait for conditions to improve. Cash and patience will tide investors over.

Indexes Reverse Lower But Volume Declines
==========================================

The stock market reversed lower Tuesday as it continued its enigmatic behavior.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 opened higher, rising as much as 0.6%. But they started rolling over around midday and continued falling into the close.


The Nasdaq dropped 0.1%; the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slipped 0.6%. Small caps have outperformed big caps so far this year, but this week they've lagged.


Energy and transportation stocks withstood the reversal much better. Oil prices continued to rebound, adding 3.5%. The Dow transports rallied 0.5% after **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) announced that it is acquiring TNT Express for $4.8 billion in cash.


Volume fell, which meant that the market avoided a new distribution day. Yet the market remains laden with distribution: the declines in higher volume that indicate major selling by institutional investors.


With eight on each of the main indexes the past few weeks, there's enough distribution days to be concerned.


Investors should limit new stock purchases and raise cash. Taking profits is a more sensible choice than holding out for profits of 20% or more.


The market still has a chance to cure itself. As time passes, several distribution days that occurred in March will become too aged to count any longer. Of course, a reduction in distribution days won't happen if the indexes incur more of them.


Leading stocks are doing their share to keep growth investors with at least a toe in the market. Thanks to them, the market has a ledge to hang on to while it seeks direction.


Quite a few stocks that were on the IBD 50 at the start of the year have produced solid advances from their buy points.


Sell signals remain rare among the leaders, even if many advances have stalled.


Some breakouts among top-rated stocks are still emerging. On Tuesday, **Cynosure** ([CYNO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYNO)) and **Barracuda Networks** ([CUDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUDA)) were two of them. That's another way the market has vexed investors, providing new entries despite the wobbly indexes.


Tuesday, the IBD 50 rose 0.1%, in line with the major indexes.


Several IBD 50 components are forming bases. They will be the next opportunities for purchase, provided they break out in good order.


Trouble is that some of those bases are risky fourth-stage patterns. That's just a circumstance of the stage at which the bull market finds itself.


**Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)), **Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) and **Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)), a volatile Chinese stock to begin with, are in late-stage formations.


In some cases, strong leaders will make good gains from late-stage bases. For example, **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) is up 15% from a fourth-stage buy point. **Asbury Automotive** ([ABG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABG)) has climbed nearly 5% from a sixth-stage base.


Sector rotation can refresh the market by bringing emerging leaders to the forefront, and often they have earlier bases.


Some industry groups in the auto, food, building and media sectors have been rising sharply in six-month performance.

The stock market ended the week with solid gains, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 set record highs. Leading growth stocks continue to strengthen, as **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) soared on earnings, while **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) surged past a new buy point.




Indexes got off to another slow start Friday before extending gains throughout the session. The Nasdaq closed 1% higher, while the S&P 500 also moved up 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.5%.


Leading growth stocks ended with strong gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 2.6% Friday. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) advanced 5.8%, moving closer to an 81.87 buy point in double bottom with handle.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE compared with Thursday's numbers.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![MP072321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP072321-235x300.jpg)The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average extended their win streaks to four sessions Friday, an unexpected scenario following Monday's Covid-19 fueled sell-off. Those fears faded quickly. For the week, the Nasdaq advanced 2.8%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 2% and 1.1%, respectively.


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 hit all-time highs, shifting the market trend back into a confirmed uptrend. The Dow Jones industrials closed above the 35,000 level for the first time.


Keep in mind that the [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remains at an elevated level. The S&P 500 has six distribution days, while the Nasdaq's count remains at four. Another risk is that the Nasdaq and Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) are already somewhat extended from their 50-day moving average. The QQQ ETF is 6.7% above the 50-day line â€” the exact same amount before the most recent pullback.

Traders were still in party mode on a post-Thanksgiving Friday as stock market indexes ended the day, week and month higher. Up next, the latest jobs report is among the key events just around the corner.  
在感恩节后的星期五，交易员仍处于派对模式，因为股市指数在当天、每周和一个月收盘上涨。接下来，最新的就业报告是即将到来的关键事件之一。


The Nasdaq composite ended Friday's shortened session up 0.8%. This allowed the tech-heavy index to post a weekly rise of 1.1% and notch a 6.2% increase for November, its best month since May. The Nasdaq has climbed in three of the past four months and has climbed 28% for the year so far.  
纳斯达克综合指数在周五的缩短交易中收盘上涨 0.8%。这使得以科技股为主的指数每周上涨 1.1%，11 月上涨 6.2%，这是自 5 月以来最好的一个月。纳斯达克指数在过去四个月中的三个月上涨，今年迄今上涨了 28%。




The S&P 500 closed at record highs after ending the session up 0.6%. Its weekly lift came in at 1.1%, which helped escalate it 5.7% for the month. It notched its best monthly improvement since November 2023. The benchmark index is clear of all its moving averages and is now up 26.5% in 2024.  


Advancers led decliners by almost 2-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges due to the truncated trading day.  
纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克的涨幅几乎是 2 比 1。由于交易日被截断，两家交易所的成交量均有所下降。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 45,000 level for the first time after rising 0.4% Friday. This helped it to a muscular monthly lift of 7.9%, also its best since the previous November. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) turned in the best gains on the much-watched index.  
道琼斯工业平均指数在周五上涨 0.4% 后首次收于 45,000 点上方。这帮助其实现了 7.9% 的月度强劲增长，也是自去年 11 月以来的最佳水平。**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 和**波音** （[BA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA) 在备受关注的指数中涨幅最大。


Small caps moved up as well, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.4% Friday. A monthly chart underlined its stellar recent performance, with the index booking an 11% jump. Still, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) left it in the dust, rising 2.4% and surging 19.6% for the month.  


With election uncertainty out of the way and indexes sitting above short-term and major moving averages, the signs are looking positive for more gains in the final month of the year.

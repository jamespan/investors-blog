  Nasdaq, Nvidia Lead Stock Market Rebound On Easing Recession Fears

The Nasdaq composite and Nvidia led the stock market higher Thursday, as Wall Street reacted positively to a bigger-than-expected drop in the Labor Department's initial unemployment claims. That eased recession fears that had gripped Wall Street after weak economic data in recent days.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.8%, while the S&P 500 gained 2.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced 2.9%. For the S&P 500, it was the largest one-day gain since Nov. 30, 2022, per Dow Jones market data. Finally, the small-cap Russell 2000 index climbed 2.4%.


All 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with the technology, communication services, health care, industrials, consumer discretionary and energy sectors each rallying more than 2%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Gains were broad, with advancers beating decliners by a 4-1 ratio on the NYSE and by nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet. The Investor S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) jumped 1.8%, its best day of the year so far.


Early Thursday, the Labor Department said that [new claims for unemployment benefits](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobless-claims-fall-big-federal-reserve-rate-cut-sp-500/) fell 17,000 to 233,000 in the week through Aug. 3, above economists' 240,000 forecast. The ranks of people continuing to claim benefits rose 6,000 to 1.875 million in the July 27 week.


"Initial claims remain more consistent with a mild slowdown than a brewing recession for now," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He noted that the decline in initial claims from the prior week "primarily was driven by claims dropping back in Texas, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Beryl in early July."


As of Thursday evening, [markets are pricing in 55.5%](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) odds of a half-point rate cut by the close of the Sept. 18 Fed meeting, down from 69% on Wednesday and 100% during the height of Monday's market panic.

Stock Market Today
------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) were among the biggest winners Thursday, with advances of 7.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Salesforce added 59 points to the Dow's 683-point rally.


[All of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended sharply higher. Notably, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) rallied 4.2% to retake its 50-day moving average. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rebounded 6.1% and 3.7%, respectively. Both are still below their 50-day lines.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) bounced 3.1% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) surged more than 11%, ending just shy of all-time highs.


What To Do Now: Nasdaq Eyes Follow-Through Day
----------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP080824-285x300.jpg)


While Thursday's gains were constructive, they weren't able to change the status of the market outlook. It was too soon for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on the Nasdaq, which should occur on Day Four or later of a rally attempt. [Tuesday was Day One](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-snaps-3-session-losing-streak-gains-fade-risks-remain-palantir-earnings/), so Friday would be the earliest day for a follow-through rally confirmation.


Lacking that signal, IBD holds its recommended exposure level at 0%-20%.


This environment clearly puts investor emphasis on [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means that buying stocks at the moment carries excessive risk. It is important to be especially aware of sell signals within one's portfolio, such as breaches of the 50-day moving average. Staying engaged is important, and now is a good time to build up a watchlist of stocks for when the next market uptrend occurs.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list had only one stock Thursday, which makes sense given the stock market weakness. Further, there were only two names on the Near Pivot list, suggesting that buying opportunities would be scarce in the event of a follow-through day.

MercadoLibre, SharkNinja, Spotify On The Move
---------------------------------------------


Stocks to watch include **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), **SharkNinja** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)) and **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)).


[MercadoLibre is breaking out](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mercadolibre-ibd-stock-of-the-day-breakout-q2-results/) past a 1,792.05 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). MercadoLibre [stock soared 10% last Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mercadolibre-stock-soars-earnings-breakout/), after the company reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter results. The gains placed MercadoLibre as Latin America's [most valuable company](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mercadolibre-tops-estimates-profit-doubling-200819916.html) by market cap, surpassing oil giant Petrobras. Founder Marcos Galperin celebrated the milestone in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Friday. "It had to be done ... and we did it," Galperin wrote.


SharkNinja vaulted above a flat base's 80.81 buy point following strong Q2 results. SharkNinja is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) earnings options play. It was [Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/sharkninja-stock-jumps-q2-earnings-news/)


Spotify shares rallied 4.6% Thursday, [retaking a 331.08 buy point.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/spotify-stock-forecast-nvidia-microsoft-out-of-tune/)


The music streaming service continues to hit the right notes. In three out of the last four quarters, Spotify has posted triple-digit earnings growth. While each of the three is based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed a loss, the rebound is impressive. In the second quarter, [Spotify beat subscriber and profit targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-q2-2024-earnings/).


Another bullish note: The stock's relative strength line notched a new high.

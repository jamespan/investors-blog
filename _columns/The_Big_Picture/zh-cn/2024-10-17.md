  Stock Market Pauses Even As Nvidia Hits All-Time High; Netflix Jumps On Earnings Beat

The stock market rally paused Thursday, as Wall Street initially climbed on better-than-expected U.S. retail sales and unemployment data but faded into the close. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) hit a record high, propelled by [strong results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-q3-2024-earnings/) from **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)).


And late Thursday, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) rallied nearly 4% on a [strong third-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-q3-2024-earnings-nflx-stock/), sparking a modest rise in overnight tech futures.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4% and held most of the day's gains, reaching another record closing high. The S&P 500 ended one point lower after giving up moderate gains.


The Nasdaq composite closed less than 0.1% higher after being up nearly 1% earlier in the session. The small-cap Russell 2000 index declined nearly 0.3% to end a four-day win streak.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq but edged lower on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. The Nasdaq suffered a rare form of distribution, called a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/#:~:text=You%20may%20have%20heard%20the,gain%20by%20the%20day's%20close.). That's when an index closes higher but gives back the majority of its intraday gain by the day's close. That takes the Nasdaq's distribution-day count to five.


Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with utilities and communication services leading the downside. The energy and technology sector were the leaders Thursday.


In economic news, retail sales rose 0.4% in September, topping expectations of a 0.3% increase, according to the Econoday consensus forecast. August's gain was unrevised at 0.1%. Excluding autos, sales in September climbed 0.5%, above 0.1% forecasts. Factoring out both autos and gas, sales rose 0.7%, ahead of 0.3% estimates. August's gain factoring out autos and gas was revised up slightly to 0.3%.


New claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell 19,000 to 241,000 in the week ended Oct. 12, despite the hit from Hurricane Milton. That likely reflects a delay in people filing for benefits. So claims could spike next week. Wall Street had expected 260,000 new claims, up 2,000 from the prior week's initially reported figure. Initial claims in Florida fell by 3,428.

In the Dow Jones index, **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), which [reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/travelers-earnings-dow-jones-trv-stock-breakout-mmc-stock-insurance/), and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) were the biggest gainers Thursday with gains of 9% and 1.7%, respectively, on the stock market today. Travelers alone accounted for 143 points of the Dow's 161-point gain.


On the downside, **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) were the Dow losers during the session, down 1% and 0.9%, respectively.


[The Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended mostly higher as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) edged up.

What To Do Now
--------------

Despite Thursday's pause, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to perform mostly well, and IBD continues with an 80%-100% recommended exposure. As buying opportunities continue to expand, that means it's time to be aggressively invested and adding to your portfolio. And there have been a number of breakouts this week.


Also, you can always rotate out of positions that aren't working and move resources to new, better opportunities.


The current stock market environment still requires [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of theÂ [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means incrementally adding and reducing exposure to stay in sync with the broad market. Watch for sell signals and other abrupt character changes in your holdings.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured two stocks. **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) attempted to surpass an 88.26 cup-base entry. Meanwhile, there are 13 ideas appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list. That suggests that there are buying opportunities ready to emerge.

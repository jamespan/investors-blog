Small caps lagged in the stock market Tuesday, but several growth stocks outperformed once again below the surface. One of them was [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), which cleared a flat base with a 602.95 buy point in higher volume.  
周二，小盘股在股市中落后，但几只成长股再次跑赢大盘。其中之一是[排行榜](https://leaderboard.investors.com)股票 **Meta Platforms** （[META），](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)它以 602.95 的买入点在更高的成交量中清空。


The Russell 2000 small-cap index slipped 0.7% and looks poised for a test of the 2,400 level, which happens to coincide with the index's 10-day moving average. But selling was contained in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which eased 0.2%.  
罗素 2000 小盘股指数下跌 0.7%，似乎准备测试 2,400 水平，这恰好与该指数的 10 天移动平均线相吻合。但道琼斯工业平均指数（Dow Jones Industrial Average）抑制了抛售，该指数下跌了0.2%。




A 2% decline in **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) weighed down the Dow Jones index. But the weakness was largely offset by strength in technology names in the Dow like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).  
**宝洁**公司（[PG）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)下跌2%拖累了道琼斯指数。但这一疲软在很大程度上被道琼斯指数中 **Amazon.com** （[AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)）、**苹果** （[AAPL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL) 和**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 等科技股的走强所抵消。


Amazon is just past the 5% buy zone after reclaiming a 201.20 alternative buy point early last week. Now it has its sights set on another alternate entry at 215.90. Apple, meanwhile, is still in a buy zone from an entry of 237.49. But after 12 gains in 15 sessions, the stock could be ready for a pullback. Nvidia continues to hold support at its 10-week moving average  
亚马逊在上周早些时候收复 201.20 的替代买入点后，刚刚越过 5% 的买入区域。现在，它把目光投向了 215.90 的另一个替代条目。与此同时，苹果仍处于买入区域，入场价为 237.49。但在 15 个交易日上涨 12 次后，该股可能已经准备好回调。英伟达继续守住其 10 周移动平均线的支撑位


**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) edged higher in the Dow ahead of its earnings report after the close. But shares popped 5% in extended trading after the enterprise software giant reported better than expected [earnings, revenue and operating margin](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-news-q32024/).  
**Salesforce** （[CRM）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM) 在收盘后发布收益报告之前在道琼斯指数中小幅走高。但在这家企业软件巨头报告好于预期的[收益、收入和营业利润率](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-news-q32024/)后，股价在延长交易中上涨了 5%。

Some buying near the close helped lift the Nasdaq composite to a gain of 0.4% as leading growth stocks like **Astera Labs** ([ALAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALAB)), **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) ended with gains ranging from 7% to 12%.  
收盘前的一些买盘帮助纳斯达克综合指数上涨 0.4%，因为 **Astera Labs** （[ALAB）、](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALAB)**AppLovin** （[APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)） 和 **Palantir Technologies** （[PLTR）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR) 等领先成长股收盘上涨 7% 至 12%。

AppLovin was one of the first stocks out of the gate when the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 reversed sharply higher on Sept. 11. AppLovin topped a 91.91 buy point on that day, soaring 13% in huge volume, and never looked back. Two days earlier, Palantir broke out over an alternate entry of 33.13.  
AppLovin 是 9 月 11 日纳斯达克综合指数和标准普尔 500 指数大幅反转走高时最早出市的股票之一。AppLovin 当天的买入点达到 91.91 点，交易量飙升 13%，并且从未回头。两天前，Palantir 因 33.13 的替代条目而爆发。


The S&P 500 inched up less than 0.1% Tuesday. Breadth was negative on both main exchanges, but not heavily, with decliners outnumbering advancers by less than 2-to-1. Volume fell from Monday's totals.  
标准普尔 500 指数周二小幅上涨不到 0.1%。两个主要交易所的广度均为负值，但幅度不大，下跌者的数量与上涨者的数量不到 2 比 1。成交量比周一的总数有所下降。

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury reversed slightly higher after testing a key support level around 4.17%. But the yield hasn't recovered much after plunging more than 14 points on Nov. 25. That's when President-elect Donald Trump nominated Wall Street veteran Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. Bessent is expected to keep a tight leash on deficits and is also viewed as a moderate when it comes to tariffs.  
与此同时，10 年期美国国债在测试 4.17% 左右的关键支撑位后小幅走高。但收益率在 11 月 25 日暴跌超过 14 个点后并未大幅回升。就在那时，当选总统唐纳德·特朗普提名华尔街资深人士斯科特·贝森特（Scott Bessent）担任财政部长。预计 Bessent 将严格控制赤字，并且在关税方面也被视为温和派。


The odds for another 25-basis-point cut at the Dec. 17-18 Federal Reserve policy meeting have increased in recent days. Traders now see a 70% chance of a rate cut after Fed Gov. Christopher Waller on Monday said he's leaning toward a rate cut. But he said he's also concerned about sticky inflation.  
最近几天，美联储在 12 月 17 日至 18 日的政策会议上再次降息 25 个基点的可能性有所增加。在美联储理事克里斯托弗·沃勒 （Christopher Waller） 周一表示他倾向于降息后，交易员现在认为降息的可能性为 70%。但他表示，他也担心粘性通胀。


Last week, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, came in at a 2.8% annual increase. That was in line with estimates, but above September's reading of 2.7%. It's the number the Fed wants to see closer to 2%.  
上周，美联储首选的通胀指标核心个人消费支出 （PCE） 指数年增长率为 2.8%。这与预期一致，但高于 9 月份 2.7% 的读数。这是美联储希望看到的接近 2% 的数字。


What To Do Now 现在该做什么
---------------------


The stock market uptrend continues to show signs of underlying strength, but the crop of actionable stocks has gotten a lot smaller. As noted earlier, the big leaders started coming out in September. Leaderboard added **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) and Meta Platforms on Sept. 13. **Axon Enterprise** ([AXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXO)) was added on Sept. 12.  
股市上涨趋势继续显示出潜在实力的迹象，但可操作股票的产量已经大大减少。如前所述，大龙头从 9 月开始出现。Leaderboard 于 9 月 13 日添加了 **DoorDash** （[DASH）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH) 和 Meta Platforms。**Axon Enterprise** （[AXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXO)） 于 9 月 12 日添加。


There's not much to do if you're holding some big winners since September. But if you've trimmed some winners, reallocating capital has become more challenging. If you see a stock building a base that's near a proper buy point, make sure it's one of the leaders in the group. The risk now is that stocks building bases could be the laggard performers in a group.  
如果您自 9 月以来持有一些大赢家，则无需太多工作。但是，如果你削减了一些赢家，重新分配资本就变得更具挑战性。如果您看到一只股票在适当的买入点附近建立基础，请确保它是该组中的领导者之一。现在的风险是，建立基础的股票可能是一组中表现落后的股票。


In the enterprise software group, **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)) offers a good example. The stock on Tuesday cleared an early entry in an eight-week base, but it's generally been a laggard with a middling [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-relative-strength/) of 76.  
在企业软件组中，**Manhattan Associates** （[MANH）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH) 就是一个很好的例子。该股周二在八周底部早盘入场，但总体上落后，[相对强弱评级](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-relative-strength/)为 76 分。


Buying leaders on pullbacks is perfectly sound strategy. The issue here is that with so many extended stocks, most are still holding well above their 50-day and 10-week lines. Buying a group leader after a pullback to the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has generally worked well. But it's a riskier entry.  
在回调时买入领先者是完全合理的策略。这里的问题是，由于有这么多延长的股票，大多数股票仍然远高于其 50 天和 10 周线。在回调至 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)后买入组长通常效果很好。但这是一个风险更大的入口。



**Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), **Fiverr** ([FVRR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FVRR)), **Macom Technology** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) and oil and gas producer **LandBridge** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)) are recent examples of stocks that have done well after recent bounces off the 21-day line.  
**Duolingo** （[DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)）、**Fiverr** （[FVRR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FVRR)）、**Macom Technology** （[MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)） 和石油和天然气生产商 **LandBridge** （[LB）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB) 是最近从 21 日线反弹后表现良好的股票。


**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), meanwhile, is still a stock market leader as it tests support at the 10-week line for the second time after an earnings breakout Sept. 10.  
与此同时，**甲骨文** （[ORCL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL) 仍然是股市领导者，因为它在 9 月 10 日财报突破后第二次测试 10 周线的支撑位。


In the semiconductor sector, chip foundry **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) gave a buy signal Monday when it jumped above its 50-day line.  
在半导体板块，芯片代工**公司台积电** （[TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)） 周一跳升至 50 日线上方，发出买入信号。

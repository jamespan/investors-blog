Dull. Mixed. Wishy-washy. Confusing. Slightly more skittish than usual. These words, and perhaps a handful of others, describe how the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) acted Monday.  
钝痛。 混合。 如意。 混乱。 比平时稍微多了些不安。这些词，也许还有其他几个词，描述了[周一股市的表现](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)。




And who could blame Wall Street? Monday's apathetic moves, both on the upside and downside, reflected a lack of confidence in what the result will be in Tuesday's historic U.S. presidential election.  
谁又能责怪华尔街呢？周一的上行和下行都无动于衷，反映出人们对周二历史性的美国总统大选的结果缺乏信心。


Of course, there's more at stake than the possibility of a first woman president or the return of a former president to the White House.  
当然，除了第一位女总统或前总统重返白宫的可能性之外，还有更多的利害关系。


Investors and stock market strategists will be closely watching pivotal congressional races, from the Senate race in Montana to a number of New York seats in the House of Representatives, to determine if the majority shifts in either house of Congress, or even both.  
投资者和股市策略师将密切关注关键的国会竞选，从蒙大拿州的参议院竞选到纽约州众议院的一些席位，以确定国会两院的多数席位是否会发生变化。


Stock Market Today 今日股市
-----------------------


The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both fell 0.3% on Monday.  
纳斯达克综合指数和标准普尔 500 指数周一均下跌 0.3%。



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP110424-186x300.jpg)Particularly on the S&P 500, Monday's action was disappointing after last Thursday's sell-off in heavy turnover. A daily chart on [IBD MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/market/etfmarketstrategy) shows how the large-cap index finished below the 21-day exponential moving average for the third day in a row.  
特别是在标准普尔 500 指数上，在上周四的大量成交量抛售后，周一的行动令人失望。[IBD MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) 和 [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/market/etfmarketstrategy) 上的日线图显示了大盘股指数如何连续第三天收于 21 天指数移动平均线下方。


The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq briefly spent time on Monday in positive territory, yet the trade was arguably rangebound all session long.  
标准普尔 500 指数和纳斯达克指数周一短暂处于上涨区域，但可以说整个交易日都在区间震荡。


One could argue that skittishness extended into the bond markets too. Investors scooped up long-dated U.S. Treasuries. Thus, the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond sank five basis points to 4.30%. It had fallen to as low as 4.26%.  
有人可能会说，不安情绪也延伸到了债券市场。投资者大量买入长期美国国债。因此，基准 10 年期政府债券的收益率下跌 5 个基点至 4.30%。它已跌至 4.26% 的低点。


Nonetheless, long-dated Treasuries actually show a losing year so far. The 10-year yield started in 2024 at 3.86%. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to conduct its second rate cut this year.  
尽管如此，长期美国国债实际上显示出迄今为止的亏损。10 年期国债收益率从 2024 年开始为 3.86%。周四，市场普遍预计美联储将进行今年的第二次降息。


A Key Technical Level
---------------------


Monday's action also highlighted a test of support at the S&P 500's rising 50-day moving average. In fact, this week could mark the third time in which the S&P 500 falls below its 50-day line in the second half of the year. In the first half, the index tested buyers at or near the 50-day line just once, over a three-week time span from April 15 through May 3.  


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost the most among the major stock market indexes, down 0.6%. Perhaps surprising some investors, blue chips in the banking and financial sectors led the downside. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) in the Dow Jones both dropped more than 1%. Both components also took out their 21-day lines.  


Amid these declines, it was somewhat puzzling to see smaller issues actually thrive on Monday. The Russell 2000 gained 0.5%, while the S&P MidCap 400 eked out a 0.3% rise.  


Did oil and gas and other energy companies help the cause? Perhaps so. Some industrial and cyclical firms also shined brightly. Looking at IBD's industry groups, solar, oil machinery, oil drilling, oil and gas field services, building maintenance and agricultural chemical stocks jumped 2.4% or more for the day.

Recent Institutional Selling
----------------------------


Despite a slightly bearish tone to Monday's stock market, institutions didn't exactly flood the exits either.  


Volume fell 5% on the NYSE to 3.6 billion shares, while turnover cooled around 2% vs. the prior session to 5.76 billion shares on the Nasdaq. Therefore, [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) wasn't apparent. Nevertheless, the accompanying Market Pulse highlights an elevated level of intense professional selling.  


Indeed, when you consider the average decline among the S&P 500's distribution days is a pretty meaty 1.2% (down 1% on Oct. 7, 0.8% on Oct. 15, 0.9% on Oct. 23, and 1.9% on Oct. 31), it's certainly not time to become complacent about stock market behavior.  


Beyond The Market: Exercise Caution Here
----------------------------------------


In fact, volatility is showing a bigger bump higher.  


The Cboe Market Volatility Index has gained ground in three of the past four sessions. On Monday, the VIX edged up 0.5% to 21.98. Relatively speaking, that's still a depressed level compared with its spikes in recent years. During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic bear market, the VIX exploded to as high as 85.47 in March 2020.  


Brett Friedman, a contributor at Winhall Risk Analytics and OptionMetrics, notes that pre-election implied volatility in S&P 500 options jumped by 6.8% during an average election year from 1996 through 2023 vs. a 1.8% drop during nonelection years. The study covered trading over 10 days prior to Nov. 5.  
Winhall Risk Analytics 和 OptionMetrics 的撰稿人 Brett Friedman 指出，在 1996 年至 2023 年的平均选举年，标准普尔 500 指数期权的选前隐含波动率跃升了 6.8%，而非选举年则下跌了 1.8%。该研究涵盖了 11 月 5 日之前超过 10 天的交易。


Friedman, who has built a career in financial risk management for more than three decades, has also found that since 1996, the stock market has tended to perform relatively better during non-election years from Nov. 6 through Dec. 31 than in election years. Specifically, Friedman shared this figures with IBD:  


* Post-Election Return (Nov. 6 to Dec. 31): average gain of 0.9% in election years vs. 1.8% gain in non-election years
* Post-Election Return (Nov. 6 to Dec. 31): median gain of 1.4% in election years vs. 2.6% in non-election years


"Some skepticism is merited," Friedman commented. "The comparison between election years and non-election years, whether in relation to return or implied volatility, is inconsistent and partially skewed by the extreme results recorded in 2008. The difference between average and median results reflects this."  
“有些怀疑是值得的，”弗里德曼评论道。“选举年和非选举年之间的比较，无论是与回报还是隐含波动率有关，都是不一致的，并且部分被 2008 年记录的极端结果所扭曲。平均结果和中位数结果之间的差异反映了这一点。


Friedman adds research how on the stock market behaves before and after elections should be taken with a large grain of salt. Why? Consider the risks of drawing conclusions from small sample sizes. He notes that since the introduction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896, America has had 33 presidential elections while his analysis above includes just seven White House contests. "The limited number of observations makes it difficult to draw firm, statistically valid conclusions, let alone to base trading strategies on the results," Friedman said.  


Three Sectors To Eye In The Stock Market
----------------------------------------


Meanwhile, three areas of the stock market showed poor action to warrant extra caution among active stock traders.  


First, recent breakouts by small-cap growth stocks have not done particularly well.  


Take **TG Therapeutics** ([TGTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGTX)). The small-cap biotech firm, which reported a 49% plunge in third-quarter sales Monday, nose-dived 9% in heavy turnover to 24.36. TG Therapeutics also dropped more than 7%, triggering a [defensive sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), after breaking out of a narrow cup at 26.41 just one day ago.  


Weak Group Action
-----------------


Second, some gold and silver miners took big hits.  


**Idaho Strategic Resources** ([IDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDR)) collapsed despite a strong third-quarter report (EPS up 400%, revenue up 86%). The microcap fell more than 15% to 13.39 in more than double its usual turnover and undercut its rising 50-day line. The stock in August broke out of a [well-formed base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/) with an 11.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and climbed as much as 55%.  


Gold itself continues to move steadily higher. But in the gold and silver mining group, **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) and **Newmont** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) have also pierced their 50-day moving averages, a bearish sign in the near term.  


Finally, amid news that it could get more difficult for data centers to extract power from the nation's nuclear power plants to fuel their operations, utility stocks tanked. For months, Utilities Select SPDR Sector ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) acted like a [stock market leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). But on Monday, the ETF dropped further below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) with a 1.2% slide in heavy trading.  


That action triggered a [profit-taking sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). The [ETF exited Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Monday. It also fell for the eighth time in 11 sessions.

  Small Caps Shine In Stock Market, But Equal-Weighted S&P 500 Gauge Does Fine; This Is The Biggest Risk Factor Now	小盘股在股市大放异彩，但等权重标准普尔 500 指数表现良好;这是现在最大的风险因素

After a tremendous rush of buying last week, the stock market showed at least two key themes on Monday. One, investors still showed a bullish appetite for small caps. And two, traders decided to digest some profits among larger stocks.  
在上周的大量购买热潮之后，股市周一至少出现了两个关键主题。首先，投资者仍然表现出对小盘股的看涨兴趣。第二，交易员决定从较大的股票中消化一些利润。




A daily look at how the indexes acted serves a useful purpose for the above reason, even if IBD readers prefer to trade stocks, not stock market benchmarks. While the Nasdaq 100 edged a fraction of a point lower, it did fall back from an opening high of 21,182, a brand-new record. Yet a 10-point loss by the Nasdaq 100 doesn't even qualify as a pinprick compared with gains of more than 5.7% over the prior four trading days.  
出于上述原因，每天查看指数的行为具有有用的目的，即使 IBD 读者更喜欢交易股票，而不是股票市场基准。虽然纳斯达克 100 指数小幅下跌了一点点，但它确实从开盘高点 21,182 点回落，创下了全新纪录。然而，纳斯达克 100 指数下跌 10 点甚至不符合针刺的条件，而前四个交易日的涨幅超过 5.7%。


The S&P 500, meanwhile, strode to a new high of 6,017 on Monday before easing to 6,001, up only 0.1%. That gain adds minimally to last week's 4.7% catapult on the results of U.S. elections last Tuesday.  
与此同时，标准普尔 500 指数周一飙升至 6,017 点的新高，然后回落至 6,001 点，仅上涨 0.1%。这一增长略微增加了上周上周二美国大选结果的 4.7% 的反弹。


A close look at the weekly chart of the S&P 500 is worthwhile. Notice how the large-cap index refused to fall below its rising 10-week moving average (plotted in red on IBD weekly charts).  
仔细查看标准普尔 500 指数的周线图是值得的。请注意大盘股指数如何拒绝跌破其上升的 10 周移动平均线（在 IBD 周线图上以红色绘制）。

Stock Market Today 今日股市
-----------------------



Action among the [Magnificent Seven megacaps](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) was decisively mixed. This hurt the S&P 500, which is market cap-weighted. So, it's worth noting too that the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ETF did better, rallying 0.5% and marking its seventh straight win.  
[Magnificent Seven Megacap](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) 之间的行动决定性地喜忧参半。这损害了市值加权的标准普尔 500 指数。因此，值得注意的是，景顺标准普尔 500 等权重 （[RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)） ETF 表现更好，上涨 0.5%，连续第七次上涨。


Still, the star of Monday's stock market was the mighty mites on Wall Street. The Russell 2000 rose 1.5% on Monday, on top of a 8.6% explosive move higher last week. At 2,434, the Russell stands only 1% away from taking out its Nov. 8, 2021, peak of 2,458.86.  
尽管如此，周一股市的明星还是华尔街的巨螨。罗素 2000 指数周一上涨 1.5%，上周上涨 8.6%。罗素指数收于 2,434 点，距离打破 2021 年 11 月 8 日的峰值 2,458.86 点仅差 1%。


A Historical View Of Russell 2000罗素 2000 指数的历史观点
------------------------------------------------


In "Stock Trader's Almanac 2024," coauthor Jeffrey Hirsch noted that research on the Russell 2000 from 1979 to 2022 shows an average gain of 3.2% from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving (Nov. 26 this year) and the second day of the new trading year. The median gain: 3.27%. The figures include 34 up periods and 10 down periods, resulting in a win rate of 77.3%.  
在《股票交易员年鉴 2024》中，合著者杰弗里·赫希 （Jeffrey Hirsch） 指出，对 1979 年至 2022 年罗素 2000 指数的研究显示，从感恩节前的星期二（今年 11 月 26 日）到新交易年的第二天，平均上涨了 3.2%。中位数增益：3.27%。这些数字包括 34 个上涨期和 10 个下跌期，胜率为 77.3%。



Amid years in which the Russell rallied over this time frame, the average gain of 4.98% stood tall vs. an average loss of 2.89%.  
在罗素指数在此期间反弹的几年里，平均上涨 4.98%，而平均亏损 2.89%。


Hirsch credits work by his late father and Trader's Almanac founder, Yale Hirsch, and options expert and newsletter writer Larry McMillan for developing this timing strategy.  
Hirsch 将开发这种择时策略归功于他已故的父亲兼 Trader's Almanac 创始人 Yale Hirsch 和期权专家兼时事通讯作者 Larry McMillan 的工作。


"Thanksgiving kicks off a run of solid bullish seasonal patterns. November-January is the year's best consecutive three-month span," Jeffrey Hirsch wrote. "Then there's the January Effect of small caps outperforming large caps in January, which nowadays begins in mid-December. And of course, the 'Santa Claus Rally,' invented and named by our late founder Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac and often misunderstood, is the short, sweet rally that runs from the last five trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year."  
“感恩节开启了一系列坚实的看涨季节性模式。11 月至 1 月是今年最好的连续三个月跨度，“杰弗里·赫希 （Jeffrey Hirsch） 写道。“然后是 1 月份小盘股跑赢大盘股的 1 月效应，现在从 12 月中旬开始。当然，'圣诞老人拉力赛'由我们已故的创始人 Yale Hirsch 于 1972 年在年鉴中发明并命名，但经常被误解，是从一年的最后五个交易日到新年的前两个交易日的短暂而甜蜜的反弹。


Meanwhile, the "value" components of the stock market appeared to generally outperform.  
与此同时，股市的“价值”成分股似乎普遍跑赢大盘。


Looking at the 1,000 largest stocks covered by the Russell indexes, iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) advanced nearly 0.6%. That easily beat a 15-cent loss, less than 0.1%, by iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)).  
从罗素指数涵盖的 1,000 只最大的股票来看，iShares Russell 1000 Value （[IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)） 上涨近 0.6%。这轻松击败了 iShares Russell 1000 Growth （[IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)） 的 15 美分跌幅，跌幅不到 0.1%。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average grew nearly 0.7%. A related sector index did even better: The Dow transportation average rallied 1.2% amid a sharp drop in crude oil prices. Gasoline futures fell 2.6% and finished the day at $1.96 a gallon.  
道琼斯工业平均指数上涨近 0.7%。相关行业指数表现更好：在原油价格大幅下跌的情况下，道琼斯平均运输平均指数上涨 1.2%。汽油期货下跌 2.6%，收于每加仑 1.96 美元。

Mixed Stock Market Turnover混合股票市场成交量
------------------------------------


Volume grew on the Nasdaq while turnover on the NYSE declined from Friday's levels.  
纳斯达克的成交量有所增长，而纽约证券交易所的成交量较上周五的水平下降。


The higher turnover posed a small concern for the Nasdaq, as it appeared as if some traders sold into the early advance of today's stock market. Such action is typical for a stalling session. However, the Nasdaq finished above the upper 50% range of Monday's trading. Hence, based on [Market School rules](https://get.investors.com/online-courses/market-school/), the close did not meet the requirement for this type of distribution.  
较高的成交量对纳斯达克来说是一个小小的担忧，因为似乎一些交易员在今天股市的早期上涨时抛售。此类操作对于停滞会话来说是典型的。然而，纳斯达克指数收于周一交易的 50% 以上区间上方。因此，根据 [Market School 规则](https://get.investors.com/online-courses/market-school/)，结算不符合此类分配的要求。


Either way, as the Market Pulse illustrates, the distribution-day count for the Nasdaq had gotten wiped totally clean in recent sessions. That's due to the powerful rally that began on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, with just two institutional-level sell-offs on its books over a rolling 25-session count, indicates that the buyers are more energetic than the sellers.  
无论哪种情况，正如 Market Pulse 所显示的那样，纳斯达克的发行日计数在最近几个交易日已经完全消失了。这是由于周三开始的强劲反弹。与此同时，标准普尔 500 指数在连续 25 个交易日的统计中只有两次机构层面的抛售，这表明买家比卖家更有活力。


When the [Aug. 13 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dow-jones-sp500-nasdaq-inflation-starbucks-chipotle/) took place, the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were at a D grade or worse. The rating tracks 13 weeks of price-and-volume action. In selecting stocks, you'd much prefer to see candidates show a grade better than C, which is neutral.  
当 [8 月 13 日的后续交易日](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dow-jones-sp500-nasdaq-inflation-starbucks-chipotle/)发生时，纳斯达克和标准普尔 500 指数的累积/派发评级都处于 D 级或更差。该评级跟踪了 13 周的价格和数量行动。在选择股票时，您更希望看到候选人的评级优于 C，而 C 是中性的。


Yet in terms of the indexes, it's actually not uncommon to see a very poor A/D rating at the start of strong tradable rallies.  
然而，就指数而言，在强劲的可交易反弹开始时看到非常糟糕的 A/D 评级实际上并不少见。


Headed into Monday's stock market action, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 held a [B Accumulation grade](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI_110824.pdf).  
在周一的股市走势中，纳斯达克指数和标准普尔 500 指数均持有 [B 级累积评级](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI_110824.pdf)。


Since that pivotal session on Aug. 13, the Nasdaq has risen about 20%, the S&P 500 10.4% and the Russell 2000 16.2%.  
自 8 月 13 日那个关键交易日以来，纳斯达克指数上涨了约 20%，标准普尔 500 指数上涨了 10.4%，罗素 2000 指数上涨了 16.2%。

Industry Groups Today 当今的行业团体
-----------------------------


A look at the day's leading industries reflected what has been gradually happening throughout the year: Leadership in the stock market is broadening.  
对当天的领先行业进行回顾，反映了全年逐渐发生的事情：股市的领导地位正在扩大。


As many as 31 industries covered by IBD rose 2% or more. They spanned from automakers (the best, up 6.6% on a price-weighted basis) and trucking (up 2.5%) to Midwest banks (up 3.3%) and investment banks (up 2.4%).  
IBD 涵盖的多达 31 个行业上涨了 2% 或更多。它们涵盖汽车制造商（最好的，按价格加权计算上涨 6.6%）和卡车运输（上涨 2.5%），以及中西部银行（上涨 3.3%）和投资银行（上涨 2.4%）。


**Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), operator of a host of brand name RVs such as Airstream, is not a stock market leader yet. But the cyclical spending play attempted a breakout from an [early-stage cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/) that offers a 115.86 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Thor rose 5.6% to 114.91 in average turnover and paced the Building-Mobile Manufacturing and Recreational Vehicle industry group to a market-beating 2.3% rise.  
**Thor Industries** （[THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)） 是 Airstream 等众多品牌房车的运营商，目前还不是股市的领导者。但周期性支出游戏试图从提供 115.86 [买入点](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)的早期[杯子](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/)中突破。Thor 的平均成交额增长 5.6% 至 114.91 美元，并带领建筑移动制造和休闲车行业组以 2.3% 的涨幅领先市场。


As the Treasury bond yield curve continues to bend more positively in favor of lenders, it's likely no surprise that banks of all shapes and geographies have been doing so well.  
随着美国国债收益率曲线继续向有利于贷方的方向弯曲，各种形式和地区的银行都表现如此出色也就不足为奇了。



With less than two months left in the year, what are real risks to the current rally?  
今年还剩下不到两个月的时间，当前反弹的真正风险是什么？


What's Your 'Giddy Level'?你的“眩晕程度”是多少？
--------------------------------------


One area to watch within the stock market? Eye signs of excessive optimism. Are we there yet? Likely not.  
股市中值得关注的一个领域？过度乐观的眼球迹象。我们到达了吗？可能不会。


[Margin debt in September](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=margindebt) grew 19% vs. year ago levels. That's clear evidence that the animal spirits are rising. Yet it's nowhere near levels seen in March 2021, when the amount of money borrowed by investors to speculate in stocks shot to 71%.  
[9 月份的保证金债务](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=margindebt)与去年同期相比增长了 19%。这是动物精神正在崛起的明显证据。然而，这与 2021 年 3 月的水平相去甚远，当时投资者为投机股票而借入的资金量飙升至 71%。


As noted on the chart, IBD states that the "year-over-year percentage change in margin debt can help flag major tops in bull markets. This contrarian sentiment indicator will exceed 55% when optimism runs rampant on Wall Street and investors are heavily borrowing money during the late stages of a bull market."  
如图所示，IBD 指出，“保证金债务的同比百分比变化有助于在牛市中标记主要顶部。当华尔街的乐观情绪猖獗，投资者在牛市后期大量借款时，这个逆向情绪指标将超过 55%。

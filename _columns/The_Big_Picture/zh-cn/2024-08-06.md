The stock market bounced back Tuesday after three straight days of sharp declines. But 1% gains for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 — and some late-session selling — weren't enough to lift the market out of its corrective phase.  
股市在连续三天大幅下跌后于周二反弹。但纳斯达克综合指数和标准普尔 500 指数上涨 1%，以及一些尾盘抛售，不足以将市场从修正阶段拉出来。




After plunging 7.9% in the prior three sessions, the Nasdaq composite bounced back 1% in lower volume after three heavy-volume declines. Breadth was nearly 2-to-1 positive on the Nasdaq. At its high, the Nasdaq was up 2.6%, but sellers came into the market during the final hour of trading.  
纳斯达克综合指数在前三个交易日暴跌 7.9% 后，在连续三个交易日大幅下跌后反弹 1%。纳斯达克指数的广度几乎是 2 比 1 的正值。纳斯达克指数在高点上涨 2.6%，但卖家在交易的最后一个小时进入市场。


NYSE-listed **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) closed off highs, but shares still surged more than 10% after the enterprise software firm reported its fourth straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth. The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance for the second time this year, thanks to continued strong demand for its generative AI offerings.  
在纽约证券交易所上市的 **Palantir Technologies** （[PLTR）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR) 收于高点，但在这家企业软件公司报告连续第四个季度加速收入增长后，股价仍飙升超过 10%。该公司今年还第二次上调了全年收入指引，这要归功于对其生成式 AI 产品的持续强劲需求。


Palantir looks better than a lot of other technology stocks at the moment, but there's no new entry as the stock looks ready to form a new base.  
Palantir 目前看起来比许多其他科技股要好，但没有新的入场点，因为该股看起来已准备好形成新的基础。


Stock Market Today 今日股市
-----------------------


The Nasdaq closed in the upper half its trading range Monday, giving the session the look of a "pink rally day," or the first day of a rally attempt. But it fell short because the midpoint of the Nasdaq's true range Monday, based on Friday's closing price (16,776) and Monday's low (15,708), was 16,242. The Nasdaq closed Monday at 16,200, just below the midpoint. That means Tuesday marked the first day of a rally attempt.  
纳斯达克指数周一收于其交易区间的上半部分，使该交易日看起来像“粉红色反弹日”，或反弹尝试的第一天。但它没有达到目标，因为根据周五的收盘价（16,776）和周一的低点（15,708），纳斯达克周一真实区间的中点是 16,242。纳斯达克指数周一收于 16,200 点，略低于中点。这意味着周二是拉力赛尝试的第一天。


It's common to see short covering during the first few days of a rally. That means a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-how-to-invest-using-follow-through-days/) could come as early as Friday. Not all follow-through days work though, especially when buy candidates are in short supply.  
在反弹的最初几天看到空头回补是很常见的。这意味着[跟进日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-how-to-invest-using-follow-through-days/)最早可能在周五到来。不过，并非所有的后续日子都有效，尤其是当购买候选人供不应求时。


Several stock market leaders, including **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), have come under heavy selling pressure. That means they're most likely ready to form new bases, and that will take some time.  
包括 **Nvidia** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 在内的几家股市领导者都面临着沉重的抛售压力。这意味着他们很可能已经准备好组建新的基地，这需要一些时间。

It will also take some time for new leadership to develop. For now, several stocks in the health care sector as well as consumer staples like **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **Philip Morris** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)) and **Colgate-Palmolive** ([CL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CL)) continue to outperform.  
新的领导层也需要一些时间来培养。目前，医疗保健行业的几只股票以及像**宝洁**（[PG）、](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)**可口可乐**（[KO）、](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)**菲利普莫里**斯（[PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)）和高**露洁棕榄**（[CL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CL)这样的消费必需品继续表现出色。


After three straight higher-volume declines, the S&P 500 also rallied 1%. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by just over 3 to 1.  
在连续三次成交量下跌后，标准普尔 500 指数也上涨了 1%。纽约证券交易所的赢家以略高于 3 比 1 的比分击败输家。


**Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) was a top gainer in the S&P 500, up nearly 11%. Wall Street cheered [Uber's Q2 earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/uber-stock-uber-earnings-q2-2024/), which showed adjusted profit up 161% to 47 cents a share. Total revenue increased 16% to $10.7 billion. Despite the stock's big gain Tuesday, Uber is still below its 50- and 200-day lines.  
**优步** （[UBER）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER) 是标准普尔 500 指数中涨幅最大的股票，上涨近 11%。华尔街对 [Uber 的第二季度收益报告](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/uber-stock-uber-earnings-q2-2024/)欢呼雀跃，该报告显示调整后利润增长 161% 至每股 47 美分。总收入增长 16%，达到 107 亿美元。尽管该股周二大幅上涨，但 Uber 仍低于其 50 天和 200 天线。


CAT Leads Dow Jones CAT 领涨道琼斯指数
-------------------------------


The Russell 2000 small-cap index outperformed in the stock market today with a 1.2% gain, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, rising nearly 0.8%.  
罗素 2000 小盘股指数今天跑赢股市，上涨 1.2%，但道琼斯工业平均指数落后，上涨近 0.8%。

**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) was among a group of six blue-chip stocks that rallied at least 2%. Shares rose 3% after the company reported [better-than-expected earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-earnings-q2-cat-stock-dow-jones-buybacks/). But after finding support at the 200-day line, Caterpillar could run into some resistance near its 50-day line, currently around 334.50.  
**卡特彼**勒 （[CAT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT) 是上涨至少 2% 的六只蓝筹股之一。该公司公布的[收益好于预期](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-earnings-q2-cat-stock-dow-jones-buybacks/)后，股价上涨 3%。但在 200 日线找到支撑后，卡特彼勒可能会在其 50 日线附近遇到一些阻力，目前约为 334.50。


The 10-year Treasury yield finally firmed up after eight straight declines. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 3.89%, up 10 basis points.  
10 年期美国国债收益率在连续八次下跌后终于走稳。股市收盘后，收益率在 3.89% 左右交易，上涨 10 个基点。


Last week, the Federal Reserve confirmed expectations that the first interest-rate cut will likely come at the September meeting. Chances for a 50-basis-point cut are now around 65% in light of Friday's [weak jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-july-unemployment-rate-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/).  
上周，美联储证实了首次降息可能在 9 月会议上的预期。鉴于周五[疲软的就业报告](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-july-unemployment-rate-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/)，降息 50 个基点的可能性现在约为 65%。


The stock market is now in a correction. On Monday, IBD lowered the invested percentage to 0% to 20%. If you're holding a lot of cash, it's OK to stay engaged and wade into the market with a pilot buy or two. But keep in mind that weak markets eventually bring everything down with them — even stocks showing strength in a down market.  
股市现在处于调整中。周一，IBD 将投资百分比下调至 0% 至 20%。如果您持有大量现金，则可以保持参与并通过一两次试点购买进入市场。但请记住，疲软的市场最终会让一切都陷入困境——即使是在下跌的市场中表现出实力的股票。


Stock Market Movers 股市推动者
-------------------------


For perspective, the [Leaderboard model portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com) came into Tuesday just under 40% invested on the long side as defensive holdings like **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) and **Ensign Group** ([ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)) continue to perform well.  
从长远来看，由于**Agnico Eagle Mines** （[AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)） 和 **Ensign Group** （[ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)） 等防御性持股继续表现良好，[Leaderboard 模型投资组合](https://leaderboard.investors.com)周二的多头投资略低于 40%。


In the oil and gas sector, **Viper Energy** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) reclaimed a 41.22 entry in the morning and was still in buy range. But Viper strengthened even more after that and closed just past the 5% buy zone. The oil and gas producer reported a 30% rise in quarterly profit, with revenue up 35% to $216.7 million.  
在石油和天然气板块，**Viper Energy** （[VNOM）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM) 早盘收复 41.22 的入场点，仍处于买入区间。但 Viper 在此之后进一步走强，收盘价略高于 5% 的买入区域。这家石油和天然气生产商报告称，季度利润增长了 30%，收入增长了 35%，达到 2.167 亿美元。


India-based online travel firm **MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)) jumped back above its 50-day line after the stock on Monday pared a 9.4% intraday loss to 1.1%.  
总部位于印度的在线旅游公司 **MakeMyTrip** （[MMYT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT) 周一股价收窄 9.4% 至 1.1%，此后该股重回 50 日线上方。


**Mueller Water Products** ([MWA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MWA)) reclaimed a 19.43 buy point after finding support at its 50-day line Monday. Shares jumped nearly 6% in strong turnover.

  Stock Market Extends Rebound As Nasdaq Retakes Critical Level; What To Do Now

The stock market ended solidly higher Thursday, as Wall Street reacted to more inflation data ahead of next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite regained its critical 50-day moving average, another bullish sign in the wake of last week's heavy losses.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% and the S&P 500 gained nearly 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced 1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index rallied 1.2%.


All 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with communication services and consumer discretionary each up more than 1%. The financials and real estate sectors were the biggest laggards, both up a fraction.


Breadth was positive, as advancers topped decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 2-to-1- on the Nasdaq.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Early Thursday, the producer price index, or PPI, for August came in mostly in line with economist expectations. Headline PPI was up 1.7% year over year, its lowest reading in six months, and rose 0.2% compared to July. Core PPI, which strips out volatile food, energy and trade services costs, rose 3.3% on an annualized basis and was up 0.3% on the prior month.


"The PPI report doesn't change interest rate expectations," said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank in an email to IBD. "Comerica forecasts for the Fed to cut the fed funds target a quarter percent at next Wednesday's decision, and signal that further rate cuts are coming in following decisions."


The 10-year Treasury yield rose nearly 3 basis points to 3.68%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq's Sept. 6 distribution day fell off the overall count. When an index moves up 5% from the closing price of the distribution day, then it is considered no longer relevant to the current count.


Inside the Dow Jones index, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) were among the biggest winners Thursday, with gains of 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively.


On the downside, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was among the six Dow losers on the session. The chipmaker remains near a 52-week low.


[All of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended higher. Notably, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rallied 1.9% to extend a win streak to four sessions and move above the 50-day line.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 1.6% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), Taser maker **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) rallied more than 6% to hit a new high. Axon is a new [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) after breaking out with conviction over Monday's high of 369.44.

What To Do Now
--------------


On Wednesday, IBD's [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) was lifted from 20%-40% to 40%-60%. And Thursday's action was more evidence of stock market strength, as the Nasdaq reclaimed its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) for the first time since Aug. 30. That essentially breaks the composite's downtrend.


As such, IBD is raising the exposure level further, to 60%-80%. That means that investors can add more stocks as stock market leaders offer new entries. For example, decisive rebounds from 50-day lines and breakouts past correct entries are good opportunities to put some capital to work.


But don't be too aggressive with buying stocks. The current environment clearly puts investor emphasis on [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means incrementally adding and reducing exposure to stay in sync with the broad market.


If those latest purchases start to gain some traction, then you can feel confident in the health of the market rebound. But if those buys turn negative, then the market isn't quite following through as intended and you can back away with little lost.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list featured just two stocks, which may be normal given the nascent market rebound. On the upside, there are more ideas appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list, suggesting there are buying opportunities ready to emerge.

Flutter, the [parent company of FanDuel](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/fanduel-parent-flut-stock-nfl-season/), is building a cup base that offers a 226.40 entry. Meanwhile, a 216.38 entry has formed due to a three-weeks-tight within the base.

[Uber shares](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/uber-stock-self-driving-car-ambitions/) are trying to find support around their 50-day line, as they fade from a double-bottom entry at 75.40. An early entry at 74.48 is also in play.

The underperforming indexes of 2024 bested their stock market counterparts on Thursday after **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), the [last of the Magnificent Seven to report Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/), dominated headlines with its [July-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-ai-competition-chips/). Despite the negative reversal by some indexes, the bull run still has a good footing with one day left in what was a volatile month.




The Nasdaq squandered a stout early 1.3% gain to end lower Thursday, slightly more than 0.2%. Volume grew 9% on that exchange vs. Wednesday, early data showed. Hence, it marked a [mild distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The composite index also finished beneath its flattened-out [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) for the second straight session.


The S&P 500 also posted a disappointing finish. It wasted a morning advance of almost 1% to close down 22 cents. Yet at 5,591, the S&P 500 stands only a 1.4% gain away from moving into new highs.


In contrast, small caps did a better job of holding onto early gains.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF also finished well off session highs, yet still rose 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.6% on Thursday, is up 1.2% in August and has a good shot at rallying for the fourth month in a row.


The Dow Jones still lags the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in terms of gains since Jan. 1. Just check out the General Market Indicators page, found at the bottom of every Big Picture column. Yet, what's also notable? Check out a monthly chart of the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF ([DIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIA)). The exchange traded fund dropped 1.3% during the month of Halloween in 2023. Since then, the ETF has rallied every month except for April.


Stock Market And Economic Data
------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP082924-227x300.jpg)One reason for Thursday's decent session overall? It's still about the economy.


U.S. GDP accelerated to a 3% rise from 2.8% for the second quarter, bolstered by stronger-than-estimated consumer spending. The recession argument weakened. However, the stock market will stay focused on future inflation and jobs data ahead of the Federal Reserve's next meeting on interest rates on Sept. 17-18.


While the stock market may see action quiet down Friday afternoon as traders turn off their computers and rush to beat the traffic ahead of the three-day Labor Day Weekend, IBD readers may want to keep a keen eye on the PCE inflation index numbers for July coming out before the open. [Econoday forecasts](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) a 2.5% year-over-year increase in the main personal consumption expenditures gauge, matching the June increase.


Excluding volatile items such as food and energy, the core PCE is expected to lift 2.7%, a slight acceleration from June's 2.6% increase.


Outside The Stock Market
------------------------


Some commodities outperformed the stock market on Thursday.


Near-term expiring light sweet crude oil futures on the NYMEX gained 1.9% to $75.91 a barrel, according to Dow Jones Market Data. While that marks a fourth gain in six sessions, oil is actually lagging the stock market since Jan. 1. Year to date, crude is up a much milder 6% vs. a 17% rise for the S&P 500.


Like in July, interest rates on the long end of the U.S. Treasury curve have fallen hard for the month. On Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond edged up two basis points to 3.86%. But that's still sharply down from a near-term peak of 4.47% seen on July 1.

Breakouts Scorecard
-------------------



**Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) staged a [powerful breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) on better-than-expected results. Earnings jumped 10% to $1.34 a share, the best result in at least eight quarters. The consumer electronics retailer soared over a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) with a 90.57 buy point.


Yet others have struggled.


**Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) pushed past a 105.68 cup-with-handle entry on Aug. 15, 10 days after the wild stock market reversal on Aug. 5. Yet the recent breakout has made no progress. On Thursday, shares sank 3% for a fourth straight decline. Shake Shack also tested buyers at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


In the construction space, **AAON** ([AAON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAON)) is hovering just below a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and its 94.67 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-buy-zone-is-the-sweet-spot/). Fellow ventilation expert **Comfort Systems** ([FIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIX)), featured in Thursday's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) column, is aiming at a fresh breakout past 352.45 in a [four-month consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). Arguably, 347.73 is an early entry.


Utilities are rallying with their heads held high.


**Pacific Gas & Electric** ([PCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCG)), formerly a stock market pariah due to its humongous obligations related to devastating wildfires sweeping through Northern California, marched further past an 18.61 entry in a very shallow [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Shares rallied 3.6% in volume that jumped 148% above average levels. Its Relative Strength Rating is 74, which is not fabulous and reflects sideways action over the years. Yet it's rising fast vs. a 47 four weeks ago.


**Ensign** ([ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)), in the long-term care industry group and a half-size position in Leaderboard since July 10, has now rallied 18% from a [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 127.58 in a four-month [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Ensign, a midcap growth stock with a market value of $8 billion, also surpassed a [three-weeks-tight follow-on entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) at 147.93.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) currently holds 16 long positions, the majority of which reside on the ["Leaders Near A Buy Point"](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) list. Interestingly, just three of the 16 actually hail from tech land.

Meanwhile, new setups may also emerge.


**Affirm** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)) rocketed more than 30% higher on Thursday, crossing its 200-day moving average in towering volume. CEO Max Levchin told Bloomberg News he's confident the company will achieve GAAP-level earnings in the near future. Wall Street now expects earnings of 34 cents a share in fiscal 2026, which ends in June that year.


At the session high of 42.87, the "buy now, pay later" payments firm traded 18% below a large cup pattern's 52.48 peak. So, Affirm still has work to do. But it's clearly in a much better position to stage a potential winning breakout.


Headed into the session, [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) showed a mediocre Composite Rating of 51 on a scale of 1 to 99. Watch for improvement in this key score.


Meanwhile, the new highs list for both the Nasdaq and NYSE continue to make bullish strides.


Avoid The Magnificent Seven?
----------------------------


For instance, the Nasdaq shows a 10-day moving average of 148 stocks making new 52-week highs vs. 60 new lows, according to [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).


On the NYSE, the gap is even wider. The 10-day moving average of 156 new highs stands way above the 10-day average of 14 new lows.


Could this have consequences for investors who prefer to focus on megacap names such as the Magnificent Seven? Indeed, they've had huge runs, in part because they were able to grow sales and earnings impressively even though the Fed raised the fed funds rate from a 0%-0.25% range in early 2022 to the current level of 5.25%-5.5%.


Yet today, quarterly results indicate the law of large numbers may be catching up with many of the biggest technology leaders.


"One major deviation from prior quarters is the weaker earnings results of the Magnificent Seven versus the average company in the S&P 500 Index," Alex Atanasiu, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia, wrote in comments emailed to IBD. "While six of these companies did beat consensus estimates, their surprises were the smallest since Q4 2022 and below the benchmark in that time frame."

World Look At The Stock Market
------------------------------


While one trading day remains in August, it may be worth noting that equities around the globe are rising in synchrony.


According to Dow Jones Market Data, the STOXX Europe 600 index finished Thursday at 524.57, up 9.5% since Jan. 1. Japanese equities have cooled off since the Nikkei 225 hit an all-time high of 42,000. That said, the Nikkei has still garnered a 14.6% year-to-date advance through Thursday.


The glaring exception has been China.


The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong has enjoyed a solid month, rising more than 2% so far in August. Yet heading into Friday's overnight session, the Hang Seng is down 4.3% year to date. That's only a touch better than a 5.1% dip by the Shanghai Composite index.

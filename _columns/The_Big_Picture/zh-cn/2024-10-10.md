  Stock Market Falls After Hot Inflation Data; Broadcom, Viking Near Buy Points

The stock market finished modestly lower Thursday, as Wall Street reacted to a hotter-than-expected consumer inflation report, along with a surprise spike in weekly unemployment claims. Up next, producer inflation data is due Friday that could have implications on Federal Reserve rate policy.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite inched lower. The small-cap Russell 2000 index declined nearly 0.6%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with real estate and communication services leading the downside. The energy sector was the clear leader Thursday, as oil prices rallied 3.7%. West Texas intermediate futures settled just below $76 per barrel.


Ahead of Thursday's stock market open, [consumer price index data](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-september-jobless-claims-federal-reserve-sp-500/) for September showed that core inflation ran hotter than expected, but new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly surged in the first week of October.


In response, [odds of a 25-basis-point rate cut](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) at the next Fed meeting increased to 84.9%, vs. 80.3% one day ago and 67.9% one week ago.


Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to its highest level since July 31, closing at 4.09%.


Up next, the Labor Department's producer price index is due out Friday morning. That may influence the Fed rate-cut outlook.

What To Do Now
--------------

Despite Thursday's mild losses, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to perform well, and IBD has an 80%-100% recommended exposure threshold. As buying opportunities continue to expand, that means it's time to be aggressively invested and adding to your portfolio.


Also, you can always rotate out of positions that aren't working and move resources to new opportunities.


The current stock market environment still requires [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of theÂ [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means incrementally adding and reducing exposure to stay in sync with the broad market. Watch for sell signals and other abrupt character changes in your holdings.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list featured two new stocks. Notably, **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) attempted to surpass a 111.17 cup-with-handle entry. Meanwhile, there are 12 ideas appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list. That suggests that there are potential buying opportunities ready to emerge.

Growth stocks came under heavy selling in the stock market Tuesday after a stronger than expected job-openings report fueled fears that Friday's jobs report could show more underlying strength.


The selling picked up the pace around 10 a.m. ET after the JOLTS report, which tracks the monthly change in job openings, came in at 8.11 million. That was well above the 7.65 million consensus estimate. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed policymakers realize that continued strength in the labor market won't help in the Fed's fight against inflation. In fact, it could hurt it if consumer spending remains strong.




At the same time the JOLTS report came out, the ISM Services index also came in stronger than expected at 54.1.


Record Nasdaq Volume In Stock Market
------------------------------------


After briefly crossing the 20,000 level Monday, the Nasdaq composite registered another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), falling 1.9% in higher volume. The index fell through its 21-day exponential moving average although it is still holding above its 50-day moving average. Decliners beat advancers on the Nasdaq by just over 2-to-1.


Nasdaq volume was the largest on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data, and a sign that institutions sold shares heavily. Dollar-weighted volume, however, was lower and on that basis the Nasdaq would have avoided a distribution days. Much of the heavy volume came from stocks trading under 10 a share.

Still, Tuesday's selling prompted a downward shift in IBD's recommended exposure to 40%-60%. Clearly, it's become a challenging environment for growth investors. With an elevated distribution-day count, trimming some big winners, or taking profits, makes sense.


Heavy volume on the Nasdaq was partly due to **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which fell 6% in volume 67% above average. CEO Jensen Huang on Monday unveiled new gaming hardware at CES in Las Vegas, including graphics cards based on Blackwell architecture. But investors sold the news after a three-session rally for the stock.

A clustering of distribution days on the Nasdaq — with four notable percentage declines in higher volume since Dec. 27 — is a yellow flag for growth investors. The selling has been less pronounced on the NYSE. The S&P 500 shows a total of six distributions days since Dec. 9, but only three of those down sessions showed declines of 1% or more. Even so, it's become a more difficult environment for new buys.


The S&P 500 fell 1.1% and the Russell 2000 small-cap index gave back 0.7%. The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day line after a brief move above the 6000 level Monday. Losers beat winners on the NYSE by about 2-to-1.


Rising Rates
------------


The bond market is clearly worried about inflation. After clearing a resistance level Monday near 4.64%, the 10-year Treasury yield rallied to an eight-month high and was trading around 4.69% just after the stock market close, up seven basis points. The yield is up more than 100 basis points after hitting a low of 3.60% in mid-September.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up the best, with a decline of just 0.4% as names like **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) closed with gains of 1.5% to 2%. The Dow Jones and Russell 2000 have been living below their 50-day lines for a few weeks.


Some of the stock's market's strongest performing growth stocks were hit the hardest Tuesday. **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) slumped 7% in higher volume. The stock closed off lows and held above its 50-day line, but the weekly chart shows a clear test of the 10-week line. **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) swooned nearly 8% and is also testing its 10-week line.



Several other big leaders are testing their 10-week lines, including [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) as well other top performers like **Affirm** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **GoDaddy** ([GDDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDDY)). When leading stocks break below their 1o-week lines, it's another reason to get even more defensive.


Oil and gas stocks were a bright spot. Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) picked up 1%. Inside the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), **Vista Energy** ([VIST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIST)) jumped 5.5% as it held support at the 10-week line.


The stock market will have more key economic reports to consider Wednesday with the release of the ADP Employment Report at 8:15 a.m. ET. Later in the day, the minutes from the December Fed meeting will be out at 2 p.m. ET.

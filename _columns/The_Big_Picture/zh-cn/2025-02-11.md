  Stock Market Takes Powell Testimony In Stride; Growth Stocks Pressured But Little Damage Done

Sellers knocked down several top-rated growth stocks Tuesday, but the rest of the stock market held up well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a modest gain, while the S&P 500 erased a 0.4% opening loss to close nearly flat.


After touching a 52-week high Monday, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped 2%, with nearly half the stocks in the IBD 50 index down 2% or more. But the decline didn't look too bad in light of a strong move off lows for the fund since early last week.




**Doximity** ([DOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS)) took the hardest hit in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), down around 10%. But just like the IBD 50 ETF, the decline was fairly tame considering that Doximity soared 36% Friday after reporting strong earnings. Despite a lot of red in the IBD 50, the only sell signal came from **Globus Medical** ([GMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMED)), which slumped below its 50-day moving average again.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The selling was concentrated in the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which fell 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite edged lower by 0.4% and is still testing its 50-day moving average after a gap below the line on Feb. 3. The Russell 2000, the lagging index at this point, has been getting resistance at its 50-day line after slumping below the support level on Dec. 18.


The Dow Jones industrials added 0.3%, drifting just below the 45,000 level. **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) was the top performer in the blue-chip index, up nearly 5% after reporting Q4 earnings and revenue growth that accelerated from Q3. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was another top gainer in the Dow, up 2% on reports the company is partnering with **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) to bring [AI services](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-alibaba-china-ai/) to the iPhone in China.

Volume fell slightly on both exchanges. Breadth was less than 2-to-1 negative on the Nasdaq, while winners had a slight edge over losers on the NYSE.


After gapping down and finding support at its 21-day line Monday, **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) jumped 2.5% after the company priced a large share offering at $79.25 a share. Schwab is trying to clear a shallow cup base with an 83.35 buy point.


Patience For Now
----------------


If you've been scanning growth-stock screens, you've probably noticed the crop of actionable top-shelf stocks has gotten smaller. With so many growth stocks well past proper entries at this point, it's important to avoid the common pitfall of chasing strong performers like **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)), among many others, and keep your attention focused on stocks setting up or in buy zones. They're out there still.


**Vita Coco** ([COCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COCO)), discussed on [IBD Live](https://www.investors.com/ibdlive) earlier in the day, is still in a buy zone after clearing an alternate entry of 38.91 Monday.



Among financial stocks, **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)) has pulled back gently into a buy zone after a breakout from an 82.72 buy point. Group peer **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) is also back in a buy zone from a 78.13 entry.


IBD lowered its recommended investment percentage to 60%-80% after the DeepSeek AI sell-off on Jan. 27. Some growth investors might be closer to the high end of the band, while others may be closer to the lower end. From a [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) perspective, the model portfolio is just under 70% invested after some pruning.


After the close Tuesday, Leaderboard stock **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) jumped 6% after the company [beat on revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/doordash-stock-dash-stock-news-q4-2024-earnings-results/) and said monthly active users topped 42 million. It's the highest-weighted holding in the model portfolio. DoorDash initially joined the Leaders list on Sept. 13.


Stock Market Watches Powell Testimony
-------------------------------------


Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off two days of testimony on Capitol Hill by reiterating that the Fed does not need to be in a rush to cut interest rates further. He testified in front of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Tuesday and will appear before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.

[CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) now expects only one quarter-point rate cut this year after last week's jobs report showed weaker-than-expected job growth in January, but an unexpected rise in wages along with an upward revision to job growth in December.


The 10-year Treasury yield rallied for a fourth straight session. Just after the stock market close, the yield was around 4.54%, up four basis points.


The stock market on Wednesday will be watching the latest reading on consumer prices closely, due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Core prices are expected to be up 0.3% month over month, slightly higher than December's reading of 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, prices should be up 3.1%, down slightly from 3.2% in December. The latest reading on wholesale prices will be out Thursday with the release of the producer price index.

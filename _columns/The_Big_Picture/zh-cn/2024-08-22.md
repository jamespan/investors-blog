  Tech Stocks Lead Stock Market Lower As Wall Street Braces For Powell Speech

The stock market rally took a step backward on Thursday as Wall Street braces for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's pivotal speech from Jackson Hole, Wyo., Friday morning.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid 1.7%. For the Nasdaq, it was the largest one-day percentage loss since Aug. 5, per Dow Jones market data. The small-cap Russell 2000 index fell nearly 1%.


Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with technology and consumer discretionary the biggest losers. The technology sector index fell 2.3%, its worst day since Aug. 5. On the upside, the real estate, financial and energy sectors held modest gains.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That resulted in the first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the Nasdaq since the follow-through day on Aug. 13.


Losses were broad, with decliners outnumbering advancers by a nearly 2-1 ratio on the NYSE and by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq, according to [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/market-data/us). The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) only fell 0.3%, a mild loss compared with the Nasdaq and S&P 500, indicating that heavier losses occurred in the higher-weighted stocks.


The 10-year Treasury yield rose eight basis points to 3.86%.


Early Friday, [Powell will likely say](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-jackson-hole-bls-job-revisions-sp-500/) at his Jackson Hole speech that inflation has eased to the point where the risks are now tilted toward waiting too long to cut rates. Although the effects of Hurricane Beryl contributed to a soft July jobs report, hiring momentum has clearly slowed.

Stock Market Today
------------------


Inside the Dow Jones index, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were among the biggest losersThursday, with declines of 6.1%, 2.2% and 2%, respectively.


On the upside, financials **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) were among the handful of Dow gainers on the session.


[All of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended sharply lower. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) tumbled 3.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Notably, Nvidia stock held above its 50-day line, while Tesla fell below that key level.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.6% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Powell Industries** ([POWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWL)) advanced more than 2%, closing within striking distance of a 188.45 buy trigger.



What To Do Now
--------------


The Nasdaq is right back at its 50-day moving average following Thursday's sharp loss. A sharp breach of that level would likely indicate further weakness, while a rebound would be bullish for the market's short-term prospects. And Friday's Powell speech could be the catalyst in either direction.


Still, it's normal for the market to pull back after a sharp rally since the Aug. 5 market low, so IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60% to 80%.


This environment clearly puts investor emphasis on [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means that incrementally raising exposure remains a priority. See how your existing positions and the latest buys perform before putting more capital to work.


If you're making progress, then it makes sense to add more exposure. If not, then hold off until you can find more opportunities.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list featured four stocks, but none moved in heavy volume. That indicates a lack of strong institutional demand at these levels. Notably, **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) and **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) topped their entries. But Intuit shares jumped in extended trading after the company's earnings were announced.


Further, more names are appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list, suggesting that buying opportunities are on the near horizon.

Meta stock, an [IBD SwingTrader idea](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader), briefly topped a 542.81 buy point before closing below it. Volume was below average on the breakout attempt.

This week, TJX gapped above a 115.34 flat-base entry. The stock triggered a [blue dot](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-use-these-marketsmith-features-to-catch-stock-market-leaders/) signal in its [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) charts during Wednesday's breakout.

The stock market ended squarely lower Thursday, as Wall Street reacted to comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Magnificent Seven stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) sold off further Thursday, on pace to end with a weekly loss.  
周四股市收盘走低，因为华尔街对美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔的评论做出了反应。Magnificent Seven 股票**特斯拉** （[TSLA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA) 周四进一步抛售，以每周下跌结束。


Indexes closed near session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite both moved down 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index sold off 1.4%, falling sharply for a third straight session.  
指数收于盘中低点附近。道琼斯工业平均指数下跌 0.5%，而标准普尔 500 指数和纳斯达克综合指数均下跌 0.6%。小盘股罗素 2000 指数下跌 1.4%，连续第三个交易日大幅下跌。




Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That helped the Nasdaq and S&P 500 avoid a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) and left both with minor totals of higher-volume losses.  


Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with industrials and consumer discretionary leading the downside. The energy and technology sectors edged higher.  


On Thursday afternoon, Powell said that U.S. economic strength will allow the central bank to be patient on lowering interest rates.  


"The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates," Powell said. "The strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the ability to approach our decisions carefully."  


Bond traders [scaled back the chances for a December rate cut](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html). Odds for a quarter-point reduction fell to 62.1% from 82.5% on Wednesday. Yet the 10-year Treasury yield fell two basis points to 4.42% in late-afternoon trading.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) was the clear winner Thursday with its jump of 6.2%. Late Wednesday, Disney reported stronger-than-expected [fiscal Q4 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-q4-2024-earnings-dow-jones/).  


On the downside, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) sold off 3% and 2.1%, respectively. Cisco [reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-stock-cisco-earnings-news-q32024/). Salesforce remains above its recent 318.71 buy point.  


Most of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended lower as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) dropped 1.3%. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) moved up 0.3% to [close near its record highs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-fiscal-q3-2025-earnings-preview/). And Tesla skidded nearly 6%, erasing the entirety of this week's gains.  


Meanwhile, the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund tumbled 3.3%. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), there were a number of big decliners on the session, including **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)), which continued to fall after Wednesday's brief spike to new highs.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP111424-229x300.jpg)


IBD maintained its recommended exposure level at 80%-100%.  


As the stock market pulls back, the environment continues to require diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). Make sure you monitor your positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules.  


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured no new stocks, which makes sense given the session's broad-based weakness. Meanwhile, the Near Pivot list has only two stock ideas on it, and one is **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)).

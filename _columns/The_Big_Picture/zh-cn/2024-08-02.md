The bears ran amok on the stock market Friday after a weak jobs report raised new recession fears. Now, **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) earnings are among the noteworthy events in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite dived 2.4%, helping it end a wild week where it fell 3.4%. The index has now dropped around 5% below the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and is more than 10% off its July 11 high. While gains have faded substantially, the tech-heavy composite still remains up nearly 12% for the year so far.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP080224.jpg)The S&P 500 was punched 1.8% lower Friday, booking a 2.1% dip for the week in the process. It gapped below the 50-day line, a distinctly bearish look. The benchmark index now has a slightly better year-to-date gain than the Nasdaq; it is up 12.1%.


Decliners led advancers by around 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and more than 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Market Weakness Triggers This Switch
------------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best among the major indexes on the stock market. But this was nothing to boast about, given it tumbled 1.5%. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) outperformed here while **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) lagged following results.


Small caps were given a harsh spanking by the bears. The Russell 2000 dived 3.5% Friday and has ceded all the rally gains it's had since July 11. Growth stocks also suffered, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund falling 3.9%. It now sits below its 200-day moving average and has fallen more than 13% over the past four weeks.


Due to Friday's sharp pullback, Investor's Business Daily is reducing its recommended market exposure to the 20%-to-40% level. Be sure to trim back exposure in a measured fashion, and cut the weakest stocks in your portfolio first. Look for stocks falling 7% to 8% below your purchase price or those making sharp breaks below the 50-day moving average.


The stock market is now in a correction. Due to this our attention will turn to looking for a new rally attempt and follow-through day. The distribution day count will be reset for beginning of the next uptrend.

Jobs Report Disappoints; Berkshire, Palantir Earnings Next
----------------------------------------------------------


Stocks were mauled after the July jobs report showed the U.S. economy added 114,000 nonfarm jobs last month, well shy of economist estimates for 180,000. Additionally, the unemployment rate popped to 4.3% while economists saw it holding steady at 4.1%.


Rising fears of a recession spurred a flight to safety. The 10-year Treasury note dived 18 basis points to 3.8% while the two-year sank 28 basis point to 3.88%. It also raised questions on whether Fed officials had been right to hold off on cutting interest rates at this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.


The coming week will be lighter on economic data, something of a relief after the past week. The S&P final U.S. services PMI reading for July comes Monday while U.S. trade deficit data for June comes Tuesday. Initial jobless claims figures will be under even more scrutiny than usual Thursday. There will also be some Fedspeak, with Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin making an appearance Thursday.


There will be some [noteworthy earnings reports though](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/dow-jones-companies-earnings-calendar/). **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)), led by legendary investor Warren Buffett, posts second-quarter results on Saturday. In the days that follow, **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) are among noteworthy firms posting results.


Apple Earnings Help This Stock Market Group
-------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors closed Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) mostly negative. Consumer staples and utilities, both defensive areas, fared best. In contrast, financials and consumer discretionary took the worst shellacking.



Those looking for an alternate viewpoint [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) could get it by examining the relative performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups.


Nonalcoholic beverage firms, auto parts plays and cleaning products companies were among the best performers. And while **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) ended off highs after rallying on earnings, it still helped the telecom consumer products group outperform.


Oil-and-gas machinery plays, travel booking stocks, media periodicals and chip equipment firms all lagged. Semiconductor manufacturing firms also struggled amid Intel's 26% dive following its poor results and move to lay off more than 15,000 employees.

The stock market ended the day mixed, with a post-earnings surge from **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) boosting the Nasdaq. Now, the latest Fed meeting and more inflation data loom in the week ahead.  
股市收盘涨跌互现，**博通** （[AVGO）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO) 的财报飙升提振了纳斯达克指数。现在，最新的美联储会议和更多的通胀数据将在未来一周迫在眉睫。


The Nasdaq composite closed near record highs after inching up 0.1%, enough for relative outperformance. It posted a meager weekly gain of 0.3%, its fourth in a row. The tech-heavy index remains clear of all its moving averages and is now up 32.7% for the year.  
纳斯达克综合指数小幅上涨 0.1% 后收于历史高点附近，足以相对跑赢大盘。它公布了 0.3% 的微弱周涨幅，连续第四次上涨。这个以科技股为主的指数仍然没有走过所有移动平均线，目前今年上涨了 32.7%。




The S&P 500 managed to rally off lows to end the session flat. However, it suffered a decline of 0.6% for the week, its first weekly dip in four. The benchmark index is straddling its [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/), has a solid cushion on [its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and holds a gain of 26.9% for 2024.  
标准普尔 500 指数成功从低点反弹，收盘持平。然而，该指数本周下跌 0.6%，为四年来首次周下跌。该基准指数跨越其 [10 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/)，在其 [50 天线上](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)有坚实的缓冲，并在 2024 年保持 26.9% 的涨幅。


Decliners outstripped advancers by around 2-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges.  
纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克的下跌股均以 2 比 1 的比例超过上涨股。两家交易所的成交量均有所下降。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes after falling 0.2% Friday, its seventh daily decline in a row. It ended the week down a bruising 1.8% and has fallen below the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) were among the best performers on the much-watched index, while **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) lagged.  
道琼斯工业平均指数周五下跌 0.2%，连续第七天下跌，落后于其他主要指数。本周收盘下跌 1.8%，跌破 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)。**波音** （[BA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA) 和 **UnitedHealth** （[UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)） 在备受关注的指数中表现最佳，而**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 则落后。


Small caps were hit hardest by the bears, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.6%. A test of the 50-day line could be imminent amid a weekly decline of 2.5%. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund impressed by reversing higher, ending Friday with a robust 1% gain.  
小盘股受空头打击最大，罗素 2000 指数下跌 0.6%。在每周下跌 2.5% 的情况下，对 50 日线的测试可能迫在眉睫。Innovator IBD 50 （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 交易所交易基金逆转走高，给人留下深刻印象，周五收盘上涨 1%。


Fed Meeting, PCE Inflation Reading Next美联储会议，PCE 通胀数据 下一个
---------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP121324.jpg)Investors had to digest mixed economic data this week, with consumer price index and producer price index data underlining the stickiness of inflation. CPI was in-line while PPI was hotter than expected. But Fed officials are also keeping a close eye on the labor market, and jobless claims rose unexpectedly in the last reading.  
投资者本周不得不消化喜忧参半的经济数据，消费者价格指数和生产者价格指数数据强调了通胀的粘性。CPI 符合预期，而 PPI 高于预期。但美联储官员也在密切关注劳动力市场，上次读数中申请失业救济人数意外上升。


The mixed picture means central bankers are almost certain to follow through with a rate cut of 25 basis points when the Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday. As ever, the tone adopted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the post-meeting media conference is sure to impact the stock market.  
喜忧参半的形势意味着央行行长们几乎肯定会在周二和周三的联邦公开市场委员会会议上降息 25 个基点。与往常一样，美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔在会后新闻发布会上采用的语气肯定会影响股市。


But there is a slew of other economic data due in the coming week. The Empire State manufacturing survey drops Monday, retail sales data come Tuesday, the latest housing starts reading comes Wednesday and initial jobless claims drop Thursday. With the specter of persistent inflation looming, the personal consumption expenditures price index reading for November, due Friday, is also important.  
但未来一周将公布大量其他经济数据。帝国州制造业调查周一下降，零售销售数据周二公布，周三公布最新住房开工数据，周四首次申请失业救济人数下降。随着持续通胀的幽灵迫在眉睫，将于周五公布的 11 月个人消费支出价格指数读数也很重要。


Some noteworthy firms also post [quarterly reports next week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/nike-stock-harsh-downtrend-ahead-of-earnings-new-ceo-aims-for-turnaround/), even as earnings season winds down. Dow Jones giant **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), Warren Buffett stock **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) are all due.  
一些值得注意的公司也在[下周发布季度报告](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/nike-stock-harsh-downtrend-ahead-of-earnings-new-ceo-aims-for-turnaround/)，即使财报季即将结束。道琼斯巨头**耐克** （[NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)）、**联邦快递** （[FDX）、](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)沃伦巴菲特股票 **Heico** （[HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)） 和**美光科技** （[MU）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU) 都到期了。

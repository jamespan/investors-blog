The stock market ended the day mixed, with a post-earnings surge from **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) boosting the Nasdaq. Now, the latest Fed meeting and more inflation data loom in the week ahead.  


The Nasdaq composite closed near record highs after inching up 0.1%, enough for relative outperformance. It posted a meager weekly gain of 0.3%, its fourth in a row. The tech-heavy index remains clear of all its moving averages and is now up 32.7% for the year.  




The S&P 500 managed to rally off lows to end the session flat. However, it suffered a decline of 0.6% for the week, its first weekly dip in four. The benchmark index is straddling its [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/), has a solid cushion on [its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and holds a gain of 26.9% for 2024.  


Decliners outstripped advancers by around 2-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges.  


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes after falling 0.2% Friday, its seventh daily decline in a row. It ended the week down a bruising 1.8% and has fallen below the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) were among the best performers on the much-watched index, while **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) lagged.  


Small caps were hit hardest by the bears, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.6%. A test of the 50-day line could be imminent amid a weekly decline of 2.5%. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund impressed by reversing higher, ending Friday with a robust 1% gain.  


Fed Meeting, PCE Inflation Reading Next
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP121324.jpg)Investors had to digest mixed economic data this week, with consumer price index and producer price index data underlining the stickiness of inflation. CPI was in-line while PPI was hotter than expected. But Fed officials are also keeping a close eye on the labor market, and jobless claims rose unexpectedly in the last reading.  


The mixed picture means central bankers are almost certain to follow through with a rate cut of 25 basis points when the Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday. As ever, the tone adopted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the post-meeting media conference is sure to impact the stock market.  


But there is a slew of other economic data due in the coming week. The Empire State manufacturing survey drops Monday, retail sales data come Tuesday, the latest housing starts reading comes Wednesday and initial jobless claims drop Thursday. With the specter of persistent inflation looming, the personal consumption expenditures price index reading for November, due Friday, is also important.  


Some noteworthy firms also post [quarterly reports next week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/nike-stock-harsh-downtrend-ahead-of-earnings-new-ceo-aims-for-turnaround/), even as earnings season winds down. Dow Jones giant **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), Warren Buffett stock **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) are all due.  


Stock Market Group Pops After Broadcom Earnings
-----------------------------------------------


A majority of the [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday lower](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Technology and consumer discretionary were the strongest areas while communication services and materials lagged the most.

Home furnishing plays, boosted by a sunny outlook from luxury retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), drug stores, fiber-optics stocks and automakers were among the best performers.  


Fabless chip plays also outperformed, aided by group giant Broadcom, whose price jumped by nearly a quarter after the firm beat fourth-quarter earnings views. Artificial intelligence-related revenues more than tripled and the company [forecast that AI chip sales would surge](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/broadcom-stock-avgo-stock-massive-ai-chip-opportunity/) over the next three years  


One the flip side, department stores, office supply retailers, steel producers, toy companies and database software plays all struggled.

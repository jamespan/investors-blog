The stock market was mixed Friday following weak retail sales data but still booked solid weekly gains. The Fed minutes and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) earnings are among the noteworthy events to come in Presidents Day week.


The Nasdaq composite briefly flirted with negative territory but ended Friday up 0.4%. It is back near all-time highs after notching a weekly gain of 2.6%, ending a two-week losing streak in the process. Perhaps more importantly, it finished the week back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The tech-heavy index now holds a gain of 3.7% in 2025.




Intriguingly, the Direxion Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) notched a fresh closing high, a sign of the broadening participation outside of the so-called Magnificent Seven and other megacap techs.


The S&P 500 was nominally lower but finished Friday clear of its major and short-term moving averages. The benchmark index rose 1.5% for the week and is up 4% for the year.


Advancers managed to edge out decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was weakest out of the major indexes Friday as it fell 0.4%. It remains above its 21-day and 50-day lines due to a 0.6% weekly lift. AI play **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) were the strongest components Friday.


Small caps were nibbled by the bears, with the Russell 2000 slipping 0.1% Friday. The index met resistance at its 50-day moving average. Growth stocks outperformed though, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rising 0.4%.


Yields Fall After Retail Sales; Walmart Earnings Due
----------------------------------------------------


Stocks were mostly steady after U.S. retail sales fell 0.9% in January, the biggest monthly drop in a year. Economists had been expecting a 0.1% fall, so this could be a sign of a weakening consumer. Excluding autos, sales slipped 0.4% while analysts had expected a 0.3% expansion, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/?_gl=1*jgh6fj*_gcl_au*NTYxMTI5NzA5LjE3MzY2Mzg0OTIuMTk2Mzc3MjU3MC4xNzM5MzE0NzkwLjE3MzkzMTQ3OTA.*_ga*MzU3MjcwNjk3LjE3MzQzMDIxOTI.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczOTU2NDIzNi40MzAuMS4xNzM5NTY1OTY5LjcuMC4w).

While indexes were firm, the same could not be said for Treasury yields. The 10-year yield dipped five basis points to 4.48%, ending the week lower, while the 2-year also fell five basis points to 4.26%.


The stock market will be closed Monday to mark Presidents Day. The shortened week will also be lighter on economic data.


The Empire State manufacturing survey drops Tuesday, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey comes Friday and the minutes from January's Federal Open Market Committee meeting drop Wednesday. This could give some insight into the future path of interest rates.


There will also be a sprinkling of housing readings, with housing starts and permits data due Tuesday and existing-home sales numbers on Friday.


While we are into the second half of earnings season, some [noteworthy reports are still due next week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/walmart-stock-scores-all-time-high-earnings-alibaba-carvana-earnings/). There is a retail flavor, with Dow Jones giant Walmart, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and Latin American e-commerce play **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) all reporting.


Roku Boosts This Stock Market Group
-----------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended the day mixed with a downside bias](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Technology and communication services were strongest while health care and consumer staples lagged.



Once again, the performance of IBD's 197 industry groups gave a more granular account of the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Diversified companies, tire makers, newspapers, computer hardware makers and medical supply firms all outperformed.


The movies group was also strong as **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) soared after Q4 earnings [bested views](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/roku-stock-earnings-new-highs/). The firm also said the number of homes using its platform grew 12% year over year last year. It briefly cleared its 20% profit target from an 86.75 entry and ended the day up 14.1%.


On the flip side, coal companies, gold miners, meat products plays and home care stocks were among the worst performers.

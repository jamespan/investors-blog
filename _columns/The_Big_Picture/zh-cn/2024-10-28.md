Six trading days and eight calendar days before historic U.S. elections take place, investors enjoyed a broad advance in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/). This time around, smaller issues occupied the vanguard.  
在历史性的美国大选前的 6 个交易日和 8 个日历日，投资者今天享受了[股市](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)的广泛上涨。这一次，较小的问题占据了先锋。




A 1.5% rise by the S&P SmallCap 600 topped gains of 0.3% by both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. But the small cap index's move looked especially pleasant for another reason: The index hoisted nicely above not only the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) but also a shorter-term yet equally meaningful technical level, the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).  
标准普尔小盘股 600 指数上涨 1.5%，标准普尔 500 指数和纳斯达克指数上涨 0.3%。但小盘股指数的走势看起来特别令人愉快，还有另一个原因：该指数不仅很好地升至 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/)上方，而且还高于短期但同样有意义的技术水平，即 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)。


How an index behaves around the shorter-term moving average weighs heavily on whether IBD is seeing a [power trend among indexes and top stocks today](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/market/marketschool). An Investor's Corner explains [how IBD defines a power trend in stocks today](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-power-trend/).

The Russell 2000, up 1.6% on Monday, also climbed bullishly above its own [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).  
罗素 2000 指数周一上涨 1.6%，也看涨攀升至其自身[的 21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)上方。


Growth Vs. Value 增长与价值
----------------------


Just because small caps performed well, that alone does not mean value stocks are taking over growth.  
仅仅因为小盘股表现良好，这并不意味着价值股正在接管增长股。


For sure, the iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) exchange traded fund outperformed with a 0.6% gain vs. just a 0.2% nudge higher by iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)). However, IWF holds a better Relative Strength Rating (82 vs. 70 over a 12-month time frame).  
可以肯定的是，iShares Russell 1000 Value （[IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)） 交易所交易基金以 0.6% 的涨幅跑赢大盘，而 iShares Russell 1000 Growth （[IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)） 仅小幅上涨 0.2%。然而，IWF 拥有更好的相对强弱评级（在 12 个月的时间范围内为 82 对 70）。


How about since the critical follow-through day that took place on Nov. 1, 2023? Since that nearly year-ago date, IWF has proven superior, gaining 44.1% while IWD has moved up 29.45.  
自 2023 年 11 月 1 日的关键跟进日以来，情况如何？自近一年前的那一天以来，IWF 被证明更胜一筹，上涨了 44.1%，而 IWD 上涨了 29.45%。


Stocks Today: Large Caps Fade今日股市：大盘股衰落
---------------------------------------



Going back to the large-cap gauges, Monday's action got tarnished by the way they forfeited intraday gains later in the day.  
回到大盘股指标，周一的行动因他们在当天晚些时候失去盘中涨幅而受到损害。


The Nasdaq composite reached as high as 18,671, up as much as 0.8%. If the Nasdaq had actually closed at this session high, it would have eclipsed a July 10 all-time closing peak of 18,647.  
纳斯达克综合指数高达 18,671 点，涨幅高达 0.8%。如果纳斯达克指数真的以这个盘中高点收盘，它将超过 7 月 10 日创下的 18,647 点的历史收盘峰值。


In similar fashion, the S&P 500 didn't do a good job of keeping its intraday gain of 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed the Nasdaq and S&P 500, rising nearly 0.7%.  
同样，标准普尔 500 指数在保持 0.6% 的盘中涨幅方面表现不佳。道琼斯工业平均指数跑赢纳斯达克和标准普尔 500 指数，上涨近 0.7%。


Volume fell more than 7% vs. Friday's session on the Nasdaq, Dow Jones Market Data reported. But on the NYSE, turnover climbed 5% to 3.69 billion shares. Therefore, one could argue that action on the S&P 500 mimicked a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/), or a rare form of distribution. Nonetheless, because the S&P 500 did not make a two-day high on Monday, it does not count as such.  
据道琼斯市场数据公司（Dow Jones Market Data）报道，与周五的纳斯达克交易时段相比，成交量下跌了7%以上。但在纽约证券交易所，成交量攀升了 5% 至 36.9 亿股。因此，有人可能会争辩说，标准普尔 500 指数的行动模仿了[停滞日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/)，或者是一种罕见的分配形式。尽管如此，由于标准普尔 500 指数周一没有创下两天高点，因此不算作两天高点。


Bank, industrial and consumer-oriented components within the Dow Jones industrials more than offset a 2.8% slide by **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) in the price-weighted index of blue chips.  
道琼斯工业指数中以银行、工业和消费者为导向的成分股抵消了**波音** （[BA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA) 在蓝筹股价格加权指数中下跌 2.8% 的影响。

![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102824-208x300.jpg)Despite the nice numbers in the key stock averages, investors in individual stocks today need to stay extra vigilant about two things: one, earnings; and two, sector rotation.  
尽管主要股票平均数据不错，但今天个股的投资者需要对两件事保持格外警惕：第一，收益;二是行业轮换。


**Vista Energy** ([VIST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIST)) on Friday tried to break out of an amorphous [eight-week base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/) with a 52.47 buy point. The 8% rise on Friday came in hefty volume, a bullish sign of institutional buying. But amid a sell-off in crude oil and natural gas futures, Vista shares slipped 1.6% Monday and it failed to follow through on its breakout.  
**Vista Energy** （[VIST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIST)） 周五试图以 52.47 的买入点突破无定形[的八周底部](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/)。周五 8% 的涨幅很大，是机构买入的看涨信号。但在原油和天然气期货抛售的情况下，Vista 股价周一下跌 1.6%，未能跟进突破。


Aerospace stocks have also achieved marvelous gains this year. But as the Market Pulse highlights, a few leaders in the space did not participate in the rally.  
航空航天股今年也取得了惊人的收益。但正如 Market Pulse 所强调的那样，该领域的一些领导者并未参与反弹。


**Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) sank further below its 50-day moving average with a 2% drop in active turnover. Gains from a breakout near 200 have been excellent, but it's imperative for investors to not let paper gains turn into dust.  
**Heico** （[HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)） 进一步跌破其 50 天移动平均线，活跃成交额下降 2%。突破 200 点附近的收益非常出色，但投资者必须不要让账面收益化为灰烬。


[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-heico-corp-hei.aspx), Heico ranks 5th overall within the aerospace and defense industry group and holds a solid 96 Composite Rating.  
[根据 IBD Stock Checkup，Heico](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-heico-corp-hei.aspx) 在航空航天和国防工业集团中总体排名第 5，综合评级为 96 分。


The View From Bonds 邦兹的观点
-------------------------


The yield on the key U.S. 10-year government bond rose for the fifth time in six sessions. On Monday, the yield increased more than four basis points to nearly 4.28%, the highest close since July 24.  
关键的美国 10 年期政府债券收益率在六个交易日内第五次上涨。周一，收益率上涨超过 4 个基点至近 4.28%，为 7 月 24 日以来的最高收盘价。

在 MarketSurge 上，输入“0TNX”（零 TNX）以查看基于 Cboe 市场数据的 10 年期收益率图表。


"It's a little bit of 'Back to the Future,' " Rick Pitcairn, chairman and chief global strategist at the multifamily office firm Pitcairn near Philadelphia, told IBD in a recent interview. The firm has $8.3 billion in assets under management. By referring to the iconic film starring Michael J. Fox, Pitcairn referred to what prognosticators in bonds were thinking almost a year ago. Back in December 2023, bond traders bet on the Federal Reserve making as many six cuts of the fed funds rate by a quarter of one percentage point each over the next 12 months.  
“这有点像'回到未来'，”费城附近的多家族办公室公司 Pitcairn 的董事长兼首席全球策略师 Rick Pitcairn 在最近的一次采访中告诉 IBD。该公司管理着 83 亿美元的资产。通过提到迈克尔·福克斯 （Michael J. Fox） 主演的标志性电影，皮特凯恩提到了债券预言家大约一年前的想法。早在 2023 年 12 月，债券交易员押注美联储将在未来 12 个月内将联邦基金利率下调多达 6 次，每次下调 1 个百分点的四分之一。


They proved to be wrong.  
事实证明他们错了。


In September, the U.S. central bank made its first cut in rates in four years. The Fed reduced the fed funds rate by a half point to a range of 4.75%-5%. Next week on Nov. 7, when the Fed holds its penultimate meeting of the year on interest rates, just two days after the Nov. 5 elections, CME FedWatch's survey shows a 96% probability that the bank will trim rates by 25 basis points.  
9 月，美国央行进行了四年来的首次降息。美联储将联邦基金利率下调半个百分点至 4.75%-5% 的区间。下周 11 月 7 日，美联储将举行今年倒数第二次利率会议，就在 11 月 5 日大选两天后，CME FedWatch 的调查显示，该银行将利率下调 25 个基点的可能性为 96%。


Another quarter-point drop in short-term rates is less of a done deal at the Dec. 18 final meeting of the year. But probabilities are high at 71% of the Fed taking the fed funds rate to a 4.25%-4.5% level.  
短期利率再下调 25 个基点在今年 12 月 18 日的最后一次会议上还算不上什么定局。但 71% 的美联储将联邦基金利率提高到 4.25%-4.5% 水平的可能性很高。

How Interest Rates Could Impact Stocks Today利率如何影响当今的股票
-------------------------------------------------------


Pitcairn points out that if the Fed has to frantically cut rates, it implies the economy is in trouble. Yet earnings have grown sharply among S&P 500 firms so far in 2024. So, "both cannot happen at once. We didn't get all those cuts, but we got better than expected growth," Pitcairn added. He also sees a strong likelihood that U.S. investors could get 15% earnings growth in 2025 along with a lower cost of borrowing money.  
皮特凯恩指出，如果美联储不得不疯狂降息，那就意味着经济陷入困境。然而，截至 2024 年，标准普尔 500 指数公司的收益大幅增长。因此，“两者不可能同时发生。我们没有得到所有这些削减，但我们的增长好于预期，“Pitcairn 补充道。他还认为，美国投资者很有可能在 2025 年获得 15% 的盈利增长，同时降低借款成本。


"I'm tempted to make the same mistake" regarding expectations of big profits and significant rate cuts, Pitcairn said. "I don't think the Federal Reserve is partisan, but they are political. That is, they want to be thought of well. It is rare for the bank to starting a rate-cutting cycle before the election."  
Pitcairn 表示，在预期巨额利润和大幅降息方面，“我很想犯同样的错误”。“我不认为美联储是党派性的，但他们是政治性的。也就是说，他们希望被人很好地看待。该银行在选举前开始降息周期的情况很少见。


For those who think interest rates on the long end of the curve could keep rising, take a look at Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3X ([TMV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMV)). The ETF is designed to move three times the inverse move in the interest rates of long-term bonds. On Monday, the ETF rose 0.8% to 35.09 and spent its sixth session in a row above its now slightly-rising 200-day moving average.  
对于那些认为曲线长端利率可能会继续上升的人，请查看 Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3X （[TMV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMV)）。该 ETF 的变动幅度是长期债券利率反向变动的三倍。周一，该 ETF 上涨 0.8% 至 35.09，连续第六个交易日高于目前小幅上涨的 200 天移动平均线。


Besides earnings, Friday's nonfarm payrolls report might have a pronounced impact on bond prices and yields.  
除了收益，周五的非农就业报告可能对债券价格和收益率产生显著影响。


[According to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), economists on consensus see just 125,000 net new jobs created in October, well down from a gain of 254,000 jobs in September. Forecasters see the jobless rate staying at 4.1%. Keep in mind that in recent years, revisions to the government data can get quite large.  
[根据 Econoday 的数据](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)，经济学家一致认为 10 月份仅创造了 125,000 个净新增工作岗位，远低于 9 月份增加的 254,000 个工作岗位。预测者认为失业率保持在 4.1%。请记住，近年来，对政府数据的修订可能会变得相当大。

It wasn't looking good in the early going Wednesday as sellers initially knocked the Nasdaq composite lower by 1.4% on an intraday basis. There was no specific news to account for the downdraft, but it didn't matter. Stock market bulls won another battle as the Nasdaq pared early losses and closed with a deficit of just 0.1%.  
周三早盘情况并不乐观，因为卖家最初盘中将纳斯达克综合指数推低 1.4%。没有具体的消息来解释这种下降，但这并不重要。随着纳斯达克指数收复早盘跌幅，收盘时仅亏损 0.1%，股市多头赢得了另一场战斗。




Meanwhile, a weak earnings report from **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) weighed on the S&P 500. But the index closed fractionally higher after falling nearly 1% intraday. Target slumped more than 20% after the retailer [missed on earnings and revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-walmart-tjx-q3-target-stock-tjx-stock/) and also gave a weak outlook.  


Target was already a laggard in the retail sector with a Relative Strength Rating of 58. Its weak report came one day after **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) reported strong results.  
Target 在零售领域已经落后，相对强弱评级为 58。其疲软的报告是在**沃尔玛** （[WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)） 报告强劲业绩的前一天发布的。


Stock Market Today 今日股市
-----------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both testing their 21-day lines, along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000. The Dow Jones index added 0.3%, snapping a four-session slide. After reversing higher above its 21-day line Tuesday, the Russell 2000 edged higher by a fraction.  
纳斯达克指数和标准普尔 500 指数以及道琼斯工业平均指数和罗素 2000 指数都在测试其 21 天线。道琼斯指数上涨 0.3%，结束了连续四个交易日的下滑。在周二反转至 21 日线上方后，罗素 2000 指数小幅走高。


Losers had a slight edge over winners on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq exchange. Volume fell slightly from Tuesday.  
在纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克交易所，输家比赢家略有优势。成交量较周二略有下降。


The 10-year Treasury yield faded off highs but still picked up 3 basis points to around 4.41%. After a strong move off lows, the 10-year yield continues to show strength as futures traders dial back rate-cut expectations. [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) now sees a 52% chance of another quarter-point cut at the December Federal Reserve meeting. That's down from 77% a month ago.  
10 年期美国国债收益率从高点回落，但仍上涨 3 个基点至 4.41% 左右。在从低点强劲回落后，随着期货交易员降低降息预期，10 年期国债收益率继续走强。[CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) 现在认为在 12 月的美联储会议上再次降息 25 个基点的可能性为 52%。这比一个月前的 77% 有所下降。


While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain on uptrends, there are yellow flags to consider. For starters the number of new highs on the Nasdaq has started to flatten out while new lows increase. This comes as breadth has weakened in recent days.  
虽然纳斯达克和标准普尔 500 指数仍处于上升趋势中，但仍有黄旗需要考虑。首先，纳斯达克的新高数量已经开始趋于平缓，而新低的数量则增加。这是在最近几天广度减弱之际发生的。


An Extreme Reading On Bulls关于多头的极端解读
------------------------------------


Meanwhile, the latest weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence showed bulls at 60% for the second straight week.  
与此同时，Investors Intelligence 对股市通讯作者的最新每周调查显示，多头连续第二周为 60%。


This is considered an extreme reading, and readings of 60% or more have been seen at or near several market tops in the past. It's a contrarian indicator, meaning when the crowd is leaning bullish, it's usually time to tread cautiously.  
这被认为是一个极端的读数，过去曾在几个市场顶部或附近看到 60% 或更高的读数。这是一个逆向指标，这意味着当人群倾向于看涨时，通常是时候谨慎行事了。

All that said, a large number of leading growth stocks continue to show strength and support after big price gains. While it's important to pay attention to yellow flags, it's also important to focus on the positives.  
综上所述，大量领先的成长股在价格大幅上涨后继续表现出实力和支持。虽然关注黄旗很重要，但关注积极因素也很重要。


After the close, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) held up well after the [AI bellwether](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-fiscal-q3-2025-earnings/) reported another quarter of strong growth. Shares initially fell 4%, but Nvidia fought back and was down less than 1% around 2 p.m. ET.  
收盘后，[排行榜](https://leaderboard.investors.com)股票**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 在 [AI 领头羊](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-fiscal-q3-2025-earnings/)报告了另一个季度的强劲增长后保持良好状态。股价最初下跌 4%，但 Nvidia 进行了反击，在美国东部时间下午 2 点左右下跌了不到 1%。


Movers And Shakers 推动者和摇动者
--------------------------


Several growth stocks came under pressure in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com). Data center supplier and Leaderboard stock **Vertiv** ([VRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRT)) gave back 2.4%, but the decline didn't look so bad in light of Tuesday's strong gain. Shares rallied nearly 15% Tuesday on the heels of the company's investor presentation.  
几只成长股在 [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) 中承压。数据中心供应商和排行榜股票 **Vertiv** （[VRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRT)） 回吐了 2.4%，但鉴于周二的强劲上涨，跌幅看起来并没有那么糟糕。周二，在该公司的投资者介绍之后，股价上涨了近 15%。


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP112024.jpg)While several leading growth stocks continue to act well, buy prospects generally remain in short supply. Avoid the pitfall of chasing extended stocks.  
虽然几只领先的成长股继续表现良好，但买入前景普遍仍然供不应求。避免追逐扩展库存的陷阱。


The Leaderboard model portfolio did find two financial names Tuesday. **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) cleared a trendline as it forms a flat base. The stock tried to break out Wednesday but early gains faded. Leaderboard also added asset manager **Blue Owl** ([OWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OWL)). Blue Owl could have a flat base in place by the end of the week with a 24.17 entry.  
周二，Leaderboard 模型投资组合确实发现了两个金融公司。**Tradeweb Markets** （[TW）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW) 在形成平坦底部时清除了趋势线。该股周三试图突破，但早盘涨幅消退。排行榜还添加了资产管理公司 **Blue Owl** （[OWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OWL)）。Blue Owl 可能会在本周末以 24.17 的入场率就位。


Elsewhere, after a setup day Tuesday, online pet retailer **Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)) gapped up and cleared an alternate handle entry of 34.19.  
在其他地方，在周二的设置日之后，在线宠物零售商 **Chewy** （[CHWY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY) 跳空扩大并清除了 34.19 的备用条目。


While several top-rated growth stocks are bouncing off short-term support levels like the 10- and 21-day lines, many are not clear-cut buys. They might be add-on buys for a winning position, but they're riskier entries for a first-time buy.  
虽然几只排名靠前的成长型股票正在从 10 天和 21 天线等短期支撑位反弹，但许多股票并不是明确的买入。它们可能是获胜位置的附加购买，但对于首次购买来说，它们是风险更高的入场点。


Take stock market leader **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)). Those who bought Twilio's earnings gap on Oct. 31 have been rewarded. Current holders got an opportunity to add to add to their position Wednesday as Twilio found support at its 10-day line. New buyers, however, should sit tight and wait for a new base.  
以股票市场领导者 **Twilio** （[TWLO）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO) 为例。那些在 10 月 31 日买入 Twilio 收益缺口的人已经获得了回报。当前持有者周三有机会增持头寸，因为 Twilio 在其 10 日线找到支撑。然而，新买家应该坐下来等待新的基地。

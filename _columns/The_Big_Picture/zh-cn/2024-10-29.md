While Big Tech earnings, elections, the jobs report and the next Fed meeting remain on investors' minds, the Nasdaq climbed to a record high Tuesday. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) soared in after-hours trading after topping both sales and earnings estimates. But **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rival **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) fell after AMD's earnings report.  
虽然大型科技公司的财报、选举、就业报告和下一次美联储会议仍在投资者的脑海中，但纳斯达克指数周二攀升至历史新高。**Alphabet** （[GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)） 在销售额和收益预期均超过预期后，在盘后交易中飙升。但**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 的竞争对手 **Advanced Micro Devices** （[AMD）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD) 在 AMD 财报发布后下跌。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged other major indexes, falling 0.4%. But the Nasdaq closed at a record high, gaining 0.8% on Tuesday. The S&P 500 edged up 0.2% in the stock market today.  
道琼斯工业平均指数落后于其他主要指数，下跌 0.4%。但纳斯达克指数周二收盘上涨 0.8%，创下历史新高。标准普尔 500 指数今天在股市小幅上涨 0.2%。


Advancers found themselves outmatched on both major exchanges. Losers topped winners by more than a 2-1 ratio on the NYSE, while decliners edged out decliners on the Nasdaq.  
Advancers 发现自己在两个主要交易所都处于劣势。在纽约证券交易所，下跌的股票以超过 2：1 的比率领先于赢家，而在纳斯达克，下跌的股票略微超过下跌的股票。




After a day of outperformance, small caps pulled back but remained above the [21-day exponential moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.3%, a minor loss compared with Monday's 1.6% rally.  
在跑赢大盘一天后，小盘股回落，但仍高于 [21 天指数移动平均线。](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)小盘股罗素 2000 指数下跌 0.3%，与周一 1.6% 的涨幅相比略有下降。


Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq, noticeably more on the latter. Nasdaq volume ranked among the 11 highest days this year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  
纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克的成交量增加，后者的成交量明显增加。根据道琼斯市场数据，纳斯达克的交易量是今年交易量最高的 11 天之一。


McDonald's, F5 Among Earnings Movers麦当劳，F5 成为收益推动者
--------------------------------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102924-239x300.jpg)Earnings season is gathering steam, and the stock market saw several earnings movers on Tuesday. Dow leader **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) struggled to get past the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) after the company reported modest growth in sales and earnings in a mixed Q3 report. The impact of the E. coli breakout last week will be more evident in its next quarterly report.  
财报季正在加速，股市周二出现了几项财报变动。道琼斯指数领导者**麦当劳** （[MCD）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD) 在喜忧参半的第三季度报告中报告销售额和收益温和增长后，努力突破 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/)。上周大肠杆菌爆发的影响将在下一份季度报告中更加明显。


**Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)), a staple on [IBD Long Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), surged after the release of [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cdns-stock-cadence-design-systems-q3-2024-earnings/). In database plays, **Commvault Systems** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) soared as it [beat views and raised its outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/commvault-stock-cvlt-stock-earnings-q3-2024/). **F5** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) lifted the internet network group, which was a top gainer among industry groups on Tuesday.  
**Cadence Design Systems** （[CDNS）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS) 是 [IBD 长期领导者](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/)的主要产品，在[第三季度业绩](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cdns-stock-cadence-design-systems-q3-2024-earnings/)发布后飙升。在数据库业务方面，**Commvault Systems** （[CVLT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT) 的股价[飙升，因为它超越了浏览量并提高了前景](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/commvault-stock-cvlt-stock-earnings-q3-2024/)。**F5** （[FFIV）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV) 提振了互联网网络组，该组周二在行业组中涨幅最大。


After the close Tuesday, [Alphabet jumped about 5%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-google-earnings-ad-search-growth-q32024/) after the Google parent reported third-quarter sales rose 15% to $88.3 billion while earnings of $2.12 per share climbed 36%. Analysts polled by FactSet had targeted $1.84 in earnings per share on sales of $86.4 billion.  
周二收盘后，谷歌母公司 Alphabet 报告称第三季度销售额增长 15% 至 883 亿美元，而每股收益为 2.12 美元，增长 36%，随后 [Alphabet 上涨约 5%。](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-google-earnings-ad-search-growth-q32024/)FactSet 调查的分析师预计每股收益为 1.84 美元，销售额为 864 亿美元。


But Advanced Micro Devices fell in extended trading after third-quarter results were released. Sales came in above views of $6.7 billion at $6.8 billion, while earnings of 92 cents per share matched estimates. But [the company's forecast disappointed](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-advanced-micro-devices-q3-2024-earnings/).  
但在第三季度业绩发布后，Advanced Micro Devices 在延长交易中下跌。销售额为 67 亿美元至 68 亿美元，而每股收益 92 美分符合预期。但[该公司的预测令人失望](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-advanced-micro-devices-q3-2024-earnings/)。


Homebuilding stocks were among Tuesday's worst performing, finishing among the 10 lowest industry groups in IBD's 197 rankings.  
住宅建筑股是周二表现最差的股票之一，在 IBD 的 197 个排名中跻身 10 个最低的行业组之列。


**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) reported a decline in sales and earnings, sending the stock tumbling below its long-term 200-day moving average before closing above it. Other [homebuilders triggered sell signals](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/dr-horton-stock-homebuilding-stocks/) as well, as buyers wait for lower mortgage rates in 2025.  
**DR Horton** （[DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)） 报告称，销售额和收益下降，导致该股跌破其长期 200 天移动平均线，然后收于该水平上方。其他[房屋建筑商也触发了卖出信号](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/dr-horton-stock-homebuilding-stocks/)，因为买家等待 2025 年更低的抵押贷款利率。


**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) sold off after its outlook for the final quarter of the year disappointed and weighed on the apparel and shoes group in the stock market today. The stock gapped below its 200-day line.  
**卡骆驰** （[CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)） 在对今年最后一个季度的展望令人失望并打压了当今股市的服装和鞋类集团后遭到抛售。该股跳空跌破 200 日线。

Rising Yields Test Stock Market收益率上升考验股市
----------------------------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield was essentially flat Tuesday, at 4.27%.  
10 年期美国国债收益率周二基本持平，为 4.27%。


Yields remained near recent highs amid a bond sell-off and pressured the more rate-sensitive segments of the stock market, including small caps. At the same time, gold continued to rise after sentiment among consumers surprised to the upside. On Tuesday, the Conference Board's October survey of consumer sentiment showed a reading of 108.7, beating estimates of 99.1.  
在债券抛售中，收益率保持在近期高点附近，并给股市中对利率更敏感的板块（包括小盘股）带来压力。与此同时，在消费者情绪意外上行后，黄金继续上涨。周二，世界大型企业联合会 （Conference Board） 10 月份的消费者信心调查显示，该指数为 108.7，高于预期的 99.1。


But yields could be approaching a tipping point for stocks. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, finds the 4.3% level in the 10-year yield a "[line in the sand for equities."](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-year-treasury-yield-crosses-line-in-the-sand-thatbegins-tospell-trouble-for-stocks-00eb8521) A foray above that "seems to be pretty problematic for equity markets to absorb."  
但收益率可能正在接近股市的临界点。LPL Financial 首席技术策略师 Adam Turnquist 发现 10 年期国债收益率中 4.3% 的水平是“股票的一线[之选”。](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-year-treasury-yield-crosses-line-in-the-sand-thatbegins-tospell-trouble-for-stocks-00eb8521)高于该水平的尝试“似乎对股市来说相当难以吸收”。


On the flip side, job openings for September did not meet expectations, falling to 7.44 million and to pre-pandemic lows last seen in September 2021.  
另一方面，9 月份的职位空缺未达到预期，降至 744 万，降至 2021 年 9 月以来的疫情前低点。


Job additions in September blew past estimates earlier this month when the Labor Department announced on Oct. 4 that the economy added 254,000 jobs — nearly double what economists had expected.  
本月早些时候，美国劳工部（Labor Department）宣布，美国经济增加了25.4万个工作岗位，几乎是经济学家预期的两倍，9月份的就业岗位增加量超过了预期。


But that is being factored in as a one-off event, and traders are seeing a 25-basis-point cut during the Fed's meeting on Nov. 7. With nonfarm payroll data for October due on Friday, Econoday's estimates are for 125,000 jobs added.  
但这被看作是一次性事件，交易员们看到美联储在 11 月 7 日的会议上降息 25 个基点。随着 10 月非农就业数据将于周五公布，Econoday 估计将增加 125,000 个工作岗位。

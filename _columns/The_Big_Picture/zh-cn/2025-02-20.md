  Dow Jones Slides 450 Points; These 6 Stock Market Leaders Trigger Sell Signals

The stock market closed squarely lower Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 450 points. And top growth names extended their losses as a number of stock market leaders triggered sell signals.


The Dow Jones index sold off 1%, while the S&P 500 moved down 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.5%. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 index declined 0.9%.




Only four of the 11 S&P 500 sectors climbed, with energy and real estate pacing the gainers. The financial and consumer discretionary sectors were the day's weakest.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq but higher on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That resulted in a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the S&P 500, taking its total to three. Amid the session's negative action, decliners outnumbered advancers in a 9-7 ratio on the NYSE and by nearly 12-to-7 on the Nasdaq, [according to MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/market-data/us).

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) were among the top performers Thursday, with gains of 2.4% and 1.2%, respectively.


On the Dow's downside, **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) declined 6.5% and 3.9%, respectively. [Walmart gave a disappointing outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-q4-2025-wmt-stock-retreat-guidance/) early Thursday. Those two stocks deducted about 200 points off the Dow, which lost 450 points Thursday.


In the Nasdaq 100, **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) (up 3.9%) and **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) (up 2.3%) were the best stocks of the day.


Meanwhile, **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) tumbled 8.9% and 5.2%, respectively. Both were among the many top-shelf stocks that have come under pressure this week.


Four of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended lower, as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) lost 0.5%. Notably, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) moved up 0.6%. Nvidia stock is building a double bottom with a 148.97 entry, with an early buy point at 143.44, Tuesday's high price.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund sold off 3.4%, extending a losing streak to three sessions and giving up a 32.24 buy point. Investor's Business Daily's [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) had a number of big losers on the session, including **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)), which tumbled 11.5%.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP022025-229x300.jpg)


The major stock indexes continue to hold near record highs, and the Nasdaq is even finding support at the 21-day moving average. But due to the weak action among top growth stocks, IBD reduced its recommended exposure level to 60%-80% from 80%-100%.


Investors should be cutting back exposure, starting with any holdings that have made sell signals. That's a key element of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/). Many leaders in recent sessions have seen some sharp declines, triggering sell signals, such as a sharp break of the 10-week moving average.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured zero new stocks, which makes sense given the session's weakness. And the Near Pivot list remains relatively low at six ideas, a sign that many top stocks have already broken out or become extended and that there are few setting up.

Stocks Market Leaders Trigger Sell Signals
------------------------------------------


Stock market leaders in trouble include **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)), **Klaviyo** ([KVYO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KVYO)), **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)), **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)), **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)) and **Shift4** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)).



Axon plunged 8.7% Thursday, taking its weekly decline to nearly 21%. During that decline, shares dived from record highs, triggering the [7% loss rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 689.54 cup-with-handle entry and [breaching the 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in heavy volume.


Klaviyo slashed heavy losses but still closed almost 6% lower, as shares try to find support around their 10-week line. During the early part of the session, the stock fell more than 7% below a 44.77 flat-base entry.


Reddit tumbled 7.5% in volume nearly double its average daily volume. In the process, the stock broke below its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) for the first time since September.


Royal Caribbean sank 7.6% in mammoth volume, closing below the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Shares hit a 7% loss signal from its 258.70 cup-base entry after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Trump administration is considering taxes on cruise ships.


Finally, Samsara crumbled more than 7% in big volume, hitting the [7% loss trigger](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 57.51 cup entry. And Shift4 tumbled 4.6%, adding to Wednesday's 17.5% [earnings-fueled plunge](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shift4-stock-shift4-earnings-news-q42024/).

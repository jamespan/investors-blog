The stock market ended a banner week sharply higher on the ebullience surrounding the election victory of Donald Trump. Now a fresh inflation reading and U.S. retail sales data is due.  
股市在围绕唐纳德·特朗普大选胜利的热情洋溢下大幅走高。现在，新的通胀数据和美国零售销售数据即将出炉。


The Nasdaq composite ended Friday with a slim 0.1% gain. However, the true story was the tech-heavy index's blockbuster weekly lift of 5.7%, the best week since March 2022. It has now risen in eight of the past nine weeks and sits well above its [50-day moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) The Nasdaq now holds a sizzling year-to-date gain of 28.5%.  
纳斯达克综合指数周五收盘上涨 0.1%。然而，真实情况是，该以科技股为主的指数每周上涨 5.7%，这是自 2022 年 3 月以来最好的一周。它在过去 9 周中有 8 周上涨，远高于其 [50 天移动平均线。](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)纳斯达克指数今年迄今上涨了 28.5%。




The S&P 500 closed at record levels after rising 0.4% Friday. It snapped a two-week losing streak as it booked a weekly gain of 4.7%. The benchmark index bounced off its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and is now up 25.7% in 2024.  
标准普尔 500 指数周五上涨 0.4% 后收于创纪录水平。它结束了连续两周的下跌，每周上涨 4.7%。该基准指数从 [10 周移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/)反弹，目前在 2024 年上涨了 25.7%。


Advancers led decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, with hundreds of issues notching new 52-week highs. Additionally, the Oct. 31 distribution day came off the S&P 500 [because the index climbed more than 5% from that day's close](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).  
纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克股市领跌，数百只股票创下 52 周新高。此外，10 月 31 日的发行日从标准普尔 500 指数中脱离，[因为该指数较当天收盘价上涨了 5% 以上](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/)。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average tested the 44,000 level and closed at fresh heights after notching a Friday gain of 0.6%. The big news here was **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) making its debut as it replaced **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) on the vaunted index. It was a gently ignominious debut for the AI stock as ended the day down 0.8%.  
道琼斯工业平均指数测试了 44,000 点水平，在周五上涨 0.6% 后收于新高。这里的大新闻是 **Nvidia** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 首次亮相，因为它取代**了 Intel** （[INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)） 在备受赞誉的指数中。这是 AI 股票的一次略带耻辱的首次亮相，当天收盘下跌 0.8%。


Small caps outperformed on the stock market, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.7% Friday and turning in a muscular 8.7% weekly lift. It was its best week since April 2020. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) jumped 3.2% for the day and surged 11.5% for the week.  
小盘股在股市上表现出色，罗素 2000 指数周五上涨 0.7%，周线上涨 8.7%。这是自 2020 年 4 月以来最好的一周。Innovator IBD 50 ETF （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 当天上涨 3.2%，本周飙升 11.5%。


Trump Rally Continues, But Inflation Data Looms特朗普的反弹仍在继续，但通胀数据迫在眉睫
-------------------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP110824-287x300.jpg)Stocks rallied furiously the past week as the election results removed a key overhang. And with President-elect Trump expected to pursue pro-growth policies, such as loosening policy on dealmaking, further gains could be in store. The latest Fed meeting was also benign.  
由于选举结果消除了一个关键的悬而未决的问题，股市在过去一周疯狂上涨。由于预计当选总统特朗普将推行促增长政策，例如放松交易政策，因此可能会有进一步的收益。最近的美联储会议也是良性的。


However, the coming week will see a fresh inflation reading, and negative news on this front could give the stock market bulls reasons for pause. The consumer price index for October drops on Wednesday, with headline CPI seen rising 2.4% year over year, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). This would be the same as the prior reading. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy, is expected to hold steady with a 3.3% annualized lift.  
然而，未来一周将看到新的通胀数据，这方面的负面消息可能会给股市多头暂停的理由。[根据 Econoday 的数据](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)，10 月份的消费者价格指数周三下跌，整体 CPI 同比增长 2.4%。这与之前的读数相同。剔除食品和能源的核心 CPI 预计将保持稳定，年化增长率为 3.3%。


Producer price index data will be released Thursday, with economists expecting a year-over-year gain of 1.8% in the headline data. Other noteworthy economic reports include U.S. retail sales data, which drops Friday. This should give additional insight into the health of the all-important American consumer.  
生产者价格指数数据将于周四公布，经济学家预计整体数据同比增长 1.8%。其他值得注意的经济报告包括美国零售销售数据，该数据周五下降。这应该可以更深入地了解最重要的美国消费者的健康状况。


There are also a few [noteworthy earnings reports in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/cava-stock-shopify-cisco-systems-rally-earnings-reports/). These include [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) name **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)).

Telecom infrastructure stocks, fiber optics firms and specialty financial services plays all had good days. The automakers group also had a good day, boosted by a gain of more than 8% for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) as it [moved back above a $1 trillion market cap](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-1-trillion-market-cap-for-first-time-since-2022/) for the first time since 2022.

Security stocks also stood out, boosted by [the performance of Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) name **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)).

证券股也脱颖而出，受到排行榜名称 **Axon Enterprise** （[AXON）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON) [表现](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/)的提振。这家泰瑟枪制造商在[该公司打破盈利预期](https://www.investors.com/news/axon-stock-soars-axon-earnings-q3-guidance-raised/)并给出阳光明媚的指引后飙升了近 30%。

另一方面，电视股、计算机网络游戏、太阳能公司和金属矿商是表现最差的板块。

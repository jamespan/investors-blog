The stock market ended the week in bullish fashion, with indexes recouping most of their September losses. However the next Fed meeting and a slew of economic data await investors in the coming week.  
股市本周以看涨的方式收盘，指数收复了 9 月份的大部分失地。然而，下周美联储的下一次会议和一系列经济数据等待着投资者。




The Nasdaq composite had another solid session Friday, rising nearly 0.7%. Its muscular weekly gain of 6% was its best of the year and means it is now down just 0.2% in September, quite the turnaround in fortunes from just a week ago. It ended the latest week back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) , a bullish sign. The tech-heavy index now holds a gain of 17.8% so far in 2024.  
纳斯达克综合指数周五再次表现强劲，上涨近 0.7%。其 6% 的强劲每周涨幅是今年最好的，这意味着它现在在 9 月份仅下跌了 0.2%，与一周前相比，命运发生了相当大的转变。最近一周收盘时回到 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)上方，这是一个看涨信号。2024 年迄今，以科技股为主的指数目前上涨了 17.8%。


The S&P 500 rose 0.5% It pulled further clear of its 50-day line and ended the week above its short-term moving averages to boot. Its own weekly lift of 4% means it now has a loss of just 0.4% for the month. It also holds a meaty year-to-date gain of 18%.  
标准普尔 500 指数上涨 0.5%它进一步突破了 50 日线，并在本周收于短期移动平均线上方。它自己的每周上涨 4% 意味着它现在当月的亏损仅为 0.4%。年初至今，它还保持了 18% 的丰厚涨幅。


Advancers led decliners by more than 5-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was slightly lighter for both major exchanges from Thursday's totals.  
纽约证券交易所的上涨股领先下跌的股票超过 5 比 1，纳斯达克的上涨者领先 3 比 1。与周四的总数相比，两家主要交易所的成交量略有下降。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% Friday and popped 2.6% for the week. It now sits near all-time high levels. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), up 1.7%, was among the best performers on the vaunted index, accounting for 37 of the Dow's 297 points. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) struggled most, falling 3.5% after workers rejected a contract and voted to strike for the first time since 2008.  
道琼斯工业平均指数周五上涨 0.7%，本周上涨 2.6%。它现在接近历史最高水平。**卡特彼**勒 （[CAT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT) 上涨 1.7%，是该指数中表现最好的股票之一，占道琼斯指数 297 点中的 37 点。**波音** （[BA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA) 表现最为艰难，在工人拒绝合同并自 2008 年以来首次投票决定罢工后下跌 3.5%。


Small caps rallied furiously, with the Russell 2000 jumping 2.5%. This allowed it to recapture the 50-day line. Growth stocks also popped. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 1.7% Friday and its next challenge will be to retake its 50-day and 200-day lines.  
小盘股疯狂反弹，罗素 2000 指数上涨 2.5%。这使它能够重新夺回 50 天线。成长型股票也大涨。Innovator IBD 50 ETF （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 周五上涨 1.7%，其下一个挑战将是重新夺回其 50 天和 200 天线。


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP091324-272x300.jpg)More top-rated stocks broke out of bases, adding to the positive tone in the stock market. These included the likes of **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), which cleared a consolidation entry of 177.20, and **Badger Meter** ([BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)), which is in a buy zone above a [cup-with-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) of 207.97.  
更多评级最高的股票突破了基地，增加了股市的积极基调。其中包括 **GE Aerospace** （[GE）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE) 等公司，该公司完成了 177.20 的盘整入场，以及 **Badger Meter** （[BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)） 等股票，该公司处于 207.97 杯[带把手入场口](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/)上方的买入区域。


As Fed Meeting Looms, Consider This Exposure Level随着美联储会议的临近，请考虑这个风险敞口水平
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stocks were bolstered this week by benign inflation data. On Friday, import prices data furthered the cooling thesis, with the price of imported goods falling 0.3% last month, compared with views for a decline of 0.2%. This also compared favorably to July's 0.1% rise.  
本周，温和的通胀数据提振了股市。周五，进口价格数据进一步推动了降温论点，上个月进口商品价格下跌 0.3%，而预期下跌 0.2%。这也与 7 月份 0.1% 的涨幅相比有所好转。


A slew of noteworthy economic data is due in the coming week. The August U.S. retail sales report drops Tuesday. A splurge of housing data also looms, while the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey is expected on Thursday.  
未来一周将公布一系列值得注意的经济数据。美国 8 月零售销售报告周二下降。大量住房数据也迫在眉睫，而费城联储制造业调查预计将于周四公布。


However, the key event will be the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which concludes Wednesday. With a cut assured, the key question is the size. It is currently a near-50/50 chance for either a 25-basis-point cut or a 50-basis-point reduction, [according to the CME Fedwatch Tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) Post-meeting commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could also move the markets.  
然而，关键事件将是最新的联邦公开市场委员会会议，该会议将于周三结束。确保切割后，关键问题是尺寸。[根据 CME Fedwatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) 的数据，目前降息 25 个基点或降息 50 个基点的可能性接近 50/50。美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔在会后发表的评论也可能影响市场。


The stock market is looking bullish, with all major indexes now trading above the important 50-day moving average. IBD is retaining exposure in the 60% to 80% range for now as we head into the Fed meeting. However investors should be raising exposure back to the upper end of this range due to the encouraging action.  
股市看起来看涨，所有主要指数现在都高于重要的 50 天移动平均线。随着我们进入美联储会议，IBD 目前将风险敞口保持在 60% 至 80% 的范围内。然而，由于这一令人鼓舞的行动，投资者应该将敞口提高到该区间的上限。


Earnings season has slowed to a crawl, but there are a [few noteworthy firms set to post results](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/fedex-stock-homebuilder-lennar-earnings/). **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), homebuilder **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)) are among reports to look for in the coming week. **Granite Construction** ([GVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GVA)) and **F5** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) broke out and are noteworthy watchlist candidates.  
财报季已经放缓，但仍有[几家值得注意的公司将公布业绩](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/fedex-stock-homebuilder-lennar-earnings/)。**联邦快递** （[FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)）、住宅建筑商 **Lennar** （[LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)） 和**通用磨坊** （[GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)） 是未来一周值得关注的报告之一。**Granite Construction** （[GVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GVA)） 和 **F5** （[FFIV）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV) 爆发，是值得注意的观察名单候选者。

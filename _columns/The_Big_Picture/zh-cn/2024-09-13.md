The stock market ended the week in bullish fashion, with indexes recouping most of their September losses. However the next Fed meeting and a slew of economic data await investors in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite had another solid session Friday, rising nearly 0.7%. Its muscular weekly gain of 6% was its best of the year and means it is now down just 0.2% in September, quite the turnaround in fortunes from just a week ago. It ended the latest week back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) , a bullish sign. The tech-heavy index now holds a gain of 17.8% so far in 2024.


The S&P 500 rose 0.5% It pulled further clear of its 50-day line and ended the week above its short-term moving averages to boot. Its own weekly lift of 4% means it now has a loss of just 0.4% for the month. It also holds a meaty year-to-date gain of 18%.


Advancers led decliners by more than 5-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was slightly lighter for both major exchanges from Thursday's totals.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% Friday and popped 2.6% for the week. It now sits near all-time high levels. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), up 1.7%, was among the best performers on the vaunted index, accounting for 37 of the Dow's 297 points. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) struggled most, falling 3.5% after workers rejected a contract and voted to strike for the first time since 2008.


Small caps rallied furiously, with the Russell 2000 jumping 2.5%. This allowed it to recapture the 50-day line. Growth stocks also popped. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 1.7% Friday and its next challenge will be to retake its 50-day and 200-day lines.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP091324-272x300.jpg)More top-rated stocks broke out of bases, adding to the positive tone in the stock market. These included the likes of **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), which cleared a consolidation entry of 177.20, and **Badger Meter** ([BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)), which is in a buy zone above a [cup-with-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) of 207.97.


As Fed Meeting Looms, Consider This Exposure Level
--------------------------------------------------


Stocks were bolstered this week by benign inflation data. On Friday, import prices data furthered the cooling thesis, with the price of imported goods falling 0.3% last month, compared with views for a decline of 0.2%. This also compared favorably to July's 0.1% rise.


A slew of noteworthy economic data is due in the coming week. The August U.S. retail sales report drops Tuesday. A splurge of housing data also looms, while the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey is expected on Thursday.


However, the key event will be the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which concludes Wednesday. With a cut assured, the key question is the size. It is currently a near-50/50 chance for either a 25-basis-point cut or a 50-basis-point reduction, [according to the CME Fedwatch Tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) Post-meeting commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could also move the markets.


The stock market is looking bullish, with all major indexes now trading above the important 50-day moving average. IBD is retaining exposure in the 60% to 80% range for now as we head into the Fed meeting. However investors should be raising exposure back to the upper end of this range due to the encouraging action.


Earnings season has slowed to a crawl, but there are a [few noteworthy firms set to post results](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/fedex-stock-homebuilder-lennar-earnings/). **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), homebuilder **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)) are among reports to look for in the coming week. **Granite Construction** ([GVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GVA)) and **F5** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) broke out and are noteworthy watchlist candidates.

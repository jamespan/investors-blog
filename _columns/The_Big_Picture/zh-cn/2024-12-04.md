The stock market got through new economic data, earnings reports and a public appearance by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell with ease Wednesday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbed for a fourth consecutive day.  
周三，纳斯达克和标准普尔 500 指数连续第四天攀升，股市轻松度过了新的经济数据、收益报告和美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔的公开露面。


Both major indexes rose to record highs again Wednesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 45,000 for the first time.  
周三，两大主要指数再次升至历史新高，道琼斯工业平均指数首次收于 45,000 点以上。


The Nasdaq led with a 1.3% jump, making it 11 gains in the past 12 sessions. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, also its 11th gain in the past 12 sessions. The technology sector outperformed, giving the Nasdaq plenty of tailwind.  
纳斯达克指数以 1.3% 的涨幅领涨，在过去 12 个交易日中上涨了 11 次。标准普尔 500 指数上涨 0.6%，也是过去 12 个交易日中的第 11 次上涨。科技板块表现出色，为纳斯达克提供了充足的顺风。




The Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) rose 1.8% to an all-time high, clearing an alternative [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) at 237.94. The exchange traded fund initially broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) Sept. 26 and is up 6% from a 227.37 buy point.  
科技精选板块 SPDR （[XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)） 上涨 1.8% 至历史新高，在 237.94 处清除了另一个[买入点](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/)。该交易所交易基金最初于 9 月 26 日突破了带[手柄的杯子底部](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/)，从 227.37 的买入点上涨了 6%。


A series of positive earnings reports made the tech sector a winner. Chipmaker **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) beat expectations on [strong demand for its custom chips](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/marvell-stock-marvel-earnings-custom-ai-chips-q32024/) for artificial intelligence applications. **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) soared 22% to its highest close since July after a [solid earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pure-storage-stock-earnings-q3-2024-ai/).  
一系列积极的收益报告使科技行业成为赢家。芯片制造商 **Marvell Technology** （[MRVL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL) 因其用于人工智能应用的[定制芯片的强劲需求](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/marvell-stock-marvel-earnings-custom-ai-chips-q32024/)而超出预期。**Pure Storage** （[PSTG）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG) 在公布[稳健的收益报告](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pure-storage-stock-earnings-q3-2024-ai/)后飙升 22% 至 7 月以来的最高收盘价。


Software stocks in particular were brilliant. Seven of the 12 best-performing industry groups Wednesday were in that sector.  
软件股尤其出色。周三表现最好的 12 个行业组中有 7 个属于该行业。


Dow Races To New Milestone道琼斯指数迈向新的里程碑
--------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP120424.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% and made one of its fastest runs to a 1,000-point milestone. The index took only 16 trading days to get from 44,000 to 45,000. That's the third-fastest 1,000-point jaunt on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  
道琼斯工业平均指数上涨 0.7%，创下最快达到 1,000 点里程碑的水平之一。该指数仅用了 16 个交易日就从 44,000 点上涨到 45,000 点。根据道琼斯市场数据，这是有记录以来第三快的 1,000 点短途旅行。


**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) showed up big time for the Dow. The stock gapped up to a record high in heavy volume and provided the Dow with 224 of its 308-point advance. Late Tuesday, the software company issued a [mixed October-quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-news-q32024/) but analysts cheered the company's progress in — what else — artificial intelligence products.  
**Salesforce** （[CRM）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM) 在道琼斯指数中表现抢占先机。该股跳空飙升至历史新高，道琼斯指数上涨了 308 点中的 224 点。周二晚些时候，这家软件公司发布了一份[喜忧参半的 10 月季度报告](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-news-q32024/)，但分析师对该公司在人工智能产品方面的进步表示欢呼。


The Russell 2000 added 0.4% as it tried to snap out of a weeklong slumber. The small-cap benchmark briefly made a record high last week but has been slipping since.  
罗素 2000 指数上涨 0.4%，因为它试图从长达一周的沉睡中醒来。小盘股基准指数上周短暂创下历史新高，但此后一直在下滑。


Volume fell moderately on the New York Stock Exchange and rose on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq's solid gain in higher volume could be viewed as a secondary [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), a shot of confidence for the stock market.  
纽约证券交易所的成交量小幅下降，纳斯达克的成交量上升。纳斯达克指数在成交量增加中的稳健上涨可被视为第二个[后续交易日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/)，是对股市的信心。


Advancing stocks topped decliners by a 9-to-7 ratio on the Nasdaq. But winners and losers were nearly even on the NYSE.  
在纳斯达克指数中，上涨的股票以 9 比 7 的比率领先于下跌的股票。但在纽约证券交易所，赢家和输家几乎持平。


Stock Market Overheating?股市过热？
------------------------------


With few distribution days on the ledger, and indexes making record highs, the stock market gives investors justification to continue with 80% to 100% exposure, as IBD is recommending.  
正如 IBD 所建议的那样，由于账本上的分配天数很少，而且指数创下历史新高，股市为投资者提供了继续 80% 至 100% 敞口的理由。


But could the major indexes be getting overheated? The signals are mixed.  
但主要指数会不会过热了？信号喜忧参半。


The S&P 500 is 3.9% above the 50-day moving average, and the Nasdaq is nearly 6% above its 50-day line. That's the widest gap since the indexes made short-term highs in mid-November.  
标准普尔 500 指数比 50 天移动平均线高出 3.9%，纳斯达克指数比其 50 天移动平均线高出近 6%。这是自 11 月中旬指数创下短期高点以来的最大差距。


That's getting stretched, but is not necessarily cause for alarm. While above their 50-day lines, SPDR S&P 500 Trust ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) and Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) are still below the percentages that historically signal stock market highs.  
这有点紧张，但不一定需要引起警惕。虽然高于 50 天线，但 SPDR S&P 500 Trust （[SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)） 和 Invesco QQQ Trust （[QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)） 仍低于历史上预示股市高点的百分比。


The Nasdaq's short-term overbought-oversold indicator in [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) has climbed to about 500. Spikes to that level signaled index pullbacks in early April, May, July and early September, but not in late September.  
纳斯达克在 [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) 中的短期超买超卖指标已攀升至 500 左右。飙升至该水平预示着指数在 4 月初、5 月、7 月和 9 月初回调，但 9 月下旬则没有。

Investor optimism continues to run hot. The Investors Intelligence weekly survey of market newsletters showed bulls rose to 62.9% from 61.3% a week earlier. It's been eight straight weeks that bulls exceed 55%, which the firm considers a danger zone. It's also the most bulls since 64.2% in July.  
投资者的乐观情绪继续炙手可热。Investors Intelligence 对市场通讯的每周调查显示，多头从一周前的 61.3% 上升到 62.9%。多头已经连续八周超过 55%，该公司认为这是一个危险区域。这也是自 7 月份 64.2% 以来最多的多头。


While the stock market may need a little cooling, [seasonal trends are in its favor](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-tech-stocks/). December tends to be kind to stock investors, especially in the second half of the month.  
虽然股市可能需要一点降温，但[季节性趋势对其有利](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-tech-stocks/)。12 月往往对股票投资者有利，尤其是在下半月。


Stock Market Watches Powell, Economic Data股市关注鲍威尔， 经济数据
-------------------------------------------------------


At a New York Times DealBook conference Wednesday afternoon, Powell discussed a range of topics. He said nothing to disrupt the Fed's interest-rate outlook.  
在周三下午的《纽约时报》DealBook 会议上，鲍威尔讨论了一系列话题。他没有说任何话来扰乱美联储的利率前景。


Powell says the U.S. economy is [doing better than it looked in September](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/december-fed-rate-cut-powell-be4a617f?mod=hp_lead_pos3), when the Fed started to cut interest rates. That gives the central bank more leeway in reducing rates while staying on track to move rates toward a more neutral level, he added.  
鲍威尔表示，美国经济[的表现比 9 月份](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/december-fed-rate-cut-powell-be4a617f?mod=hp_lead_pos3)美联储开始降息时要好。他补充说，这让央行在降息方面有更多回旋余地，同时保持将利率推向更中性的水平。


Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said Powell's comments did nothing to alter the view that the Fed will likely trim rates on Dec. 18.  
BMO Capital Markets 高级经济学家 Sal Guatieri 表示，鲍威尔的言论并没有改变美联储可能会在 12 月 18 日降息的观点。


The Fed's Beige Book — released Wednesday afternoon — won't interfere with a rate cut, either, Guatieri added. It found economic activity growing slightly in most Fed districts, with the labor market steady.  
瓜蒂耶里补充说，美联储周三下午发布的褐皮书也不会干扰降息。研究发现，大多数美联储地区的经济活动略有增长，劳动力市场保持稳定。


"Although business contacts warned that 'tariffs pose a significant upside risk to inflation,' that's a worry for another day for the Fed," the economist noted. "It won't dissuade a quarter-point rate cut later this month, barring a surprisingly strong [payrolls report on Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-nov-bls-adp-federal-reserve-rate-cut-outlook-sp-500/)."  
“尽管商业联系人警告说，'关税对通胀构成重大上行风险'，但这是美联储又一天的担忧，”这位经济学家指出。“它不会阻止本月晚些时候降息 25 个基点，除非周五公布出人意料的强劲[就业报告](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-nov-bls-adp-federal-reserve-rate-cut-outlook-sp-500/)。”


The 10-year Treasury yield reversed lower by four basis points to 4.18%.  
10 年期美国国债收益率逆转下跌 4 个基点至 4.18%。

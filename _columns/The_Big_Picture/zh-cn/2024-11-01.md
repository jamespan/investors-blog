The stock market ended Friday higher following a weak jobs report but booked weekly losses. Now the U.S. elections as well as the next Fed decision on interest rates loom for investors.  
在疲软的就业报告公布后，股市周五收高，但每周录得下跌。现在，美国大选以及美联储的下一个利率决定对投资者来说迫在眉睫。


The Nasdaq composite saw early gains fade as it closed 0.8% higher. This was not enough to stop the tech-heavy index suffering a weekly decline of 1.5%, snapping a seven-week win streak in the process. It hit resistance at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) but sits 1.6% above its [50-day line.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) The index remains up 21.5% in 2024.  
纳斯达克综合指数早盘涨幅回落，收盘上涨 0.8%。这不足以阻止以科技股为主的指数每周下跌 1.5%，在此过程中结束了连续七周的上涨。它在 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)处触及阻力位，但比 [50 天线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)高出 1.6%。该指数在 2024 年仍上涨 21.5%。




The S&P 500 notched a gain of 0.4% after being up 1.2%. It ended the week down 1.4%, its second weekly decline in a row. The benchmark index has pulled back to its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), but remains up 20.1% for the year so far.  
标准普尔 500 指数在上涨 0.4% 后上涨 1.2%。本周收盘下跌 1.4%，连续第二周下跌。该基准指数已回落至 [10 周移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/)，但今年迄今仍上涨 20.1%。


A rise in Treasury yields weighed on stocks. The 10-year Treasury note jumped eight basis points to 4.36%, a four-month high, while the two-year popped four basis points to 4.20%.  
美国国债收益率上升令股市承压。10 年期美国国债上涨 8 个基点至 4.36%，创下四个月新高，而 2 年期美国国债上涨 4 个基点至 4.20%。


Decliners led advancers on the New York Stock Exchange but advancers held the edge on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges from Thursday's totals.  
纽约证券交易所的下跌股领先于上涨的股票，但纳斯达克的上涨者占据了优势。与周四的总数相比，两家交易所的成交量均有所下降。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% Friday but turned in a weekly dip of 0.2%. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was the strongest performer here after better-than-expected earnings and guidance. But it had a minor impact on the price-weighted Dow. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was the Dow's biggest contributor, according to Dow Jones Market Data. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was among the worst laggards as it fell 1.3% following its quarterly report.  
道琼斯工业平均指数周五上涨 0.7%，但每周下跌 0.2%。**英特尔** （[INTC）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC) 在收益和指引好于预期后表现最强劲。但它对价格加权道琼斯指数的影响很小。根据道琼斯市场数据，**Amazon.com** （[AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)） 是道琼斯指数的最大贡献者。**苹果** （[AAPL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL) 是表现最差的股票之一，在季度报告发布后下跌 1.3%。

Growth stocks were solid, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) clambering back above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) after popping 0.9%.  
小盘股在股市上飙升，但罗素 2000 指数周五的涨幅回落至 0.6%，本周收盘几乎持平。成长型股票表现稳健，Innovator IBD 50 ETF （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 在上涨 0.9% 后回升至 [200 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/)上方。


Trump-Harris Election, Fed Meeting Next特朗普-哈里斯大选，美联储会议
------------------------------------------------------


Stocks rallied Friday following a weak jobs report. The U.S. economy added 12,000 nonfarm positions in October, well below the 125,000 forecast by economists. While the impact of hurricanes and the strike at **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) weighed, this sizable miss bolstered the case for a rate cut at the forthcoming Fed meeting.  
在疲软的就业报告发布后，股市周五上涨。美国经济 10 月份增加了 12,000 个非农职位，远低于经济学家预测的 125,000 个。虽然飓风和**波音** （[BA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA) 罢工的影响造成了沉重的影响，但这一相当大的失误增强了在即将到来的美联储会议上降息的理由。


In other economic news, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing reading came in weaker than expected and was below the 50 threshold for growth for the seventh month in a row.  
在其他经济新闻方面，美国供应管理协会（Institute for Supply Management）的制造业数据弱于预期，连续第七个月低于50的增长门槛。


Volatility is likely to be on the cards in the coming week given the sizable events taking place. Firstly, Tuesday is election day, with [the presidential race result too close to call](https://www.realclearpolling.com/elections/president/2024/battleground-states). Voters also will decide hundreds of congressional and state elections.  
鉴于正在发生的重大事件，未来一周可能会出现波动性。首先，周二是选举日，[总统竞选结果太接近了](https://www.realclearpolling.com/elections/president/2024/battleground-states)。选民还将决定数百场国会和州选举。


Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump promises lower taxes but his love of tariffs threatens global trade. Meanwhile, Democrat Kamala Harris could pursue higher taxes while continuing the Biden Administration's tough stance on mergers. Who ends up controlling Congress will be key, with a split result being the one that could potentially offer the most benefit.  
共和党总统候选人唐纳德·特朗普承诺降低税收，但他对关税的热爱威胁到全球贸易。与此同时，民主党人卡玛拉·哈里斯 （Kamala Harris） 可能会追求更高的税收，同时继续拜登政府对合并的强硬立场。谁最终控制国会将是关键，而分裂的结果可能会带来最大的好处。


The coming week will also see the Federal Open Market Committee meeting take place. The decision itself will be announced Thursday, with a 25-basis-point cut seen as nearly certain [by the CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). Post-meeting comments from Fed Chair Powell could also move the stock market.  
下周还将举行联邦公开市场委员会会议。该决定本身将于周四宣布，[CME FedWatch 工具](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html)认为几乎肯定会降息 25 个基点。美联储主席鲍威尔的会后评论也可能影响股市。

The stock market ended Friday higher following a weak jobs report but booked weekly losses. Now the U.S. elections as well as the next Fed decision on interest rates loom for investors.  


The Nasdaq composite saw early gains fade as it closed 0.8% higher. This was not enough to stop the tech-heavy index suffering a weekly decline of 1.5%, snapping a seven-week win streak in the process. It hit resistance at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) but sits 1.6% above its [50-day line.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) The index remains up 21.5% in 2024.  




The S&P 500 notched a gain of 0.4% after being up 1.2%. It ended the week down 1.4%, its second weekly decline in a row. The benchmark index has pulled back to its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), but remains up 20.1% for the year so far.  


A rise in Treasury yields weighed on stocks. The 10-year Treasury note jumped eight basis points to 4.36%, a four-month high, while the two-year popped four basis points to 4.20%.  


Decliners led advancers on the New York Stock Exchange but advancers held the edge on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges from Thursday's totals.  


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% Friday but turned in a weekly dip of 0.2%. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was the strongest performer here after better-than-expected earnings and guidance. But it had a minor impact on the price-weighted Dow. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was the Dow's biggest contributor, according to Dow Jones Market Data. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was among the worst laggards as it fell 1.3% following its quarterly report.

Growth stocks were solid, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) clambering back above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) after popping 0.9%.  


Trump-Harris Election, Fed Meeting Next
---------------------------------------


Stocks rallied Friday following a weak jobs report. The U.S. economy added 12,000 nonfarm positions in October, well below the 125,000 forecast by economists. While the impact of hurricanes and the strike at **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) weighed, this sizable miss bolstered the case for a rate cut at the forthcoming Fed meeting.  


In other economic news, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing reading came in weaker than expected and was below the 50 threshold for growth for the seventh month in a row.  


Volatility is likely to be on the cards in the coming week given the sizable events taking place. Firstly, Tuesday is election day, with [the presidential race result too close to call](https://www.realclearpolling.com/elections/president/2024/battleground-states). Voters also will decide hundreds of congressional and state elections.  


Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump promises lower taxes but his love of tariffs threatens global trade. Meanwhile, Democrat Kamala Harris could pursue higher taxes while continuing the Biden Administration's tough stance on mergers. Who ends up controlling Congress will be key, with a split result being the one that could potentially offer the most benefit.  


The coming week will also see the Federal Open Market Committee meeting take place. The decision itself will be announced Thursday, with a 25-basis-point cut seen as nearly certain [by the CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). Post-meeting comments from Fed Chair Powell could also move the stock market.  


Noteworthy [earnings reports in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-ai-chips-ferrari-arm-earnings/) include **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), chip stock **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) and **Vistra** ([VST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VST)).  


Amazon Earnings Help This Stock Market Group
--------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday mixed](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Consumer discretionary and technology were strongest while real estate and utilities had the toughest sessions.  



Investors could get a deeper insight into the action on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by examining the relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups.  


Integrated telecom services stocks, heavy construction plays, wholesale drug suppliers and replacement auto parts firms all had good days. The internet retail group also had a solid session. It was bolstered by a post-earnings jump in Amazon.com, with the stock rising 6.2% after it beat on the top and bottom lines.  


On the flip side, metal products stocks, insurance brokers, electric utility companies and mortgage plays were among the worst performers.

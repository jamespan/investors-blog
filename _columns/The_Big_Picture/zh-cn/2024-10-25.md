The stock market ended the day and week mixed as the Nasdaq touched a fresh high. Earnings reports from Magnificent Seven names including **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), as well as the latest jobs report, are due.  
股市收盘涨跌互现，纳斯达克指数触及新高。包括 **Microsoft** （[MSFT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT) 和**苹果** （[AAPL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL) 在内的 Magnificent Seven 的收益报告以及最新的就业报告即将发布。


The Nasdaq composite was the standout performer among the major indexes as it rallied 0.6% Friday, though it ended well off session highs. The tech-heavy index notched an intraday record high and turned in a weekly gain of 0.2%. It sits comfortably clear of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and holds a gain of 23.4% for the year so far.  
纳斯达克综合指数在主要指数中表现突出，周五上涨 0.6%，但收盘远低于盘中高点。以科技股为主的指数盘中创下历史新高，周涨幅为 0.2%。它轻松摆脱了 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)，今年迄今上涨了 23.4%。




The S&P 500 fell fractionally Friday, but was essentially flat. It notched a weekly decline of 1%, backing off from the prior week's all-time high levels. Nevertheless, the benchmark index is holding above the 21-day and 50-day lines and remains up 21.8% in 2024.  
标准普尔 500 指数周五小幅下跌，但基本持平。它每周下跌 1%，从前一周的历史高位回落。尽管如此，该基准指数仍保持在 21 天和 50 天线上方，并在 2024 年仍上涨 21.8%。


Decliners led advancers on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE. The Sept. 20 distribution day came off the Nasdaq's count due to time.  
纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克股市的下跌领涨。纳斯达克的成交量较高，但纽约证券交易所的成交量较低。由于时间原因，9 月 20 日的发行日从纳斯达克的统计中消失了。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was hit the hardest out of the major indexes as it fell 0.6%. Its weekly decline was also heavier at 2.7%. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) fared best. **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) was the worst laggard, falling 3% amid the ongoing fallout from an E. coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounder burgers.  
道琼斯工业平均指数在主要指数中受到的打击最严重，下跌 0.6%。其每周跌幅也更大，为 2.7%。**英特尔** （[INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)） 和 **Salesforce** （[CRM）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM) 表现最好。**麦当劳** （[MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)） 表现最差，在与其 Quarter Pounder 汉堡相关的大肠杆菌爆发的持续影响中下跌 3%。


Small caps had a tough time on the stock market, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.5% Friday and ending the week down 3%. Growth stocks dug in though, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund ending well off its lows for the week despite skidding 0.1% Friday.  
小盘股在股市上经历了一段艰难的时期，罗素 2000 指数周五下跌 0.5%，本周收盘下跌 3%。不过，成长型股票上涨，尽管周五下跌 0.1%，但 Innovator IBD 50 （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 交易所交易基金收盘时远低于本周的低点。


Magnificent Seven Earnings, Jobs Report Next华丽七大收益，就业报告 下一份
-----------------------------------------------------------


There was a sprinkling of economic data Friday, with the Census Bureau reporting durable-goods orders falling 0.8% in September. This matched the decline of the previous month. This was slightly worse than economists' expectations for a 0.5% drop, according to Econoday. The ongoing strike at **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) had an effect, with orders rising 0.4% when autos and aircraft were excluded.  
周五有零星的经济数据，人口普查局报告称，9 月份耐用品订单下降了 0.8%。这与上个月的下降持平。据 Econoday 称，这略低于经济学家预期的 0.5% 的下降。**波音** （[BA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA) 的持续罢工产生了影响，不包括汽车和飞机的订单增长了 0.4%。


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102524.jpg)Meanwhile, consumer sentiment hit a six-month high reading of 70.5 in October, [the University of Michigan said](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/). It was partially helped by growing confidence among Republicans of a Donald Trump victory for the U.S. presidency. A drop in interest rates also bolstered the mood of consumers.  
与此同时，[密歇根大学表示](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/)，消费者信心指数在 10 月份创下 70.5 的六个月高点。共和党人对唐纳德·特朗普赢得美国总统选举的信心日益增强，这在一定程度上起到了帮助作用。利率下降也提振了消费者的情绪。


The coming week sees the release of some important economic data points. The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is due Thursday, and should offer a new inflation reading.  
未来一周，一些重要的经济数据将公布。最新的个人消费支出价格指数将于周四公布，应该会提供新的通胀数据。


A smattering of jobs data also is expected, with job openings figures scheduled for Tuesday, the ADP employment report dropping Wednesday and the pivotal U.S. jobs report due Friday. It is expected that the U.S. economy added 125,000 jobs in October.  
预计还会有少量就业数据，职位空缺数据定于周二公布，ADP 就业报告将于周三公布，关键的美国就业报告将于周五公布。预计美国经济在 10 月份增加了 125,000 个工作岗位。


As if that wasn't enough, [earnings season will reach a height of intensity](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/meta-platforms-apple-stock-amazon-headline-earnings/) when five of the Magnificent Seven stocks report next week. Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is due to report Tuesday, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) come Wednesday and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) drop Thursday.  
似乎这还不够，当 Magnificent Seven 股票中的 5 只在下周公布财[报时，财报季将达到高度紧张](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/meta-platforms-apple-stock-amazon-headline-earnings/)。谷歌母公司 **Alphabet** （[GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)） 将于周二公布财报，**Microsoft** （[MSFT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT) 和 **Meta Platforms** （[META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)） 将于周三公布财报，**Amazon.com** （[AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)） 和**苹果** （[AAPL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL) 将于周四公布财报。


Deckers Earnings Kick This Stock Market Group HigherDeckers 的收益推动该股市组走高
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday mixed](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/), with a bias to the negative. Communication services and technology were the strongest areas while financials and utilities were the worst laggards.  
[标准普尔 500 指数板块周五收盘涨跌互现](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/)，偏向负面。通信服务和科技是表现最强劲的领域，而金融和公用事业是表现最差的领域。



The relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups gave a deeper account of the action on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).  
《投资者商业日报》的 197 个行业团体的相对表现更深入地说明了[当今股市](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)的走势。


Specialty consumer products firms, trucking plays, educational software stocks and office supply retailers were all strong. But it was the shoe manufacturing group that fared the best, boosted by a post-earnings rally from **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)). The Ugg parent soared 10.5% after beating views, clearing a handle entry of 167.23 in high volume in the process.  
专业消费品公司、卡车运输公司、教育软件股和办公用品零售商都表现强劲。但鞋类制造集团表现最好，这得益于 **Deckers Outdoor** （[DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)） 财报后的反弹。Ugg 母公司在击败浏览量后飙升 10.5%，在此过程中高交易量清除了 167.23 的句柄条目。


On the flip side, medical supplies plays and a variety of insurance groups and media periodicals all underperformed. Hospitals were hit the hardest though following a disappointing earnings report from **HCA Healthcare** ([HCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA)), which ended the day down 8.9% and flashed a sell signal by [undercutting the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/).  
另一方面，医疗用品公司以及各种保险集团和媒体期刊都表现不佳。不过，在 **HCA Healthcare** （[HCA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA) 令人失望的收益报告之后，医院受到的打击最为严重，该报告当天收盘下跌 8.9%，并通过[跌破 50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/)发出卖出信号。

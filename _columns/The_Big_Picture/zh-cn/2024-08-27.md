Sellers knocked the Russell 2000 small-cap index for a loss of 0.7% in the stock market Tuesday. But the major indexes held in there, ending flat to slightly higher ahead of Nvidia's earnings report and a critical reading on inflation due Friday.  
周二，卖家在股市上敲响了罗素 2000 小盘股指数，下跌了 0.7%。但主要股指持稳，在英伟达财报和周五公布的关键通胀数据之前收盘持平或略高。




The Nasdaq composite edged up nearly 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 added 0.3% as both indexes tested their 50-day moving averages. Despite small gains for both Nasdaq indexes, declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq exchange by roughly 3-to-2. Volume came in lower than Monday.  
纳斯达克综合指数小幅上涨近 0.2%，纳斯达克 100 指数上涨 0.3%，这两个指数都测试了其 50 天移动平均线。尽管纳斯达克指数均小幅上涨，但下跌的股票数量与纳斯达克交易所上涨的股票数量之比约为 3 比 2。成交量低于周一。


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) led a mixed performance for the [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks/) stocks. Shares rose 1.5% in light volume ahead of the company's [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-ai-competition-chips/) due Wednesday after the close.  
**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 领跑 [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks/) 股票的表现喜忧参半。在周三收盘后该公司公布[收益报告](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-ai-competition-chips/)之前，股价上涨 1.5%。


Nvidia continues to show strength and support after a nice move above the 50-day moving average. Expectations are high for another quarter of triple-digit earnings and revenue growth. But Nvidia's outlook will be even more important after a strong pre-earnings rally off lows.  
英伟达在 50 天移动平均线上方取得好成绩后继续表现出实力和支持。市场对另一个季度的三位数收益和收入增长寄予厚望。但在财报前从低点强劲反弹之后，英伟达的前景将变得更加重要。


The 10-year Treasury yield added two basis points to 3.84% after hitting an intraday high of nearly 3.87%. Yields strengthened a bit after the latest reading on consumer confidence came in better than expected.  
10 年期美国国债收益率在触及近 3.87% 的盘中高点后上涨 2 个基点至 3.84%。在最新的消费者信心数据好于预期后，收益率略有走强。

Market expectations are still for 100 basis points in rate cuts before the end of the year, according to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html). That implies one 50-basis-point cut at one of the Federal Reserve's remaining three meetings.  
根据 [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) 的数据，市场仍预期年底前降息 100 个基点。这意味着美联储将在剩余的三次会议中的一次降息 50 个基点。


Meanwhile, the latest reading from the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — one of the Fed's preferred inflation gauges —is due for release Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. On a year-over-year basis, core prices are expected to rise 2.7% in July, slightly above June's reading of 2.6%.  
与此同时，个人消费支出指数 （PCE） 的最新读数——美联储首选的通胀指标之一——将于美国东部时间周五上午 8：30 发布。与去年同期相比，预计 7 月份核心价格将上涨 2.7%，略高于 6 月份的 2.6%。

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was a modest gainer on the Dow, up 0.3% ahead of the company's [Sept. 9 iPhone 16 event](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-fall-product-launch-event-anticipation/). New models of the Apple Watch and AirPods are also expected.

Similar to Nvidia, Apple is back near highs and holding above its 50-day line. Same with **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)). But **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are all on downtrends and below their 50-day lines.  
与 Nvidia 类似，Apple 回到高点附近并保持在其 50 日线上方。**与 Meta Platforms** （[META）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META) 相同。但 **Microsoft** （[MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)）、**Alphabet** （[GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)）、**Amazon.com** （[AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)） 和**特斯拉** （[TSLA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA) 都处于下跌趋势中，并低于 50 日线。


As money rotates out of several large-cap technology stocks, it's finding a home in other areas like utilities and gold stocks. These are typically defensive areas of the market, but leadership has expanded well beyond these two areas into other areas like retail, building, health care and financial stocks.  
随着资金从几只大盘科技股中轮换出来，它正在公用事业和黄金股等其他领域找到归宿。这些通常是市场的防御性领域，但领导力已经远远超出了这两个领域，扩展到了零售、建筑、医疗保健和金融股票等其他领域。


While there are plenty of stocks out there that are extended past proper buy points, the stock market continues to serve up actionable stocks. It's a smaller group these days after a nice run for the market since the Aug. 5 lows. But the confirmed uptrend continues to show signs of strength.  
虽然有很多股票超过了适当的买入点，但股票市场继续提供可操作的股票。自 8 月 5 日低点以来，市场表现良好，如今这是一个较小的群体。但已确认的上升趋势继续显示出强劲的迹象。

Inside the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), small cap and recent initial public offering **Ardent Health Partners** ([ARDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARDT)) jumped 6% and cleared an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with an 18.16 entry. The hospital operator went public in July at 16 and is prone to volatile price swings.  
在 [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com) 内部，小盘股和最近的首次公开募股 **Ardent Health Partners** （[ARDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARDT)） 上涨了 6%，并以 18.16 的入场价清除了 [IPO 基础](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/)。这家医院运营商于 7 月在 16 岁时上市，容易受到价格波动的影响。


**Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) also joined the breakout ranks Tuesday, jumping past the 900 level with conviction early in the session, Costco closed above an 896.67 entry, but an intraday gain of nearly 3% faded to 1.8% by the close.  
**Costco** （[COST）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST) 周二也加入了突破行列，在盘中早些时候坚定地跃升至 900 水平，Costco 收于 896.67 点上方，但盘中近 3% 的涨幅在收盘时消退至 1.8%。


Online travel firms outperformed, helped by a strong earnings report from China-based **Trip.com** ([TCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCOM)). Trip.com gapped above its 50-day line on news that second-quarter profit increased 43% year over year. Revenue increased 13% to $1.76 billion. But the stock is still more than 20% off its 52-week high with plenty of [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/david-ryan-how-to-spot-and-understand-overhead-supply) to conquer.  
在线旅游公司表现优异，这得益于中国 **Trip.com** （[TCOM）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCOM) 的强劲收益报告。Trip.com 跳空突破其 50 天线，因为有消息称第二季度利润同比增长 43%。收入增长 13%，达到 17.6 亿美元。但该股仍较 20 周高点下跌 52% 以上，还有大量的[间接供应](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/david-ryan-how-to-spot-and-understand-overhead-supply)可供征服。


**Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) also had a good day, up more than 4% in light volume. The cruise line operator is less than 3% off its 52-week high. A six-week cup base could be in place by the end of the week. Group peer **Viking** ([VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)) has recovered well after a volatile response to earnings last week. It's forming an IPO base with a 36.90 buy point.  
**皇家加勒比** （[RCL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL) 也表现不错，光价上涨超过 4%。这家邮轮运营商较 3 周高点下跌不到 52%。到本周末，为期六周的杯赛基础可能会到位。集团同行 **Viking** （[VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)） 在上周对收益的波动反应后恢复良好。它正在形成一个拥有 36.90 买入点的 IPO 基础。

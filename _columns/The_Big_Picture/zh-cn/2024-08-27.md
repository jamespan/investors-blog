Sellers knocked the Russell 2000 small-cap index for a loss of 0.7% in the stock market Tuesday. But the major indexes held in there, ending flat to slightly higher ahead of Nvidia's earnings report and a critical reading on inflation due Friday.




The Nasdaq composite edged up nearly 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 added 0.3% as both indexes tested their 50-day moving averages. Despite small gains for both Nasdaq indexes, declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq exchange by roughly 3-to-2. Volume came in lower than Monday.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) led a mixed performance for the [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks/) stocks. Shares rose 1.5% in light volume ahead of the company's [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-ai-competition-chips/) due Wednesday after the close.


Nvidia continues to show strength and support after a nice move above the 50-day moving average. Expectations are high for another quarter of triple-digit earnings and revenue growth. But Nvidia's outlook will be even more important after a strong pre-earnings rally off lows.


The 10-year Treasury yield added two basis points to 3.84% after hitting an intraday high of nearly 3.87%. Yields strengthened a bit after the latest reading on consumer confidence came in better than expected.

Market expectations are still for 100 basis points in rate cuts before the end of the year, according to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html). That implies one 50-basis-point cut at one of the Federal Reserve's remaining three meetings.


Meanwhile, the latest reading from the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — one of the Fed's preferred inflation gauges —is due for release Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. On a year-over-year basis, core prices are expected to rise 2.7% in July, slightly above June's reading of 2.6%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.1%, but marked its second straight all-time closing high. The S&P 500 added nearly 0.2%. Losers beat winners on the New York Stock Exchange by roughly 4-to-3. Volume was slightly lower on the NYSE.

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was a modest gainer on the Dow, up 0.3% ahead of the company's [Sept. 9 iPhone 16 event](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-fall-product-launch-event-anticipation/). New models of the Apple Watch and AirPods are also expected.


Similar to Nvidia, Apple is back near highs and holding above its 50-day line. Same with **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)). But **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are all on downtrends and below their 50-day lines.


As money rotates out of several large-cap technology stocks, it's finding a home in other areas like utilities and gold stocks. These are typically defensive areas of the market, but leadership has expanded well beyond these two areas into other areas like retail, building, health care and financial stocks.


While there are plenty of stocks out there that are extended past proper buy points, the stock market continues to serve up actionable stocks. It's a smaller group these days after a nice run for the market since the Aug. 5 lows. But the confirmed uptrend continues to show signs of strength.


Keep an eye on Stocks On The Move screen on the homepage of investors.com. Stocks rising in heavy volume can often uncover shifts in leadership. Sleep apnea specialist **ResMed** ([RMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMD)) soared past an alternate handle entry of 231.50 after a favorable response to earnings on Aug. 2.


**Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) and **SharkNinja** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)) also made the screen at one point Tuesday. Both are members of [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com). Ferrari first joined the Leaders list on Aug. 14, and IBD's Leaderboard increased its position on April 16. SharkNinja, an earnings option trade, officially joined the Leaders list on Aug. 16 with an average cost basis of 80.80.

Inside the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), small cap and recent initial public offering **Ardent Health Partners** ([ARDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARDT)) jumped 6% and cleared an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with an 18.16 entry. The hospital operator went public in July at 16 and is prone to volatile price swings.


**Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) also joined the breakout ranks Tuesday, jumping past the 900 level with conviction early in the session, Costco closed above an 896.67 entry, but an intraday gain of nearly 3% faded to 1.8% by the close.


Online travel firms outperformed, helped by a strong earnings report from China-based **Trip.com** ([TCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCOM)). Trip.com gapped above its 50-day line on news that second-quarter profit increased 43% year over year. Revenue increased 13% to $1.76 billion. But the stock is still more than 20% off its 52-week high with plenty of [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/david-ryan-how-to-spot-and-understand-overhead-supply) to conquer.


**Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) also had a good day, up more than 4% in light volume. The cruise line operator is less than 3% off its 52-week high. A six-week cup base could be in place by the end of the week. Group peer **Viking** ([VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)) has recovered well after a volatile response to earnings last week. It's forming an IPO base with a 36.90 buy point.

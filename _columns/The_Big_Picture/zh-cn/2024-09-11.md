  Indexes Reverse Powerfully Higher As Stock Market Offers Multiple Positive Signs

The stock market shook off a morning sell-off to close higher Wednesday in a bullish reversal that left some encouraging markers.




Major indexes fought back and mounted their biggest single-day comebacks in nearly two years.


The S&P 500 was down 1.6% at its session low and closed 1.1% higher. The Nasdaq composite erased a 1.4% drop and closed 2.2% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 0.3% but still wiped away a 1.8% decline.


For all three indexes, it was the largest intraday comeback since Oct. 13, 2022, from the day's lows to the closing prices, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


If that date rings a bell, it was the day the stock market made a bottom and effectively ended the 2022 bear market. Drop the mic.


In another positive bit of action, the S&P 500 closed above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) for the first time since Sept. 5. The IBD 50, a proxy for growth leaders, climbed 1.2%.


The Dow dipped below its 50-day line but closed back above it. The index had been the only major gauge to hold above the 50-day average, which hasn't broken stride and remains trending upward.


Volume topped 6 billion shares on the Nasdaq, the most trading since Aug. 5. NYSE volume was slightly lower.


Market Exposure Raised
----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP091124-240x300.jpg)The sum total of Wednesday's action was sufficient to lift IBD's [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) from 20%-40% to 40%-60%. This means investors can look for buys on breakouts, or perhaps add to existing holdings if they find support at important levels such as the 50-day moving average.


Look for other opportunities, such as stocks breaking above trendlines. IBD 50 stock **Oscar Health** ([OSCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSCR)), for example, jumped above a trendline touching its highs from the May 21 high. **Doximity** ([DOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS)), today's [IBD 50 Stocks to Watch selection](https://www.investors.com/research/doximity-stock-docs-ibd-50/), formed a three-weeks-tight pattern.


Of course, the stock market still has some obstacles in its way.


The Nasdaq remains below its 50-day moving average, which has flattened out. The stock market remains sensitive to economic news and election uncertainty.


Breadth was positive but not as much as the indexes would suggest. Advancers topped decliners by 5-4 on the Nasdaq and by 9-7 on the NYSE.


This week's action is going perhaps better than expected.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 has climbed each day this week, holding above Friday's low. Both made their highest closes so far in September.


The Nasdaq 100 is also showing a credible bounce, after rising 2.2% Wednesday.


The technology sector, which bore the brunt of selling earlier this month, led the stock market rebound Wednesday. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) soared 3.4%.


But while tech leadership reappeared, other sectors that had been displaying relative strength lagged Wednesday. Consumer Staples SPDRXLP fell 0.9%. Health care and real estate sectors each lost 0.3%.


Insurance stocks, which had been in a solid advance since early August, came under selling. **Hamilton Insurance** ([HG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HG)), **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **Erie Indemnity** ([ERIE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERIE)) were among the stocks down in high volume.


Inflation Report Rattled Investors
----------------------------------


The stock market opened weaker after inflation data showed a slight uptick.


The August consumer price index showed that inflation continued to moderate, although core prices (excluding food and energy prices) were [slightly higher than expected](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-august-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-sp-500/). Core CPI rose 0.3% from July levels, above the 0.2% consensus forecast. Still, 12-month core CPI held at 3.2%, as economists expected.


Traders immediately interpreted the data — one of the last major pieces of economic data before the Fed meeting next week — to mean a half-point rate cut was off the table. Odds for a quarter-point cut to a 5%-5.25% range [stood at 87% late Wednesday](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html).


"The Fed has the green light to cut 25 bps (basis points) next week, given that the inflation report was in line with expectations," Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said in emailed comments. "It's possible that some will be disappointed that there wasn't a lower-than-expected inflation reading, which might have given the Fed more room to cut 50 bps, but most of the Fed speakers have already telegraphed their desire to start slowly and not begin with a jumbo cut."

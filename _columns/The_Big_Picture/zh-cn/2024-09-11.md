The stock market shook off a morning sell-off to close higher Wednesday in a bullish reversal that left some encouraging markers.  
股市摆脱了早盘的抛售，周三在看涨逆转中收高，留下了一些令人鼓舞的标志。




Major indexes fought back and mounted their biggest single-day comebacks in nearly two years.  
主要股指奋起反击，创下近两年来最大单日反弹。


The S&P 500 was down 1.6% at its session low and closed 1.1% higher. The Nasdaq composite erased a 1.4% drop and closed 2.2% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 0.3% but still wiped away a 1.8% decline.  
标准普尔 500 指数在盘中低点下跌 1.6%，收盘上涨 1.1%。纳斯达克综合指数抹去了 1.4% 的跌幅，收盘上涨 2.2%。道琼斯工业平均指数仅上涨 0.3%，但仍抹去了 1.8% 的跌幅。


For all three indexes, it was the largest intraday comeback since Oct. 13, 2022, from the day's lows to the closing prices, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  
根据道琼斯市场数据，这三个指数都是自 2022 年 10 月 13 日以来从当日低点到收盘价的最大盘中反弹。


If that date rings a bell, it was the day the stock market made a bottom and effectively ended the 2022 bear market. Drop the mic.  
如果那个日期敲响了警钟，那就是股市触底并有效结束 2022 年熊市的那一天。放下麦克风。


In another positive bit of action, the S&P 500 closed above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) for the first time since Sept. 5. The IBD 50, a proxy for growth leaders, climbed 1.2%.  
另一个积极的行动是，标准普尔 500 指数自 9 月 5 日以来首次收于 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)上方。代表增长领导者的 IBD 50 上涨 1.2%。


The Dow dipped below its 50-day line but closed back above it. The index had been the only major gauge to hold above the 50-day average, which hasn't broken stride and remains trending upward.  
道琼斯指数跌破 50 日线，但收于该线上方。该指数是唯一保持在 50 天均线上方的主要指标，该指标没有大步前进，并且仍然呈上升趋势。


Volume topped 6 billion shares on the Nasdaq, the most trading since Aug. 5. NYSE volume was slightly lower.  
纳斯达克的成交量超过 60 亿股，这是自 8 月 5 日以来的最高交易量。纽约证券交易所的成交量略有下降。


Market Exposure Raised 市场敞口增加
-----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP091124-240x300.jpg)The sum total of Wednesday's action was sufficient to lift IBD's [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) from 20%-40% to 40%-60%. This means investors can look for buys on breakouts, or perhaps add to existing holdings if they find support at important levels such as the 50-day moving average.  
周三的行动总和足以将 IBD [建议的市场风险敞口水平](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/)从 20%-40% 提高到 40%-60%。这意味着投资者可以在突破时寻找买入机会，或者如果他们在 50 天移动平均线等重要水平找到支撑，则可能会增加现有持仓。


Look for other opportunities, such as stocks breaking above trendlines. IBD 50 stock **Oscar Health** ([OSCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSCR)), for example, jumped above a trendline touching its highs from the May 21 high. **Doximity** ([DOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS)), today's [IBD 50 Stocks to Watch selection](https://www.investors.com/research/doximity-stock-docs-ibd-50/), formed a three-weeks-tight pattern.  
寻找其他机会，例如股票突破趋势线。例如，IBD 50 股票 **Oscar Health** （[OSCR）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSCR) 跃升至从 5 月 21 日高点触及高点的趋势线上方。**Doximity** （[DOCS）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS) 是今天的 [IBD 50 只值得关注的股票，](https://www.investors.com/research/doximity-stock-docs-ibd-50/)形成了为期三周的紧缺模式。


Of course, the stock market still has some obstacles in its way.  
当然，股市的道路上仍然存在一些障碍。


The Nasdaq remains below its 50-day moving average, which has flattened out. The stock market remains sensitive to economic news and election uncertainty.  
纳斯达克指数仍低于其 50 天移动平均线，该移动平均线已趋于平缓。股市对经济新闻和选举不确定性仍然敏感。


Breadth was positive but not as much as the indexes would suggest. Advancers topped decliners by 5-4 on the Nasdaq and by 9-7 on the NYSE.  
广度是正的，但并不像指数所暗示的那么多。纳斯达克指数上涨的股票以 5-4 的比分领先下跌的股票，在纽约证券交易所以 9-7 的比分领先下跌的股票。


This week's action is going perhaps better than expected.  
本周的行动可能比预期的要好。


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 has climbed each day this week, holding above Friday's low. Both made their highest closes so far in September.  
纳斯达克和标准普尔 500 指数本周每天都在攀升，保持在周五的低点上方。这两家公司都在 9 月份创下了迄今为止的最高收盘价。


The Nasdaq 100 is also showing a credible bounce, after rising 2.2% Wednesday.  
纳斯达克 100 指数在周三上涨 2.2% 后也显示出可信的反弹。


The technology sector, which bore the brunt of selling earlier this month, led the stock market rebound Wednesday. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) soared 3.4%.  
本月早些时候首当其冲遭到抛售的科技板块周三引领股市反弹。科技精选板块 SPDR （[XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)） 飙升 3.4%。


But while tech leadership reappeared, other sectors that had been displaying relative strength lagged Wednesday. Consumer Staples SPDRXLP fell 0.9%. Health care and real estate sectors each lost 0.3%.  
但是，尽管科技领先地位再次出现，但其他一直表现出相对强劲的板块周三却落后了。消费必需品 SPDRXLP 下跌 0.9%。医疗保健和房地产板块各下跌 0.3%。


Insurance stocks, which had been in a solid advance since early August, came under selling. **Hamilton Insurance** ([HG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HG)), **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **Erie Indemnity** ([ERIE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERIE)) were among the stocks down in high volume.  
自 8 月初以来一直稳步上涨的保险股开始抛售。**汉密尔顿保险公司** （[HG）、](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HG)**旅行者** （[TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)） 和**伊利赔偿** （[ERIE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERIE)） 等股票成交量较大。


Inflation Report Rattled Investors通胀报告让投资者感到不安
----------------------------------------------


The stock market opened weaker after inflation data showed a slight uptick.  
在通胀数据显示小幅上升后，股市开盘走弱。


The August consumer price index showed that inflation continued to moderate, although core prices (excluding food and energy prices) were [slightly higher than expected](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-august-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-sp-500/). Core CPI rose 0.3% from July levels, above the 0.2% consensus forecast. Still, 12-month core CPI held at 3.2%, as economists expected.  
8 月消费者价格指数显示，尽管核心价格（不包括食品和能源价格）[略高于预期](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-august-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-sp-500/)，但通胀继续放缓。核心 CPI 较 7 月份的水平上涨 0.3%，高于 0.2% 的普遍预测。尽管如此，12 个月核心 CPI 仍保持在 3.2%，符合经济学家的预期。


Traders immediately interpreted the data — one of the last major pieces of economic data before the Fed meeting next week — to mean a half-point rate cut was off the table. Odds for a quarter-point cut to a 5%-5.25% range [stood at 87% late Wednesday](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html).  
交易员立即将这些数据解读为美联储下周会议前的最后一项主要经济数据，意味着降息半个基点是不可能的。周三晚些时候，将 25 个百分点下调至 5%-5.25% 区间的几率[为 87%。](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html)


"The Fed has the green light to cut 25 bps (basis points) next week, given that the inflation report was in line with expectations," Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said in emailed comments. "It's possible that some will be disappointed that there wasn't a lower-than-expected inflation reading, which might have given the Fed more room to cut 50 bps, but most of the Fed speakers have already telegraphed their desire to start slowly and not begin with a jumbo cut."  
“鉴于通胀报告符合预期，美联储已批准下周降息 25 个基点（基点），”独立顾问联盟首席投资官 Chris Zaccarelli 在电子邮件评论中表示。“有些人可能会对通胀数据没有低于预期感到失望，这可能给了美联储更多降息 50 个基点的空间，但大多数美联储发言人已经表示，他们希望慢慢开始，而不是从大幅降息开始。”

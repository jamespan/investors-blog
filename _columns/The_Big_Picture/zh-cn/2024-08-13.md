The stock market surged Tuesday following benevolent inflation data and encouraging comments from a top Fed official. This triggered a bullish market shift ahead of Wednesday's consumer price index reading.  
在温和的通胀数据和一位美联储高级官员的鼓舞人心的评论之后，股市周二飙升。这在周三消费者价格指数读数之前引发了看涨市场转变。




Stocks are really gaining traction after last week's wild action. The Nasdaq rose 2.4% Tuesday and is now up 2.6% for the week so far. It has been rallying well since getting support at the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). The tech-heavy composite is now back above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) after making the best four-day run since November 2022.  
在上周的疯狂行动之后，股市确实获得了牵引力。纳斯达克指数周二上涨 2.4%，本周迄今上涨 2.6%。自从 [200 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/)获得支撑以来，它一直反弹良好。以科技股为主的综合指数在创下 2022 年 11 月以来最好的四天表现后，现在回到了 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)上方。


The Nasdaq's next task will to be to reclaim the 50-day moving  average, which is 367 points ahead.  
纳斯达克的下一个任务将是收复领先 367 点的 50 天移动平均线。


The S&P 500, meanwhile, turned in a significant gain of 1.7%, which it also holds for the week. The index is now within comfortable striking distance of the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and has pared its loss for the month to just 1.6%.  
与此同时，标准普尔 500 指数大幅上涨 1.7%，本周也保持了这一水平。该指数现在距离 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)很近，并已将本月的跌幅缩减至仅 1.6%。


Advancers were on top of decliners by more than a 4-1 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 13-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet. Volume was higher, adding conviction to the day's moves.  
根据 FactSet 的数据，纽约证券交易所的上涨股超过下跌的股票，比例超过 4：1，纳斯达克的上涨比例超过 13：5。成交量更高，为当天的走势增添了信心。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes on the stock market today, but it still rallied 408 points, or 1%. This was enough to propel it back above its 50-day line. Beaten-down chip giant **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and sportswear stock **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) were the top performers here. But the largest contributor to the Dow was **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), which added nearly 59 of the Dow's points.  
道琼斯工业平均指数今天落后于股市上的其他主要指数，但仍上涨了 408 点，或 1%。这足以推动其回到 50 日线上方。被击败的芯片巨头**英特尔** （[INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)） 和运动服装股**耐克** （[NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)） 是其中表现最好的股票。但道琼斯指数的最大贡献者是**联合健康** （[UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)），它增加了道琼斯指数的近 59 点。


Small caps also popped, with the Russell 2000 jumping 1.6%. It will now look to move convincingly clear of its 50-day line. Growth stocks were not quite so impressive, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rising 0.4%. The midcap S&P 400 rose 1.3%.  
小盘股也大涨，罗素 2000 指数上涨 1.6%。它现在将寻求令人信服地摆脱其 50 天线。成长型股票的表现并不那么令人印象深刻，Innovator IBD 50 （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 交易所交易基金上涨 0.4%。中型股标准普尔 400 指数上涨 1.3%。


Stock Market Outlook Improves股市前景改善
-----------------------------------


Tuesday's action qualified as a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Since the latter index corrected as much as 13% from its peak, it seems a more significant event.  
周二的行动符合标准普尔 500 指数和纳斯达克指数的[后续交易日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/)的条件。由于后一个指数从峰值回调了 13%，因此这似乎是一个更重要的事件。


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP081324-229x300.jpg)Because of the bullish market action, IBD is lifting the recommended market exposure to the 20%-40% range. We will now look for continued bullish behavior, such as gains in strong volume and breakouts among top stocks, before considering a larger exposure level.  
由于看涨的市场行为，IBD 将建议的市场敞口提高到 20%-40% 的范围内。在考虑更大的敞口水平之前，我们现在将寻找持续的看涨行为，例如强劲成交量的增加和顶级股票的突破。


The S&P 500 faces a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average, and clearing that level would be another factor in deciding on a proper exposure level.  
标准普尔 500 指数在其 50 天移动平均线面临阻力测试，清除该水平将是决定适当敞口水平的另一个因素。


Remember, many follow-through days fail, so raise exposure in a measured fashion. Look for top-performing stocks clearing proper buy points in high volume. Oddly, there were few breakouts Tuesday.  
请记住，许多后续日子都失败了，因此请以有节制的方式提高曝光率。寻找表现最好的股票，大量清算适当的买入点。奇怪的是，周二几乎没有突破。


Inflation Data, Fed's Bostic Boost Stocks; CPI Next通胀数据，美联储的博斯蒂克提振股票;CPI Next
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Stocks were given an early boost due to a lighter-than-expected producer price index. The headline PPI rose 2.2% year over year in July, below economist expectations for 2.6%. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% on the year-ago period, also below views.  
由于生产者价格指数低于预期，股市早盘受到提振。7 月份整体 PPI 同比上涨 2.2%，低于经济学家预期的 2.6%。不包括食品和能源的核心 PPI 同比上涨 2.4%，也低于预期。


Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic also stepped up to the plate to cheer investors with sunny comments at today's Conference of African American Financial Professionals.  
与此同时，亚特兰大联邦储备银行行长拉斐尔·博斯蒂克 （Raphael Bostic） 也在今天的非裔美国金融专业人士会议上站出来，以阳光明媚的评论为投资者加油。


He said he was encouraged by recent inflation figures and reiterated his stance that it's likely he'll be ready to cut rates by the end of the year.  
他说，他对最近的通胀数据感到鼓舞，并重申了他的立场，即他很可能会准备在今年年底前降息。


"I'm hopeful that in the next several months, we'll be at a place where we have an economy that's pretty much fully normalized," Bostic added.  
“我希望在接下来的几个月里，我们的经济将几乎完全正常化，”博斯蒂克补充道。


The stage has been set for further gains if tomorrow's consumer price index also comes in tame. Headline CPI is expected to rise 3% year over year while core CPI is seen popping 3.2%.  
如果明天的消费者价格指数也表现平和，那么进一步上涨的舞台已经准备好了。预计整体 CPI 将同比增长 3%，而核心 CPI 预计将上涨 3.2%。

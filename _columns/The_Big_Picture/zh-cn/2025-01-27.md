You've heard the now-common refrain — from crisis breeds opportunity. Can stock market investors glean opportunity from Monday's big sell-off among companies closely tied to the artificial intelligence industry?


Judging by what happened beneath the surface, one could conclude that Monday's action showed deep selling in some industries while other industries stepped up as potential leaders in the stock market in 2025.




Many semiconductor, electronics and power generation stocks suffered a bloodbath of selling. It came on the surprise news that [Chinese tech lab DeepSeek](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-ai-chipmakers-tumble-on-deepseek-news/) has created a large-language-model-based search app in just two months at relatively low cost.


The news threw a heavy wrench into the gears of thought among stock market investors that companies across the U.S. and the globe would need to deploy gobs of dollars in order to move into the golden age of AI.


Stock Market: Nasdaq Starts Low, Stays Down
-------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite opened Monday with a sharp gap-down and stayed in deep negative territory the entire session. The index finished down 3.1% at 19,341, marking its biggest drop in a single session since the 3.6% plunge suffered on Dec. 18. That's when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the rest of the U.S. central bank warned that it may not cut short-term interest rates as sharply in 2025 as initially thought.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq also finished below its 50-day line for the first time in just over a week. In general, investors want to see both stock market indexes and top growth stocks trade above their 50-day moving averages, not below them. Through Monday's close, the Nasdaq now shows a tiny gain for the year, up less than 0.2%.


Semiconductor shares dropped even harder. The popular VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) exchange traded fund gapped lower and sank 9.8% to 235.81. Volume was nearly quadruple normal levels as the ETF triggered at least two sell rules: one, [cutting losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), ideally at 7% or less; and two, nose-diving below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).



Individual leaders in the stock market also triggered important [profit-taking sell rules](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/).


Sell Rule Triggered With These Stocks
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP012725-.jpg)Consider **Celestica** ([CLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLS)), which for weeks has locked in the No. 1 spot within the IBD 50. The giant in contract electronics manufacturing imploded on Monday. Shares plummeted 28% to 87.36 and sharply undercut the stock's fast-rising 50-day moving average. Volume ballooned to 16.8 million shares, 661% above the stock's average trading over the past 50 sessions.


Such price-and-volume action marked a key and bearish change in character and hence reason to take profits. Monday's action was Celestica's worst day since it cleared a trendline entry near 53 in early October and staged a second breakout attempt out of a three-month base at 63.49 on Oct. 24.


The accompanying Market Pulse also highlights numerous other stock market leaders that got rammed by sellers amid the news from DeepSeek. For instance, power generation firm **Vistra** ([VST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VST)) tumbled more than 28% to 137.08 in heavy volume. It closed deeply beneath the 50-day moving average, also triggering a profit-taking sell rule. Gains from a Sept. 20 breakout from a base at 107.24 were slashed from 86% to less than 28%.


Yet Monday's stock market action also showed fund managers moving cash into other industries and sectors.


Based on preliminary data, 21 of Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups rallied 2% or more.


These Industries Managed To Climb
---------------------------------


They included water supply utility companies, which jumped 4.4% on a price-weighted basis. Tobacco, hospital, insurance broker, confectionery,  restaurant and homebuilding stocks also advanced with gains well exceeding 2%. Soap, rail transport, packaged-food and long-term-care companies also rose nicely.


"The latest pullback will likely be insufficient to draw investors back into big tech until there is greater clarity around the costs and longevity of DeepSeek," Seema Shaw, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote in an email sent to IBD. "Meanwhile, sectors like healthcare and agriculture stand to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains."


As a result, the gains in these areas helped buffer the S&P 500's slide as the large-cap index fell 1.5%. The Russell 2000 lost 1%, or only a third of the Nasdaq's decline. And the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied nearly 0.7%.


For sure, the industries that rallied reflected a decision among institutions to lean into more defensive sectors and consumer-staples companies. Meanwhile, on Monday IBD's fiber-optic industry group collapsed 18.7%, marking the day's worst decline. Alternative energy sank 16.8%, heavy construction firms slid 13.2%, and fabless semiconductor stocks retreated 12.3%.

New Distribution Day For Both Stock Market Exchanges
----------------------------------------------------


In the meantime, volume jumped on both major stock market exchanges. So overall, investors were keen to sell shares and lock in profits. That's understandable, given how the indexes have scored solid double-digit gains for two straight years.


On Monday, the Dec. 17 distribution days on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange fell due to time. However, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 added a new distribution day on Monday. Therefore, the overall count seen in the Market Pulse stays the same, and it remains elevated.


Due to the walloping of AI-related companies, IBD readers who have invested heavily in tech stocks should consider reducing their overall market stock exposure. IBD's current outlook on Monday reduced the recommended investment level to 60%-80% exposure from 80%-100%.


Yet, if nontech areas of the stock market hold up well, that would justify maintaining positions in growth stocks that continue to excel amid the high volatility already seen in January.


Volatility Index Ends Up Lower
------------------------------


The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) reversed from its intraday high of 22.51 on Monday to end 14% lower at 17.90.


Meanwhile, Boston Consulting Group reported in its latest investment survey that more than half of investors consider the stock market to be overvalued. This is consistent with the survey respondents' more subdued 3-year market return expectations of 6.7% on an average annual basis in the S&P 500. At the same time, 51% hold a bullish view on U.S. stocks over the next 12 months. BCG surveyed 540 investors across 16 countries.


The survey also noted that "geopolitical risk" was cited by 51% of all investors among their top three risks, jumping 15 percentage points from the prior survey conducted in February 2023.


"Interest rates fell to second place among North American investors (cited by 46%) and globally (46%). Inflation ranked third (29% of North American investors and 31% globally), the survey authors told IBD.


Such worries, in fact, build a wall of worry for the stock market to potentially climb. As an individual investor, you'd actually prefer to have more participants sit on the bearish end of the boat. This typically means such investors have raised a lot of cash, expecting a correction. But if the stock market does not fall as expected, these players may eventually decide to move over to the bullish side, deploying more cash into equities.


On Monday, following the selling rampage in AI companies, the CNN Fear & Greed Index held within the "Fear" zone at 39 on a scale of zero to 100. One year ago, it was at 73, squarely in the "Greed" territory of the sentiment and price momentum indicator.


Later in the week, expect the stock market to move on a [very busy earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) as well as the decision by the Fed during its first meeting of the year on interest rates on Wednesday.


On Monday, as investors moved back into long-dated U.S. government bonds, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond yield fell nearly 10 basis points to 4.52%. That was the lowest close since 4.49% on Dec. 18, according to Cboe data.


Crude oil futures dropped more than 2% to $73.10 a barrel. Gold futures slipped 1.3% to $2,743 an ounce.

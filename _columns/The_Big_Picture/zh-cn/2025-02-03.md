Another Monday, another sell-off on Wall Street.


Just a week after the stock market tumbled on [worries about the artificial intelligence economy](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/ai-companies-trampled-china-app-stock-market-investors-vistra-vaneck-semiconductor/), the first broadside in a new trade war sent U.S. stocks skidding Monday. Indexes opened sharply lower after 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports plus 10% levies on Chinese imports were confirmed over the weekend.




But indexes started paring losses one hour into the session. That's when President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum reached an agreement that [forestalls Mexico tariffs for one month](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tariffs-mexico-reprieve-canada-china-sp-500/). And late Monday, Canada's government said it also struck a 30-day deal.


Still, the dawn of a trade war and a [cloudy outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/trump-tariffs-hammer-tech-hardware-stocks/) for manufacturing, autos, technology and other sectors weighed on investors around the globe.


Tokyo's Nikkei 225 Index sold off 2.7% overnight while South Korea's Kospi Composite slid 2.5%, and the Sensex in India fell 0.4%. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index was nearly flat. Shanghai trading was closed for a holiday.


In Europe, the London FTSE 100 Index lost 1%, the German DAX dropped 1.4% and the Paris CAC 40 sank 1.2%.


Gold for February delivery gained $21.40 per troy ounce, or 0.8%, to $2,833.90. That's a record high for gold, which is up nearly 8% so far this year. Gold stocks and exchange traded funds were [among the assets that outperformed the stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/gld-stock-a-buy-right-now-heres-what-charts-show-2/) Monday. Energy, utilities and defensive medical industry groups also rose.


Nymex crude oil for March delivery gained 0.9% to $73.16 per barrel as traders expect tariffs to crimp supplies.


Stock Market Trims Losses
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP020325_2.jpg)In the U.S. stock market, the Nasdaq composite fell as much as 2.5% but ended the day just 1.2% lower. Although the reversal was encouraging, the Nasdaq still closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


The S&P 500's reversal was better. The index narrowed its loss to 0.8% and finished the day just above its 50-day line.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% after wiping away most of its 1.5% early setback. The index found support at the 44,000 level.


Small caps continued to face a struggle. Even after the Russell 2000 trimmed a 2.5% tumble to 1.3%, the index is even deeper below resistance around its 50-day moving average.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) to the index.


Declining stocks topped advancers by more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by about 12-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.


Of course, the daily action of the major indexes will determine how Wall Street handles the tariff trouble. On Tuesday, it will be a good sign if the stock market can follow up Monday's positive reversal with at least modest gains.


Also important is the behavior of leading stocks. In a hopeful indication, the IBD 50 Index fell a modest 0.3% Monday. The IBD 50 got good contributions from **Root** ([ROOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROOT)), **Hims & Hers Health** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)), **Interactive Broker**s ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) and **Stride** ([LRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRN)). After the close Monday, **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) shot up more than 17% following the [company's earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-pltr-stock-palantir-earnings-q42024/).


Tariff Risk For Markets
-----------------------


But just like Monday morning's headlines about the Mexico-U.S. agreement sent stocks higher, the trade war means investors must be ready for any headline that could move stocks sharply.


Even the best chart setup can unravel in such unpredictable conditions, and it's a risk that must be taken into account with every trade. An investor's best protection is to have an exit strategy ready, knowing when it's time to sell. Remember to cut losses at no more than 7% and take profits in most cases at about 20%-25%.


Also have a plan on when to increase exposure. Tariff-sensitive stocks and indexes could rally with favorable news. Have a watchlist of stocks nearing buy points, preferably with the characteristics in the IBD Stock Checkup. Identify buy points ahead of time, and set up alerts when stocks reach those price levels.


Exposure Level Stays The Same
-----------------------------


Despite new distribution days and more uncertainty, IBD is holding its recommended stock market exposure at a 60%-80% level. Given the new risks, investors should be closer to 60% on that scale.


Even if tariff worries dissipate, the stock market starts a week that includes the January employment report and about 20% of the S&P 500 companies reporting earnings, says UBS' Chief Investment Office.


"We continue to believe that S&P 500 earnings are set to grow by 9% in 2024 and 2025," David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients. "We think there is further upside toward our year-end S&P 500 price target of 6,600."


Lefkowitz added that rise should be driven by earnings growth, durable economic growth, rate cuts and AI investment. Of course, tariff announcements could generate volatility.

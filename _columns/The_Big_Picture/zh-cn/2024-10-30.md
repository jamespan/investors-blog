The stock market closed lower after a flurry of earnings reports, although Wednesday's losses pretty much kept a mild-mannered market uptrend intact.  
在一系列财报发布后，股市收盘走低，尽管周三的下跌几乎保持了温和的市场上涨趋势。


The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 0.6% in a day in which techs were the weakest sector. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) slid 3.7%, more than wiping out Tuesday's 1.4% gain. Much of the sector's weakness was in semiconductors, after **Advanced Micro Devices**' ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) [weak outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-advanced-micro-devices-q3-2024-earnings/) shook the chip sector.  
纳斯达克综合指数下跌近 0.6%，其中科技股是最弱的板块。科技精选板块 SPDR （[XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)） 下跌 3.7%，超过抹去周二 1.4% 的涨幅。该行业的大部分疲软来自半导体，此前 **Advanced Micro Devices** （[AMD）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD) [的疲软前景](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-advanced-micro-devices-q3-2024-earnings/)震动了芯片板块。




Software and internet stocks helped offset some tech losses. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) pared its gain to 2.8% following a splendid third-quarter earnings report.  
软件和互联网股票帮助抵消了一些科技股的损失。**Alphabet** （[GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)） 在公布出色的第三季度收益报告后，将其涨幅缩减至 2.8%。


The S&P 500 reversed lower 0.3% and is practically back at the same spot it was a week ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% and closed near session lows for the third time in the past four sessions.  
标准普尔 500 指数反转下跌 0.3%，几乎回到一周前的同一位置。道琼斯工业平均指数下跌 0.2%，在过去四个交易日中第三次收于盘中低点附近。


Most of the selling occurred in afternoon trading. Declining stocks topped advancers by about a 3-2 ratio on the Nasdaq, but winners slightly beat losers on the NYSE.  
大部分抛售发生在下午交易中。纳斯达克下跌的股票以约 3-2 的比率领先于上涨的股票，但纽约证券交易所的赢家略高于输家。


The IBD 50 index underperformed the stock market with a 0.8% drop. **Hims & Hers** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)) plunged more than 14%. The online provider of wellness products may have fallen in sympathy with **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), whose [sales of weight-loss drugs missed expectations.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-stock-eli-lilly-earnings-diabetes-weight-loss-drugs/)  


After Wednesday's close, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) were the latest Magnificent Seven companies to announce earnings. Microsoft beat profit expectations and shares rose about 1% in extended trading. But Meta fell more than 2%.  


Stock Market Indexes Vary
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP103024-179x300.jpg)While the stock market has softened a bit, IBD continues to recommend 80%-100% exposure. The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) is manageable. The S&P 500, though, narrowly avoided a distribution day Wednesday as volume edged lower on the NYSE. Nasdaq volume fell more than 5%.  


Each in its own way, the main indexes are crafting their own versions of the stock market uptrend.  


The Nasdaq is the current leader, having notched a record high this week. Up 2.3% in October, the composite made a record high Wednesday but came short of a new closing high.  


The communications services and technology sectors take much of the credit, up 2.7% and 1.7% this month. That's a welcome trend for the Nasdaq, which is [weighted about 56% in techs](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nasdaq-composite-benchmark-for-the-21st-century). More importantly, they are two of just four S&P sectors up in October, and Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) is barely 0.3% higher.  


The S&P 500 has been going sideways for two weeks. Yet, it is less than 1% from new highs and still holding above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).  


The Dow is the only major index down for the month, about 2.6% off its prior high and testing the 42,000 level. It's been hit with weakness from some consumer components such as **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)).  


On Wednesday, **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) cost the Dow 54 of its 91-point drop. **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) is another industrial stock hurting the Dow.  


In small caps, the Russell 2000 continues to be the most volatile. It is rebounding from a pullback to the 50-day moving average and nearing another test of resistance around 2,300.  


Stock Market Digests GDP And Jobs Data
--------------------------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield was nearly flat at 4.26% vs. Tuesday afternoon quotes. The yield erased a morning drop that greeted economic data.  


In the first measurement of third-quarter gross domestic product, the U.S. economy rose 2.8%. That's slightly slower than the 3% increase in Q2 and below economists' consensus forecast.  


The ADP National Employment Report showed a better-than-expected increase of 233,000 jobs in October, up from 143,000 in September.  


"This makes two consecutive quarters now of well-above potential GDP growth for the U.S. economy, built on a solid foundation of accelerating real consumer spending and government spending growth, and steady nonresidential fixed investment," Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a report. "Volatile quarterly trade flows and inventory changes will largely be ignored by the Federal Reserve."  
BMO Capital Markets 首席美国经济学家斯科特·安德森 （Scott Anderson） 在一份报告中表示：“这使得美国经济连续两个季度的 GDP 增长远高于潜在 GDP 增长，这是建立在加速实际消费支出和政府支出增长以及稳定的非住宅固定投资的坚实基础之上的。”美联储将在很大程度上忽视波动的季度贸易流量和库存变化。”


Anderson also noted a positive trend in inflation, with the GDP price index slowing to a 1.8% annualized rate in Q3 from 2.5% in the second quarter. Other inflation gauges also eased.  
Anderson 还指出，通胀呈积极趋势，GDP 价格指数年化率从第二季度的 2.5% 放缓至第三季度的 1.8%。其他通胀指标也有所缓解。

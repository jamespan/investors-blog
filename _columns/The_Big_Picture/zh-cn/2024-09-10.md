  Stock Market Ends Mixed Despite Financial Scare; Goldman, JPMorgan Fall Hard, But Oracle Jumps

The stock market ended mixed Tuesday as a strong earnings report from **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) boosted sentiment in the technology sector. But a sell-off in financial stocks weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 small-cap index, even though both indexes closed well off lows.




Auto financing specialist **Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)) plunged nearly 18% after Chief Financial Officer Russell Hutchinson [warned of increasing credit challenges](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-rise-jpmorgan-in-buy-zone-with-feds-barr-to-speak/) at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference. "Our borrower is struggling with high inflation and cost of living, and now more recently, a weakening employment picture," he said.


In related news, **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) slumped 5% after Chief Operating Officer Daniel Pinto said net interest income in 2025 will be [lower than expected](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-rise-jpmorgan-in-buy-zone-with-feds-barr-to-speak/). **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) on Monday warned that a downturn in the firm's trading business would weigh on Q3 results. Both Dow Jones stocks plunged through their 50-day moving averages. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) fell 2% but held support at its 50-day line.


Banks did get some good news after a [Federal Reserve official](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-rise-jpmorgan-in-buy-zone-with-feds-barr-to-speak/) said big banks would be required to increase reserves for loan losses by 9%, much lower than an earlier proposal of nearly 20%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Weakness in JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and American Express weighed on the Dow Jones, which fell as much as 1% but closed with a loss of just 0.2%.

There were several bright spots in the blue-chip index, including **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which rallied 2.4%. After a 25% July-early August decline, Amazon is trying to break out of a downtrend, but the stock's 50-day line is still a potential resistance level. **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) cleared a long flat base, rallying 2% in strong volume, while **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) added 1.5% as the home improvement chain eyes a 378.58 entry.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended near session highs, up 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively. Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq and rose slightly on the NYSE.


Oil and gas stocks lagged. West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $65.75 a barrel, down 4.3%. According to Dow Jones Market Data, that's the lowest close since December 2021. Inside the S&P 500, **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), **Apa** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) closed with losses ranging from 3.6% to 4.3%.


Winners beat losers on the Nasdaq and NYSE by a small margin.


Large-cap technology stocks generally performed well, helped by a strong [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oracle-stock-orcl-q1-report-cloudworld-ai-cloud/) from Oracle. Late Monday, the software giant said total revenue increased 7% to $13.3 billion. But investors focused on revenue at Oracle's cloud infrastructure unit, which rose 45% to $2.2 billion.


**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) was the top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up more than 5%. But the chip giant is still on a downtrend even after another bounce off its 200-day moving average.


The Russell 2000 pared a 1.2% intraday loss to close nearly flat. It was a resilient performance, but the index is still down 5.4% over the past six sessions.


What To Do Now
--------------


The sudden sell-off in financial stocks cast an early pall on the stock market, which had already been dealing with increasing signs of distribution. The Nasdaq composite shows five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) since Aug. 22. Four of those higher-volume declines showed losses of at least 1.1%. Selling has been less pronounced in the S&P 500. Headed into Tuesday, the benchmark index showed three distribution days.


Tuesday's recovery off lows for the major stock indexes was a welcome development for the bulls. But the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are still on downtrends and below their 50-day lines.


With the market tide still flowing negative, it's a good idea to raise some cash and wait for more signs of strength in the broad market. That would come in the form of higher-volume gains for the indexes followed up by lower-volume declines.


For now, stock-buy prospects remain scarce. But there are some exceptions. Inside the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), **Rollins** ([ROL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROL)), a provider of pest and wildlife control services, jumped 3% in lower volume and closed just below a 51.28 alternative entry. **Tyler Technologies** ([TYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TYL)) rose 1%, also in light turnover, and closed just above a 593.50 buy point.


Meanwhile, a key piece of economic data looms large Wednesday with the release of the consumer price index at 8:30 a.m. ET. On a year-over-year basis, core prices are expected to be up 3.2% in August, unchanged from July.


Inflation data isn't as big a deal as it once was as the Federal Reserve gets set to start cutting rates at next week's meeting. Federal funds futures traders at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) are still expecting 100 basis points in rate cuts by the end of the year.

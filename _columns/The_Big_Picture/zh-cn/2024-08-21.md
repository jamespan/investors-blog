The stock market wavered for much of Wednesday's session but closed higher as the S&P 500 came even closer to record highs.




The S&P 500 rose 0.4% for its ninth gain in the past 10 sessions. The index is less than 1% from a record high, after sprinting nearly 10% from its Aug. 5 low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, about 1% away from its own record high, edged upward by 0.1%.


Like other indexes, the Nasdaq composite closed near session highs, up 0.6% and near the 18,000 level. Small caps led the market, with the Russell 2000 up 1.3%.


Volume rose on the New York Stock Exchange but fell on the Nasdaq exchange. Advancing stocks topped decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.


A Bump From The Fed
-------------------


Stock market indexes saw a temporary bump up after minutes of the most recent Federal Reserve meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET.


Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said a September rate cut was "on the table," and the minutes provided some clarity on that. The documents said that a "vast majority" of policymakers believed that if economic data doesn't surprise, "it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting."


Some officials believed jobs gains were overstated, and Wednesday's [massive revision of employment data](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-jackson-hole-bls-job-revisions-sp-500/) seemed to confirm their suspicions.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP082124.jpg)Bond traders also grew more comfortable with the chances of lower interest rates: The 10-year Treasury yield fell four basis points to 3.778% â€“ a 13-month low.


Meanwhile, the IBD 50 index rose nearly 0.8% Wednesday.


Stock Market Ready For Pause?
-----------------------------


A month that started out with panic selling has come back with a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on Aug. 13 and continued gains. Since that rally confirmation signal, the stock market indexes have yet to record a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/).


While the stock market uptrend continues to hum, indexes are reaching potential resistance levels, including the S&P's prior high at 5,669. A pullback would not necessarily hurt the market uptrend. In fact, it could help the market settle down and avoid getting too far ahead of itself.


[MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s NYSE Short Term Overbought-Oversold Oscillator has climbed to overbought levels near the market peaks of May and July.


Second, this month's market volume shows buying hasn't been as robust as the market rebound would suggest. The [Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the major indexes](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DailyGMI_082024.pdf) are at or near lowest-possible readings. That's exactly where those ratings were when the market bottomed Aug. 5.


Still, with stock market signals mostly positive, Investor's Business Daily continues to recommend an exposure level of 60% to 80%.


Retail Stocks Offer A Boost
---------------------------


SPDR Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) rose 1.3% to a three-week high. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) led S&P sector ETFs with a 1.3% increase.


Yet, it was discount retail that truly stood out Wednesday on the stock market, thanks in large part to a [bullish quarterly report](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-q-2-2024-target-stock-walmart-amazon/) from **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)). The stock soared more than 11% to close at the highest since mid-May.


**Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) rose nearly 1% to a record high. A six-day win streak has sent shares up about 10%. It is Walmart's best six-day stretch since a run ending Sept. 3, 2020, when it rose 10.6%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Reports said the retailer [sold its 9.4% stake](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-jd-macys-tjx-discount-retailers-dltr-dg/) in China-based **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) for $3.6 billion.


By comparison, department store chain **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) plunged nearly 13% after the company's [quarterly sales fell nearly 4%](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-jd-macys-tjx-discount-retailers-dltr-dg/) and missed estimates.


Some stock market strategists noted that the strength in retail rested primarily in discount chains, which may suggest consumers are reining in their spending.


The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) rose to an all-time high Wednesday, and this month's gain of nearly 5% leads all other S&P sectors. The utilities sector is up 3.4% in August. The sector also is associated with defensive trading, but could be benefiting from a decline in competing Treasury yields.

The stock market wavered for much of Wednesday's session but closed higher as the S&P 500 came even closer to record highs.  
股市在周三的大部分时间里都波动，但随着标准普尔 500 指数更接近历史高点，收盘走高。




The S&P 500 rose 0.4% for its ninth gain in the past 10 sessions. The index is less than 1% from a record high, after sprinting nearly 10% from its Aug. 5 low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, about 1% away from its own record high, edged upward by 0.1%.  
标准普尔 500 指数上涨 0.4%，这是过去 10 个交易日中的第 9 次上涨。该指数从 8 月 5 日的低点飙升近 10% 后，距离历史高点不到 1%。道琼斯工业平均指数（Dow Jones Industrial Average）距离自己的历史高点仅差约 1%，小幅上涨 0.1%。


Like other indexes, the Nasdaq composite closed near session highs, up 0.6% and near the 18,000 level. Small caps led the market, with the Russell 2000 up 1.3%.  
与其他指数一样，纳斯达克综合指数收于盘中高点附近，上涨 0.6% 并接近 18,000 点水平。小盘股领涨，罗素 2000 指数上涨 1.3%。


Volume rose on the New York Stock Exchange but fell on the Nasdaq exchange. Advancing stocks topped decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.  
纽约证券交易所的成交量上升，但纳斯达克交易所的成交量下降。根据 FactSet 的数据，纽约证券交易所上涨的股票比下跌的股票高出 3 比 1 以上，纳斯达克的涨幅接近 5 比 2。


A Bump From The Fed来自美联储的冲击
---------------------------


Stock market indexes saw a temporary bump up after minutes of the most recent Federal Reserve meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET.  
在美国东部时间下午 2 点发布最近的美联储会议纪要后，股市指数暂时上涨。


Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said a September rate cut was "on the table," and the minutes provided some clarity on that. The documents said that a "vast majority" of policymakers believed that if economic data doesn't surprise, "it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting."  
美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔曾表示，9 月降息“已提上日程”，会议纪要对此提供了一些明确性。文件称，“绝大多数”政策制定者认为，如果经济数据不令人意外，“在下次会议上放松政策可能是合适的”。


Some officials believed jobs gains were overstated, and Wednesday's [massive revision of employment data](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-jackson-hole-bls-job-revisions-sp-500/) seemed to confirm their suspicions.  
一些官员认为就业增长被夸大了，周三[对就业数据的大规模修正](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-jackson-hole-bls-job-revisions-sp-500/)似乎证实了他们的怀疑。


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP082124.jpg)Bond traders also grew more comfortable with the chances of lower interest rates: The 10-year Treasury yield fell four basis points to 3.778% – a 13-month low.  
债券交易员也对降息的可能性更加放心：10 年期美国国债收益率下跌 4 个基点至 3.778%，创下 13 个月低点。


Meanwhile, the IBD 50 index rose nearly 0.8% Wednesday.  
与此同时，IBD 50 指数周三上涨近 0.8%。


Stock Market Ready For Pause?股市准备好暂停了吗？
---------------------------------------


A month that started out with panic selling has come back with a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on Aug. 13 and continued gains. Since that rally confirmation signal, the stock market indexes have yet to record a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/).  
一个月以恐慌性抛售开始，然后在 8 月 13 [日卷](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/)土重来，并继续上涨。自该反弹确认信号以来，股市指数尚未记录[过分发日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/)。


While the stock market uptrend continues to hum, indexes are reaching potential resistance levels, including the S&P's prior high at 5,669. A pullback would not necessarily hurt the market uptrend. In fact, it could help the market settle down and avoid getting too far ahead of itself.  
虽然股市上涨趋势继续嗡嗡作响，但指数正在达到潜在的阻力位，包括标准普尔指数之前的高点 5,669 点。回调不一定会损害市场上升趋势。事实上，它可以帮助市场稳定下来，避免太超前。


[MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s NYSE Short Term Overbought-Oversold Oscillator has climbed to overbought levels near the market peaks of May and July.  
[MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) 的纽约证券交易所短期超买-超卖震荡指标已攀升至 5 月和 7 月市场峰值附近的超买水平。


Second, this month's market volume shows buying hasn't been as robust as the market rebound would suggest. The [Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the major indexes](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DailyGMI_082024.pdf) are at or near lowest-possible readings. That's exactly where those ratings were when the market bottomed Aug. 5.  
其次，本月的市场成交量显示，买盘并不像市场反弹所暗示的那样强劲。[主要指数的累积/派发评级](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DailyGMI_082024.pdf)处于或接近可能的最低读数。这正是 8 月 5 日市场触底时的收视率。


Still, with stock market signals mostly positive, Investor's Business Daily continues to recommend an exposure level of 60% to 80%.  
尽管如此，由于股市信号大多是积极的，《投资者商业日报》继续建议 60% 至 80% 的敞口水平。


Retail Stocks Offer A Boost零售股提振
--------------------------------


SPDR Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) rose 1.3% to a three-week high. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) led S&P sector ETFs with a 1.3% increase.  
SPDR Retail ETF （[XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)） 上涨 1.3% 至三周高点。非必需消费品精选行业 SPDR （[XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)） 以 1.3% 的涨幅领先标准普尔行业 ETF。


Yet, it was discount retail that truly stood out Wednesday on the stock market, thanks in large part to a [bullish quarterly report](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-q-2-2024-target-stock-walmart-amazon/) from **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)). The stock soared more than 11% to close at the highest since mid-May.  
然而，周三在股市上真正脱颖而出的是折扣零售，这在很大程度上要归功于 **Target** （[TGT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT) 的[看涨季度报告](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-q-2-2024-target-stock-walmart-amazon/)。该股飙升超过 11%，收于 5 月中旬以来的最高水平。


**Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) rose nearly 1% to a record high. A six-day win streak has sent shares up about 10%. It is Walmart's best six-day stretch since a run ending Sept. 3, 2020, when it rose 10.6%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Reports said the retailer [sold its 9.4% stake](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-jd-macys-tjx-discount-retailers-dltr-dg/) in China-based **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) for $3.6 billion.  
**沃尔玛** （[WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)） 上涨近 1% 至历史新高。连续六天的上涨使股价上涨了约 10%。根据道琼斯市场数据，这是沃尔玛自 2020 年 9 月 3 日结束的上涨以来最好的六天表现，当时上涨 10.6%。报道称，该零售商以 36 亿美元的价格出售了其在中国 **JD.com** （[JD）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD) [9.4% 的股份](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-jd-macys-tjx-discount-retailers-dltr-dg/)。


By comparison, department store chain **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) plunged nearly 13% after the company's [quarterly sales fell nearly 4%](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-jd-macys-tjx-discount-retailers-dltr-dg/) and missed estimates.  
相比之下，百货连锁店**梅西**百货 （[M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)） 暴跌近 13%，此前该公司[的季度销售额下降了近 4%](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-jd-macys-tjx-discount-retailers-dltr-dg/) 且低于预期。


Some stock market strategists noted that the strength in retail rested primarily in discount chains, which may suggest consumers are reining in their spending.  
一些股市策略师指出，零售业的实力主要在于折扣连锁店，这可能表明消费者正在控制他们的支出。


The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) rose to an all-time high Wednesday, and this month's gain of nearly 5% leads all other S&P sectors. The utilities sector is up 3.4% in August. The sector also is associated with defensive trading, but could be benefiting from a decline in competing Treasury yields.  
消费必需品精选板块 SPDR （[XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)） 周三升至历史新高，本月上涨近 5%，领先于所有其他标准普尔板块。公用事业板块 8 月份上涨 3.4%。该行业也与防御易有关，但可能会从竞争性美国国债收益率的下跌中受益。

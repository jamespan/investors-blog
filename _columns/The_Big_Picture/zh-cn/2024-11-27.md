The stock market cooled off Wednesday, as the Nasdaq composite ended a four-day win streak and the S&P 500 snapped a seven-day win streak. Yet, indexes remained in position for a push into December.  
周三股市降温，纳斯达克综合指数结束了连续四天的上涨，标准普尔 500 指数结束了连续七天的上涨。然而，指数仍处于推动至 12 月的位置。


Investors took some profits ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Nasdaq lost 0.6% while the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and continued to arm-wrestle the 6,000 level. The Oct. 23 distribution day for the S&P dropped off because 25 days have passed.  
投资者在感恩节假期前获利了结。纳斯达克指数下跌 0.6%，而标准普尔 500 指数下跌 0.4%，并继续在 6,000 点水平上搏斗。标准普尔指数的 10 月 23 日分发日因 25 天已过去而下降。




The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is leading this week with a 1% increase, fell 0.3%. It was its first drop in six sessions.  


Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.1%. The index is nearing its record close of 2,442.74 set on Nov. 8, 2021, and is up more than 10% for November.  


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. While that indicated institutions sold in moderation, the eve of Thanksgiving tends to be quiet on Wall Street anyway, with many operatives taking a four-day break. The stock market will be closed Thursday and will shutter three hours early on Friday.  


Advancing stocks topped decliners by a 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by about 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.  


Stock Market Hits Techs, Likes Financials
-----------------------------------------


While selling certainly wasn't isolated to the technology sector, it was the area of most concern Wednesday. Of the 15 worst-performing industry groups Wednesday, semiconductor, software and other tech groups accounted for 10 of them.  


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP112724-2.jpg)Tech bellwether **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) trimmed losses and closed at its 50-day moving average. A lukewarm outlook, tariff risks and other factors [weighed on Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-earnings-china-trade-war-worries/).  


**CrowdStrike**'s ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) [current-quarter outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crowdstrike-stock-crowdstrike-earnings-news-q32024/) and **Dell**'s ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) [soft sales outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dell-stock-slips-as-revenue-misses-forecasts-despite-earnings-beat/) also hurt the sector. **HP** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) plunged more than 11% after it [gave a cloudy outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hp-stock-earnings-q4-2024-hp-news/). **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) offered a [subscription revenue outlook that was below views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/workday-stock-workday-earnings-news-q32024/) and fell more than 6% in heavy volume. Dell and HP were the worst performers in the S&P 500.  


Real Estate Select Sector SPDR ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) led the S&P sectors, up 0.7%. Several breakouts were seen in real estate investment trusts, including **Essential Property Realty** ([EPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPRT)) and **AvalonBay Communities** ([AVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVB)).  
房地产精选板块 SPDR （[XLRE）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE) 领涨标准普尔板块，上涨 0.7%。房地产投资信托基金出现了几次突破，包括 **Essential Property Realty** （[EPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPRT)） 和 **AvalonBay Communities** （[AVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVB)）。


Financials also climbed. **The Hartford** ([HIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIG)) broke out of a flat base, although in light trading. **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) also broke out of a flat base but closed below the 585.82 buy point.  
金融股也攀升。**哈特福德** （[HIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIG)） 从平坦的基础中突破出来，尽管交易清淡。**伯克希尔哈撒韦**公司 （[BRKB）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB) 也突破了平坦的底部，但收于 585.82 买入点下方。


In general, growth stocks continue to perform well. The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) — which is designed to capture breakouts to new highs — is up 11.5% this month. That would make it the fund's best month in almost four years.  


But the IBD 50 index underperformed with a 1% drop Wednesday.  


If there's anything to complain about is that the November rally has left most quality stocks extended from buy areas. The more-recent breakouts in the [MarketSurge 250 index](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) have come from a mix of financial, energy, defense, tech and consumer companies.  


Stock Market Seasonal Trends Favorable
--------------------------------------


Investors can be thankful for the stock market's blessings this year. The Nasdaq is up 27% and the S&P 500 has risen close to 26% year to date.  


Friday's half session will cap a month in which the S&P and Nasdaq have moved up more than 5%. And next week, December brings a historically favorable trend for the stock market.  
周五的半个交易日将结束标准普尔和纳斯达克指数上涨超过 5% 的一个月。下周，12 月为股市带来了历史上的有利趋势。


Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist for LPL Financial, says that since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average gain of 1.8% from Thanksgiving through year-end. The index has finished higher about 70% of the time. By comparison, the broad market's average gain is 1% — and up 63% of the time — during all six-week periods.  
LPL Financial 首席技术策略师 Adam Turnquist 表示，自 1950 年以来，标准普尔 500 指数从感恩节到年底的平均涨幅为 1.8%。该指数在大约 70% 的时间里收盘走高。相比之下，在所有六周期间，大盘的平均涨幅为 1%，并且在 63% 的时间里上涨。


"When the index is higher on the year into Turkey Day, the average gain into year-end bumps up to 2.1%, with 75% of occurrences yielding positive results," he added.  
“当指数在火鸡节的一年中走高时，年终的平均涨幅会上升到 2.1%，其中 75% 的事件产生了积极的结果，”他补充道。


The Stock Trader's Almanac says December is one of the top three months of the year. The Dow and Nasdaq have climbed an average of 1.6% since 1950 and the S&P is up 1.5% on average.  
The Stock Trader's Almanac 表示，12 月是一年中排名前三个月的月份之一。自 1950 年以来，道琼斯指数和纳斯达克指数平均上涨了 1.6%，标准普尔指数平均上涨了 1.5%。


Market Gets Inflation, Economic Data市场获得通货膨胀、经济数据
-------------------------------------------------


Indexes opened lower Wednesday after a series of economic reports were released.  
在一系列经济报告发布后，股指周三开盘走低。


What is arguably the most important inflation gauge [offered no big surprises](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/pce-inflation-oct-federal-reserve-sp-500/). The personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index rose 0.2%, slightly under the 0.3% economists' forecasts. The 12-month headline inflation rate picked up to 2.3% from 2.1%, in line with forecasts.  
可以说是最重要的通胀指标并没有[带来太大的惊喜](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/pce-inflation-oct-federal-reserve-sp-500/)。个人消费支出 （PCE） 价格指数上涨 0.2%，略低于经济学家预测的 0.3%。12 个月总体通胀率从 2.1% 回升至 2.3%，与预期一致。


The Fed tends to put more weight on core PCE, which removes food and energy prices. That price index rose 0.3% in October, and 12-month core inflation rose to 2.8%. Both met economists' consensus estimates.  
美联储倾向于加重核心 PCE，从而消除食品和能源价格。该物价指数在 10 月份上涨了 0.3%，12 个月核心通胀率升至 2.8%。两者都符合经济学家的普遍估计。


Initial claims for unemployment benefits stayed at [213,000 the most recent week](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=591316&year=2024&lid=0#top), below the 217,000 estimate culled by Econoday. The revised [third-quarter GDP climbed 2.8%](https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2024-second-estimate-and-corporate-profits), same as in the initial estimate and equal with forecasts.  
最近一周初请失业金人数保持在 [213,000](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=591316&year=2024&lid=0#top) 人，低于 Econoday 估计的 217,000 人。修正后的[第三季度 GDP 增长 2.8%，](https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2024-second-estimate-and-corporate-profits)与初步估计相同，与预测持平。


Bond traders [raised the odds](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's December meeting to 70% vs. about 60% on Tuesday. Those odds crept higher the past week.  
债券交易员将美联储 12 月会议上降息 25 个基点的[几率提高](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html)到 70%，而周二的概率约为 60%。过去一周，这些赔率逐渐上升。

"Given the broad consensus-like reading across the slew of economic data releases today, we do not see any meaningful impact on the Fed's upcoming rate decision in December," Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. Fixed Income at Janus Henderson Investors, said in a report to clients.  
“鉴于今天发布的一系列经济数据的广泛共识，我们认为不会对美联储即将在12月做出的利率决定产生任何有意义的影响，”骏利亨德森投资美国固定收益主管Greg Wilensky在给客户的一份报告中表示。


"We still believe that a 25-basis point reduction to the policy rate is extremely likely. We feel the odds of a cut are still higher than the 70% currently implied in the futures market. In our view, it will take a combination of a very strong NFP (nonfarm payrolls) print and a higher than expected core CPI release to cause a pause at the December meeting."  
“我们仍然认为，将政策利率下调 25 个基点的可能性极大。我们认为降息的几率仍高于期货市场目前隐含的 70%。在我们看来，需要非常强劲的 NFP（非农就业数据）数据和高于预期的核心 CPI 发布相结合，才能在 12 月的会议上暂停。

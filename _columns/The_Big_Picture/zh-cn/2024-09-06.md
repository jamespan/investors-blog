The stock market took a pounding on Friday after a pivotal jobs report came in weaker than expected. Now, inflation data and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) earnings are among noteworthy events in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite had the toughest time among the major indexes Friday, plummeting 2.6%. Its weekly decline of 5.8% was its worst since January 2022. It ended the week below the low of the Aug. 13 follow-through day and sits just 2.5% above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/). While it is well off recent highs, the tech-heavy index remains up 11.2% for the year.


The S&P 500 tumbled 1.7% for the day, which slammed it below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It also turned in a painful weekly drop of 4.3%, its worst since last year, while its year-to-date gain has atrophied to 13.4%. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund fell 1% but held above the 50-day line.


Decliners led advancers by more than 3-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume came in higher for both, which added fresh distribution days to both major indexes.


Stock Market Dip Sparks This Change
-----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP090624-272x300.jpg)It wasn't just the S&P 500 and Nasdaq that got clobbered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded closer to its 50-day line as it fell 1% Friday, which accounted for a fair portion of its 2.9% weekly decline.


Insurance stock **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) outperformed while **Amazon.com** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) had the toughest sessions among the Dow components.


Small caps also took a hard blow, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.9%. Growth stocks did not escape the wrath of the bears either, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) plunging 1.7% Friday.


Sharp declines across the indexes have prompted a reduction in Investor's Business Daily's recommended exposure levels to the 20% to 40% range. Given the sharp stock market pullback, being at the lower end of this band makes sense.


Make sure to reduce in a measured fashion though. Start by selling your weakest performing stocks first and take action on holdings that are triggering sell signals, such as breaches of the 50-day moving average.


Jobs Report Weak, Inflation Data Next
-------------------------------------


Stocks got a spanking after the release of the pivotal jobs report for August. The U.S. economy added 142,000, well below economist views for 161,000, while the unemployment rate of 4.2% matched expectations. There were also big downward revisions to job growth in June and July.


An interest-rate cut looms at the Sept. 18 Fed meeting, with the stock market seeing a 69% chance of a 25-basis-point cut and a 31% chance for a 50-basis-point cut. The likelihood of the bigger trim actually declined, [according to the CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). But many expect more cuts heading into the end of 2024.


There are a few noteworthy events on the economic calendar in the coming week, with wholesale inventories and consumer credit data both scheduled for Monday. A smattering of inflation data is also due.


First, Consumer Price Index data for August comes Wednesday, with a year-over-year rise of 2.9% seen. Economists see core CPI turning in a 3.2% annualized lift. Producer Price Index data for the same month drops Thursday, where experts predict a 3.3% rise from the year-ago period.


And while earnings season has tailed off, there are a few [noteworthy reports in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/adobe-adbe-oracle-orcl-show-strength-earnings/). Big Tech names **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) are set to post earnings while meme stock **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) and supermarket giant **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) are also due.

Broadcom Results Hurt This Stock Market Group
---------------------------------------------


Each of the [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday lower](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Communications services, technology and consumer discretionary absorbed the hardest blows while real estate and consumer staples suffered the smallest declines.



Investors could get a deeper insight into the action on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by examining the relative performance of the 197 IBD industry groups.


Department stores, office supplies retailers, alcoholic beverage makers and confectionary firms were among the top performers.


On the flip side, many more groups closed in negative territory. The worst performers included automakers, computer hardware stocks and fiber-optics plays.


IBD's Fabless-Semiconductor group was also hit hard on the stock market after **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) fell sharply on a disappointing quarterly revenue outlook despite a top- and bottom-line beat.

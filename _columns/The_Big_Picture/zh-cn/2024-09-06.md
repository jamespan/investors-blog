The stock market took a pounding on Friday after a pivotal jobs report came in weaker than expected. Now, inflation data and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) earnings are among noteworthy events in the coming week.  
周五，在关键就业报告弱于预期后，股市遭受重创。现在，通胀数据和**甲骨文** （[ORCL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL) 收益是未来一周值得注意的事件之一。




The Nasdaq composite had the toughest time among the major indexes Friday, plummeting 2.6%. Its weekly decline of 5.8% was its worst since January 2022. It ended the week below the low of the Aug. 13 follow-through day and sits just 2.5% above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/). While it is well off recent highs, the tech-heavy index remains up 11.2% for the year.  
纳斯达克综合指数周五在主要指数中表现最艰难，暴跌 2.6%。其每周跌幅为 5.8%，是自 2022 年 1 月以来的最大跌幅。本周收盘价低于 8 月 13 日后续日的低点，仅比 [200 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/)高出 2.5%。虽然远低于近期高点，但以科技股为主的指数今年仍上涨了 11.2%。


The S&P 500 tumbled 1.7% for the day, which slammed it below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It also turned in a painful weekly drop of 4.3%, its worst since last year, while its year-to-date gain has atrophied to 13.4%. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund fell 1% but held above the 50-day line.  
标准普尔 500 指数当天下跌 1.7%，跌破 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)。它还出现了 4.3% 的痛苦周跌幅，这是自去年以来的最大跌幅，而年初至今的涨幅已萎缩至 13.4%。Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight （[RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)） 交易所交易基金下跌 1%，但保持在 50 日线上方。


Decliners led advancers by more than 3-to-1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume came in higher for both, which added fresh distribution days to both major indexes.  
纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克的下跌股均以超过 3 比 1 的比分领先上涨。这两个指数的成交量都更高，这为两个主要指数增加了新的发行天数。


Stock Market Dip Sparks This Change股市下跌引发了这一变化
----------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP090624-272x300.jpg)It wasn't just the S&P 500 and Nasdaq that got clobbered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded closer to its 50-day line as it fell 1% Friday, which accounted for a fair portion of its 2.9% weekly decline.  
不仅仅是标准普尔 500 指数和纳斯达克指数受到重创。道琼斯工业平均指数周五下跌 1%，跌至 50 日线附近，占其每周 2.9% 跌幅的相当一部分。


Insurance stock **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) outperformed while **Amazon.com** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) had the toughest sessions among the Dow components.  
保险股**旅行者** （[TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)） 跑赢大盘，而 **Amazon.com** （[GS）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS) 和美国**运通** （[AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)） 在道琼斯指数成分股中表现最艰难。


Small caps also took a hard blow, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.9%. Growth stocks did not escape the wrath of the bears either, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) plunging 1.7% Friday.  
小盘股也受到沉重打击，罗素 2000 指数下跌 1.9%。成长型股票也未能逃脱空头的愤怒，Innovator IBD 50 ETF （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 周五暴跌 1.7%。


Sharp declines across the indexes have prompted a reduction in Investor's Business Daily's recommended exposure levels to the 20% to 40% range. Given the sharp stock market pullback, being at the lower end of this band makes sense.  
指数的大幅下跌促使《投资者商业日报》将建议的风险敞口水平下调至 20% 至 40% 的范围内。鉴于股市大幅回调，处于该区间的低端是有道理的。


Make sure to reduce in a measured fashion though. Start by selling your weakest performing stocks first and take action on holdings that are triggering sell signals, such as breaches of the 50-day moving average.  
不过，请确保以有节制的方式减少。首先卖出表现最差的股票，然后对触发卖出信号的持仓采取行动，例如突破 50 天移动平均线。


Jobs Report Weak, Inflation Data Next就业报告疲软，通胀数据 下一个
----------------------------------------------------


Stocks got a spanking after the release of the pivotal jobs report for August. The U.S. economy added 142,000, well below economist views for 161,000, while the unemployment rate of 4.2% matched expectations. There were also big downward revisions to job growth in June and July.  
在 8 月份关键就业报告发布后，股市受到了重创。美国经济增加了 142,000 人，远低于经济学家预期的 161,000 人，而 4.2% 的失业率符合预期。6 月和 7 月的就业增长也出现了大幅下调。


An interest-rate cut looms at the Sept. 18 Fed meeting, with the stock market seeing a 69% chance of a 25-basis-point cut and a 31% chance for a 50-basis-point cut. The likelihood of the bigger trim actually declined, [according to the CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). But many expect more cuts heading into the end of 2024.  
美联储将在 9 月 18 日的会议上降息，股市降息 25 个基点的可能性为 69%，降息 50 个基点的可能性为 31%。[根据 CME FedWatch 工具](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html)，更大幅度削减的可能性实际上有所下降。但许多人预计，到 2024 年底，将有更多降息。


There are a few noteworthy events on the economic calendar in the coming week, with wholesale inventories and consumer credit data both scheduled for Monday. A smattering of inflation data is also due.  
未来一周经济日历上将发生一些值得注意的事件，批发库存和消费者信贷数据均定于周一公布。一些通胀数据也即将公布。


First, Consumer Price Index data for August comes Wednesday, with a year-over-year rise of 2.9% seen. Economists see core CPI turning in a 3.2% annualized lift. Producer Price Index data for the same month drops Thursday, where experts predict a 3.3% rise from the year-ago period.  
首先，8 月份消费者价格指数数据将于周三公布，同比增长 2.9%。经济学家预计核心 CPI 年化增长 3.2%。同月生产者价格指数数据周四下降，专家预测较上年同期上涨 3.3%。


And while earnings season has tailed off, there are a few [noteworthy reports in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/adobe-adbe-oracle-orcl-show-strength-earnings/). Big Tech names **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) are set to post earnings while meme stock **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) and supermarket giant **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) are also due.  
虽然财报季已经结束，但未来一周将发布一些[值得注意的报告](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/adobe-adbe-oracle-orcl-show-strength-earnings/)。大型科技公司**甲骨文** （[ORCL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL) 和 **Adobe** （[ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)） 将公布财报，而模因股票 **GameStop** （[GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)） 和超市巨头**克罗格** （[KR）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR) 也将公布财报。

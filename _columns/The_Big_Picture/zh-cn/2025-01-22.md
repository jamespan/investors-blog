  Indexes Extend Gains But Only This Sector Keeps S&P 500 In The Black

Stocks extended their advance Wednesday as the S&P 500 rose for the sixth time in the past seven sessions. But small caps underperformed in the stock market.


The S&P added 0.6%, falling just short of a record closing high but narrowly reaching a record intraday high.




The Nasdaq composite led with a 1.3% advance thanks to continued strength in the technology sector. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) rallied 2.3% to almost make a new high.


It led the S&P sector exchange traded funds on a day when performance was much more mixed than the major indexes might suggest. The S&P 500, for example, would have been lower without techs: ProShares S&P 500 Ex-Technology ETF ([SPXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPXT)) fell 0.2%.


Declining stocks led advancers on the Nasdaq by more than 3-to-2. On the New York Stock Exchange, losers led by a 2-1 ratio, according to FactSet.


The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) fell nearly 0.4%. Volume fell from Tuesday's levels. Those market indicators were further confirmation that buyers were more selective Wednesday.


What Stock Market Went For
--------------------------


What did the stock market favor? Growth stocks, for one. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) jumped 1.4%, while Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) lost 0.6%. Also, big caps won over small caps and midcaps.


The Russell 2000 fell 0.6%, ending a six-day win streak. The small-cap benchmark had rallied more than 7% from its Jan. 13 low, outpacing the Nasdaq and S&P 500. So the Russell could be the first major index to pause from the January rally.


The S&P MidCap 400 reversed lower by 0.4%, also ending a six-day win streak. The midcap gauge held well above its 50-day line, however.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%. Tech components **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) contributed much of the Dow's gains.


Stock Market Still In Bullish Phase
-----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP012225.jpg)While breadth thinned out, chart signals remained positive for the stock market.


Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have climbed above trendlines drawn from their December peaks. Those indexes also have broken a bearish trend of lower highs and lower lows. Notwithstanding Wednesday's breadth, accumulation-distribution lines are trending higher, and the NYSE A-D line is near new highs.


True, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are saddled with an uncomfortably high number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). But that seems to be on the way down. The S&P 500's Dec. 12 distribution day is now too dated, so it dropped off the count on the adjacent Market Pulse. A few more higher-volume declines will be expiring soon.


So far this year, almost every major index and sector index is up except for consumer staples. And there isn't much difference between those index gains, other than a 7% rally in the energy sector. At this same time last year, indexes were quite mixed.


More Breakouts
--------------


More high-rated stocks are breaking out past buy points.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) rode a [bullish earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-breakout-q4-2024-results-outlook/) to a record high. The stock gapped above the 941.75 buy point of a flat base. The pattern is [late-stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-tell-if-a-growth-stocks-run-is-getting-too-old/), but the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) made a new high and the company is on track with a revenue-growth strategy.


**Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), **Amphenol** ([APH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APH)), **Blue Owl Capital** ([OWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OWL)) and **Capital One** ([COF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COF)) were others topping bullish chart patterns Wednesday.


Yet, the fury of the market's advance from its Jan. 13 lows is such that it's reasonable to expect a pause. If the bullish undercurrents are for real, expect leading stocks to hold above buy points and support levels. Even more high-quality stocks should break out.


IBD's current recommended exposure is 80%-100%. Think of that as a full tank of gas for investors to travel the stock market and find more buying opportunities. But a rest stop could be on the horizon.

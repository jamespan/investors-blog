Major stock indexes took a step back in the stock market Tuesday as weakness in semiconductor stocks was offset by strength in oil and gas names. The pace of selling picked up just after 10 a.m. ET on reports that Iran was preparing to launch missiles at Israel after Israel commenced a ground offensive in Lebanon.




The selling intensified just before 1 p.m. ET after Israel confirmed that Iran had launched an estimated nearly 200 missiles, but many were intercepted in Jordanian airspace. Buyers started coming back into the stock market just after 1:20 p.m. ET, but selling picked up the pace again by the close.


The selling was concentrated in the Nasdaq composite, which slumped 1.5% in slightly higher volume. The Russell 2000 small-cap index lagged, also down 1.5%, but held support at its 21-day exponential moving average.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Despite the Nasdaq's downdraft, the index paid a visit to its 21-day line and held support. But higher volume resulted in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), the index's sixth since Aug. 28. Keep in mind, though, that only two of those declines showed declines of more than 1%. From this perspective, the Nasdaq is not in a heavy distribution phase.


Breadth improved on the Nasdaq by the close, but losers still beat winners by about 2-to-1.


Inside the Nasdaq 100, **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) slumped nearly 5%. The chip designer unsuccessfully tried to clear a 149.93 handle buy point last week in light volume. So far this week, shares are down 6.5%. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) fell 3.7% and closed just above its 50-day moving average.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up relatively well, down 0.4%, despite a 2.9% drop for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). According to a note from Barclays, supply chain channel checks showed that [Apple possibly reduced the number of builds](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-iphone16-demand-ai/) for the iPhone 16 by 3 million units for the quarter ending in December. It's not the first time worries about waning iPhone demand have weighed on the stock.


The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, but it's still holding comfortably above its 21-day line. NYSE volume fell from Monday's level. Oil and gas stocks outperformed in the stock market along with defense stocks. Breadth was better on the NYSE, with decliners beating advancers by about 4-to-3.

Among oil and gas stocks, **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)), **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) and **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) outperformed in the S&P 500 with gains ranging from 3% to 4%. But all three stocks remain on technical downtrends.


Defense Stocks Shine
--------------------


In the aerospace and defense group, **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) jumped 3% in higher volume. It's one of the leaders in the group after the large cap broke out of a cup base in early August. Group peer **L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) also had a good day, up nearly 3% in strong turnover. The defense contractor cleared a base with a 245.60 entry and closed just below it. Finally, drone maker **AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)) tried to clear a 211.44 handle buy point, but gains faded by the close.


West Texas intermediate crude oil futures were trading around $70.50 a barrel, up 3.5% around 4:30 p.m. ET on supply disruption fears.

After four straight declines, oil and gas producer **LandBridge** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)) continued to rise off its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) after making a stand at the support level Monday. LandBridge is one of the leaders in the exploration and production group after its IPO in late June. But the group ranks firmly in the bottom half of IBD's industry group rankings.


Despite Tuesday's stock market weakness, several top-rated growth stocks showed more strength and support. **Constellation Energy** ([CEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEG)) jumped 2% as the stock holds near highs. The stock gapped up sharply Sept. 20 after the company announced a nuclear power deal with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) to power its data centers.


Meanwhile, a 5% drop for **ZIM Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) might not have looked good on the surface. But after a strong move off lows, ZIM closed near session highs after retesting a prior buy point of 23.82.



**CBOE Global Markets** ([CBOE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBOE)) rallied 2.5% and gave a buy signal as the exchange operator got support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It's the first test of the 10-week line after the stock cleared a 23-week consolidation in early August.


In the insurance sector, **Ryan Specialty** ([RYAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAN)) gained nearly 3% in higher volume. Ryan poked above Friday's high but closed just below its all-time high of 69.03.


With the stock market uptrend still intact and IBD's invested percentage at 80%-100%, it still makes sense looking for new stocks to buy. Keep position sizes small to start and only add to your strongest performers.


If some of your winners have hit the 20% profit target from a proper buy point, there's nothing wrong with taking partial profits. As always, if a new buy doesn't go as planned, keep losses small.

On days when trading volume simulates melt-on-contact snowflakes rather than a fast-accumulating blizzard, the adept stock market investor focuses even more attention on this key aspect: price action. And Monday's action proved bullish.  




Thirty minutes into the regular session, the stock market slipped on some icy economic data.  


Consumer confidence in December slid to 104.7, well below the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 113. The Conference Board survey revised its November reading a shade higher, to 112.8 from 111.7. Strong consumer confidence translates to robust spending, giving a boost to the economy overall. Meanwhile, durable goods data offered a mixed picture. The headline number fell 1.1%, a much bigger decline than the 0.2% dip expected.  


Stock Market Today
------------------


However, excluding both transport and defense-related equipment, core capital goods orders expanded 0.7%. That smashed the 0.1% growth estimate.  


Yet the stock market shook off the numbers, and the Nasdaq composite led the recovery in prices. Down nearly 0.4% in the early going, the tech-enriched index quickly mopped up that minor loss and steadily rose the rest of the session. The Nasdaq closed a sprightly 1% higher and just 8 points off its session high of 19,772.  


On [past episodes of IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?_gl=1*1543wax*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2Ljc3NzYwNzQ3OS4xNzM0MzkyNjE0LjE3MzQzOTI2MTQ.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNDk4Njk3Ni4yNC4xLjE3MzQ5ODg1NjQuMi4wLjA.), special guest Mark Minervini, a two-time winner of the U.S. Investing Championships, has often remarked that the key to success in the stock market is a piece of advice veteran trader Bill Berger told him: Don't buy eggs. Buy tennis balls.

Be A Tennis Ball
----------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP122324-248x300.jpg)For two sessions in a row, the Nasdaq decided to act like a bouncy tennis ball, not a cracked egg.  


The S&P 500 also showed a bullish intraday bounce.  


Down nearly 0.5% at around 10:15 a.m. ET, the large-cap benchmark snapped back like a bull after taking a power nap. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to 5,974, coming within 5% of its all-time peak of 6,099.97.  


The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ETF edged up 0.1%. Having fallen 7.7% from its Nov. 29 peak, the exchange traded fund needs to rally a significant amount just to test resistance at its [cresting 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).  


A decent array of industries helped the cause. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, fabless semiconductor, automaker, chip equipment, internet content, airline, home furnishings retail, solar, managed care and ship transport stocks all posted price-weighted gains of 1% or more.  


A host of oil-related industry groups also rallied in the 0.7% to 0.9% range, even though crude oil futures on the NYMEX had just a mild gain.  



Nonetheless, IBD's industry-specific analysis of the stock market showed numerous areas of egg-like action.  


Drugstore, mobile building and RV manufacturing, airfreight, alcoholic beverages, super and mini market and leisure product firms were among the groups that backtracked 1.5% or more. Generally, banking, utility, electrical power and some cyclical stocks sold off. Hence, from this perspective, it's easy to see why the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 lagged. The former gained less than 0.2%; the latter dipped 0.2%.

These Stock Market Indexes Underperform
---------------------------------------


Volume fell rapidly on both main exchanges, as to be expected when Tuesday is scheduled to be only a half-day session ahead of the Christmas holiday. Turnover plunged 56% vs. Friday's trading on the NYSE and shrank 38% on the Nasdaq. The triple-witching expiration of weekly and monthly options and futures boosted Friday's volume.  



Notice on a daily chart that the Dow Jones, despite gaining ground a third straight session, has only scraped back a portion of last Wednesday's 2.6% sell-off that followed a strong signal from the Federal Reserve that it's now leaning to fewer trims in the cost of money in 2025. On that day, the U.S. central bank reduced the fed funds rate for the third time this year to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%.  
请注意，在日线图上，道琼斯指数尽管连续第三个交易日上涨，但只收复了上周三 2.6% 的部分抛售，此前美联储发出强烈信号，表示它现在倾向于在 2025 年减少资金成本削减。当天，美国央行今年第三次将联邦基金利率下调至 4.25%-4.5% 的目标区间。


Overall, action in the stock market has been superbly bullish since two key junctures: the Nov. 1, 2023, [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) by the Nasdaq; and bullish action on Nov. 6 this year that IBD described as a "subsequent" follow-through.  
总体而言，自两个关键时刻以来，股市的行动一直非常看涨：2023 年 11 月 1 日，纳斯达克指数的[后续交易日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/);以及今年 11 月 6 日的看涨行动，IBD 将其描述为“后续”跟进。


Despite Monday's positive action, keep in mind that last week's sell-off was strong enough to lower the recommended exposure in the stock market to 60%-80% from 80%-100%. Plus, [IBD's Market School analysis](https://leaderboard.investors.com/?_gl=1*6zmmgx*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2LjY0NTg3ODExLjE3MzM5NDk2ODAuMTczMzk0OTY3OQ..*_ga*MjA3NTg4MzU4OC4xNzM0MDY0MTIz*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNDA5OTMyOS4zLjEuMTczNDA5OTM0NS40NC4wLjA.#/market/marketschool) currently shows that the [power trend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-power-trend/) is under pressure.  
尽管周一采取了积极行动，但请记住，上周的抛售足够强劲，足以将股市的推荐敞口从 80%-100% 降至 60%-80%。此外，[IBD 的 Market School 分析](https://leaderboard.investors.com/?_gl=1*6zmmgx*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2LjY0NTg3ODExLjE3MzM5NDk2ODAuMTczMzk0OTY3OQ..*_ga*MjA3NTg4MzU4OC4xNzM0MDY0MTIz*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNDA5OTMyOS4zLjEuMTczNDA5OTM0NS40NC4wLjA.#/market/marketschool)目前显示，[电力趋势](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-power-trend/)面临压力。


While we're now entering the phase where the Santa Claus rally, as coined by Yale Hirsch, founder of the Stock Trader's Almanac, begins on Dec. 24 (or the fifth-to-last trading session of the year), what are some risk factors that investors should be on the lookout for? Here are several to munch on as you consider that second cup of eggnog or extra Christmas cookie.  
虽然我们现在正在进入圣诞老人反弹的阶段，正如 Stock Trader's Almanac 的创始人 Yale Hirsch 所创造的那样，从 12 月 24 日（或今年倒数第五个交易日）开始，投资者应该注意哪些风险因素？当您考虑第二杯蛋奶酒或额外的圣诞饼干时，这里有几个可以咀嚼。

Risks To The Stock Market股票市场的风险
--------------------------------


One, small caps sour further. Further drops by smaller issues may indicate that the economy is rapidly contracting, or a credit crunch could be on the horizon. That said, this area of the stock market has advanced. From the Nov. 1, 2023, follow-through day, the Russell 2000 has gained a healthy 47.7%.  
第一，小盘股进一步恶化。较小发行量的进一步下跌可能表明经济正在迅速收缩，或者信贷紧缩可能即将到来。也就是说，股市的这一领域已经取得了进步。从 2023 年 11 月 1 日的后续日开始，罗素 2000 指数上涨了 47.7%。


Two, market breadth worsens. Keep an eye on the advance-decline lines for the NYSE and the Nasdaq. If the major indexes power to new highs but the A-D lines keep heading south, this divergence usually sets up a serious correction in the future. Meanwhile, [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF&_gl=1*1r3utpm*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2LjY0NTg3ODExLjE3MzM5NDk2ODAuMTczMzk0OTY3OQ..*_ga*MjA3NTg4MzU4OC4xNzM0MDY0MTIz*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNDA5OTMyOS4zLjEuMTczNDA5OTMzNi41My4wLjA.) shows that the 10-day average of new lows has now doubled the 10-day average of new highs. Go to "NYEXG" to see a graph of both new highs and new lows.  
第二，市场广度恶化。密切关注纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克的涨跌线。如果主要指数创下新高，但 A-D 线继续南下，这种背离通常会在未来造成严重的修正。与此同时，[MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF&_gl=1*1r3utpm*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2LjY0NTg3ODExLjE3MzM5NDk2ODAuMTczMzk0OTY3OQ..*_ga*MjA3NTg4MzU4OC4xNzM0MDY0MTIz*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNDA5OTMyOS4zLjEuMTczNDA5OTMzNi41My4wLjA.) 显示，新低的 10 天平均值现在已经是新高 10 天平均值的两倍。前往 “NYEXG” 查看新高和新低的图表。


Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, noted in a Monday comment that "as expectations about the number of (interest rate) cuts in 2025 recently began to come into question, the market returned to favoring a small subset of large technology names that it believes will grow regardless of the economy. The upshot is that every trading day from Dec. 2 through Dec. 19, more individual stocks saw their prices decline than those that rose in price."  
Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management 首席投资官 Brent Schutte 在周一的评论中指出，“随着对 2025 年（利率）降息次数的预期最近开始受到质疑，市场又开始青睐一小部分大型科技公司，它认为这些公司无论经济如何都会增长。结果是，从 12 月 2 日到 12 月 19 日的每个交易日，价格下跌的个股都多于价格上涨的个股。


"For further context, this is the longest stretch of negative breadth in data going back to 1990," Schutte added. "Despite this, the S&P 500 posted positive performance from Dec. 2 through Dec. 17. It wasn't until the sell-off sparked by the Fed's latest dot plot that the index turned negative."  
“进一步的背景信息，这是自 1990 年以来数据中最长的负广度，”Schutte 补充道。“尽管如此，标准普尔 500 指数在 12 月 2 日至 12 月 17 日期间仍表现良好。直到美联储最新的点阵图引发抛售，该指数才转为负值。


The S&P 500 edged up a mere 18 points over that Dec. 2 to 17 time frame, yet it was still a gain.  
标准普尔 500 指数在 12 月 2 日至 17 日的时间范围内仅小幅上涨了 18 点，但仍是上涨。

Now, even leading stocks can go into corrections and switch into basing modes. That's normal. **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) is clearly working on a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/). **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) has undercut its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and might test buyers at its rising 50-day line.  
现在，即使是领先的股票也可以进入修正并切换到基地模式。这很正常。**Cava** （[CAVA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA) 显然正在开发[一个新的基础](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/)。**Spotify** （[SPOT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT) 已跌破其 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)，并可能在其上升的 50 天线处测试买家。


Risk No. 3  风险 3
----------------



Three, emerging markets start to outperform. It's not hard to find a financial advisor publicly touting exposure in non-U.S. equities. In 2024, European equities have been a disappointment. Japan has cooled off. China equities are still trying to bottom out. Some Argentine stocks have been excellent, but only a limited number trade on the U.S. exchanges. So if U.S. companies underperform, it's a little trickier for individual investors to create alpha.  
第三，新兴市场开始跑赢大盘。不难找到一位财务顾问公开吹捧在非美国的风险敞口。股票。2024 年，欧洲股市令人失望。日本已经降温了。中国股市仍在试图触底反弹。一些阿根廷股票表现优异，但在美国交易所交易的股票数量有限。因此，如果美国公司表现不佳，个人投资者创造超额收益就有点棘手了。


Four, serious distribution smothers the charts. On Monday, the Nov. 15 decline in higher volume on the S&P 500 expired due to time. Thus, it and the Nasdaq currently hold the same number of distribution days on the rolling 25-session count.  
第四，严重的分布扼杀了图表。周一，标准普尔 500 指数 11 月 15 日的较高成交量下跌因时间限制而到期。因此，它和纳斯达克目前在滚动 25 个交易日计数上持有相同的分发天数。


Still, the count remains a bit elevated. Plus, the Nasdaq has seen all four of its distribution days cluster over an eight-session period (Dec. 9, Dec. 12, Dec. 17 and Dec. 18). Past stock market tops, such as in March 2000, showed a cluster of heavy-duty declines in increasing volume. Investor euphoria often is unsustainably high at market tops as well.  
尽管如此，这个数字仍然有点高。此外，纳斯达克的四个派发日都集中在八个交易日（12 月 9 日、12 月 12 日、12 月 17 日和 12 月 18 日）。过去的股市顶部，例如 2000 年 3 月，显示出一系列交易量增加的重度下跌。投资者的欣快感在市场顶部也往往是不可持续的。


Additional Risks  其他风险
----------------------


Five, earnings disappointments in January and February could spark sell-offs. In a bearish scenario, you'll see breakouts by highly rated stocks fail quickly and miserably, and leaders [plummet through their 10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).  
第五，1 月和 2 月的收益令人失望可能会引发抛售。在看跌的情况下，您会看到高评级股票的突破迅速而悲惨地失败，领导者在其 [10 周移动平均线中暴跌](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/)。


Six, the cost of borrowing could spike. Keep an eye on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. On Monday, the yield jumped seven basis points to 4.59%, marking the highest close since May 29. Higher yields have historically impacted valuations of stocks. A prolonged rise could force institutions to reassess their projections for corporate earnings, the ability to pay down debt, make acquisitions, and buy back shares.


Seven, a Black Swan event in 2025 is always a possibility. Will it be an expanding military conflict that engulfs Europe? A terrorist event? A serious trade war caused by tariffs? Veteran investors know to expect the unexpected.

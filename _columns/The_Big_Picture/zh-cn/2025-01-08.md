Stock market indexes continued to do a balancing act Wednesday, teetering between holding some important chart levels while doing just enough to keep investors nervous.


The major indexes struggled for direction in seesaw trading, settling with modestly mixed price changes. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.1% but had been down nearly 1% at midday. Interestingly, the index made its low at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). That offers hope the Nasdaq can continue to bounce and perhaps lead the rest of the market higher.




The S&P 500 climbed 0.2% after erasing a loss of 0.6%. The index remained below its 50-day moving average, but support continues to hold around the 5,850 price level.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average led with a gain of nearly 0.3%. And the Russell 2000 reduced its loss to 0.5%. The small-cap index is holding support above 2,200.


Volume fell Wednesday after the Nasdaq recorded the highest trading ever recorded on Tuesday. But that record came at the hands of several low-priced stocks that traded millions of shares beyond normal.


The stock market is closed Thursday to commemorate the passing of former President Jimmy Carter.


Stock Market Seeks Direction
----------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP010825.jpg)While the stock market tries to find clear direction, Investor's Business Daily is recommending 40%-60% exposure to stocks. It is indeed a time to invest with precision and deliberation.


Of a handful of breakouts in the [MarketSurge 250 index](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) the past couple of weeks, about half remain above buy points. And whatever gains have occurred, they are modest.


The stock market has suffered multiple distribution days since the Dec. 18 market rout, leaving a trail of institutional selling into the new year.


Some of the hot investing themes in December are unraveling. Quantum computing stocks plummeted Wednesday after **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) Chief Executive Jensen Huang said quantum technology is [at least 15 years away from practical use](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/quantum-computing-stocks-dive-after-nvidia-ceo-says-tech-15-30-years-away/). Nvidia itself was almost flat Wednesday after tumbling 6% the prior day.


Monday's semiconductor rally has faded, too. Meanwhile, the new year has not offered much in the way of new investing ideas. The energy and health care sectors are early leaders. **Boston Scientific** ([BSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSX)) gapped above a flat base on [news of an acquisition](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/boston-scientific-stock-bolt-medical-acquisition/).


Finally, the MarketSurge short-term overbought-oversold oscillator is near the zero mark, meaning there's no tendency for either bulls or bears to take control.


More Bases To Watch In Stock Market
-----------------------------------


One positive side of the current stock market is that more top-rated stocks are nearing [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/).


**Globus Medical** ([GMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMED)), **Vital Farms** ([VITL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VITL)), **Argan** ([AGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGX)), **Deckers** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Travere Therapeutics** ([TVTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TVTX)) and **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) are among IBD 50 stocks in bullish chart patterns.Â The IBD 50 index rose 0.2% Wednesday.



Earnings season starts next week and President-elect Donald Trump is due to be sworn in Jan. 20. Those events could provide market catalysts, in one direction or another.


After the Santa Claus Rally melted away, another forecasting model came into focus.


The S&P 500 tends to climb for the year when the benchmark index is up in the first five sessions of January. Whichever direction the index goes the first five days, the S&P 500 goes in that direction for the full year 68% of the time.


Full-year returns average 16% when the indicator is positive, but only 2.6% when the indicator is negative. Wednesday marked the first five days of 2025 and the S&P rose a collective 0.6% in that time.


But remember that the best indicator is nothing more than the daily action of the major indexes, along with the behavior of leading stocks.


Stock Market Briefly Rises On Fed Minutes
-----------------------------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield came off session highs and was flat from Tuesday afternoon at 4.69%. It remained near eight-month highs, due to the rising costs of borrowing


Stock market indexes rose momentarily after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its December meeting, when the central bank cut the Fed funds rate by a quarter point. Policymakers believed inflation would continue to whither, but possible changes in trade tariffs and immigration policy could retard the process.


"Uncertainty has come to the Fed. Policymakers are increasingly unsure about how tax cuts, tariffs and immigration rules will impact the economy and inflation," David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said in comments to the media. "Everyone's in wait-and-see mode over the next few weeks. The Fed is no longer data dependent. It's now Trump dependent."

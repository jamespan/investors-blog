  Stock Market Steps Back As ASML Earnings Spark Chip Sell-Off; Russell 2000 Fades

Major stock indexes came under selling pressure in the stock market Tuesday after semiconductor-equipment firm **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) accidentally released its [quarterly earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/asml-stock-crashes-on-q3-report/) a day early and warned of weaker revenue in 2025.


ASML shares crashed 16%, helping fuel a 1% decline for the Nasdaq composite. For ASML, volume of more than 9 million shares was the  heaviest for a down day in at least 10 years. The selling spread quickly throughout the chip-equipment group, which was the day's worst-performer, down around 10%. **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) swooned nearly 15% and closed below its 200-day moving average.




The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) slumped more than 5% and paid a visit to its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which gets a 21% weighting in the ETF, fell 4.7%. But the downdraft only resulted in a test of the 10-day moving average. The second-highest-weighted holding — **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) — gave back 2.6% after rising in eight of the past nine sessions. Taiwan Semi [reports earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-netflix-nflx-intuitive-surgical-isrg-taiwan-semi-tsm/) Thursday before the open.


The Nasdaq on Monday closed in on its July 11 high of 18,671 but stopped short. The index is still in a bullish technical setup as it holds above its short-term moving averages and the 18,000 level. Despite the stiff selling on the Nasdaq, decliners only had a tiny edge over advancers. But volume rose sharply from Monday, giving the index a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


If distribution days start to cluster over a short amount of time, it could cause problems for the stock market uptrend. For now, it's a manageable count on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Stock Market Today: Small Caps Rise
-----------------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP101524-205x300.jpg)After clearing a three-week trendline Friday, the Russell 2000 broke out over its Sept. 18 high. But a 1% intraday gain faded to less than 0.1% by the close.


Digital pharmacy **Hims & Hers Health** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)) soared another 11% in the stock market today after jumping nearly 10% Monday. The catalyst Monday was news that the Food and Drug Administration would reconsider its decision to bar compounders from selling knockoff versions of **Eli Lilly**'s ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) weight-loss drug tirzepatide.


Losses were  milder in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500, which both closed lower by less than 0.8%. Volume also rose on the NYSE, giving the S&P 500 a distribution day. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by a tiny amount.

Cruise line operators like **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)), **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) and **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) outperformed in the S&P 500, closing higher by about 3% to 7%.


There was no news to account for the group move, but [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Viking** ([VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)) reversed higher for a gain of nearly 2%. Viking is still in the 5% buy zone from a 37.25 buy point. But after five straight weekly price gains — and another taking shape this week — Viking could be ready to pause and consolidate.


**Raymond James** ([RJF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RJF)) also had a fine day in the S&P 500, up nearly 2.5% ahead of next week's earnings report. Raymond James cleared a lengthy consolidation with a 131.19 entry. The investment bank hasn't announced an official date, but last year it reported quarterly results on Oct. 25.


What To Do Now
--------------


As Q3 earnings season kicks into gear, be aware of earnings dates in your portfolio. Has a big winner rallied furiously ahead of results? With a large profit cushion, you'll likely be able to sit through the report. With a smaller profit cushion, there's nothing wrong with taking partial profits ahead of the report.



For now, an invested percentage of 80%-100% still makes sense as major stock indexes stay on strong uptrends. Take stock of your current holdings by identifying the strongest performers and weaker ones. Funnel money into your winners when alternate entries arise, and pare down the laggards.


In the Dow Jones index, an earnings sell-off for **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was offset by gains of at least 1.5% for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)).


China stocks lagged badly in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com) as investors wonder if recently announced stimulus measures out of China will be enough to reignite growth. **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Trip.com** ([TCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCOM)) all cratered around 9%. The latter erased a 20% gain from its 58 buy point.

  Stock Market Powers Higher As Retail Sales, Walmart Earnings Boost Case For Soft Landing

The stock market extended its gains Thursday, as Wall Street reacted positively to strong retail sales and a better-than-expected earnings report from retail giant **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) that further assuaged recession fears.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.4%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced 2.3%. For the Nasdaq, it was the largest six-day percentage gain since November 2022, per Dow Jones market data. The small-cap Russell 2000 index climbed nearly 2.5%.


Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with consumer discretionary and technology leading the way. The utility and real estate sectors were the only losers on the day.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That, combined with the strong price action on the indexes, resulted in a subsequent [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), a sign that institutions are joining in on the ongoing rebound. It's another confirmation of re-emerging market strength and why IBD is recommending a higher exposure to stocks.


Gains were broad, with advancers beating decliners by a more-than 3-1 ratio on the NYSE and by nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq, according to [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/market-data/us). The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) jumped 1.4%.


Early Thursday, the Commerce Department said that retail sales — a measure of spending at stores, online and in restaurants — rose a seasonally adjusted 1% in July vs. the previous month. That was a strong pickup from June, when sales were revised down to a 0.2% decrease. Econoday estimates had expected retail sales to rise just 0.3% in July.

Stock Market Today
------------------


Early Thursday, [Walmart raised its full-year outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-q2-walmart-stock-amazon-home-depot/) after beating earnings estimates for its second quarter, sparking a 6.6% rally to record highs.


Walmart guided higher based on strength in the first half of the year, management said. But the Dow Jones component remained cautious for the second half of 2024, due to factors such as the U.S. presidential elections in November and the Middle East conflict.


"In this environment, it's responsible or prudent to be a little guarded with the outlook," Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC on Thursday. "But we're not projecting a recession."


Walmart's outlook and the economic data reinforced the case for a soft landing. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 10 basis points to 3.92%.


Elsewhere in the Dow Jones index, **Cisco** **Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) were among the biggest winners Thursday, with advances of 6.8% and 5.1%, respectively. Cisco [beat profit views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-stock-cisco-earnings-news-july2024/) while Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed a stake in Nike.


**Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) were among the four decliners on the session.


[All of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended higher. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) each rallied above a key level. Amazon regained its 200-day line, while Nvidia and Tesla reclaimed their 50-day lines.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) bounced 1.3% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) jumped 5.1% to hit a new high. Shares are extended past a 1,792.05 buy point.



What To Do Now
--------------


The Nasdaq is right back at its 50-day line following six straight days of gains. The Nasdaq could pause around this potential resistance level.


Still, the S&P 500 decisively regained its 50-day moving average, and with the market generally acting better, IBD is raising its recommended exposure level to 40% to 60%.


From here, ideally, the major indexes will drift sideways for a period of time, holding near or above key levels of resistance so stocks can form bases and new setups.


This environment clearly puts investor emphasis on [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means that incrementally raising exposure remains a priority. See how your existing positions and the latest breakouts perform before putting more capital to work.


If you're making progress, then it makes sense to add more exposure. If not, then hold until you are able to get back in sync with the general market.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list featured only one stock Thursday, **Birkenstock** ([BIRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIRK)). **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) and new issue **OneStream** ([OS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OS)) also topped buy points.


However, more names are appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list, suggesting that buying opportunities are on the horizon.

The [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) lost initial gains, but the pullback wasn't necessarily bearish. Monday's action perhaps signaled that equity traders preferred to take a cautious stance ahead of some economic reports and earnings results from some of the largest companies on the planet.  
[今天的股市](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)失去了最初的涨幅，但回调不一定是看跌的。周一的行动可能表明，股票交易员更愿意在全球一些最大公司的一些经济报告和收益结果之前采取谨慎立场。


One piece of [economic news to watch](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)? The July nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday before the open. Stock market observers will also pay attention to the ADP private-sector jobs survey on Wednesday and weekly jobless claims on Thursday. The jobless claims data has been quietly rising, worrying some economists that the probability of a recession is also rising.  
值得关注的[一则经济新闻](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)？7 月非农就业报告，将于周五开盘前公布。股市观察人士还将关注周三的 ADP 私营部门就业调查和周四的每周申请失业救济人数。申请失业救济人数的数据一直在悄然上升，这让一些经济学家担心经济衰退的可能性也在上升。


The yield on the U.S. Treasury benchmark 10-year note cooled, down 2 basis points to 4.17%, according to Cboe data.  
根据 Cboe 的数据，美国基准 10 年期国债收益率降温，下跌 2 个基点至 4.17%。


[And on the earnings front](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), the slate is extremely heavy again this week. It includes the likes of **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) on Tuesday and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) on Wednesday. Both megacap techs report quarterly results after the closing bell.  
[在财报方面](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/)，本周再次出现异常沉重的局面。它包括周二的 **Microsoft** （[MSFT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT) 和周三的 **Meta Platforms** （[META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)） 等公司。两家大型科技股都在收盘后公布了季度业绩。


Also be on the lookout for other stock market leaders such as **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) in the AI and PC semiconductor realm (Tuesday), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) in the wireless chip space (Wednesday), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) (Wednesday), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) (Thursday) and **Sarepta Therapeutics** ([SRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRPT)) (Friday).  
此外，请留意其他股票市场领导者，例如人工智能和 PC 半导体领域的 **Advanced Micro Devices** （[AMD）（](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)周二）、无线芯片领域的**高通** （[QCOM）（](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)周三）、**万事达卡** （[MA）（](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)周三）、**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** （[VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)）（周四）和 **Sarepta Therapeutics** （[SRPT）（](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRPT)周五）。

Stock Market Today 今日股市
-----------------------


A drop in crude oil futures, one barometer of economic activity, may have punctured the early rise in the stock market. On the Nymex, light sweet crude oil futures sank 1.6% to $75.90 a barrel. Oil is now up only 6.4% year to date. Back on April 14, crude got as high as $87.67, up almost 23% since Jan. 1.  
原油期货是经济活动的晴雨表，其下跌可能已经刺穿了股市的早期上涨。在纽约商品交易所，轻质低硫原油期货下跌 1.6% 至每桶 75.90 美元。今年迄今，油价仅上涨 6.4%。早在 4 月 14 日，原油价格就高达 87.67 美元，自 1 月 1 日以来上涨了近 23%。


Back to the stock market, the Nasdaq composite closed less than 0.1% higher. That's disappointing on two fronts. One, the tech-weighted index had rallied as much as 1% early on Monday. Two, even the intraday gain paled vs. a sharp two-week loss of 5.7%.  
回到股市，纳斯达克综合指数收盘上涨不到 0.1%。这在两个方面令人失望。首先，科技加权指数周一早盘上涨了 1%。第二，即使是盘中涨幅也相形见绌，两周大幅下跌 5.7%。


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP07292024-221x300.jpg)The weekly chart of the Nasdaq shows just how muted Monday's rally was, no matter what time of the session. The index, for now, remains beneath its still-rising 10-week moving average.  
纳斯达克的周线图显示了周一的涨势有多么温和，无论交易日的什么时间。目前，该指数仍低于其仍在上升的 10 周移动平均线。


On July 24, [IBD lowered the suggested level of investment in stocks](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-sp500-dow-jones-alphabet-ge-stock/) to a 40%-60% range vs. 60%-80%. That range got reduced from 80%-100% five trading days earlier, on July 17.  
7 月 24 日，[IBD 将建议的股票投资水平从](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-sp500-dow-jones-alphabet-ge-stock/) 60%-80% 下调至 40%-60% 的范围。该区间从五个交易日前，即 7 月 17 日的 80%-100% 缩小。


The S&P 500 reflected a mixed day as well. At 5463, it inched up 4 points, less than 0.1% higher. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average didn't move much. Yet at 40,573, down only 49 points on Monday, it closed above 40,000 for the 10th session in July.  
标准普尔 500 指数也反映了喜忧参半的一天。该指数小幅上涨 4 点至 5463 点，上涨不到 0.1%。与此同时，道琼斯工业平均指数没有太动。然而，该指数周一仅下跌 49 点，报 40,573 点，7 月份第 10 个交易日收于 40,000 点以上。


The Russell 2000, a huge winner last week with its 3.5% lift, dropped 1.1% on Monday.  
罗素 2000 指数上周以 3.5% 的涨幅大赢家，周一下跌 1.1%。


Looking at the daily action of 197 IBD industries, a mishmash of high-growth, cyclical and defensive groups fared poorly, an interesting development.  
纵观 197 个 IBD 行业的日常活动，高增长、周期性和防御性组别的大杂烩表现不佳，这是一个有趣的发展。


Among the 15 industries that dropped 2% or more, department stores and dairy products led the way, both down 4%. Solar, database software, oil drilling, Southwest banks, alcoholic beverages, coal, and oil and gas field services had a bad day. (See the entire 197 at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)  
在下跌 2% 或以上的 15 个行业中，百货公司和乳制品领跌，均下跌 4%。太阳能、数据库软件、石油钻探、西南银行、酒精饮料、煤炭以及石油和天然气现场服务行业今天表现不佳。（请参阅 [IBD 数据表中](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/)的完整 197。


Stock market internals weakened, but overall the confirmed market uptrend remains intact.  
股市内部因素走弱，但总体而言，已确认的市场上升趋势保持不变。


According to early data, falling stocks on the New York Stock Exchange outmatched rising ones by a nearly 3-2 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers by close to 2-to-1. Volume edged lower on both the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Friday.  
根据早期数据，纽约证券交易所下跌的股票与上涨的股票的比率接近 3：2。在纳斯达克，下跌的股票以接近 2 比 1 的比分击败上涨的股票。与周五相比，纳斯达克和纽约证券交易所的成交量均小幅走低。

The X Factor? X 因素？
-------------------


With the possibility that the stock market could lose further momentum, IBD readers have certainly benefited from acting more cautiously lately. Breakouts have also proved somewhat mixed lately. This is another reason to be very selective with new investments.  
由于股市可能会进一步失去动力，IBD 读者最近无疑从更加谨慎的行动中受益。最近证明，突破也有些复杂。这是对新投资非常挑剔的另一个原因。


On the bright side, long-term care firms have gushed with gains. **Ensign** ([ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)) (a [half-size position on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint)), **Pennant Group** ([PNTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNTG)) and **Sabra Healthcare** ([SBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBRA)) have outperformed the stock market lately and posted nice moves after clearing breakout points.  
从好的方面来看，长期护理公司已经大举获利。**Ensign** （[ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)）（[在排行榜上排名一半](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint)）、**Pennant Group** （[PNTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNTG)） 和 **Sabra Healthcare** （[SBRA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBRA) 最近跑赢股市，并在清除突破点后发布了不错的走势。


But it's a different story for names like **Hamilton Insurance** ([HG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HG)), which has dipped below a [V-shaped, weird-looking cup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/) with a 17.77 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Yet Hamilton remains above its IPO pricing of $15 a share.  
但对于**汉密尔顿保险公司** （[HG）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HG) 这样的名字来说，情况就不同了，它已经跌破了一个 [V 形、看起来很奇怪的杯子](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/)，入场[点](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)为 17.77。然而，汉密尔顿仍高于其每股 15 美元的 IPO 定价。


New IPO **Bowhead Specialty** ([BOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOW)), another insurance-sector play, has traded wildly since it moved past an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) with a 27.49 buy point. Yet it hasn't triggered the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) for now.  
新 IPO **Bowhead Specialty** （[BOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOW)） 是另一家保险行业公司，自从它以 27.49 的买入点超过 [IPO 基础](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/)以来，交易价格波动很大。然而，它目前还没有触发[投资的黄金法则](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/)。


**Loews** ([L](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=L)) reversed badly Monday, sinking 1.5% to 78.86 in above-average turnover. For now, though, the property and casualty insurer and operator of oil rigs is above a 77.99 [early buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in its amorphous base.  
**Loews** （[L](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=L)） 周一表现严重逆转，下跌 1.5% 至 78.86，成交额高于平均水平。不过，就目前而言，这家财产和意外伤害保险公司和石油钻井平台运营商在其无定形基础中高于 77.99 [的早期买入点](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)。


**MicroStrategy** ([MSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR)), which got some airplay during [Friday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), also reversed lower. The owner of a huge treasury of bitcoin briefly rallied past 1,800, then dove 3.5% and hit a session low of 1,671.27. In recent days, MicroStrategy formed a faulty four-session handle that included a big shakeout on Thursday.  
在[周五的 IBD Live 表演](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A)中获得一些播放量的 **MicroStrategy** （[MSTR）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR) 也反转走低。庞大比特币宝库的所有者短暂反弹至 1,800 点以上，然后下跌 3.5% 并触及 1,671.27 的盘中低点。最近几天，MicroStrategy 形成了一个错误的四会话手柄，其中包括周四的一次大洗牌。

Beyond The Stock Market: The Fed And Rates超越股市：美联储与利率
-----------------------------------------------------


The Federal Reserve begins a new two-day meeting on interest rates Tuesday. The CME FedWatch shows a slim 4% possibility that the bank will cut the overnight lending rate to large banks from its current range of 5.25%-5.5%. However, at the next meeting on Sept. 18, FedWatch shows a 100% chance the Fed will trim the cost of money by at least a quarter point.  
美联储周二开始为期两天的新一轮利率会议。CME FedWatch 显示，该银行将大型银行的隔夜贷款利率从目前的 5.25%-5.5% 范围下调的可能性很小，为 4%。然而，在 9 月 18 日的下一次会议上，FedWatch 显示美联储将货币成本削减至少 25 个百分点的可能性为 100%。


Cindy Beaulieu, chief investment officer for North America at Conning, which has $160 billion in assets under management, says her team still believes the Fed will limit any monetary easing this year to one or two cuts of 25 basis points, possibly after the November elections.  
管理着 1600 亿美元资产的 Conning 北美首席投资官 Cindy Beaulieu 表示，她的团队仍然相信美联储会将今年的任何货币宽松政策限制在一到两次 25 个基点的降息范围内，可能在 11 月大选之后。


"Overall, the growth picture looks decent. I wouldn't say it's going gangbusters," Beaulieu, who has been in the asset management industry for three decades, told IBD. "Inflation has moved more consistently toward the Fed's 2% target. But it will get harder for inflation to continue to make such consistent progress toward the U.S. central bank's target. Why? Primarily because the prices of nonhousing-related services continue to rise faster than other components of the vast, complex U.S. economy.  
“总体而言，增长前景看起来不错。我不会说它会变得很糟糕，“在资产管理行业工作了三十年的 Beaulieu 告诉 IBD。“通胀更持续地朝着美联储 2% 的目标迈进。但通胀要继续朝着美国央行的目标取得如此持续的进展将变得更加困难。为什么？主要是因为非住房相关服务的价格继续比庞大而复杂的美国经济的其他组成部分上涨得更快。


"The consumer is still consuming. Unlike four years ago (when Covid 19 caused many dislocations across industries), currently inflation is being driven by the demand side of the economy," Beaulieu added.  
“消费者仍在消费。与四年前（当时 Covid 19 导致各行各业出现许多错位）不同，目前的通货膨胀是由经济的需求侧驱动的，“Beaulieu 补充道。


She's also encouraged by the strength of the financial sector in the stock market so far.  
她还对迄今为止股市中金融部门的实力感到鼓舞。


It's been more than a year since Silicon Valley Bank operator SVB Bancorp and Signature Bank of New York imploded by holding a huge load of Treasury bonds and other debt securities. Those lost a tremendous amount of market value as the Fed took the fed funds rate from 0%-0.25% to 5.25%-5.5% from March 2022 to July 2023. Lately, interest rates across the yield curve have remained fairly stable, making it easier for lenders to adjust their portfolios.  
自硅谷银行运营商 SVB Bancorp 和 Signature Bank of New York 因持有大量美国国债和其他债务证券而崩溃以来，已经过去了一年多。随着美联储从 2022 年 3 月到 2023 年 7 月将联邦基金利率从 0%-0.25% 提高到 5.25%-5.5%，这些货币损失了大量市场价值。最近，整个收益率曲线的利率保持相当稳定，使贷方更容易调整其投资组合。


A few regional and community banks with overexposure to the struggling office real estate market could still go bankrupt, Beaulieu warned. But it would be unlikely to have such ripple effects as the stock market felt back in the first half of 2023. And with the prospects for the slope of the Treasury yield curve to regain some steepness, banks may be able to borrow more at lower rates and lend at higher rates, generating fatter net interest margins.  
Beaulieu 警告说，一些过度投资于陷入困境的写字楼房地产市场的区域和社区银行仍可能破产。但它不太可能产生像 2023 年上半年股市那样的连锁反应。随着美国国债收益率曲线的斜率可能重新变得陡峭，银行可能能够以较低的利率借入更多资金，并以更高的利率放贷，从而产生更丰厚的净息差。

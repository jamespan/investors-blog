  Stock Market Ends Mixed As Small Caps Disappoint The Hopeful; Expect This To Jump During Earnings

The stock market started a new week on mixed footing Monday. While technology stocks made a bid to extend a six-week winning streak, small caps did a face plant.




The Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.3% on Monday. Not far behind, the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund ended the day up nearly 0.2%. The fund tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks on the Nasdaq.


Yet most of the other popular indexes could not end in the winners column.


The worst performer? Small caps, as the Russell 2000 lost almost 1.6%. The S&P MidCap 400 sank 1.2%, significantly more than losses of 0.8% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 0.2% slip by the S&P 500.


Even the S&P SmallCap 600 — which most investing pros would agree has a more fundamentally sound collection of companies vs. the Russell 2000 in terms of earnings, profit margins and sales — had a rough Monday at the office. Its 1.7% decline wiped out gains made since Oct. 12. The drop also marked the 600's worst in a single session since a 1.7% slide on Sept. 6.


A sharp rise in interest rates perhaps had a lot to do with Monday's motley picture.


Stock Market: Small Caps Down As Yields Go Up
---------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102124.jpg)The yield on the key U.S. 10-year government bond climbed 10 basis points to 4.18%. That marked the highest close since July 26, according to Cboe Global Markets data.


Perhaps the stock market is getting a stronger sense that the Federal Reserve is going to continue cutting interest rates to ensure an economic soft landing, but just not as aggressively as investors thought after the central bank cut the fed funds rate in September by half a point to a target range of 4.75%-5%.


That was the Fed's first outright move to ease monetary policy since the spring of 2020.


Go to a [MarketSurge daily chart](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and type in "0TNX" (0 as in zero), and you'll see the 10-year bond yield is now pressing against upside resistance at the 200-day moving average.


Yields rise as bond prices go lower. The yield, or return, goes up as traders who seek to exit their positions sell to make bonds more attractive for would-be buyers.


Watch The Cost Of Money
-----------------------


It's common to see the Russell 2000, a bastion of smaller companies, sell off as the cost of money rises. A jump in interest rates, particularly on the long end of the yield curve, generally places pressure on economically sensitive firms.



Think homebuilding, regional banks and cyclical companies. In fact, looking at the 20 worst performers among [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the stock market on Monday, and many of them hailed from these sectors.


According to early data, mobile building manufacturing, residential building, Southwest and Western banks, mortgage services, construction products, meat, apparel maker and discount retail stocks led the downside, each falling 2% or more on a price-related basis.


Breadth was highly negative on the stock market. On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners surpassed risers by nearly 4-to-1, though it was much worse earlier in the day. Nasdaq losers beat winners on Monday by roughly 9-to-4.

Over the next two weeks in the stock market, the majority of S&P 500 companies report quarterly results. Stocks often rise in expectation of rosy earnings and sales, and often sell right on the news.


This phenomenon is hardly new. "Buy the rumor, sell the news" is extremely common behavior. Therefore, be extra careful about ponying up large amounts of cash to buy key stock market leaders right before their announcements.


A Great Tech Stock Lesson
-------------------------


**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) is a wonderful example of why it's often better to wait for earnings to come out and the post-reaction dust to settle before considering a tactical entry.



On Oct. 11, 2023, the megacap social media play broke out of a base but its breakout past 326.20 lasted all but a day. It soon fell more than 8% below that buy point, forcing new buyers to cut losses. The downdraft occurred just as the Facebook and Instagram operator reported quarterly results.


Yet the stock snapped back bullishly. In both November and December that year, Meta rebounded and took out that 326.20 former entry without forming a full-fledged base.


Since then, Meta has sharply outperformed. It's gained as much as 85% from the 326.20 original entry to a new high of 602.95. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has advanced a healthy 40% since the end of October 2023.


Meta is currently a full-size position in the [Leaderboard model stock portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). Leaderboard, on a portfolio-weighted basis, gained more than 30% through the fiscal year ended June 30.

The stock market started a new week on mixed footing Monday. While technology stocks made a bid to extend a six-week winning streak, small caps did a face plant.  
周一，股市以喜忧参半的方式开始了新的一周。虽然科技股试图延续六周的连涨势头，但小盘股却大放异彩。




The Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.3% on Monday. Not far behind, the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund ended the day up nearly 0.2%. The fund tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks on the Nasdaq.  
纳斯达克综合指数周一上涨近 0.3%。紧随其后的是 Invesco QQQ Trust （[QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)） 交易所交易基金当天收盘上涨近 0.2%。该基金跟踪纳斯达克最大的 100 只非金融股票。


Yet most of the other popular indexes could not end in the winners column.  
然而，大多数其他受欢迎的指数都不能以赢家列结尾。


The worst performer? Small caps, as the Russell 2000 lost almost 1.6%. The S&P MidCap 400 sank 1.2%, significantly more than losses of 0.8% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a slightly less than 0.2% slip by the S&P 500.  
表现最差的？小盘股，罗素 2000 指数下跌近 1.6%。标准普尔中型股 400 指数下跌 1.2%，远高于道琼斯工业平均指数 0.8% 的跌幅和标准普尔 500 指数略低于 0.2% 的跌幅。


Even the S&P SmallCap 600 — which most investing pros would agree has a more fundamentally sound collection of companies vs. the Russell 2000 in terms of earnings, profit margins and sales — had a rough Monday at the office. Its 1.7% decline wiped out gains made since Oct. 12. The drop also marked the 600's worst in a single session since a 1.7% slide on Sept. 6.  
即使是标准普尔小盘股 600 指数——大多数投资专业人士都同意，在收益、利润率和销售额方面，与罗素 2000 指数相比，它拥有更基本健全的公司集合——在办公室度过了一个艰难的周一。其 1.7% 的跌幅抹去了自 10 月 12 日以来的涨幅。此次下跌也标志着 600 自 9 月 6 日下跌 1.7% 以来单日最差。


Spirited Stock Market Turnover充满活力的股票市场成交量
------------------------------------------


Volume surged nearly 20% on the Nasdaq vs. Friday's trading to 6.09 billion shares and edged 1% higher on the New York Stock Exchange to 3.41 billion.  
与周五的交易相比，纳斯达克的成交量飙升近 20% 至 60.9 亿股，纽约证券交易所小幅上涨 1% 至 34.1 亿股。


The S&P 500 technically avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). While volume grew, the large-cap index's loss fell short of the 0.2% minimum.  
标准普尔 500 指数在技术上避免了[分配日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/)。虽然成交量增加，但大盘股指数的损失低于 0.2% 的最低水平。


A sharp rise in interest rates perhaps had a lot to do with Monday's motley picture.  
利率的急剧上升可能与周一的杂乱无章有很大关系。


Stock Market: Small Caps Down As Yields Go Up股市：收益率上升，小盘股下跌
-----------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102124.jpg)The yield on the key U.S. 10-year government bond climbed 10 basis points to 4.18%. That marked the highest close since July 26, according to Cboe Global Markets data.  
关键的美国 10 年期政府债券收益率攀升 10 个基点至 4.18%。根据 Cboe Global Markets 的数据，这是自 7 月 26 日以来的最高收盘价。


Perhaps the stock market is getting a stronger sense that the Federal Reserve is going to continue cutting interest rates to ensure an economic soft landing, but just not as aggressively as investors thought after the central bank cut the fed funds rate in September by half a point to a target range of 4.75%-5%.  
也许股市越来越强烈地意识到美联储将继续降息以确保经济软着陆，但并不像投资者在 9 月份将联邦基金利率下调半个百分点至 4.75%-5% 的目标区间后想象的那么激进。


That was the Fed's first outright move to ease monetary policy since the spring of 2020.  
这是美联储自 2020 年春季以来首次直接放松货币政策。


Go to a [MarketSurge daily chart](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and type in "0TNX" (0 as in zero), and you'll see the 10-year bond yield is now pressing against upside resistance at the 200-day moving average.  
转到 [MarketSurge 日线图](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF)并输入“0TNX”（0 代表零），您会看到 10 年期债券收益率现在正在 200 天移动平均线处压制上行阻力。


Yields rise as bond prices go lower. The yield, or return, goes up as traders who seek to exit their positions sell to make bonds more attractive for would-be buyers.  
收益率随着债券价格走低而上升。随着寻求退出头寸的交易员抛售以使债券对潜在买家更具吸引力，收益率或回报会上升。


Watch The Cost Of Money观看金钱成本
-----------------------------


It's common to see the Russell 2000, a bastion of smaller companies, sell off as the cost of money rises. A jump in interest rates, particularly on the long end of the yield curve, generally places pressure on economically sensitive firms.  
随着资金成本的上升，罗素 2000 指数（小公司的堡垒）被抛售是很常见的。利率的跳跃，尤其是收益率曲线的长端利率跃升，通常会给对经济敏感的公司带来压力。


Think homebuilding, regional banks and cyclical companies. In fact, looking at the 20 worst performers among [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the stock market on Monday, and many of them hailed from these sectors.  
想想住宅建筑、区域银行和周期性公司。事实上，看看周一股市 [IBD 的 197 个行业组中](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/)表现最差的 20 个，其中许多来自这些行业。



According to early data, mobile building manufacturing, residential building, Southwest and Western banks, mortgage services, construction products, meat, apparel maker and discount retail stocks led the downside, each falling 2% or more on a price-related basis.  
根据早期数据，移动建筑制造、住宅建筑、西南和西方银行、抵押贷款服务、建筑产品、肉类、服装制造商和折扣零售股领跌，与价格相关时均下跌 2% 或更多。


On the upside? The heavy construction group had a great Monday. **Construction Partners** ([ROAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROAD)) boomed to an all-time high of 86 and closed the session up 13% in the heaviest turnover since March 25.  
好的一面呢？重型建筑组度过了美好的星期一。**Construction Partners** （[ROAD）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROAD) 飙升至 86 点的历史新高，收盘上涨 13%，创下 3 月 25 日以来的最大成交量。


The daily chart shows a long chain of inter-connected bases. Buying on breakouts from most of them proved perilous.  
日线图显示了一长串相互关联的基地。事实证明，从他们中的大多数突破时买入是危险的。



No doubt, the breakouts that occurred on May 22, July 22-23 and Sept. 16 led to the trigger of [IBD's golden rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). That is, the position had to get jettisoned because ROAD fell 7% or more below each buy point. The Sept. 16 run past 66.50 was an exception.  
毫无疑问，5 月 22 日、7 月 22 日至 23 日和 9 月 16 日发生的突破导致了 [IBD 黄金法则](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/)的触发。也就是说，由于 ROAD 在每个买入点下方下跌 7% 或更多，因此该头寸不得不被抛弃。9 月 16 日超过 66.50 的成绩是一个例外。


Nonetheless, the year-to-date move has been impressive. After the provider of construction products and services broke out of a symmetrical base at 45.22 on Jan. 31, ROAD has rallied 90%. It's grown to midcap status with a market value of $4.5 billion and 53 million shares outstanding.  
尽管如此，年初至今的走势令人印象深刻。在 1 月 31 日突破 45.22 的对称底部后，ROAD 已上涨 90%。它已发展成为中等市值，市值为 45 亿美元，流通股为 5300 万股。


Construction Partners' earnings have leapt 136%, 375%, 82% and 44% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters through the second quarter of the calendar year. (The company's fiscal year ends in September.) These four quarters total $1.35 in earnings per share. Yet itt's worth noting that in Q1, the firm actually posted a 2-cent net loss, far smaller than the 11 cents it lost in the year-ago quarter. So, how does IBD calculate an "82% EPS increase?"  
截至日历年第二季度的过去四个季度，Construction Partners 的收益与去年同期相比分别增长了 136%、375%、82% 和 44%。（该公司的财政年度于 9 月结束。这四个季度的每股收益总计为 1.35 美元。但值得注意的是，在第一季度，该公司实际上公布了 2 美分的净亏损，远低于去年同期的 11 美分亏损。那么，IBD 如何计算“每股收益增长 82%”呢？


In order to turn the 11 cent-per-share loss to an 11 cent gain, one must add 22 cents. Add the same amount to the 2-cent loss to get a theoretical profit of 20 cents. A "profit" of 20 cents vs. 11 cents translates to 82% growth.  
为了将每股 11 美分的亏损变成 11 美分的收益，必须增加 22 美分。在 2 美分的损失中加上相同的金额，得到 20 美分的理论利润。20 美分对 11 美分的“利润”转化为 82% 的增长。


Triggering A Profit-Taking Rule触发获利回吐规则
---------------------------------------


Last week, **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) reversed negatively. A gain of as much as 6.3% turned into a 3.6% decline for the week. On Monday, the member of IBD's Banks-West/Southwest industry group got thumped again. The stock dropped nearly 5.9% and [sharply undercut its 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).  
上周，**Western Alliance Bancorp** （[WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)） 下跌。高达 6.3% 的涨幅变成了本周 3.6% 的跌幅。周一，IBD 的 Banks-West/Southwest 行业集团的成员再次受到打击。该股下跌近 5.9%，[大幅低于其 10 周移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/)。


Monday's action arguably justified a decision to take short-term profits.  
周一的行动可以说是合理地证明了短期获利的决定是合理的。



Notice on a weekly chart how Western Alliance has not closed below its 10-week line even a single time since it throttled out of a long consolidation with a 65.79 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in the week ended July 12. From that entry, WAL propelled more than 25%. (The daily chart, according to [MarketSurge chart pattern recognition](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF), also showed an eight-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/) that showed a 64.74 entry.)  
请注意周线图上的 Western Alliance 自从在截至 7 月 12 日当周以 65.79 [买入点](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)结束长期盘整以来，甚至一次也没有收于其 10 周线下方。从该条目开始，WAL 推动了超过 25%。（根据 [MarketSurge 图表模式识别](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF)，日线图还显示了一个八周[cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/)显示 64.74 入场。


[Taking gains in many stocks at 20%-25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/), or perhaps a little more than that, can prove very beneficial to a portfolio's long-term equity curve.  
[在许多股票中获利 20%-25%，](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/)或者可能略高于此，可以证明对投资组合的长期股票曲线非常有利。


On Thursday last week, after the market close, Western Alliance reported a 9% decline in third-quarter earnings to $1.80 a share on a 15% revenue increase to $823.1 million.  
上周四收盘后，Western Alliance 报告称，第三季度收益下降 9% 至每股 1.80 美元，营收增长 15% 至 8.231 亿美元。


Market Internals: Vigilant On Divergence市场内部情况：对背离保持警惕
------------------------------------------------------


Going back to the broader stock market, breadth turned out highly negative on the stock market. On the New York Stock Exchange, early data showed decliners surpassing risers by nearly 4-to-1, though it was much worse earlier in the day. Nasdaq losers beat winners on Monday by roughly 9-to-4.  
回到更广泛的股市，股市的广度非常负面。在纽约证券交易所，早期数据显示，下跌股数几乎是 4 比 1 的涨幅，尽管当天早些时候的情况要糟糕得多。纳斯达克的失败者周一以大约 9 比 4 击败了获胜者。

请参阅每个 Big Picture 列底部的 GMI（一般市场指标）PDF 上的确切数字。


Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) fell 0.6% on Monday for its fourth drop in five sessions. The exchange traded fund's performance differed sharply from the Nasdaq 100, being a market-cap-weighted index. Yet QQQE remains bullishly on the north side of the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).  
Direxion 纳斯达克 100 等权重指数 （[QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)） 周一下跌 0.6%，为五个交易日以来的第四次下跌。该交易所交易基金的表现与纳斯达克 100 指数截然不同，纳斯达克 100 指数是一个市值加权指数。然而，QQQE 仍然看涨 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)的北侧。


In contrast to the S&P 500's small loss of less than 0.2% on Monday, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) fund also fared poorly on Monday, losing nearly 0.9%.  
与标准普尔 500 指数周一不到 0.2% 的小幅跌幅相反，景顺标准普尔 500 等权重 （[RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)） 基金周一也表现不佳，下跌近 0.9%。


Gains are thin for RSP in the fourth quarter so far. It pole-vaulted 9% higher in the July-to-September period.  
到目前为止，RSP 在第四季度的涨幅很小。它在 7 月至 9 月期间的撑杆跳高出了 9%。


Over the next two weeks in the stock market, the majority of S&P 500 companies report quarterly results. Stocks often rise in expectation of rosy earnings and sales, and often sell right on the news.  
在接下来的两周股市中，大多数标准普尔 500 指数公司将公布季度业绩。股票经常因预期乐观的收益和销售而上涨，并且经常在新闻中直接卖出。


This phenomenon is hardly new. "Buy the rumor, sell the news" is extremely common behavior. Therefore, be extra careful about ponying up large amounts of cash to buy key stock market leaders right before their announcements.  
这种现象并不新鲜。“买谣言，卖新闻”是极其常见的行为。因此，在主要股市领导者宣布之前，不要拿出大量现金购买他们，这要格外小心。

A Great Earnings Lesson In The Stock Market股市的一大堂收益课
----------------------------------------------------


**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) is a wonderful example of why it's often better to wait for earnings to come out and the post-reaction dust to settle before considering a tactical entry.  
**Meta Platforms** （[META）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META) 是一个很好的例子，说明为什么在考虑战术性入场之前，等待财报出来和反应后尘埃落定通常更好。



On Oct. 11, 2023, the megacap social media play broke out of a 10-week base featuring a decline of just 16% from high to low. Its breakout past 326.20 lasted all but a day. It soon fell more than 8% below that buy point, forcing new buyers to cut losses. The downdraft occurred just as the Facebook and Instagram operator reported quarterly results.  
2023 年 10 月 11 日，大型社交媒体游戏突破了 10 周的基数，从高到低仅下跌了 16%。它突破 326.20 持续了一天。它很快比该买入点下跌了 8% 以上，迫使新买家减少损失。下滑发生在 Facebook 和 Instagram 运营商报告季度业绩之际。


Yet the stock snapped back bullishly. In both November and December that year, Meta rebounded and took out that 326.20 former entry without forming a full-fledged base.  
然而，该股反弹看涨。在那年 11 月和 12 月，Meta 都反弹并拿下了 326.20 的前条目，但没有形成成熟的基础。


Since then, Meta has sharply outperformed. It's gained as much as 85% from the 326.20 original entry to a new high of 602.95. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has advanced a healthy 40% since the end of October 2023.  
从那时起，Meta 的表现急剧优于大盘。它从最初的 326.20 入口上涨了 85% 至 602.95 的新高。与此同时，标准普尔 500 指数自 2023 年 10 月底以来已健康上涨 40%。


Meta is currently a full-size position in the [Leaderboard model stock portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). Leaderboard, on a portfolio-weighted basis, gained more than 30% through the fiscal year ended June 30.  
Meta 目前是 [Leaderboard 模型股票投资组合](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint)中的全尺寸头寸。在截至 6 月 30 日的财年中，按投资组合加权计算，排行榜上涨了 30% 以上。


Beyond Meta 超越 Meta
-------------------


[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-meta-platforms-meta.aspx), Meta tops the Internet-Content industry group in terms of Composite Rating (96). Keep an eye on other leaders in the group, including **CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)), Norway-based **Opera** ([OPRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPRA)) (thinly traded with an average dollar volume of $7 million), and new issue **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)).  
[根据 IBD Stock Checkup 的数据](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-meta-platforms-meta.aspx)，Meta 在综合评级 （96） 方面在互联网内容行业组中名列前茅。密切关注该集团的其他领导者，包括 **CarGurus** （[CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)）、挪威的 **Opera** （[OPRA）（](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPRA)交易量清淡，平均交易量为 700 万美元）和新发行的 **Reddit** （[RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)）。

Major indexes snapped a losing streak Friday to end the first week of the new year with hearty gains and some reason for optimism in the stock market outlook.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8% but action on the other indexes was more noteworthy. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% and closed almost exactly at the 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq composite rebounded from that important level, rising an impressive 1.8% on the stock market today.




Small caps also performed well, with the Russell 2000 up 1.7%. It is trying to recover from an 11% slide from late November into its Dec. 20 low.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) led the Dow Jones industrials higher with a 4.5% gain. Notably, the stock climbed back above its 50-day moving average and cleared an early buy point at 141.90. Investors will be watching Monday evening, when CEO Jensen Huang delivers the [keynote address at the CES 2025 trade show](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-january-2025/).


It was generally a positive day for leading stocks, too. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rebounded more than 8%. The IBD 50 index rallied 2.1% and climbed back above its 50-day line. IBD 50 stocks **Rocket Lab USA** ([RKLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RKLB)), **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)) and **Affirm Holdings** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)) jumped 6% to 15%. More leading stocks are [finding support](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/stock-market-ibd-50-stocks-3/) at their 10-week moving averages.

Volume edged higher on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq from Thursday's totals. It would have been better if Friday's impressive index gains had come in significantly higher volume.


Stock Market Breadth Bullish
----------------------------


Still, breadth was bullish. Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


The broad rebound and improving action among top stocks meant a change in Investor's Business Daily's [recommended exposure level to 60%-80%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/). This means investors can shift from defensive mode to a more aggressive stance — with a measure of caution.


More stocks have been making new lows than new highs since mid-December on both exchanges with the exception of a handful of days. That reflects the bearish breadth in the stock market.


Another reason to be cautious despite buyers' jubilant return on Friday is the cluster of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for both the S&P and the Nasdaq.


The S&P 500 saw 57 record highs in 2024, but in December just three S&P 500 sectors — communication services, consumer discretionary and technology — gained, leading to divergence.


If you are buying stocks, be sure to enter while they are in proper buy ranges. With few breakouts to choose from and few stocks setting up, investors are more likely to find opportunities in pullbacks to the 10-week line.


Santa Claus Rally Ends With Losses
----------------------------------


Friday marked the end of the Santa Claus Rally period, which is defined as the last five trading days of the year and the first two days of the new year. The S&P lost 0.5%, the Dow 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.7% during that period this time around.


Historically, that can mean a slump or even a bear market this year, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. But it's worth noting that the Nasdaq fell the previous three Santa Rally periods and still had superb gains in 2023 and 2024.


The stock market sought to repair some of the damage done since Dec. 18 when a hawkish Fed indicated fewer rate cuts this year. On Friday, Richmond Fed President [Tom Barkin](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-futures-rise-after-losing-start-to-2025/card/fed-s-barkin-sees-risk-that-inflation-pressures-reemerge-IMprmT91p7RRcXNwfc21?mod=mw_quote_news) noted that the risk of inflation reemerging remained, and that could mean mid-cycle adjustments and bumps in the Fed's already diminished easing cycle.

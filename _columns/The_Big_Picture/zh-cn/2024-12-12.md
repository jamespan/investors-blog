  Dow Jones Extends Losing Streak, While Small-Cap Stocks Struggle	道琼斯指数延续连跌势头，小盘股苦苦挣扎

Small-cap stocks underperformed Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average extended a losing streak to six sessions — its longest since April.  
小盘股周四表现不佳，道琼斯工业平均指数（Dow Jones Industrial Average）延续了6个交易日的连跌纪录，这是自4月以来最长的一次下跌。


The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 both dropped 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 0.7%. The Russell 2000 index sold off 1.4%.  
道琼斯工业指数和标准普尔 500 指数均下跌 0.5%，而以科技股为主的纳斯达克综合指数下跌 0.7%。罗素 2000 指数下跌 1.4%。




Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and was lower on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That created a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the Nasdaq, taking its count to three, which matches the S&P 500's distribution.  


While that number remains tolerable, bears clearly were in control. Declining stocks topped advancers by nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by about 13-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.  


This week delivered two inflation reports that pretty much cleared the path for a [Federal Reserve rate cut](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cut-cpi-ppi-jobless-claims-sp-500/) next week. And policymakers are going to feel much better about cutting rates after Thursday's producer price index, which was hot on the surface but showed tepid inflation in health care services and other categories that feed into the Fed's primary inflation rate.  


While a rate cut was already virtually a done deal for the Dec. 18 Fed meeting, Thursday's data including a jump in initial jobless claims, lowered the risk that Fed policymakers will offer a hawkish forecast for rate cuts next year when they update quarterly projections next week.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **Merck** ([MKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKR)) were the top performers Thursday, with gains of 1.9% and 1.5%, respectively.  


On the downside, **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) sold off 3.3% and 2.1%, respectively. Their combined point loss was nearly 159 points. **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) also cost the Dow nearly 43 points.  


The [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended sharply mixed Thursday as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) fell 0.8%. Notably, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) notched all-time highs, but reversed lower to snap a six-day win streak.  


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund declined 1.2%. Despite that, [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) had a number of solid winners on the session, including bitcoin stock **Hut 8 Mining** ([HUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUT)) and **Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)).

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP121224-261x300.jpg)


With the Nasdaq setting another record high this week, and the S&P 500 holding just off its own highs, IBD maintains its recommended exposure level at 80%-100%.  


However, there is weaker-than-ideal breadth, with the S&P 500's recent gains much stronger compared with its equal-weighted counterpart, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ETF. While the S&P is down 0.6% this week, the equal-weight index is down 1.3%.  


Meanwhile, Direxion Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) failed to hit a new high this week, contrary to QQQ's action. This shows there could be some weakness beneath the surface.  


Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with consumer discretionary, health care and communication services falling the most. Consumer staples was the only rising sector on the day.  
标准普尔 500 指数的 11 个板块中有 10 个板块收低，其中非必需消费品、医疗保健和通信服务跌幅最大。必需消费品是当天唯一上涨的板块。


That means investors should be utilizing diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). It's important to monitor positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules.  
这意味着投资者应该利用勤奋的[风险管理](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/)，这是 [IBD 方法的四大支柱](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/)之一。监控行为不正常的头寸并卖出任何触发卖出规则的股票非常重要。


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured one new stock: **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)). The Near Pivot list has four stock ideas, and one is Dow Jones media giant **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), which is approaching a 118.63 buy point.  
[IBD MarketSurge 的](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)Breaking Out Today 名单中有一只新股：**Manhattan Associates** （[MANH）。](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)Near Pivot 列表有四个股票想法，其中一个是道琼斯媒体巨头**华特迪士尼** （[DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)），它正在接近 118.63 的买入点。

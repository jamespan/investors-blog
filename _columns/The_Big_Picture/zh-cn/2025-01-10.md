The stock market closed firmly lower Friday after the latest jobs report came in far stronger than expected. A new inflation reading and retail sales data for December now loom in the coming week.


The Nasdaq composite closed off lows for the day, but still plunged 1.6%. Notably, it dropped below the important [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and failed to rally back above it, a bearish sign. It finished with a weekly decline of 2.3% but is down a more modest 0.8% so far in January.




The S&P 500 closed near session lows, ceding 1.5%. It now sits more than 2% below its 50-day line. It fell 1.9% for the week and dipped for its second week in a row. The benchmark index is down 0.9% so far in 2025.


Decliners led advancers by more than 4-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by just over 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume also was higher on the NYSE, adding a distribution day to the S&P 500.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average did not escape the wrath of the rampaging bears as it skidded 1.6% Friday. It lost more ground on its 50-day line and is now just 2.5% above its 200-day moving average. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) outperformed while insurance play **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and chip giant **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) were among the worst laggards on the closely watched index. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) flashed a sell signal by falling below its 50-day line.


Small caps were mauled, with the Russell 2000 tumbling 2.2%. A test of its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rule-no-21-use-200-day-line-to-spot-overheating/) is imminent. Bears also took a bite out of growth stocks, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund falling 1.8%.


Market Pullback Prompts Exposure Shift
--------------------------------------


Stocks were rattled as Treasury yields spiked following a hot jobs report. The U.S. economy created 256,000 nonfarm jobs in December, well above economist views for 157,000. Additionally, the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked lower to 4.1% and wage growth was a bit softer than expected.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP011025.jpg)Treasury yields ended the day sharply higher as a result. The 10-year Treasury note jumped eight basis points to 4.76%, the highest level since Nov. 1, 2023, while the two-year note surged 13 basis points to 4.39%.


In stocks, leading issues such as **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Jefferies Financial** ([JEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JEF)) are flashing sell signals. Due to the negative indicators, Investor's Business Daily is reducing its recommended exposure level to the 20% to 40% level. Investors should take care to reduce exposure in a measured manner, and trim their weakest holdings first.


Meanwhile, more important economic data looms in the week ahead. The producer price index comes Tuesday before the critical consumer price index reading comes Wednesday. The headline consumer price index is seen rising 3.1% year over year while core CPI is expected to turn in annualized growth of 2.9%. And on Thursday, U.S. retail sales figures for the crucial December period are due.


Additionally, the latest [earnings season is set to kick off in earnest](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/jpmorgan-stock-goldman-sachs-tsmc-earnings/). Big bank stocks including **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) are among those set to report. **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) also have results due.


These Stock Market Groups Hit Hardest
-------------------------------------


Nearly all of the [S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Real estate and financials were the areas hit the hardest. Only energy managed to finish the day in positive territory.



Once again, the relative performance of IBD's 197 industry groups gave investors a clearer picture of what happened [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Most ended the session in the red, with alcoholic beverage firms, newspapers, foreign telecom services plays, health care commercial services companies and mortgage stocks among the worst laggards.


Alternative energy plays, discount retailers and airlines — the latter group boosted by a better-than-expected report from **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) — were among the best performers.


However, it was the drug stores group that took top honors after **Walgreen Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) rocketed 27.6% following an earnings beat.

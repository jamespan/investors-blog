The stock market climbed for the third time in the past four sessions — each time closing at session highs — as the S&P 500 made a record high and indexes continued making steadfast progress.  
随着标准普尔 500 指数创下历史新高，指数继续稳步上涨，股市在过去四个交易日中第三次攀升——每次收盘均创下盘中高点。


The S&P 500 rose 0.7% after rising from support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The Dow Jones Industrial Average led with a 1% increase and marked a new closing high.  
标准普尔 500 指数从 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)的支撑位上涨 0.7%。道琼斯工业平均指数以 1% 的涨幅领涨，并创下收盘新高。




The Nasdaq added 0.6% and is knocking on the door of its 18,327 high, reached on Sept. 26. As [Tuesday's Big Picture noted](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-nasdaq-dow-jones-sp500-nvidia-stock/), a move above that level would be a bullish sign for the market. The IBD 50, Investor's Business Daily's growth-stock index, rose more than 1%.  
纳斯达克指数上涨 0.6%，正在敲响 9 月 26 日触及的 18,327 点高点的大门。正如[周二的 Big Picture 所指出](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-nasdaq-dow-jones-sp500-nvidia-stock/)的那样，突破该水平将是市场的看涨信号。投资者商业日报的成长型股票指数 IBD 50 上涨超过 1%。


Today's stock market is looking firm despite geopolitical threats, election uncertainty, softening manufacturing activity, the eve of earnings season and a lurch in benchmark yields.  
尽管存在地缘政治威胁、选举不确定性、制造业活动疲软、财报季前夕和基准收益率暴跌，但今天的股市看起来仍然坚挺。


The 10-year Treasury yield Wednesday added three basis points to 4.065% for a sixth straight day of gains and a third straight session above the 4.0% level. The 32-basis-point jump over the past six sessions is the largest since February, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  
10 年期美国国债收益率周三上涨 3 个基点至 4.065%，连续第六天上涨，连续第三个交易日高于 4.0% 的水平。根据道琼斯市场数据，过去六个交易日上涨 32 个基点是自 2 月以来的最大涨幅。


Yet, skies are clearing a bit for a stock market that chalked up multiple [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) in the past several weeks.  
然而，过去几周连续数[天派](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/)发的股市正在放晴。


On Wednesday, the S&P's Sept. 5 distribution day was deleted because the index rose more than 5% from that day's close. That thinned the number of distribution days in the S&P to three. The Nasdaq is still a bit bloated with five distribution days.  
周三，标准普尔 9 月 5 日的分配日被删除，因为该指数较当天收盘价上涨超过 5%。这使得标准普尔指数的分发天数减少到三个。纳斯达克仍然有点臃肿，只有五个派息日。


High Stock Market Exposure Justified高股市敞口是合理的
---------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP100924.jpg)IBD raised its recommended exposure to 80%-100% on Sept. 19, and the current market behavior still supports that level of risk. While major indexes are behaving well, many important index funds are breaking out of cup-with-handle patterns or are in bullish chart formations.  
IBD 于 9 月 19 日将其建议的风险敞口提高到 80%-100%，目前的市场行为仍然支持该风险水平。虽然主要指数表现良好，但许多重要的指数基金正在突破杯子带把手的模式或处于看涨的图表形态中。


Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)), up 1.1% Wednesday, is breaking out past a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) is about to break out of a flat base, although the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) is lagging. The consumer discretionary exchange traded fund is finding support at its 21-day line.  
科技精选板块 SPDR （[XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)） 周三上涨 1.1%，突破 [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/)。金融精选板块 SPDR （[XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)） 即将突破flat base，尽管[相对强弱线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/)滞后。非必需消费品交易所交易基金在其 21 天线处获得支撑。


Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) is breaking out of a handle formation. Vanguard Megacap ETF ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)), iShares S&P 100 ETF ([OEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OEF)) rose to an all-time high Wednesday.  
Direxion 纳斯达克 100 等权重 ETF （[QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)） 正在突破手柄形态。Vanguard Megacap ETF （[MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)）、iShares S&P 100 ETF （[OEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OEF)） 周三升至历史新高。


The iShares S&P Total U.S. ETF ([ITOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITOT)), which tracks the broad S&P 1500 index, also made a new high. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) is near new highs.  
追踪广泛的标准普尔 1500 指数的 iShares S&P Total U.S. ETF [（ITOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITOT)） 也创下新高。景顺标准普尔 500 等权重 （[RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)） 接近新高。


Smaller Stocks Lag As Sectors Rotate小幅股票滞后于板块旋转
-----------------------------------------------


But smaller stocks are lagging. The Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark rose less than 0.3% and is 4.5% below its prior high. The S&P MidCap 400 is doing better. It rose 0.7% Wednesday and is less than 1% off new highs.  
但较小的股票表现落后。罗素 2000 小盘股基准指数上涨不到 0.3%，比之前的高点低 4.5%。标准普尔中型股 400 指数表现更好。周三上涨 0.7%，距离新高不到 1%。


But sectors that had led the stock market in August and in some cases into September are rotating out of favor. Utilities Select Sector SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) closed below its 50-day moving average.  
但是，在 8 月甚至 9 月在某些情况下引领股市的板块正在轮换，不再受青睐。公用事业精选板块 SPDR （[XLU）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU) 收于其 50 天移动平均线下方。


Consumer Staples SPDR ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) has spent a few days below the 50-day line. Health Care Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) is trying to get back above its 50-day average. All three show weak relative strength lines.  
Consumer Staples SPDR （[XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)） 在 50 天线下方停留了几天。医疗保健精选行业 SPDR （[XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)） 正试图回到其 50 天平均水平上方。这三条线都显示出较弱的相对强度线。


That sector rotation may explain why the 10-day moving average of stocks up in volume is weakening, while the 10-day moving average of new highs is also falling. For now, however, up in volume and new high totals are beating stocks down in volume and new lows.  
这种板块轮换可能解释了为什么成交量上升的 10 天移动平均线正在减弱，而新高的 10 天移动平均线也在下降。然而，就目前而言，成交量的增加和新的高点正在击败股票的成交量和新低。


Market Gets Fed Minutes 市场获得 Fed Minutes
----------------------------------------


At 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Reserve released minutes of its most recent policy meeting. The major indexes hit session lows just before the headlines came out.  
美国东部时间下午 2 点，美联储公布了其最近的政策会议纪要。主要指数在头条新闻发布前触及盘中低点。


The Fed debated whether to cut rate by a quarter-point or half-point. The half-point prevailed because policymakers believed the Fed needed to catch up with some weakening economic data. Some Fed officials felt a quarter-point cut was justifiable even at the July meeting.  
美联储就是否降息四分之一或半个百分点进行了辩论。半个百分点占上风，因为政策制定者认为美联储需要赶上一些疲软的经济数据。一些美联储官员认为，即使在 7 月的会议上降息 25 个基点也是合理的。


On Wednesday, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan supported the September half-point rate cut, but [still sees risks](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2024/lkl241009) that could unleash sudden inflation.  
周三，达拉斯联储主席洛里·洛根 （Lorie Logan） 支持 9 月降息半个基点，但仍[认为可能](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2024/lkl241009)引发突然通胀的风险。


"These risks suggest the FOMC should not rush to reduce the fed-funds target to a 'normal' or 'neutral' level but rather should proceed gradually while monitoring the behavior of financial conditions, consumption, wages, and prices," Logan said. She is not currently a voting member of the Fed.  
“这些风险表明，联邦公开市场委员会不应急于将联邦基金目标下调至'正常'或'中性'水平，而应在监测金融状况、消费、工资和价格行为的同时逐步进行，”洛根说。她目前不是美联储的投票成员。


For stock market watchers, the next barometer reading for the Fed comes Thursday morning with the consumer price index for September. Economists [expect prices to inch up](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=591546&year=2024&lid=0#top) 0.1% from the previous month and 2.3% on an annual basis.  
对于股市观察者来说，美联储的下一个晴雨表读数将于周四上午公布 9 月消费者价格指数。经济学家[预计价格将比上个月小幅上涨](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=591546&year=2024&lid=0#top) 0.1%，同比上涨 2.3%。


Core prices excluding food and energy items are estimated to rise 0.2% and 3.2% annually. The September jobs report [showed wages ticking up](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-sp-500/), which may feed into the CPI report.  
不包括食品和能源项目的核心价格估计每年上涨 0.2% 和 3.2%。9 月就业报告[显示工资上涨](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-sp-500/)，这可能会纳入 CPI 报告。

The stock market climbed for the third time in the past four sessions — each time closing at session highs — as the S&P 500 made a record high and indexes continued making steadfast progress.


The S&P 500 rose 0.7% after rising from support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The Dow Jones Industrial Average led with a 1% increase and marked a new closing high.




The Nasdaq added 0.6% and is knocking on the door of its 18,327 high, reached on Sept. 26. As [Tuesday's Big Picture noted](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-nasdaq-dow-jones-sp500-nvidia-stock/), a move above that level would be a bullish sign for the market. The IBD 50, Investor's Business Daily's growth-stock index, rose more than 1%.


Today's stock market is looking firm despite geopolitical threats, election uncertainty, softening manufacturing activity, the eve of earnings season and a lurch in benchmark yields.


The 10-year Treasury yield Wednesday added three basis points to 4.065% for a sixth straight day of gains and a third straight session above the 4.0% level. The 32-basis-point jump over the past six sessions is the largest since February, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Yet, skies are clearing a bit for a stock market that chalked up multiple [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) in the past several weeks.


On Wednesday, the S&P's Sept. 5 distribution day was deleted because the index rose more than 5% from that day's close. That thinned the number of distribution days in the S&P to three. The Nasdaq is still a bit bloated with five distribution days.


High Stock Market Exposure Justified
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP100924.jpg)IBD raised its recommended exposure to 80%-100% on Sept. 19, and the current market behavior still supports that level of risk. While major indexes are behaving well, many important index funds are breaking out of cup-with-handle patterns or are in bullish chart formations.


Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)), up 1.1% Wednesday, is breaking out past a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) is about to break out of a flat base, although the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) is lagging. The consumer discretionary exchange traded fund is finding support at its 21-day line.


Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) is breaking out of a handle formation. Vanguard Megacap ETF ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)), iShares S&P 100 ETF ([OEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OEF)) rose to an all-time high Wednesday.


The iShares S&P Total U.S. ETF ([ITOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITOT)), which tracks the broad S&P 1500 index, also made a new high. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) is near new highs.


Smaller Stocks Lag As Sectors Rotate
------------------------------------


But smaller stocks are lagging. The Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark rose less than 0.3% and is 4.5% below its prior high. The S&P MidCap 400 is doing better. It rose 0.7% Wednesday and is less than 1% off new highs.


But sectors that had led the stock market in August and in some cases into September are rotating out of favor. Utilities Select Sector SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) closed below its 50-day moving average.


Consumer Staples SPDR ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) has spent a few days below the 50-day line. Health Care Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) is trying to get back above its 50-day average. All three show weak relative strength lines.


That sector rotation may explain why the 10-day moving average of stocks up in volume is weakening, while the 10-day moving average of new highs is also falling. For now, however, up in volume and new high totals are beating stocks down in volume and new lows.


Market Gets Fed Minutes
-----------------------


At 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Reserve released minutes of its most recent policy meeting. The major indexes hit session lows just before the headlines came out.


The Fed debated whether to cut rate by a quarter-point or half-point. The half-point prevailed because policymakers believed the Fed needed to catch up with some weakening economic data. Some Fed officials felt a quarter-point cut was justifiable even at the July meeting.


On Wednesday, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan supported the September half-point rate cut, but [still sees risks](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2024/lkl241009) that could unleash sudden inflation.


"These risks suggest the FOMC should not rush to reduce the fed-funds target to a 'normal' or 'neutral' level but rather should proceed gradually while monitoring the behavior of financial conditions, consumption, wages, and prices," Logan said. She is not currently a voting member of the Fed.


For stock market watchers, the next barometer reading for the Fed comes Thursday morning with the consumer price index for September. Economists [expect prices to inch up](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=591546&year=2024&lid=0#top) 0.1% from the previous month and 2.3% on an annual basis.


Core prices excluding food and energy items are estimated to rise 0.2% and 3.2% annually. The September jobs report [showed wages ticking up](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-sp-500/), which may feed into the CPI report.

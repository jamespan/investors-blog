  These Major Indexes Mark New Highs; Will The Nasdaq Follow Suit?

Does the stock market in the final quarter of 2024 belong to the New York Stock Exchange?


When you just look at Monday's action among the major indexes, it's hard to make this argument.


The Nasdaq composite, up almost 0.9% on Monday, exceeded a 0.5% rise by its peer, the NYSE composite index. Megacap techs enjoyed a bullish session; Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), tracking the Nasdaq's 100 largest nonfinancial companies, gained 0.8%.




Yet even though Monday's leadership mantle belonged to the Nasdaq, you might wonder whether the Nasdaq will follow the NYSE index in climbing to new high ground.


Stock Market Today
------------------


At 18,502.69, the Nasdaq composite has run ahead 1.7% since the fourth quarter started. The index hovers just 1% below the all-time high of 18,671.


Yet in the meantime, take a look at the NYSE composite (type in ticker zero-NYC at [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF)).


This index has notched either an all-time high or a closing high no fewer than 12 times since Sept. 17. Certainly, that's a big bundle of new highs over a period of less than a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, rising 0.5% to 43,065 on Monday, has also drummed up a bullish batch of new peaks over the same period.


On Monday, the large-cap S&P 500 also posted an all-time high of 5871, extending its year-to-date gain to 23%, with a 0.8% advance and its fourth gain in five sessions. The Russell 2000 rallied 0.6%, extending its gain from the Aug. 5 low of 1,993 to a solid 12.8%.


Volume fell mildly on both the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. Friday. The U.S. government bond market was closed for Columbus Day.

If you're a stock picker, you might just shrug your shoulders at Monday's action in the stock market. And that would be a valid reaction. If the earnings season produces pleasant surprises, it's reasonable to expect the Nasdaq composite to join its NYSE compatriot in new high territory.


But if you deploy a lot of capital in index and sector ETFs, then it may be useful to continue to track how the non-Nasdaq indexes fare on a day-to-day basis.


Early data showed homebuilder, semiconductor equipment, building maintenance, electric utility, managed health care, generic drug, financial software, building products and chipmaking stocks pacing the day's upside. Each of these industry groups rallied 1.6% or more on a price-weighted basis.


On the downside, discount and variety retail, drugstore chain, foreign bank, department store, specialty steel alloy and construction and mining machinery industries dropped 1.6% or more. Ship transport, oil and gas field services, toy and movie stocks also fell 1% or more as individual groups.


Institutional Selling Tracks Dissipate
--------------------------------------


Due to the Nasdaq's solid gains on Monday, two distribution days on the Market Pulse count got erased. Namely, the Sept. 17 stalling session and the Sept. 18 regular-type decline in higher volume got removed after the composite index rose 5% past the close in each of those sessions.


Hence, the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) now stands even at three each for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.


The Market Pulse also displays a large number of companies based on the New York Stock Exchange. Put another way, leadership in the stock market appears to be getting more evenly distributed. This is an overall positive for bull runs. You want to see the breadth of the stock market expand, not compress.


A New IPO And Stock Market leader
---------------------------------



**LandBridge** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)) has been one of the hottest new issues this year. Admittedly, there have not been many excellent IPOs trading this year.


The land owner, focused on developing energy-producing properties, went public at $17 a share June 28. Monday's action saw the NYSE-listed company likely succumb to profit taking after the stock tripled in price vs. its initial public offering price. While shares rallied 5.2% to 51.55 on Monday, the stock finished well off the day's high of 56.84.


The stock finished Monday a heady 34% above its rising [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Expect the 200-day line to start forming in mid-April.


On Monday, crude oil futures on the Nymex slid 2.3% to $73.83 a barrel.

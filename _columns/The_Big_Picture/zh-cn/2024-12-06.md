The stock market continued its upward march following a Goldilocks jobs report Friday, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged. A key inflation reading is now set for the coming week.  
周五发布金发姑娘就业报告后，股市继续上涨，尽管道琼斯工业平均指数落后。现在确定了下周的关键通胀数据。


The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high after ending the session up 0.8%. This helped it post a weekly gain of 3.3%. The tech-heavy index has now risen for the past three weeks in a row and sits clear of all its moving averages. It now holds a jaw-dropping gain of 32.3% for 2024.  
纳斯达克综合指数收盘上涨 0.8% 后创下历史新高。这帮助它实现了 3.3% 的周涨幅。这个以科技股为主的指数现在已经连续三周上涨，并避开了所有移动平均线。它现在在 2024 年保持着令人瞠目结舌的 32.3% 的收益。




The S&P 500 also closed at an all-time high level after popping 0.3% Friday, helping it to a weekly lift of 1%. The benchmark index pulled further away from its [21-day exponential average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and now holds an annualized gain of 27.7%.  
标准普尔 500 指数在周五上涨 0.3% 后也收于历史高位，帮助其每周上涨 1%。该基准指数进一步远离其 [21 天指数平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)，目前年化涨幅为 27.7%。


Decliners outstripped advancers on the New York Stock Exchange while the converse was true on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges.  
纽约证券交易所的下跌者超过了上涨者，而纳斯达克的跌幅则相反。两家交易所的成交量均有所下降。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood out for the wrong reasons after falling 0.3% Friday. It closed the week down 0.6% but remains near all-time high levels. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was the worst laggard on the much-watched index while **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) made the biggest gains.  
道琼斯工业平均指数在周五下跌 0.3% 后因错误的原因脱颖而出。本周收盘下跌 0.6%，但仍接近历史高位。**UnitedHealth** （[UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)） 是备受关注的指数中最落后的股票，而 **Amazon.com** （[AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)） 的涨幅最大。


Small caps also made progress, with the Russell 2000 ending the day up 0.5%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) was stronger, notching a 1.6% gain Friday.  
小盘股也取得了进展，罗素 2000 指数当天收盘上涨 0.5%。Innovator IBD 50 ETF （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 表现更强劲，周五上涨 1.6%。


It remains a good time to be buying stocks, but with the S&P 500 nearly 4% above its 50-day line — and the Nasdaq composite more than 6% above the benchmark — the risk of a pullback is increasing. This warrants extra caution.  
现在仍然是购买股票的好时机，但随着标准普尔 500 指数比其 50 天线高出近 4%，纳斯达克综合指数比基准高出 6% 以上，回调的风险正在增加。这需要格外小心。


Jobs Report Strong, Inflation Data Due就业报告强劲，通胀数据即将公布
-----------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP120624.jpg)Indexes took a stronger-than-expected jobs report in stride. The U.S. economy added 227,000 nonfarm jobs in November, well in excess of the 211,000 expected by economists. Despite this, the unemployment rate from October's 4.1% increased to 4.2% for November. This was seen as a Goldilocks report and is not expected to change the Fed's view on cutting rates at its Dec. 18 meeting.  
指数从容应对强于预期的就业报告。美国经济在 11 月增加了 227,000 个非农就业岗位，远高于经济学家预期的 211,000 个。尽管如此，失业率从 10 月份的 4.1% 上升到 11 月份的 4.2%。这被视为一份金发姑娘报告，预计不会改变美联储在 12 月 18 日会议上降息的看法。


A full slate of economic data is due in the coming week, with wholesale inventories data coming Monday, a third-quarter U.S. productivity reading due Tuesday and an import price index report coming Friday.  
下周将公布完整的经济数据，周一将公布批发库存数据，周二将公布美国第三季度生产率数据，周五将公布进口价格指数报告。


But inflation will be the biggest focus for the week. Most importantly, the Consumer Price Index reading is scheduled for Wednesday. Headline CPI is seen rising 2.7% year-over-year while core prices are expected to post an annualized rise of 3.2%. Producer Price Index data is due Thursday.  
但通货膨胀将是本周最大的焦点。最重要的是，消费者价格指数读数定于周三公布。整体 CPI 预计同比增长 2.7%，而核心价格预计将年化上涨 3.2%。生产者价格指数数据将于周四公布。


A number of [noteworthy earnings reports are also due](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/oracle-stock-probes-all-time-highs-software-giant-in-new-growth-phase/). These include software firms **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), along with retailers **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) and [Leaderboard stock](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)).  
一些[值得注意的收益报告也即将发布](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/oracle-stock-probes-all-time-highs-software-giant-in-new-growth-phase/)。其中包括软件公司**甲骨文** （[ORCL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL) 和 **MongoDB** （[MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)），以及零售商**梅西百货** （[M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)） 和[排行榜股票](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/)**Costco Wholesale** （[COST）。](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)

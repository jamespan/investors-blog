Major indexes remained wobbly Wednesday, although the stock market made a stand at a critical level that will help determine its course.  
周三，主要股指仍然震荡不定，尽管股市处于关键水平，这将有助于确定其发展方向。




A day after the stock market suffered its worst day since Aug. 5 and the worst start to any month since the spring of 2020, buyers remained absent. Yet, there was nothing like the wave of selling that hit Wall Street Tuesday.  
在股市遭遇自 8 月 5 日以来最糟糕的一天，也是自 2020 年春季以来任何一个月最糟糕的开局后，买家仍然缺席。然而，没有什么能比得上周二席卷华尔街的抛售浪潮了。


Indexes were higher until about 11 a.m. ET Wednesday, when sellers started to resurface. Then the market trended lower the rest of the session. The Nasdaq composite closed 0.3% lower and the S&P 500 fell 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, managed to edge up 0.1%.  
指数一直走高，直到美国东部时间周三上午 11 点左右，卖家开始重新出现。然后市场在其余交易日呈走低趋势。纳斯达克综合指数收盘下跌 0.3%，标准普尔 500 指数下跌 0.2%。然而，道琼斯工业平均指数小幅上涨 0.1%。


Market statistics also showed seller exhaustion, for now. Volume fell on both major exchanges. Declining stocks topped advancers by a 6-5 ratio on the Nasdaq but winners edged out losers on the New York Stock Exchange, according to FactSet.  
市场统计数据还显示，目前卖家已经筋疲力尽。两家主要交易所的成交量均有所下降。根据 FactSet 的数据，纳斯达克下跌的股票以 6：5 的比率领先于上涨的股票，但纽约证券交易所的赢家略高于输家。


While comparisons to the start of August seem apt, the market so far is not exactly echoing that rout. Back then, the Nasdaq fell 4.7% in two days. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq's two-day loss is not quite 3.6%.  
虽然与 8 月初的比较似乎很贴切，但到目前为止，市场并没有完全反映出那次暴跌。当时，纳斯达克指数在两天内下跌了 4.7%。周三，纳斯达克指数的两天跌幅还不到 3.6%。


The S&P 500 is down 2.3% this week, which is better than its 3.2% drop in the first two sessions of August. Granted, the early-August crunch took three days, in which the S&P 500 slid more than 6%. So it's a bit early to draw comparisons.  
标准普尔 500 指数本周下跌 2.3%，好于 8 月前两个交易日的 3.2% 跌幅。诚然，8 月初的紧缩持续了三天，其中标准普尔 500 指数下跌了 6% 以上。所以现在进行比较还为时过早。


Was Stock Market Due For Drop?股市应该下跌了吗？
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP090424.jpg)This week's losses present another talking point: The market's August rebound lacked strong volume, and indexes rolled over as soon as they hit significant levels. The S&P peaked last week when it neared prior highs. The Nasdaq could not penetrate the 18,000 price level. And the Dow backed off after making record highs Thursday and Friday.  
本周的下跌是另一个话题：市场 8 月份的反弹缺乏强劲的成交量，指数一旦触及重要水平就翻盘。标准普尔指数上周见顶，接近前高点。纳斯达克指数无法突破 18,000 点的价格水平。道琼斯指数在周四和周五创下历史新高后回落。


For now, the S&P 500 holds the key to the stock market's immediate outlook. It closed just above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) for a second straight day. A clear drop below that level would surely worsen the outlook for stocks.  
目前，标准普尔 500 指数是股市近期前景的关键。它连续第二天收于 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/)上方。明显跌破该水平肯定会使股市前景恶化。


Small caps face a test of their own as the Russell 2000 sits right at the 50-day moving average. The index fell 0.2% Wednesday.  
小盘股也面临着自己的考验，因为罗素 2000 指数正好位于 50 天移动平均线。该指数周三下跌 0.2%。


Picture Among Stock Market Leaders股市领导者中的合影
-------------------------------------------


Despite the fact that some are damaged, many growth leaders are holding up. The IBD 50 index rose 0.1% Wednesday and is finding support at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). Bellwethers such as **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) found support at the 50-day moving averages.  
尽管有些公司受损，但许多增长领导者仍在坚持。IBD 50 指数周三上涨 0.1%，并在其 [200 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/)处获得支撑。**Meta Platforms** （[META）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META) 和高**盛** （[GS）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS) 等领头羊在 50 天移动平均线找到支撑。


But **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), arguably the current market's most consequential stock, fell further below its 50-day line. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) [closed below its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-dow-jones-stock/) for the first time since Aug. 8. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are testing their 200-day lines, while Tesla faces resistance at its 50-day line.  
但**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 可以说是当前市场上最重要的股票，进一步跌破其 50 日线。**苹果** （[AAPL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL) 自 8 月 8 日以来首次[收于 50 日移动均线下方](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-dow-jones-stock/)。**Microsoft** （[MSFT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT) 和 **Alphabet** （[GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)） 正在测试其 200 天线，而特斯拉在其 50 天线面临阻力。


IBD continues to recommend 40% to 60% exposure to stocks, mindful that the important technology sector is under pressure. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) is down 4.8% so far this week, more than double most other S&P sectors.  
IBD 继续建议对股票进行 40% 至 60% 的敞口，因为考虑到重要的科技行业面临压力。科技精选行业 SPDR （[XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)） 本周迄今下跌了 4.8%，是大多数其他 S&P 行业的两倍多。


Economically sensitive sectors such as energy (down 3.8%), industrials (down 2.1%) and materials (off 2.7%) have also been hit this week.  
能源（下跌 3.8%）、工业（下跌 2.1%）和材料（下跌 2.7%）等经济敏感行业本周也受到打击。


Economic Data And The Market经济数据与市场
-----------------------------------


A couple of months ago, weak economic data was a boost for stocks. The thinking was that if the economy slows enough, the Fed will have more reason to start cutting interest rates. Now that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has essentially committed to a rate cut this month, the stock market's thinking has shifted: How big a rate cut? And is the economy slowing too much?  
几个月前，疲软的经济数据提振了股市。当时的想法是，如果经济放缓得足够多，美联储将有更多理由开始降息。既然美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔 （Jerome Powell） 基本上已经承诺本月降息，股市的思维已经发生了变化：降息幅度有多大？经济放缓是否太多了？


Weak manufacturing data sparked Tuesday's market sell-off, and on Wednesday a report showed the pool of job openings shrinking. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey report fell to the lowest level since January 2021, to 7.7 million in July, the Labor Department said. Economists [expected 8.1 million openings](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=596029&year=2024&lid=0#top).  
疲软的制造业数据引发了周二的市场抛售，周三的一份报告显示，职位空缺正在缩小。美国劳工部表示，职位空缺和劳动力流动率调查报告降至 2021 年 1 月以来的最低水平，7 月份降至 770 万。经济学家[预计有 810 万个职位空缺](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=596029&year=2024&lid=0#top)。


Factory orders, however, [climbed 5% in July](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=591593&year=2024&lid=0#top), rebounding from a decline in June and beating forecasts.  
然而，[7 月份工厂订单增长了 5%，](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=591593&year=2024&lid=0#top)从 6 月份的下降中反弹，并超过了预期。


Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says slowing economic growth boosts recession worries and rate-cut expectations. Rate cut expectations, in turn, favor a sector rotation from highly valued big techs toward nontech sectors.  
瑞讯银行高级分析师 Ipek Ozkardeskaya 表示，经济增长放缓加剧了对经济衰退的担忧和降息预期。反过来，降息预期有利于行业从高估值的大型科技公司转向非科技行业。

"But the expectation of (a) jumbo rate cut is bad for all stocks, regardless of their technology exposure," Ozkardeskaya said. "Bad news is bad news for everyone."  
“但 （a） 巨额降息的预期对所有股票都是不利的，无论它们的技术敞口如何，”Ozkardeskaya 说。“坏消息对每个人来说都是坏消息。”


Historically, September is the worst month for the stock market. The S&P falls an average of 0.7% and the Nasdaq an average of 0.9% in September, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. The Russell 2000 also falls 0.7% on average and the Dow 0.8%. However, the average losses are smaller during election years, from 0.4% to 0.5%.  
从历史上看，9 月是股市最糟糕的月份。根据 Stock Trader's Almanac 的数据，9 月份标准普尔平均下跌 0.7%，纳斯达克平均下跌 0.9%。罗素 2000 指数也平均下跌 0.7%，道琼斯指数平均下跌 0.8%。然而，选举年的平均损失较小，从 0.4% 到 0.5% 不等。


The longer-term outlook is more favorable. From Labor Day to the end of the year, the S&P rises 70% of the time and on average gains 2.8% over that period, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq climbs 68% of the time and climbs an average 3.4%. The Dow moves up 72% of the time and adds 2.7% on average.  
长期前景更为乐观。根据道琼斯市场数据，从劳动节到年底，标准普尔指数上涨 70% 的时间，在此期间平均上涨 2.8%。纳斯达克指数在 68% 的时间里上涨，平均上涨 3.4%。道琼斯指数在 72% 的时间里上涨，平均上涨 2.7%。

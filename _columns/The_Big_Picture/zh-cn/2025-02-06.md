The stock market closed mixed Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and small caps pausing ahead of Friday's employment report. **Amazon**.**com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) [dropped on disappointing guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-earnings-due-today-cloud-growth-is-in-focus-after-microsoft-google-stumbles/) after the close. The Dow Jones index fell 0.3%. The S&P 500 moved up 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%, both finishing near session highs.


Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 index dropped 0.4%, again failing to clear resistance at the 50-day moving average.




Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors climbed, with consumer staples and financials pacing the gainers. The energy sector was the biggest loser on the day, as West Texas Intermediate futures eased to $70.50 per barrel.


Volume was modestly lower on the Nasdaq, but slightly higher on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. Amid the session's mixed action, decliners slightly outnumbered advancers on the NYSE and the Nasdaq, [according to MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/market-data/us).


Due out Friday morning is the Labor Department's January jobs report. Economists expect a decent rise of 168,000 jobs, down from December's 256,000 increase. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.

S&P 500 Win Streak: What Investors Should Do Now
------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP020625-218x300.jpg)


IBD's recommended exposure level remains at 60%-to-80%, as the major stock indexes continue to trade in a narrow consolidation that goes back to late January. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to hold above their 50-day moving averages amid three-day win streaks.


The Dec. 30 distribution day fell off the counts of the Nasdaq and S&P 500. That takes their respective counts to six and three over the last 25 trading sessions.


Investors should continue to utilize diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), although many breakouts in the past few weeks have given growth investors good opportunities.


It's important to monitor positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules, like a sharp break of the 10-week moving average.


Fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing, which can lead to big gap-downs, so ensure you have a sufficient profit cushion to withstand those potential declines. On the upside, take at least some profits at the 20%-25% profit level. That's a sure way of compounding gains over the long term.


If the market is able to extend its ongoing rebound, then be on the lookout for stocks breaking out past correct buy points.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured nine new stocks, notably **Dave** ([DAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAVE)), which topped a 108.50 cup-base buy point. And the Near Pivot list remains loaded with 21 ideas.

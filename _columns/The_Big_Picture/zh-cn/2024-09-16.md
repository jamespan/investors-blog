  Dow Jones, Midcaps Lead Stock Market Gains; What This Index's New High Means For Traders

A somewhat broad stock market rally on Monday helped fortify the argument that investors should stay invested ahead of a pivotal meeting on U.S. interest rates.




The S&P 500 strutted its way to a sixth straight advance. Yet its 0.1% gain on Monday was trifling compared with advances of nearly 0.6% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund.


The Russell 2000 rose 0.3% for its fourth up day in a row.


Compared with the S&P 500, however, the Nasdaq composite felt a bigger thorn in its side.


Sharp declines in the semiconductor field dragged on the market-cap-weighted Nasdaq, pushing it down 0.5%. That prevented the Nasdaq from joining the S&P 500 in a sixth up day in a row.


On the bright side, the Nasdaq respected its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and finished well in the upper half of its intraday trading range.


Stock Market Today

A good stock market reveals both key indexes and leading stocks spending their days and weeks above their 50-day lines, not below.


Nasdaq volume fell less than 3% to 4.68 billion shares, according to Dow Jones Data. So, the Nasdaq composite avoided a fresh distribution day.


On the NYSE, turnover dipped less than 2% lower vs. Friday to 3.44 billion.


The iShares Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) lost 1.3%. It's trading in an increasingly narrow space between the 50- and 200-day moving averages. VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) matched that drop.


Meanwhile, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund also outperformed the Nasdaq with a 0.7% gain to 176.28. The fund also underscored the decent strength of the current stock market by posting a new high.


When an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 does well, take that as a sign that institutions are putting more money to work outside of technology, which for the past few years has done the heavy lifting for large-cap indexes.


On Monday, more than 40 of [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) advanced 1% or more, early data showed. Utility, bank, travel, energy, insurance and retail dominated this list. Among the groups related to tech, only tech services, internet networking and design software made the cut.


A Meandering Nasdaq?
--------------------


Going back to the Nasdaq, a closer look at its daily chart reveals the composite index trading both above and below its own 50-day moving average for weeks at a time since the July peak.



In other words, the trend in price has actually been weaker compared with the smooth bullish runs seen from mid-April through the beginning of June.


Stock market action over the past few months has likely taken into consideration the growing concern that the Federal Reserve has perhaps kept the cost of money at an elevated level for too long. Some talking heads have repeatedly said the Fed — which in 2021 was too late in beginning to remove its hugely accommodative monetary policy to support the Covid-19-battered economy — is now behind the curve in loosening its tight policy to avoid a recession.

Here Comes The Fed Meeting
--------------------------


This question will burn more brightly each day in the stock market until Wednesday afternoon, when the two-day Federal Reserve meeting ends and Chair Jerome Powell announces what the bank will do about the fed funds rate, which has been in the [5.25%-5.50% range](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm) for more than a year.


At the stock market close, the CME FedWatch survey of bond traders showed a 65% probability that the Fed will cut the fed funds rate by half a percentage point to a 4.75%-5% range on Wednesday. Last week, the probability stood at 30%. CME also highlights only a 30% chance that the U.S. central bank will trim short-term rates by a quarter point.


"Ultimately, though, the 25 bps (basis points) vs 50 bps decision is less important than the fact Wednesday will mark the beginning of the cutting cycle, with the Fed likely signaling that a string of rate cuts is in the pipeline," Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, told IBD via email.


"Although the U.S. labor market is clearly slowing, the continued strength of household and corporate balance sheets suggests that there is nothing broken about the U.S. economy that a sequence of Fed cuts cannot fix," Shah added. "Risks around the FOMC forecast are elevated, but recession risk remains low."


Meanwhile, the [homepage of MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) showed 242 stocks rising in above-average volume while only 105 fell in fierce turnover. Plus, a screen showed eight stocks breaking out on Monday and 17 near a buy point.

Going Beneath The Stock Market Hood
-----------------------------------


Despite the poor showing by the Nasdaq, not all techs did badly. Some leading names in the enterprise software industry group flourished.



[Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) rose 1.5% and marked a new high of 897.99, good for a fifth gain in six sessions. Earnings at the leader in digital transformation for large organizations and businesses have grown 49%, 36%, 44% and 32% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The megacap is getting extended from a new [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) showing an 850.33 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


ServiceNow is up 26% year to date. The Santa Clara, Calif., firm has also rallied 165% from its 2022 bear-market low. The S&P 500 has advanced 61% from its 2022 low of 3,491.


Other companies to watch in the enterprise software space? **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)).


Oracle is acting bullishly after an earnings gap-up last week. Wall Street sees Oracle's earnings rising 13% in fiscal 2025 (ending in May that year) to $6.28 a share, then adding 14% in fiscal 2026.

The stock market was punched lower as the bears took a big bite out of tech stocks. Wednesday's conclusion of the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and the post-event musings of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, now look key to the health of the current market.




The Nasdaq composite tumbled 1.3% and is now down 1.2% for the week so far. The index now sits more than 2% below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). And while that retains a strong gain for the year so far, the composite is on track to end July down 3.3% with just one trading day remaining.


The S&P 500 fell 0.5% Tuesday and is now nursing a weekly decline of 0.4%. It closed a hair below its 50-day line as it makes a fresh test of that critical level. The benchmark index is down 0.4% so far this month.


More Distribution, But A Ray Of Sunshine
----------------------------------------


Despite the negative action at the index level, advancers actually held a near 2-1 advantage on decliners on the New York Stock Exchange. In contrast, decliners held a slight edge on advancers on the Nasdaq. Nevertheless, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite added [a distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) amid higher volume.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP073024-209x300.jpg)The broader stock market rotation was illustrated by the fact that the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) rose 0.5% today. It's on track for an eye-catching monthly gain of 4% and sits clear of all its major and short-term moving averages.


Investors looking for an added ray of sunshine would find it at the number of issues at 52-week highs vs. new lows. There were 218 issues reaching fresh heights on the NYSE vs. just 25 plumbing depths not seen in at least a year.


Big caps also had a reason to smile, for the Dow Jones Industrial Average turned in a gain of 0.5%. The index is also kicking sand in the faces of the S&P and Nasdaq with a monthly gain so far of 4.2%. Some gains could diminish after **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) posted disappointing results after the close and fell more than 6%.


**Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) fared best in the Dow during the regular session, contributing more than 125 of the Dow's 203-point gain.


Small caps managed to squeeze out a gain, with the Russell 2000 ending the session up 0.4%. The same could not be said for growth stocks, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund falling 0.9%. The midcap S&P 400 was modestly positive, rising 0.3% Tuesday.


There should be further clarity on the direction of the current uptrend at this time Wednesday. Given the uncertainty surrounding the stock market at the moment, we are holding our recommended exposure level at the 40%-60% level.


Fed Meeting Kicks Off; Job Openings Fall
----------------------------------------


Investors have no shortage of economic data this week, with Tuesday seeing the release of the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Job postings fell to 8.18 million in June from the upwardly revised 8.23 million in May, the Labor Department reported. This was slightly above the consensus range for 7.8 million to 8.1 million, according to Econoday. The main release comes Friday, though, when the July jobs report drops.


Meanwhile, central bankers gathered for the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting Tuesday. The event concludes tomorrow, and investors will be looking for details on future interest rate policy. This will come both from the post-meeting statement and from Powell's media conference.


[The CME FedWatch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) has the likelihood of rates holding steady during this week's meeting at 96%. It then suggests there is an 86% likelihood of a 25-basis-point cut during the September meeting. It also rates a 50-basis-point cut as possible, though the 14% likelihood means it remains an outside bet.


Treasury yields ended the day lower. The much-watched 10-year Treasury note yield fell four basis points to 4.14%, while the two-year dipped three basis points to 4.36%.

Some Stock Market Groups Struggle
---------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended mixed Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/), though there was a slight positive bias. Energy and financials were the strongest performers, while technology lagged the most by far.



Once again, traders looking for more insight into the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) could get it from the relative performance of the 197 Investor's Business Daily industry groups.Â Internet network firms, tire makers, food wholesalers and trucking firms were among the strongest performers.


On the flip side, cleaning products makers, computer hardware plays, electronic parts makers and auto stocks all lagged. Fabless chip stocks also had a tough time, with AI darling **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) losing ground on its 50-day line amid a 7% pounding.


While Nvidia stock [remains up 109.5% for the year so far](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-nvidia-nvda.htm), it has fallen an eye-watering 26.3% from its June high and closed Tuesday at the lowest level since May 24. Nvidia is a member of the [prestigious IBD Leaderboard list of top stocks](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/), but the position is hedged right now.

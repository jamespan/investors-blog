The stock market closed at session lows Thursday, as the major stock indexes struggled in the wake of Wednesday's Federal Reserve-fueled plunge.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average cut gains to less than 0.1%, narrowly breaking a 10-day losing streak. The S&P 500 reversed lower 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite also gave up solid gains to fall 0.1%, as the small cap Russell 2000 index lost 0.5%.




Only four of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with utilities and financials rising the most. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.57%. That's its highest level since May 29, per Dow Jones Market Data. The real estate and materials sectors were the day's biggest losers.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's busy session.


Up next, Wall Street will shift its attention to Friday's personal income and outlays report. That report includes the core PCE price index, which is the Federal Reserve's favored inflation reading. The core PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2% for the month of November, with an annual increase of 2.9%, per Econoday.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP121924-213x300.jpg)


Following Wednesday's stock market plunge, IBD reduced its recommended exposure level to 60%-80%. And Thursday saw more bearish action, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gave up solid gains to close lower and at session lows.


Meanwhile, the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, tumbled nearly 13% to 24.09. Wednesday's surge was a sure sign of fear on Wall Street.


Amid the recent weakness, investors should be utilizing diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). It's important to monitor positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured no new stocks, while the Near Pivot list has dwindled to only one, **Adtalem Global Education** ([ATGE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATGE)). That's a signal that new breakouts could be days away. If the market continues to stabilize, then be on the lookout for stocks approaching new buy points.

Stocks Market Leaders: Alphabet, Meta, TSMC
-------------------------------------------


Stock market leaders to watch include **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)).



Google parent Alphabet moved up 0.1% after trimming a 2.4% gain. Shares are back in the buy range from a cup-with-handle's 182.49 buy point, per [IBD MarketSurge chart analysis.](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) But it's risky to buy as a stock trends lower.


Shares of Meta closed further below their flat base's 602.95 buy point, after a 0.3% decline. Wait for a decisive retake of that entry before considering a new purchase of shares.


Taiwan Semiconductor, better known as TSMC, closed right at its 50-day line, about 5% away from a 205.63 cup-with-handle buy point.

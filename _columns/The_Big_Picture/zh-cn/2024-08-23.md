The stock market rallied after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated interest rate cuts are imminent. Now **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) earnings and critical inflation data loom.




The Nasdaq composite fared best among the major indexes Friday, jumping 1.5%. This actually outstripped its weekly gain of 1.4%. It ended the week back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) but remains well below recent highs. The tech-heavy index is now up 19.1% for the year.


The S&P 500 rose 1.2% for the day but notched a better weekly gain of 1.5%. It sits clear of its short-term and major moving averages and is getting close to all-time high levels. Its year-to-date gain has risen to 18.1%. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund made a new closing high.


Advancers led decliners almost 8-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was higher for both, a bullish sign.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished only slightly behind the other major indexes. It notched a 1.1% lift Friday, which accounted for the bulk of its 1.3% weekly gain.


**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) fared the best, while **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) were the only Dow components to close lower.


Small caps gave the bears the biggest spanking though, with the Russell 2000 rising 3.2%. Growth stocks also had a strong session, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 1.7% Friday.


Powell Comments Boost Stocks; Nvidia Earnings Loom
--------------------------------------------------


Fed Chair Powell unlocked a stock market rally after he made dovish comments in his long-awaited speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium Friday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP082324.jpg)"The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks," he said.


[The CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) rates the chance of a cut at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting as a virtual certainty, with a 25-basis-point cut seen as 63.5% likely and a 50-basis-point cut rated as a 36.5% likelihood.


While the markets responded positively to Powell's comments, the Nasdaq remains below the 18,000 level. As a result, Investor's Business Daily is holding its recommended exposure level in the 60% to 80% range. But with the current bullish action it makes sense to be at the top end of this range.


Though Powell's speech has cleared up the picture to a significant degree, economic data remains crucial. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is due to offer inflation data Friday, and should be the headline event of the week. Other noteworthy readings include durable-goods orders data on Monday and The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence report on Tuesday.


And while earnings season has slowed substantially, a major report comes late Wednesday when artificial intelligence behemoth and [Leaderboard stock](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) posts results. Other noteworthy firms [reporting in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-nvidia-nvda-birkenstock/) include **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)), **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)).


Stock Market Groups: Regional Banks Deposit Gains
-------------------------------------------------


Each of the [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday in positive territory](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Real estate and consumer discretionary were the strongest areas while utilities and consumer staples, defensive areas, made the slimmest gains. Underscoring real estate's strength, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF ([XHB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XHB)) notched a new closing high.



Once again, the relative performance of the 197 IBD industry groups gave a deeper insight into the action on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


It was a strong day for home furnishings plays, solar stocks, newspapers and wood products firms. Regional banking groups also outperformed, with Midwest banks faring best of all among this cadre.


Only a handful of groups closed in negative territory. These included auto parts plays, wholesale drug companies and diversified medical stocks.


The financial software group also lagged on a day that group heavyweight **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) flashed a sell signal by undercutting the 50-day line. Intuit served up a disappointing outlook for the current quarter.

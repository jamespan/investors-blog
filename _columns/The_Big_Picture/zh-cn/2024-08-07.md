  Stock Market Fades Badly As Dow Jones Index Turns Back At This Critical Level

The stock market reversed lower Wednesday, leaving a rebound in doubt but a rally attempt remains in play.




The Nasdaq composite was up as much as 2.1% in morning trading but closed nearly 1.1% lower. The S&P 500 went from a 1.7% rally to a loss of 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6%.


While a one-day reversal doesn't doom the market's rally attempt, the way it happened was disheartening. The Dow met resistance at its 50-day moving average for a second straight day. The Russell 2000, down 1.4% Wednesday, met resistance at its own 50-day line. And other important indexes displayed similar action.


Among exchange traded funds, Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) met resistance at the 50-day line for a second straight day. Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) rose near its 200-day moving average before it turned lower.


Volume was little changed from Tuesday's totals. But breadth was bearish, with declining stocks over advancers by about 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq and nearly 7-to-5 on the New York Stock Exchange, according to FactSet.


While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showed poor action, both held above their Tuesday lows. That was [the first day of a rally attempt](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-snaps-3-session-losing-streak-gains-fade-risks-remain-palantir-earnings/). As long as indexes stay above those levels, the stock market has a chance at a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


Stock Market Volatility
-----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP080724_2.jpg)Just like a major earthquake is followed by a series of aftershocks, the stock market's [Aug. 1-5 rout was severe enough](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-vertical-violation/) that it could leave the market unsettled for weeks. Already, index swings have been unusually wide.


The S&P 500's and Nasdaq's intraday spreads have been above 2% for three straight days. That's the longest stretch since March 2023, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


And August is starting out badly. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials just had their worst five-day start to any month since January 2016. For the Nasdaq, it's the worst start for any month since August 2011.


The stock market doesn't have much to work with as it attempts to rally.


The Nasdaq advance-decline line is at its lowest point in more than 12 months. But the NYSE short-term overbought-oversold oscillator — a tool in [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) — still has not reached oversold levels. However, the Nasdaq oscillator is at the most oversold level since April, when the index bottomed.


One hopeful sign in July was the high number of [stocks making 52-week highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-aug-06-2024/) as a rotation out of growth and into value, while other stocks unfolded. But that trend has reversed, with new lows outnumbering new highs this week.


Growth stocks still struggle. The IBD 50 reversed lower, but to its credit it lost less than 0.1%.


Japan Impacts U.S. Markets
--------------------------


U.S. investors don't normally watch the Tokyo stock market much, but now it's a factor. The Nikkei 225 index crashed more than 12% Monday after the Bank of Japan lifted its policy interest rate to 0.25% on July 31 and a top official made hawkish comments.


That sent the yen higher, and caused a knock-on effect on U.S. stocks because of what's known as the carry trade. That's a strategy in which investors borrow at super-low Japanese interest rates to purchase U.S. equities.


On Wednesday, a Japan central bank official [tempered expectations of rate hikes](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/boj-wont-raise-rates-when-markets-are-unstable-deputy-gov-says-6f4bf962?mod=economy_lead_story). On Wednesday, the Nikkei 225 rose 1.2%, and jumped a total 11.5% over the last two trading days. It's the best two-day gain since March 25, 2020.


Also, the iShares MSCI Japan ETF ([EWJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWJ)) bounced 1.7% but spent a fourth straight day below the 200-day moving average.

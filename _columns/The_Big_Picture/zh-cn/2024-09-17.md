Early gains faded in the stock market Tuesday as investors weighed mixed retail sales and the start of the two-day Federal Reserve meeting.




Overall, [retail sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-august-fed-meeting-rate-cut-sp-500/) rose 0.1% in August, better than the consensus estimate for a decline of 0.3%. Excluding autos, sales also rose 0.1%, but that was below the 0.3% consensus forecast.


The Fed policy statement is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Market expectations are for the Fed to cut its key lending rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%. But it's far from a sure thing. As of 4 p.m. ET, fed funds futures put the chances of a 50-basis-point cut at 63%.


Just after the stock market close, the 10-year yield was trading around 3.64%, up two basis points. The yield hit a low of 3.60%, the lowest since June 2023, as the Fed gets ready to embark on a rate-cutting campaign.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Russell 2000 index extended its winning streak to five sessions but failed to hold the 2,200 level. The small-cap index rallied surged 1.8% early and came close to taking out its Aug. 26 high. But the gain faded to 0.7% by the close.

The S&P 500 hit an all-time high early in the session, but the index pared a 0.7% gain and closed fractionally higher. The [stalling action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) in higher volume qualified as a distribution day, raising the S&P 500's count to four.


The Nasdaq composite also showed stalling action in the stock market today after the index shaved a 1.1% morning gain to 0.2% in higher volume.


Winners beat losers on both main exchanges by less than 2-to-1.


IBD's recommended invested percentage stays at 60%-80%. If you're closer to 80%, there's nothing wrong with managing risk and trimming some of your winners ahead of Wednesday's Fed decision.


Tuesday's weakness came after the Nasdaq turned in a strong showing Monday, cutting a 1.1% intraday loss to 0.5% by the close. Buyers pushed the Nasdaq off lows even as semiconductor stocks underperformed. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) slumped 1.3% Monday as **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) and **Arm Holding** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) lagged in the Nasdaq 100.


A few Nasdaq-listed biotechs outperformed Tuesday. Inside the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), **Exelixis** ([EXEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXEL)) added 0.5% and closed just above a 27.53 buy point. Meanwhile, **Alnylam Pharmaceuticals** ([ALNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALNY)) continued to get support at its 10-week moving average. Shares surged in late June, when its experimental drug vutrisiran reduced deaths and cardiovascular events by a third in patients with a rare heart disease.


Elsewhere, [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) firm **Rhythm Pharmaceuticals** ([RYTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYTM)) jumped 7% and reclaimed a 50.22 buy point after the stock tried to clear a cup-with-handle base early last week.


After an all-time closing high Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed fractionally lower. The blue-chip index hit another all-time high early Tuesday, helped by strong starts for **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Intel shares closed off highs but still rallied nearly 3% after the company announced a [big chip deal](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-stock-foundry-plans-amazon-ai-deal-federal-funding/) with **Amazon.com**'s ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Web Services cloud unit in which Intel will design and produce at least two different AI chips.


Microsoft jumped more than 2% early in the session after the company raised its dividend by 10% and also announced a new $60 billion share buyback program. But the gain faded to 0.9% by the close.


Financials Join The Party
-------------------------


Despite Tuesday's fade, the stock market continues to show signs of underlying strength. Market breadth has improved as leadership has expanded well beyond the Magnificent 7 stocks. Financial stocks are acting much better in the stock market, including [several stocks in the Finance-Investment Bank/Brokers group](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/interactive-brokers-ibkr-investment-banks/).


Among online brokers, **Robinhood** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)) extended its winning streak to seven sessions. It's now just past the 5% buy zone from a 21.54 handle entry. **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)), meanwhile, rallied 2.5% and is still in the buy zone from a 128.98 handle entry.


Among investment banks, **Evercore** ([EVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVR)) is near the top of an eight-week consolidation. Same with group peer **Moelis** ([MC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MC)) and **Piper Sandler** ([PIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PIPR)).


In the investment management group, **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)) extended gains and followed through after Monday's breakout over a 124.20 entry. KKR, discussed in [today's IBD 50 Stocks to Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/kkr-stock-private-equity-firm/), is still in the 5% buy zone.

If the stock market were a tasty gourmet fruitcake, then no matter how you cut into today's action, you found fruit.


From the macro-level vantage point of broad stock market averages to the micro-level view of searching for intrepid midcap growth stocks, Tuesday's action gave plenty of layers of bullish action that kicked off a new era of U.S. politics and economic policy under President Donald John Trump's second term.




Bulls roared back on Wall Street following the three-day MLK Jr. national holiday. The Nasdaq composite, which made double-digit gains the past two years, rose 0.6%. Some of the megacap techs failed to join the advance. Yet, the Nasdaq 100 also rose 0.6%. But the impressive strength across additional sectors deserves notice as the S&P 500 moved 0.9% higher and the small-cap Russell 2000 roared 1.9% higher.

Stock Market Today
------------------



The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2% and closed back above its 50-day moving average. The Russell 2000 has been the weakest index among the popular stock market averages since the end of the 2022 bear market.


Since Halloween of 2022, the popular small-cap gauge has risen all of 28.8%. That's still a healthy return, but nothing like what the large caps have achieved.


Over the same time frame, the S&P 500 has driven 60% higher; the Nasdaq composite has trampled all over the bears with an 88.6% advance.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP012125--201x300.jpg)In Tuesday's action, while the Russell index has now notched a sixth straight gain and an energetic bounce off its still-rising 200-day moving average, it still has yet to run back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), perhaps an even more critical technical level for active stock market investors than the 200-day line. Yet, practically all of the other major equity indexes on Tuesday finished bullishly above their 50-day lines.


Such chart action indicates that investors large and small are more anxious to accumulate stock positions lately, not dump them.


The S&P MidCap 400 rolled 1.6% higher for its sixth straight gain. The S&P 400 also finished above its 50-day moving average for the second straight trading day.


Meanwhile, stock market screens have been flashing green-light signals to go long as well.


Two Important Screens
---------------------


Take a peek at the [homepage of MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF&_gl=1*1jxp0fq*_gcl_au*NjMwMTgyMTM0LjE3Mjk4NjEzMTc.*_ga*MTE2NDI0NTk5LjE3MzUwMDgyODA.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNzEyMzU3Ni4zNS4xLjE3MzcxMjM1ODcuNDkuMC4w), which showcases the quick results of two important screens built into the premium research tool. The homepage highlighted 14 stock breakouts on Tuesday and 76 companies trading near a pivot point, which is another term for a buy point.


Both figures on a single day point to unusually fierce demand for growth stocks. Plus, Tuesday's action was not an outlier.


In fact, in the prior six trading sessions, the number of stocks hitting the breakout screen totaled no fewer than 42 names. Over the same time frame, on average 33 companies hit the "Near Pivot" screen.


For these reasons, IBD made the decision after the stock market close Tuesday to bump up recommended exposure to 80%-100% from 60%-80%. Equity index ETF traders, meanwhile, could consider going back to fully invested in their target funds allocated toward equities.


It's worth addressing why IBD has made this upgrade in the outlook amid what looks like a [plethora of distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).

When Distribution Days Proliferate
----------------------------------


As the Market Pulse shows, the Nasdaq still hosts seven clear days of pronounced institutional selling over a rolling 25-session time frame. Many of these won't fall off the count for days, if not weeks. The Nasdaq also needs to rally at least past 20,276 to begin knocking off distribution days due to index gains.


However, history has shown that the market can maintain a good uptrend even though the distribution count has gotten to elevated levels.


Consider May 31, 2023. At that point, the S&P 500 had posted seven distribution days, including a stalling day. Just two weeks earlier, IBD made an outlook change from "Uptrend under pressure" to "Uptrend resumes."



However, a historical chart shows that, at the time, the S&P 500 held firmly above the 50-day and 200-day lines. The large-cap index went on to rally nearly 500 points until the end of July, further demonstrating that the downtrend that began with a Jan. 4, 2022, peak of 4,818 had ended.


On Tuesday, advancers trumped decliners by more than 4-to-1 on the NYSE, according to FactSet. On the Nasdaq, risers outmatched decliners by a 12-to-5 margin.


MarketSurge, meanwhile, also showed that in the IBD stock market database, 725 stocks rallied in above-average turnover while just 96 issues fell in heavy volume.


Looking at the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/full), as many as 12 members rose 5% or more on the day.


Midcaps Add Stock Market Magic
------------------------------


They included **Guardant Health** ([GH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GH)), which soared to a 52-week high of 45.68 after zooming ahead 23%. A weekly chart highlights how the cancer diagnostics company had initially stumbled on a first breakout attempt past a cup with a 37.04 entry.


Arguably, GH also formed a handle in the pattern that offered a 33.64 buy point. Either way, the midcap growth stock sold off three weeks in a row, shaking out new buyers at those entries. By falling to as low as 29.91, Guardant also triggered the [7% loss stop sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-growth-stock-golden-sell-rule-when-take-losses-fast/), still the most important rule of investing.



Yet the weekly chart shows bulls stepping in to support the stock at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) during the week ended Jan. 3.


Guardant's test of the 10-week line, by itself, did not trigger an [IBD-style buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


However, the positive reversal showed that investors were clearly not throwing in the towel. And Guardant eventually retook the prior buy points without completing a new base.

The stock market ended a strong week on a high note Friday ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump. The latest report from **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) also looms as earnings season intensifies.


The Nasdaq composite was strong all day, ending the session up 1.5%. It pulled further clear of the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and is above its short-term moving averages to boot. It turned in a weekly gain of 2.5% and now holds a gain of 1.7% for the month. Nevertheless, it remains nearly 3% off its all-time high.




The S&P 500 closed just below the 6,000 level, but still notched a strong gain of 1% Friday. Importantly, it managed to mount its 50-day line, a bullish sign. It snapped a two-week losing streak as it rose 2.9% this week. The benchmark index is now up 2% for the year so far.


Advancers led decliners by less than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on both exchanges.


The fact the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund lagged the market cap-weighted index was noteworthy. It booked a daily gain of 0.5% and sits just shy of its 50-day line.


Nvidia Boosts Dow Jones, Small Caps Lag
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP011725.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also lifted by the animal spirits running free Friday. But it failed to overcome resistance at its 50-day moving average despite a 0.8% lift. [Leaderboard stock](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) were the best performers here as Big Tech flexed its muscles.


Small caps lagged behind though, with the Russell 2000 ending well off session highs as it notched a gain of 0.4%. Its bounce this week from the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rule-no-21-use-200-day-line-to-spot-overheating/) is a crumb of comfort though. Growth stocks fared a bit better, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rising 0.6%.


With the S&P 500 reclaiming its 50-day line with gusto, and the Nasdaq extending gains, the stock market is looking more bullish. Leading stocks are also behaving well.


Because of this, Investor's Business Daily is raising its recommended exposure level to the 60%-to-80% level. Investors should take care to raise their exposure in a measured fashion and not to purchase equities that are extended from entries.


Stocks Rally Into Trump Inauguration, Netflix Earnings Next
-----------------------------------------------------------


Stocks in general have been rallying since Wednesday's consumer price index report showed core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, came in cooler than economists expected.


Economic data is light in the coming week, with the stock market being closed Monday for Martin Luther King Day as the inauguration of soon-to-be President Donald Trump also takes place. There will be a light sprinkling, with leading U.S. economic indicators dropping Wednesday and S&P flash services and the Purchasing Managers' Index due Friday. Weekly jobless claims drop Thursday, which remain important due to their impact on Fed policy.


Another key catalyst for recent gains has been a strong start to earnings season, with the likes of big banks including **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) serving up sunny reports.


More [earnings are due in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/dow-jones-sp500-netflix-schwab-earnings/), with **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) arguably headlining when it reports late Tuesday. Other noteworthy firms set to release quarterly updates include insurance giant **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)).

Tesla Stock Pops, Boosts This Stock Market Group
------------------------------------------------


Nearly all of the [S&P 500 sectors made gains on Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Consumer discretionary and technology were the strongest areas. Only real estate, which slipped fractionally, and health care ended the day lower.



Investors could get a more nuanced look at action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by studying the relative performance of IBD's 197 industry groups.


There was a clear bias to the upside, with fabless semiconductor stocks, chipmakers, fiber-optics companies, department stores, educational software firms and nonalcoholic beverage stocks all faring particularly well.


Automakers were the strongest group, however, bolstered by a 3.1% gain for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). The electric vehicle play now sits nearly 12% above its 50-day moving average.


On the flip side, integrated computer systems companies, diversified medical plays, financial software stocks and trucking firms all lagged.

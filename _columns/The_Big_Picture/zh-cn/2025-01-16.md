  S&P 500, Nasdaq At Key Levels; 3 Stock Market Leaders In Or Near Buy Zones

The stock market finished lower Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite closing at key levels. But despite the session's weakness, there were plenty of new breakouts among leading growth stocks.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped almost 0.2%, snapping a three-day win streak, while the S&P 500 eased 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 0.9% to give back part of Wednesday's rally. And the small-cap Russell 2000 index outperformed with a gain of nearly 0.2%.




Despite the losses on the major indexes, eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with utilities and real estate pacing the gainers. The technology, communication services and consumer discretionary sectors were the day's losers.


Also, the losses weren't broad-based as [more stocks rose than fell](https://www.marketwatch.com/market-data/us) on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. Among exchange traded funds, First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) was up 0.3%, indicating there was more selling in the Nasdaq big caps. And the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF rallied 0.8%.


Volume was slightly lower on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That means the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both avoid new distribution days, though both indexes still have a worrisome number of higher-volume declines over the past several weeks. Lastly, the Dec. 9 distribution day on both indexes dropped off the count due to the passage of time.

S&P 500 At Key Level: What Investors Should Do Now
--------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP011625.jpg)Wednesday's rally caused IBD to raise its recommended exposure level to 40%-60% from 20%-40%. But with the S&P 500 facing resistance at its 50-day line, it's important to hold off on aggressively raising exposure.


Another reason to remain diligent is the elevated number of distribution days over the past several weeks. Also, the S&P and Nasdaq have yet to break their patterns of lower highs and lower lows.


Amid this week's strength, investors should continue to utilize diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). It's important to monitor positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules, especially if the major indexes again weaken.


If the market is able to extend its ongoing rebound, then be on the lookout for stocks breaking out past correct buy points. And more stocks are poised to move higher.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured seven new stocks, notably **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), which topped a 116.43 buy point. And the Near Pivot list has increased to 35 stock ideas. **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) is approaching a 136.24 buy point in a flat base.

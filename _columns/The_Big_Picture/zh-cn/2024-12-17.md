Sellers came into the stock market Tuesday as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway. Several growth stocks came under heavy selling pressure again, although the signals were hard to find.  


The Russell 2000 fared the worst with a decline of 1.2%. The small-cap index closed just above its 50-day moving average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its losing streak to nine sessions and closed just below its 50-day line.  




The last time the Dow Jones fell for nine straight sessions was in 1978, according to Dow Jones data. **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) weighed on the blue-chip index with a loss of more than 3%. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) also lagged with losses of nearly 2%.  


Selling also continued in the broad-based New York Stock Exchange composite index, which fell nearly 0.6% and marked its eighth loss in nine trading sessions. The NYSE composite fell further below its 50-day moving average after giving up the support level late last week.  


But sell signals were few and far between among top growth stocks. **Credo Technology** ([CRDO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRDO)) crashed nearly 10% in the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), but only closed slightly below its 10-day moving average. **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) slumped nearly 4%, but after two straight bullish up sessions in a row, the decline didn't look too bad. Broadcom held inside of Monday's range and closed near its session high.  


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund, a good proxy for growth stocks, pared an intraday loss of nearly 3% to 1% by the close.  


**T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)), however, did flash a sell signal with a sharp break of its 50-day line. Shares slumped 3.8% in heavy volume.  


Stock Market Bulls Encouraged By Tamer Selling
----------------------------------------------


Still, stock market bulls were at least partly encouraged by tamer selling in the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500, which edged lower by 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Both indexes suffered mild distribution days, raising the count to three on the Nasdaq and four on the S&P 500. It's not a count that raises a major red flag, but distribution days are worth monitoring because when they start to cluster, it almost always causes problems for a stock market uptrend.

Despite the small losses, losers beat winners on the Nasdaq exchange by nearly 2-to-1. The ratio was about 5-to-2 negative on the NYSE.  


Weak breadth has been on display for a while now as large-cap technology names like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), among others, continue to lead the stock market.

But waning breadth hasn't been tough to navigate if you're holding some big winners like **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)). And there are plenty of other stock market leaders showing relative strength and holding above short-term support levels like the 10- and 21-day lines. If you own big leaders like these, they've been easy holds.  


Tough Environment For New Buys
------------------------------


The current stock market environment, however, has gotten a lot more challenging when it comes to new buys. Take **Curtiss-Wright** ([CW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CW)) in the aerospace and defense group. The stock broke out of a downtrend Monday, soaring nearly 5% in high volume. But sellers knocked Curtiss-Wright sharply lower Tuesday in even higher volume.  


In the enterprise software group, **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)) cleared a cup-with-handle base Thursday and closed nicely above a 306.63 handle entry. But sellers hit the stock hard Friday. Manhattan on Tuesday closed 3.8% below the buy point.  


Meanwhile, the wild speculation continued in unproven names like **Quantum Computing** ([QUBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QUBT)). The company is losing money and has no revenue to speak of, yet shares surged 65% Monday and another 50% Tuesday. In the same area, **Rigetti Computing** ([RGTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGTI)) jumped 32%, bringing its weekly gain to just over 55%. Rigetti is also losing money and shows two straight quarters of declining revenue.  


All Eyes On The Fed
-------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield closed off highs after hitting a high of 4.43%. It was recently trading flat around 4.40%.  


Before the open, retail sales rose 0.7% in November, a little better than the 0.5% consensus. October's sales gain was revised slightly higher to 0.5% from 0.4%. Excluding autos, sales edged higher by 0.2%, a little below the 0.4% consensus  


The retail sales data came as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway. The Fed is widely expected to lower the federal funds rate by another 25 basis to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.  


As it stands now, futures traders at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) only expect two rate cuts next year. But the Fed will have more inflation to ponder Friday when the Personal Income and Spending report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET.  


Inside the report, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the core personal consumption expenditures index — is expected to tick higher to 2.9%, up slightly from October's reading of 2.8%. Committee members want to see this number closer to 2%.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP112124-217x300.jpg)


As the major stock indexes rebounded from their recent losses, IBD maintain its recommended exposure level at 80%-100%. So far, the indexes have successfully defended their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which are shorter-term support levels to watch.  


As the stock market recovers, the environment continues to require diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). Make sure you monitor your positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules.  


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured one new stock, **Procore Technologies** ([PCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCOR)), which broke out past a 74.11 handle buy point. Meanwhile, the Near Pivot list has only two stock ideas on it, and one is **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)).

Dow Jones Tech Titan Shows New Buy Point
----------------------------------------


Leaders to watch include Dow Jones giant **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) and fintech leader **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)).  



Apple stock moved down 0.2% Thursday and is 4% from a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) at 237.49 as a result of a flat base. Shares are back above their 50-day line. A lagging relative strength line is an ominous technical indicator to watch.  


Cybersecurity leader Cloudflare jumped 8% Thursday, breaking out past a 99.17 buy point in a cup with handle. It was the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cloudflare-stock-artificial-intelligence-crypto-bitcoin-developers/)  


Tradeweb is attempting to break out past a 136.13 buy point in a flat base, but shares were turned away Wednesday.

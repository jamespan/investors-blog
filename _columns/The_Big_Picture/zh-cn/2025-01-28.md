Buyers came back into the stock market in spades Tuesday as a rally in software stocks helped propel the Nasdaq composite to a gain of 2% by the close.


After gapping below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) Monday, the Nasdaq is back above all of its principal moving averages. But the move came in lower volume after the index suffered a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) Monday.




The S&P 500 added 0.9%. The index also marked a distribution day Monday but held support at its 50-day line. Note that the Dec. 18 distribution days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell off the count Tuesday because of time.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher by 0.3% as the blue-chip index sits just off an all-time high. A 9% gain for **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was offset by declines of at least 1% for nine Dow components, including **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)).


The Russell 2000 inched up 0.2% and continues to struggle below its 50-day line.


As a result of Monday's selling, IBD lowered the recommended exposure level to 60% to 80%. While growth stocks continue to act well overall, the lowered invested percentage means it's time to take a look at current holdings. There's nothing wrong with giving your top performers more room to work. As always, though, don't be afraid to cut your laggards loose, especially during a time like now when more and more stocks are joining the breakout ranks.


Stock Market Leadership
-----------------------


Weakness in the Nasdaq Monday was caused by a [broad sell-off in AI stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/deepseek-ai-stocks-nvidia-artificial-intelligence-capital-spending/). But IBD's enterprise software group bucked the trend Monday with a 1% gain. The group rallied another 3.5% Tuesday.

Several institutional-quality software names in the group, including **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), ignored the selling Monday as investors digested news from China-based DeepSeek, which claimed its AI models use less data and at a fraction of the cost of current offerings like ChatGPT. That fueled hopes of lower costs for AI computing firms like Salesforce and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), among others.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP012825-223x300.jpg)ServiceNow,which joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) last week, cleared a flat base Monday with a 1,157.90 buy point. But gains faded by the close. The stock on Tuesday rallied another 2.5% and is still in the 5% buy zone to 1,215.80. Earnings are due Wednesday after the close, along with **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), another Leaderboard stock. Meta broke out from a flat base Friday and has followed through nicely since then.


**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), meanwhile, led the security software group to a gain of more than 4%. CrowdStrike soared past a 389 entry, jumping more than 9% in strong volume. **Rubrik** ([RBRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBRK)), another top performer in the group, could try to add a handle to its seven-week-old consolidation. Watch for an orderly, low-volume pullback as the stock trades less than 5% off its high, which is also its 75.79 buy point.


Outside of the software sector, **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) served up a powerful breakout after the company reported strong earnings and record bookings. The cruise line operator also said it plans to launch a luxury river cruise brand to compete with group peer **Viking** ([VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)). Viking erased early losses and is back in buy range from a 47.62 entry. **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)) jumped 8% and cleared a base with a 27.16 buy point.



**Merit Medical Systems** ([MMSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMSI)) and **GoDaddy** ([GDDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDDY)) also broke out from bases Tuesday.


Notable Earnings & Economic Data
--------------------------------


While the stock market awaits earnings reports this week from other large-cap technology giants like **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), there are plenty of other potentially market-moving events on the horizon.


The two-day Federal Reserve meeting concludes on Wednesday. The Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to leave the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. Futures traders at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)Â are still debating whether there will be one or two rate cuts this year. Rate cut expectations have been dialed back quite a bit amid fears that it could take inflation more time to get down to the Fed's 2% target.


Speaking of inflation, the Personal Income and Spending report also looms large on Friday. Inside the report, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is expected to come in at 2.6% year over year, up slightly from the prior month. Core PCE is seen at 2.8%, the same rate seen the prior month.

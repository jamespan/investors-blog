The stock market waited 2-1/2 years for this day, and it wasn't sure what to do after the Fed officially ended a tightening policy that began in March 2022.  
股市等了 2-1/2 年才等到这一天，在美联储正式结束 2022 年 3 月开始的紧缩政策后，不确定该怎么做。




Indexes were erratic Wednesday afternoon. The initial announcement of a 50-basis-point rate cut was the larger of two scenarios, and it motivated buyers. The Nasdaq initially climbed more than 1%, and the Russell 2000 rallied more than 2%. But investors soon tempered their enthusiasm.  
周三下午，指数不稳定。最初宣布降息 50 个基点是两种情况中较大的一种，它激励了买家。纳斯达克指数最初上涨超过 1%，罗素 2000 指数上涨超过 2%。但投资者很快就缓和了他们的热情。


As Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke with reporters, indexes erased most or all gains. That came despite a generally positive Q&A session from Powell. Sellers took control in the final hour, leaving the main indexes at session lows at the closing bell.  
正如美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔与记者交谈时，指数抹去了大部分或全部涨幅。尽管鲍威尔的问答环节总体上是积极的。卖家在最后一小时控制了局面，主要股指在收盘时处于盘中低点。


The S&P 500 closed 0.3% lower, diminishing its intraday record high to just a footnote. The Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 escaped with a gain of less than 0.1%.  
标准普尔 500 指数收盘下跌 0.3%，将其盘中历史高点缩小到只是一个脚注。纳斯达克综合指数和道琼斯工业平均指数也下跌 0.3%。小盘股罗素 2000 指数以不到 0.1% 的涨幅逃脱。


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE from Tuesday's levels. That meant the Nasdaq and S&P 500 picked up a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/).  
纳斯达克和纽约证券交易所的成交量从周二的水平上升。这意味着纳斯达克和标准普尔 500 指数上涨了[分销日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/)。


Despite its volatile action Wednesday, the S&P 500's intraday advance was enough to cause the deletion of the Sept. 6 distribution day, which offset Wednesday's new distribution day. The index climbed more than 5% from that day's close, meaning it should no longer factor into the current market analysis.  
尽管周三走势波动，但标准普尔 500 指数的盘中上涨足以导致 9 月 6 日的分配日被取消，从而抵消了周三的新分配日。该指数从当天收盘价上涨了 5% 以上，这意味着它不应再纳入当前的市场分析。


Yet the Nasdaq now has a half-dozen days of higher-volume losses, and the S&P has four such days. Those numbers point to a trend of institutional selling that needs to be watched closely in the coming days.  
然而，纳斯达克指数现在已经连续六天出现高交易量亏损，而标准普尔指数有四天是这样的。这些数字表明，未来几天需要密切关注机构抛售的趋势。


Stock Market Holds Up For Now股市目前保持稳定
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP091824-230x300.jpg)The overall technical profile of the major indexes remained largely unchanged even after the wild afternoon. The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 continued to hold above their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).  
即使在狂欢的下午之后，主要指数的整体技术概况也基本保持不变。道琼斯指数、标准普尔 500 指数、纳斯达克指数和罗素 2000 指数继续保持在 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/)上方。


On Wednesday, decliners topped advancers by 7-to-4 on the Nasdaq and by 8-to-7 on the NYSE. Every S&P sector index fell except for Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)), which added 0.2%.  
周三，纳斯达克指数以 7 比 4 的比分领先于上涨的股票，在纽约证券交易所以 8 比 7 的比分领先于上涨的股票。除能源精选行业 SPDR （[XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)） 上涨 0.2% 外，所有标准普尔板块指数均下跌。


But in broader terms, breadth has been improving. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), for example, made a record high Wednesday before reversing lower 0.2%. Stocks making new 52-week highs have been far outnumbering new lows.  
但从更广泛的角度来看，广度一直在提高。例如，景顺标准普尔 500 等权重 ETF （[RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)） 周三创下历史新高，然后回吐 0.2% 的跌幅。创下 52 周新高的股票数量远远超过新低。


In a positive sign for leading growth stocks, the IBD 50 0utperformed with a 0.3% increase.  
对于领先的成长股来说，这是一个积极的信号，IBD 50 0ut 表现为 0.3%。


But breakouts Wednesday followed the market's weak afternoon. Eight stocks in the [IBD MarketSurge 250 index](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) topped buy points; in all cases, they finished below their entries.  
但周三的突破是在市场疲软的下午之后出现的。[IBD MarketSurge 250 指数](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)中有八只股票的买入点位居榜首;在所有情况下，他们的成绩都低于他们的参赛作品。


Mixed market signals mean the stock market is seeking direction and investors have to be prepared in case of a larger drawdown. IBD's recommended exposure remained at 60%-80%, but it would be smart to be cautious while the market tries to figure out its direction.  
混合市场信号意味着股市正在寻求方向，投资者必须为更大的跌幅做好准备。IBD 的建议敞口保持在 60%-80%，但在市场试图弄清楚其方向时保持谨慎是明智的。


Stock Market Moves On Powell Comments鲍威尔评论股市走势
----------------------------------------------


Buyers had been guarded ahead of the Fed's announcement. In a press briefing, Powell expressed confidence that the Fed can reach its goal of 2% inflation while keeping the U.S. economy on good footing.  
在美联储宣布之前，买家一直保持警惕。鲍威尔在新闻发布会上表示，他有信心美联储能够实现 2% 的通胀目标，同时保持美国经济的良好基础。


Powell said there was "broad support" for the [50-basis-point cut](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cuts-start-sp-500-jerome-powell/) among members of the Federal Open Market Committee, although one member dissented. The Fed penciled in another half point in rate cuts by the end of the year.  
鲍威尔表示，联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）成员“广泛支持”降[息50个基点](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cuts-start-sp-500-jerome-powell/)，但有一名成员持反对意见。美联储预计在年底前再降息半个百分点。


The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed four basis points to 3.68%, the largest one-day increase since Aug. 22.  
基准 10 年期美国国债收益率攀升 4 个基点至 3.68%，为 8 月 22 日以来的最大单日涨幅。


Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, said in written comments that a more prolonged and predictable easing cycle is at hand.  
Brandywine Global 投资组合经理 Jack McIntyre 在书面评论中表示，一个更持久、更可预测的宽松周期即将到来。


"It now will be a battle between market expectations and the Fed, with employment data — not inflation data — determining which side is right," McIntyre said. "Since this policy move was mostly telegraphed, there is no outsized move in financial markets. Now, everyone is back to data dependency."  
麦金太尔说：“现在将是市场预期与美联储之间的一场战斗，就业数据——而不是通胀数据——决定哪一方是对的。“由于这项政策举措主要是通过电报进行的，因此金融市场没有太大的波动。现在，每个人都回到了对数据的依赖上。


Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said the Fed's dot-plot changed substantially. Fed policymakers now expect another six cuts by the end of 2025, which is much closer to current market pricing.  
ClearBridge Investments 经济和市场战略主管 Jeff Schulze 表示，美联储的点阵图发生了重大变化。美联储政策制定者现在预计，到 2025 年底，美联储将再降息 6 次，这与当前的市场定价要接近得多。


"Should this rate path come to fruition, the 10-year Treasury will likely move higher on the back of stronger expected economic momentum," Schulze said. "This would rhyme with prior soft landing cutting cycles as the 10-year Treasury has historically moved higher in a sell-the-news fashion following the initial rate cut. Going forward, we expect the Fed will move in 25 bp (basis point) increments to further recalibrate policy barring a material deterioration in the labor market."  
“如果这条利率路径实现，10 年期美国国债可能会在更强劲的预期经济势头的支持下走高，”舒尔茨说。“这将与之前的软着陆降息周期相吻合，因为 10 年期美国国债历来在首次降息后以推销新闻的方式走高。展望未来，我们预计美联储将以 25 个基点的增量进一步重新调整政策，除非劳动力市场出现实质性恶化。

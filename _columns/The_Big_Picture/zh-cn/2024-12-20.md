The stock market finished a bruising week with a flourish Friday following a benevolent inflation reading, setting the stage for a possible Santa Claus rally.  
在温和的通胀数据之后，股市以周五的繁荣结束了伤痕累累的一周，为可能的圣诞老人反弹奠定了基础。


The Nasdaq composite ended the day well off session highs, but still gained 1%. While it closed back above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) it suffered a weekly decline of 1.8%. The tech-heavy index retains a strong gain of 30.4% so far in 2024.  
纳斯达克综合指数收盘时远低于盘中高点，但仍上涨 1%。虽然收盘价回升至 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)上方，但每周下跌 1.8%。截至 2024 年，以科技股为主的指数仍保持 30.4% 的强劲涨幅。




The S&P 500 also closed well of highs but turned in a 1.1% lift. It suffered its second weekly drop in a row though, falling 2%. The benchmark index ended the day a hair above [its 50-day moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) Its bump for the year now sits at 24.3%.  
标准普尔 500 指数也收于高点，但上涨了 1.1%。不过，它连续第二周下跌，下跌 2%。该基准指数当天收盘略高于[其 50 天移动平均线。](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)它今年的涨幅现在为 24.3%。


Advancers outstripped decliners by nearly 3-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was well higher, but distorted due to triple-witching. This is the session in the quarter when stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options contracts all expire on the same day.  
纽约证券交易所的上涨股几乎是 3 比 1，纳斯达克的涨幅超过 2 比 1。音量要高得多，但由于三重巫术而失真。这是股票期权、股票指数期货和股票指数期权合约都在同一天到期的季度。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best out of the major indexes as it popped 1.2% Friday. But bears punched it 2.3% lower for the week and it now sits 1.6% below its 10-week moving average. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) were the best performers on the closely watched index.  
道琼斯工业平均指数周五上涨 1.2%，在主要指数中表现最佳。但空头本周将其击低 2.3%，目前比 10 周移动平均线低 1.6%。**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 和 **UnitedHealth** （[UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)） 是备受关注的指数中表现最好的股票。


Small caps also made gains, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.9%. It managed to hold above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rule-no-21-use-200-day-line-to-spot-overheating/) despite a painful weekly decline of 4.8%. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rallied 2.3% Friday, finding support at its 50-day line.  
小盘股也上涨，罗素 2000 指数上涨 0.9%。尽管每周下跌 4.8%，但它仍设法保持在 [200 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rule-no-21-use-200-day-line-to-spot-overheating/)上方。Innovator IBD 50 （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 交易所交易基金周五上涨 2.3%，在其 50 日线获得支撑。


Bullish Action But Maintain This Exposure看涨行动但保持这种敞口
----------------------------------------------------


Stocks got a boost after the personal consumption expenditures index for November rose by less than economists expected. This is the Fed's favored inflation gauge. Headline PCE rose 2.4% on an annualized basis while core PCE was up 2.8% year over year.  
在 11 月个人消费支出指数涨幅低于经济学家预期后，股市受到提振。这是美联储最喜欢的通胀指标。整体 PCE 年化增长 2.4%，而核心 PCE 同比增长 2.8%。


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP122024.jpg)Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee, who is on the Federal Open Market Committee, also gave stocks a boost by [telling CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/) that interest rates should be lowered by a "fair amount" next year. Nevertheless, indexes still suffered weekly declines due to the more hawkish stance taken by the Federal Reserve earlier in the week.  
芝加哥联邦储备银行行长、联邦公开市场委员会成员奥斯坦·古尔斯比 （Austan Goolsbee） 也[告诉 CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/)，明年应该将利率下调“相当多”，从而提振了股市。尽管如此，由于美联储在本周早些时候采取了更鹰派的立场，指数仍然每周下跌。


While indexes made solid gains Friday, with the Nasdaq recapturing its 21-day line and the S&P 500 ending dead on its 50-day moving average, IBD is holding its recommended exposure level at the 60% to 80% level. Due to the day's encouraging action it makes sense to be at the higher end of the range.  
虽然指数周五大幅上涨，纳斯达克指数收复了 21 天线，标准普尔 500 指数收盘于 50 天移动平均线，但 IBD 将其推荐的风险敞口水平保持在 60% 至 80% 的水平。由于当天的动作令人鼓舞，因此处于范围的高端是有意义的。


Now the stage looks set for a Santa Claus rally, defined as the final five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. Investors should take care to increase exposure at a measured pace and continue to respect sell signals within their portfolios.  
现在，圣诞老人反弹的舞台似乎已经准备好了，圣诞老人反弹被定义为今年的最后五个交易日和新年前两个交易日。投资者应注意以有节制的速度增加敞口，并继续尊重其投资组合中的卖出信号。


While markets will be closing early on Christmas Eve and shuttered all of Christmas Day, there is still a light sprinkling of economic data due. A consumer confidence reading is due Monday while durable orders and new-home sales data is scheduled for Tuesday. Initial jobless claims number come Thursday while investors expect advanced retail and wholesale inventories data Friday.  
虽然市场将在平安夜提前休市，并在圣诞节期间关闭，但仍有少量经济数据到期。消费者信心数据将于周一公布，而耐用品订单和新屋销售数据定于周二公布。周四将公布初请失业金人数，而投资者期待周五公布的零售和批发库存数据。


However [the cupboard is bare on the earnings front](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/palantir-stock-ai-stock-earnings-power/), which will also be the case the following week.  
然而，在[收益方面，橱柜是光秃](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/palantir-stock-ai-stock-earnings-power/)秃的，下周也将如此。


No Festive Cheer For These Stock Market Sectors这些股市板块没有节日的欢呼
------------------------------------------------------------


All of the [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday higher](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Real estate, utilities and technology were the strongest areas, while consumer staples made the slimmest gains. But recent declines mean materials and energy are almost flat for the year. Communication services leads the pack with a year-to-date gain just shy of 35%.  
[标准普尔 500 指数的所有板块周五收高](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/)。房地产、公用事业和科技是表现最强劲的领域，而必需消费品的涨幅最小。但最近的下跌意味着材料和能源今年几乎持平。通信服务以略低于 35% 的年增长率领先。



The relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups offers deeper insight into the [action on Friday's stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).  
《投资者商业日报》（Investor's Business Daily）的 197 个行业团体的相对表现为对[周五股市走势](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)的更深入洞察提供了更深入的见解。


The vast majority ended higher, with computer hardware stocks, solar plays, fiber-optics companies and data-storage plays among the best performers.  
绝大多数股票收高，其中计算机硬件股、太阳能股、光纤公司和数据存储公司表现最佳。


The ethical drugs group also ended solidly higher despite **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) plunging due to underwhelming late-stage trial results for its experimental weight loss drug CagriSema. [Novo fell 17.8%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/novo-nordisk-dives-cagrisegma-obesity-drug-trial-eli-lilly-viking-therapeutics/) and more than 22% below its 50-day line.  
尽管**诺和诺德** （[NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)） 由于其实验性减肥药 CagriSema 的后期试验结果不佳而暴跌，但道德药物组也收盘走高。[Novo 下跌 17.8%，](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/novo-nordisk-dives-cagrisegma-obesity-drug-trial-eli-lilly-viking-therapeutics/)较 50 日线低 22% 以上。


In contrast, book companies, logistics firms, metal products distributors and trucking plays were among the worst performers.  
相比之下，图书公司、物流公司、金属产品分销商和卡车运输公司表现最差。

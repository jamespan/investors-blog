Indexes rallied to record highs Wednesday in a stock market session marked with superlatives that greeted unambiguous election victories for former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party.  
周三，指数在股市交易中反弹至历史新高，以最高级为标志，迎接前总统唐纳德·特朗普和共和党的明确选举胜利。


For starters, the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to all-time highs as the Dow and S&P made their best one-day gains since November 2022. For the Nasdaq, it was the best day since Feb. 22 of this year. The Dow surged 3.6% and the S&P 2.5%.  
首先，纳斯达克综合指数、标准普尔 500 指数和道琼斯工业平均指数升至历史新高，道琼斯指数和标准普尔指数创下 2022 年 11 月以来的最佳单日涨幅。对于纳斯达克来说，这是自今年 2 月 22 日以来最好的一天。道琼斯指数飙升 3.6%，标准普尔指数飙升 2.5%。




Stock Market Records Broken打破股市记录
---------------------------------


The stock market made history, too: The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 had their best day after Election Day ever recorded. The Nasdaq's 3% gain was the largest since the November 2020 election, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  
股市也创造了历史：标准普尔 500 指数和罗素 2000 指数在选举日之后创下了有史以来最好的一天。根据道琼斯市场数据，纳斯达克指数 3% 的涨幅是自 2020 年 11 月大选以来的最大涨幅。


Volume was the highest since the Nov. 20 triple witching session. Trading swelled 68% on the NYSE and rose 15% on the Nasdaq, making Wednesday's index gains analogous to a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). It effectively ended a soft patch that clouded the stock market heading into Election Day.  
交易量是自 11 月 20 日三重巫术会议以来的最高水平。纽约证券交易所的交易上涨了 68%，纳斯达克的交易上涨了 15%，这使得周三的指数上涨类似于[后续的反弹确认](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/)。它有效地结束了在选举日之前给股市蒙上阴影的疲软时期。


Breadth was positive but not as much as the index gains would have you think. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by an 8-to-5 ratio and by about 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.  
广度是积极的，但并不像你想象的指数上涨那么多。根据 FactSet 的数据，纽约证券交易所的上涨者数量超过下跌者的数量，比例为 8 比 5，纳斯达克的比率约为 9 比 5。


Still, gains were broad. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) jumped 2.4%. First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) vaulted 2.4%. Both ETFs broke out above [trendlines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/?refcode=BBB-04262022-2-B-9:04:2022:2Q:NewsLetter:Email:BBB-04262022:na:na:na:na:26:10:2:B:9&j=1566189&sfmc_sub=172274927&l=222_HTML&u=20328680&mid=100016628&jb=1) drawn from their October highs.  
尽管如此，收益是广泛的。景顺标准普尔 500 等权重 ETF （[RSP）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP) 上涨 2.4%。First Trust 纳斯达克 100 等权重指数 （[QQEW）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW) 上涨 2.4%。这两只 ETF 都突破了从 10 月高点绘制的[趋势线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/?refcode=BBB-04262022-2-B-9:04:2022:2Q:NewsLetter:Email:BBB-04262022:na:na:na:na:26:10:2:B:9&j=1566189&sfmc_sub=172274927&l=222_HTML&u=20328680&mid=100016628&jb=1)。


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP110624-179x300.jpg)The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) and iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) both rose more than 2.5%. The Russell surged 5.8%.  
iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF （[IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)） 和 iShares Russell 1000 Value （[IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)） 均上涨超过 2.5%。罗素指数飙升 5.8%。


Market Outlook Improves 市场前景改善
------------------------------


Wednesday's sharp gains wiped away the Nasdaq's Oct. 7 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), leaving only the high-volume declines of Oct. 15 and 17 as markers of institutional selling. The S&P 500 still carries four distribution days.  
周三的大幅上涨抹去了纳斯达克 10 月 7 日[的发行日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/)，只剩下 10 月 15 日和 17 日的高成交量下跌作为机构抛售的标志。标准普尔 500 指数仍然有四个派发日。


With the market outlook turning more bullish, IBD raised its recommended market exposure from 60%-80% to 80%-100%. Investors could look at the various sectors that rallied Wednesday to add to their portfolios.  
随着市场前景变得更加乐观，IBD 将其建议的市场敞口从 60%-80% 提高到 80%-100%。投资者可以关注周三上涨以增加投资组合的各个板块。


Financials, industrials and energy — sectors that may see less in terms of government mandates — led the stock market with gains of 3.8% to 6.1%.  
金融、工业和能源等受政府监管影响较小的板块以 3.8% 至 6.1% 的涨幅领涨股市。


Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) climbed more than 3%. But the defensive consumer staples, real estate and utilities fell Wednesday. Utilities also compared unfavorably to rising Treasury yields.  
非必需消费品精选板块 SPDR （[XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)） 上涨超过 3%。但防御性必需消费品、房地产和公用事业周三下跌。与不断上升的美国国债收益率相比，公用事业也表现不佳。


Stock Market Winners & Losers股市赢家和输家
------------------------------------


Although control of the House of Representatives remained unclear late Wednesday, Trump's decisive victory and GOP control of the Senate means a win for many businesses and [multiple potential changes in policy](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-surges-trump-win-signals-bull-run/).  
尽管周三晚些时候对众议院的控制权仍不明朗，但特朗普的决定性胜利和共和党对参议院的控制意味着许多企业的胜利和[政策的多种潜在变化](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-surges-trump-win-signals-bull-run/)。


"Trump is viewed as supporting lower corporate tax rates, deregulation, and industrial policies that favor domestic growth, all of which could provide more stimulus to the U.S. economy and benefit risk assets," Janus Henderson strategists Marc Pinto and Lucas Klein said in a report. "These policies could also lead to a stronger dollar, which would be a boon for U.S. small-cap firms with a domestic focus."  
“特朗普被视为支持降低公司税率、放松管制和有利于国内增长的产业政策，所有这些都可能为美国经济提供更多刺激，并使风险资产受益，”骏利亨德森策略师 Marc Pinto 和 Lucas Klein 在一份报告中表示。“这些政策还可能导致美元走强，这对专注于国内的美国小盘股公司来说将是一个福音。”


In the 2016 election, the S&P 500 gained nearly 5% from the day before the presidential election through the end of the year in the first Trump rally, Pinto and Klein wrote. "We expect a similar trend could play out this time around, too."  
平托和克莱因写道，在 2016 年大选中，标准普尔 500 指数从总统大选前一天到年底在特朗普的第一次反弹中上涨了近 5%。“我们预计这一次也会出现类似的趋势。”


Perhaps more importantly for investors, the nation avoided a contested election, removing one of the biggest clouds hanging over Wall Street. Gold assets, which acted as a hedge against political turmoil, fell broadly. Gold for November delivery fell 2.7% to $2,667.60 per ounce. The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), often called the stock market's fear gauge, slid 20.6% in its biggest drop since Aug. 6.  
也许对投资者来说更重要的是，美国避免了一场有争议的选举，消除了笼罩在华尔街上的最大乌云之一。作为对冲政治动荡的黄金资产普遍下跌。11 月交割的黄金价格下跌 2.7% 至每盎司 2,667.60 美元。芝加哥[期权交易所市场波动率指数](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility)（通常被称为股市的恐惧指标）下跌 20.6%，创下 8 月 6 日以来的最大跌幅。


Of course, the so-called Trump Trade came out a big winner. **Trump Media & Technology** ([DJT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DJT)) [social media company's stock](https://www.investors.com/news/donald-trump-stock-djt-presidential-election/) closed nearly 6% higher after trimming earlier gains.  


With Trump favoring cryptocurrencies, [bitcoin prices climbed to a record high](https://www.investors.com/news/bitcoin-price-outlook-2024-us-election-trump-kamala-harris-nov-6/) late Wednesday.  


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) gapped up nearly 15% in double its usual volume. It regained a 264.86 buy point and topped an alternative entry at 273.54. While Trump and Congress may scale back electric-vehicle goals, CEO Elon Musk may have a role in the next administration. Some shareholders, though, worry it may become a distraction for Musk.  
**特斯拉** （[TSLA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA) 跳空上涨近 15%，是平时的两倍。它重新获得了 264.86 的买入点，并在 273.54 点突破了另一个入口。虽然特朗普和国会可能会缩减电动汽车目标，但首席执行官埃隆·马斯克 （Elon Musk） 可能会在下一届政府中发挥作用。不过，一些股东担心这可能会分散马斯克的注意力。


Treasury Yields Spike 美国国债收益率飙升
-------------------------------


The 10 year Treasury yield rose nearly 14 basis points to 4.425%, the highest since July 2. Yet, the increase in borrowing costs didn't hurt the stock market.  
10 年期美国国债收益率上涨近 14 个基点至 4.425%，为 7 月 2 日以来的最高水平。然而，借贷成本的增加并没有损害股市。


The long-dated 30-year bond shed 15 basis points to 4.6% as bond traders worry of rising U.S. budget deficits.  
由于债券交易员担心美国预算赤字上升，30 年期长期债券下跌 15 个基点至 4.6%。


A changing of the guard in Washington also made losers of other sectors and asset classes.  
华盛顿的换岗也使其他行业和资产类别的亏损。


IBD's solar energy industry group was Wednesday's worst performing, down 11.5%.  
IBD 的太阳能行业组是周三表现最差的板块，下跌 11.5%。


The German DAX fell 1.1% and STOXX Europe 600 Index lost 0.5%. Europe faces the prospect of backing Ukraine's war against Russia with less aid from the U.S. The threat of more import tariffs also appeared to hurt overseas stock markets.  
德国 DAX 指数下跌 1.1%，斯托克欧洲 600 指数下跌 0.5%。欧洲面临着以美国较少援助来支持乌克兰对俄罗斯的战争的前景。提高进口关税的威胁似乎也损害了海外股市。

The stock market sold off sharply Thursday as Wall Street reacted to earnings reports from tech titans **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and many other companies.  


Indexes fell to or below important chart levels on the eve of the October jobs report.  


Late Thursday, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) traded mixed after both reported earnings after the close. [Amazon climbed](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-q3-2024-earnings-report-amzn-aws-ai/) 4.5% in extended trading, as [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-fiscal-q4-2024-earnings/) moved down 1.3%. That provided a small boost to tech futures in overnight trading.  




In the regular session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9% and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Aug. 12.  


The S&P 500 lost 1.9% and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.8%. For both, it was the biggest loss since Sept. 3, according to Dow Jones Market Data. And the small-cap Russell 2000 index dropped 1.6%.  


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, but rose on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) to the S&P 500, taking its count to four. Declining stocks topped advancers by about 3-1 on the Nasdaq and by 2-1 on the NYSE, according to FactSet.  


Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with technology and consumer discretionary leading the downside. The utilities and energy sectors finished higher Thursday.  


On the [economic front](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/pce-inflation-sept-jobless-claims-eci-federal-reserve-sp-500/), the core PCE price index ran a touch too hot in September, as the inflation gauge remained moderately above the Federal Reserve's target amid robust consumer spending. However, the Employment Cost Index, a measure of wage growth, unexpectedly slowed in Q3.  


Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell in the week ended Oct. 26, reflecting a low level of layoffs.  


Early Friday, the Labor Department is expected to release its October jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to grow by 125,000 in October, down from September's 254,000 increase, per Econoday.

Stock Market Today: Meta, Microsoft
-----------------------------------


[Shares of Meta Platforms](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-q3-2024-earnings-results-facebook-instagram/) sold off more than 4% Thursday after the company reported third quarter earnings above expectations, powered by a 19% revenue increase. But Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to keep up the company's big spending on artificial intelligence and the metaverse.  


Meta stock remains above its 50-day line.  


Meanwhile, [Microsoft topped Wall Street's targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-msft-fiscal-q1-2025-earnings/) for the software giant's fiscal first quarter on strong cloud computing business. However, Microsoft stock tumbled 6% after the company guided below views for sales in the current quarter. Microsoft shares dived below their 50-day line.  


The two stocks account for about 9% of the S&P 500 index.  


Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) were the among biggest decliners Thursday with losses of 3.5% and 3.2%, respectively, on the stock market today. Intel jumped on [earnings late Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-stock-intc-q3-2024-earnings/).  


On the upside, **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) were the Dow winners during the session, up 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively. Amgen reported [Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-amgen-earnings-q3-2024/) Wednesday evening.  


[The Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended sharply lower as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) tumbled 3.9%. Notably, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is close to triggering the 7% sell rule from a 264.86 buy point after a short-lived breakout move last week.  


And the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund slipped 1.7%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list, **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)) rallied another 2.8%, adding to Wednesday's 42% earnings-fueled surge.

What To Do Now
--------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP103124-250x300.jpg)


Following Thursday's sharp losses, IBD reduced its recommended exposure from 80%-100% to 60%-80% to reflect the weakening action in the major stock indexes.  


The S&P 500 fell to its 50-day moving average and the Nasdaq is close to testing its 50-day line. Those levels will be critical junctures to watch. Further weakness below those levels would indicate the need to more aggressively cut market exposure.  


The volatile stock market environment requires diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means incrementally adding and reducing exposure to stay in sync with the broad market. Watch for sell signals and other abrupt character changes in your holdings. For example, **SharkNinja** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)) [plunged nearly 17%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sharkninja-stock-sn-q3-2024-earnings/) to break down below the 50-day line, causing a sell signal.  


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured two stocks, both of which reported earnings. **GoDaddy** ([GDDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDDY)) crossed above a 166.17 [cup-with-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/godaddy-gddy-nvidia-meta-microsoft/). Meanwhile, there are four ideas appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list. That suggests a dwindling number of buying opportunities ready to emerge.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Ferrari, Intuitive, Nu
-----------------------------------------------------


Despite Thursday's weakness, stock market leaders to watch include **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)), **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and **Nu Holdings** ([NU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NU)).  



Ferrari shares are pulling back to their 50-day line, as they build a flat base with a 498.23 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) pattern recognition.  


Robotic surgery leader Intuitive Surgical gapped up from its 50-day and 10-week lines following the company's third-quarter report on Oct. 18. Shares are pulling back just above a tight area that formed a quasi flat base. Investors can use an Oct. 25 high of 516.89 as an entry.  


And Brazilian financial leader Nu fell below a 15.16 buy point following Monday's breakout.

  Stock Market Selling Hits Tech Stocks The Hardest; Rising Bond Yields Fuel Negative Sentiment

Sellers came into the stock market Wednesday as the 10-year Treasury yield continued its upward ascent, fueling fears that future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve might not be as aggressive as first thought.




Heavy selling in **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell 1.5% and closed just below its 21-day exponential moving average. Sellers also knocked **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) lower by nearly 3%, but the decline simply amounted to a test of the 10-day line.


The Nasdaq composite slumped 1.6%, ending a five-session win streak. The Nasdaq's power trend is still intact as the index holds just above its 21-day line. The Nasdaq avoided a distribution day Wednesday due to lower volume, but it was somewhat skewed because volume was heavy Tuesday. Declining stocks on the market outnumbered advancers by nearly 3-to-1.


Palo Alto Networks slumped nearly 5% and closed just below its 21-day line. The company on Monday tried to break out from a lengthy consolidation, but volume never came into the stock and the breakout stalled. Sentiment was also weak in the security software group after **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) announced a share offering. CyberArk shares fell 3.5%.


Qualcomm swooned nearly 4% on news that Arm wants to cancel a key license, which allows Qualcomm to design chips based on Arm architecture. Both companies are in a legal battle related to a company called Nuvia, an Arm licensee that Qualcomm acquired in 2021. Arm shares crashed nearly 7%.


Stock Market Today: Treasury Yields Keep Climbing
-------------------------------------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield added another four basis points to just over 4.24%, a three-month high. The yield is up a whopping 64 basis points since hitting a low of 3.6% on Sept. 16.

With the Federal Reserve expected to cut its key lending rate by 25 basis points in November — with another rate cut expected in December — why would investors be selling bonds with a vengeance?


One argument is that the stock market is pricing in a Republican presidential win, which could usher in larger deficits. Rising debt levels often cause bond investors to demand higher rates.


Another argument is that a recent string of strong economic data could result in a slower pace of rate cuts. Futures traders at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) still expect a rate cut in December, but expectations have been dialed back.


Earnings Sell-Offs Hit S&P
--------------------------


The S&P 500 gave back 0.9%, hurt by earnings sell-offs for index members like **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) and **Seagate Technology** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)). **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) also lagged in the benchmark index after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked an outbreak of E. coli to the fast food chain's Quarter Pounder sandwich.


Market volume rose on the New York Stock Exchange, adding another distribution day to the S&P 500's count. But the Sept. 18 higher-volume decline for the index was dropped from the count because enough time has passed — 25 days — to make it less relevant. The Sept. 17 stalling session was removed from the count Tuesday for the same reason.


Breadth was similar on the NYSE, with losers beating winners by nearly 3-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 1%, while the Russell 2000 small-cap index fell 0.8%. The Russell breached the 2,200 level and looked poised for a test of its 50-day line, but buyers lifted the index off lows. The Dow Jones also closed off lows as it tests its 21-day line.


Bullish Sentiment On The Rise
-----------------------------


Meanwhile, stock market sentiment continues to tilt quite bullish, according to the latest survey of newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence. The bulls climbed to 58.3% last week, up from 57.6%.


Readings of 60% or above indicate extreme bullishness and have been seen ahead of stock market pullbacks in the past. It's a contrarian indicator, meaning when the crowd starts to get bullish, it's usually the time to be bearish.


Stock market conditions have gotten even more challenging, even though scads of leading growth stocks continue to hold gains well after nice moves. The question now is what's left to buy? In the early stages of a new stock market uptrend, it's common to see the stock market serve up an ample supply of new buys.

But conditions are more challenging now with so many stocks well extended past proper buy points. Keep an eye out for new buys, but also realize it's slim pickings at the moment.


**Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) gave an early buy signal Wednesday when it moved with conviction above the 900 level. But a 1.4% intraday gain was more than halved by the close.


Similarly, a strong earnings report from electronics firm **Amphenol** ([APH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APH)) fueled an early breakout, but sellers knocked shares well off highs.

The stock market ended a powerful week with another day of gains, spurring a further bullish shift. The release of the latest Federal Reserve minutes and a speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell could move indexes in the coming week.  
股市以又一天的上涨结束了强劲的一周，刺激了进一步的看涨转变。美联储最新会议纪要的发布和美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔的讲话可能会在未来一周影响指数。




The Nasdaq composite squeezed out a gain of 0.2% Friday, but the true story is its mammoth weekly gain of 5.3%. It is now 12.2% above the previous week's low and sits a hair above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The tech-heavy index's gain for 2024 has spiked to 17.5%.  
纳斯达克综合指数周五上涨了 0.2%，但真实情况是其 5.3% 的巨额周涨幅。它现在比上周的低点高出 12.2%，比其 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)高出一点点。这个以科技股为主的指数在 2024 年的涨幅已飙升至 17.5%。

The S&P 500 inched up 0.2% for the day while it nailed down its best weekly gain of the year so far with a 3.9% lift. The index has a more impressive gap above the 50-day line and now sits nearly 2% above the benchmark. Its gain for the year has now jumped to 16.4%.  
标准普尔 500 指数当天小幅上涨 0.2%，同时以 3.9% 的涨幅创下今年迄今的最佳单周涨幅。该指数在 50 天线上方的差距更为明显，目前比基准高出近 2%。其今年的涨幅现已跃升至 16.4%。


Advancers led decliners almost 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 1.5-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower for each on Friday.  
纽约证券交易所的涨幅几乎是 2 比 1，纳斯达克的涨幅超过 1.5 比 1。周五每辆车的成交量都较低。


Encouraging Actions Spurs This Move鼓励行动推动这一举措
---------------------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held its own against the other major indexes on the stock market today. It rose 0.2% Friday and was up 2.9% for the week. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) were strongest here while **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) lagged.  
道琼斯工业平均指数与当今股市上的其他主要指数相比保持稳定。周五上涨 0.2%，本周上涨 2.9%。**波音** （[BA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA) 和**思科系统** （[CSCO）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO) 在这方面表现最强，而**卡特彼**勒 （[CAT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT) 则落后。


Small caps partook in the broad rally, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.3% for the day and 3% for the week. Growth stocks popped, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rising 0.6% Friday, though it remains below both the 200-day and 50-day lines.  
小盘股参与了广泛的反弹，罗素 2000 指数当天上涨 0.3%，本周上涨 3%。成长型股票大放异彩，Innovator IBD 50 （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 交易所交易基金周五上涨 0.6%，但仍低于 200 天和 50 天线。


Stocks built on recent gains Friday, which means the current market rally is continuing to prove itself. The Nasdaq composite ended the week above its key 50-day moving average while the S&P 500 is solidly above that benchmark and also moved above its close for the July 31 follow-through day.  
股市周五在最近的涨幅基础上继续上涨，这意味着当前的市场反弹正在继续证明自己。纳斯达克综合指数本周收于其关键的 50 天移动平均线上方，而标准普尔 500 指数稳固高于该基准，并在 7 月 31 日的后续交易日也升至收盘价上方。


Because of this, Investor's Business Daily is raising its recommended market exposure level to the 60% to 80% range. Investors should continue to add exposure in a measured fashion. Look to open new positions, or add to existing ones, as issues clear proper buy points.  
因此，Investor's Business Daily 将其建议的市场敞口水平提高到 60% 至 80% 的范围。投资者应继续以谨慎的方式增加敞口。寻求开设新头寸或增加现有头寸，因为问题清除了适当的买入点。


Fed Minutes And Powell Speech Loom美联储会议纪要和鲍威尔讲话
-----------------------------------------------


Benevolent inflation readings and encouraging jobless claims data this week helped soothe recession fears among investors. Additionally, better-than-expected U.S. retail sales in July and a [strong earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-q2-walmart-stock-amazon-home-depot/) from **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) eased worries over the health of the consumer. This was a potent cocktail that allowed indexes to claw back much of their recent losses.

The stock market ended a powerful week with another day of gains, spurring a further bullish shift. The release of the latest Federal Reserve minutes and a speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell could move indexes in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite squeezed out a gain of 0.2% Friday, but the true story is its mammoth weekly gain of 5.3%. It is now 12.2% above the previous week's low and sits a hair above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The tech-heavy index's gain for 2024 has spiked to 17.5%.

The S&P 500 inched up 0.2% for the day while it nailed down its best weekly gain of the year so far with a 3.9% lift. The index has a more impressive gap above the 50-day line and now sits nearly 2% above the benchmark. Its gain for the year has now jumped to 16.4%.


Advancers led decliners almost 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 1.5-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower for each on Friday.


Encouraging Actions Spurs This Move
-----------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held its own against the other major indexes on the stock market today. It rose 0.2% Friday and was up 2.9% for the week. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) were strongest here while **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) lagged.


Small caps partook in the broad rally, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.3% for the day and 3% for the week. Growth stocks popped, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rising 0.6% Friday, though it remains below both the 200-day and 50-day lines.


Stocks built on recent gains Friday, which means the current market rally is continuing to prove itself. The Nasdaq composite ended the week above its key 50-day moving average while the S&P 500 is solidly above that benchmark and also moved above its close for the July 31 follow-through day.


Because of this, Investor's Business Daily is raising its recommended market exposure level to the 60% to 80% range. Investors should continue to add exposure in a measured fashion. Look to open new positions, or add to existing ones, as issues clear proper buy points.


Fed Minutes And Powell Speech Loom
----------------------------------


Benevolent inflation readings and encouraging jobless claims data this week helped soothe recession fears among investors. Additionally, better-than-expected U.S. retail sales in July and a [strong earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-q2-walmart-stock-amazon-home-depot/) from **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) eased worries over the health of the consumer. This was a potent cocktail that allowed indexes to claw back much of their recent losses.


The coming week features a few noteworthy events that could further drive the stock market. Monday sees the release of the U.S. leading economic indicators for July. Meanwhile, the minutes from the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting come Wednesday.


There will also be a slew of Fedspeak, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday being the main event. Investors will be keen to hear any guidance on the future direction of interest rates.


There will also be some noteworthy [earnings reports in the coming week.](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/palo-alto-stock-target-stock-retail-earnings/) These include **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) and restaurant stock **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)). A slew of retailers are also due, including **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)).

A batch of good news sent the stock market to its best day in more than two months Wednesday, as multiple breakouts among highly rated stocks provided further evidence that the market is shaking off its slump.


After a fast start, indexes started to fade in late-morning trading, resembling the erratic action of the past few sessions. But buyers stepped up throughout the afternoon, and indexes closed near the day's highs.




The Nasdaq composite led with a burst of nearly 2.5% that took the index back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The S&P 500 added 1.8% and closed just below its 50-day line. For both, it was their best day since Nov. 6.


Small caps had a grand day, too, with the Russell 2000 up 2%. Although the index remained below the 50-day average, it closed above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) for the first time since Dec. 11.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed almost 1.7% and is now less than 1% below its 50-day line. It too climbed back above the 21-day moving average.


Breadth was unusually bullish, with advancers over decliners by 11-to-2 on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet. Volume rose modestly.


Stock Market Outlook Improves
-----------------------------

The stock market rebound and multiple stock breakouts brightened the outlook for investors. Thus, IBD raised its recommended market exposure to 40%-60% from the 20%-40% level.


There's reason to hold back on higher exposure for now, including the elevated number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) over the past several weeks. Also, the S&P and Nasdaq have yet to break a pattern of lower highs and lower lows — a classic description of a downtrend.


Investors can now afford to give their holdings more room, and consider some of the latest buy opportunities to increase exposure.


Even before Wednesday's stock market rally, a number of institutional-quality stocks started to break out or rise from support levels. More breakouts emerged Wednesday.


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) cleared a flat base's buy point of 556.23 in heavy trading after [fourth-quarter results beat estimates.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intuitive-surgical-stock-preliminary-fourth-quarter-report/) **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) surged past a 256.13 buy point from a flat base. The [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) of both stocks made new highs.


**Semtech** ([SMTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMTC)) emerged from a flat base at 70.27 and remained in buy range. Aerospace supplier **Howmet** ([HWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HWM)) broke out of another flat base in double its average volume. The buy zone goes to 126.75, and its RS line is also at new highs. Howmet was [Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/howmet-stock-buy-signal-aerospace-defense-shares-nearly-tripled/).


Finally, **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)) also had a flat-base breakout.


The success of these and other recent breakouts will help determine the market's health. Some earlier breakouts this year flopped quickly in a foreshadowing of broader market weakness. Further index gains will also help determine if additional market exposure is warranted.


Positive Stock Market News
--------------------------


Certainly, the stock market had plenty to feel good about before the opening bell.


Bank earnings were [better than expected](https://www.investors.com/news/goldman-sachs-jpmorgan-wells-fargo-blackrock-earnings-q4-2024-gs-jpm-wfc-blk-c-schw/). **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) delivered major earnings beats. Citigroup topped views and announced a $20 billion stock buyback program. Wells Fargo reported mixed results.


The December core [consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-dec-sp-500-federal-reserve/) rose 0.2%, below forecasts for 0.3%, while the annual core inflation rate surprisingly eased to 3.2% from November's 3.3%, which was the expected figure. Headline CPI rose 0.2%, which included a 2.6% rise in energy prices. Annual CPI climbed 2.9%, still well above the Fed's target.


The 10-year Treasury yield fell 13 basis points to 4.65% and is now 15 basis points below its 52-week high of 4.80% on Monday. [Odds for a  quarter-point rate cut](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) later this year rose modestly.


"Softer core CPI inflation in December will give the Fed some breathing room ahead of the uncertain impact of tariffs" that President-elect Trump is planning, said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said in written comments that core CPI broke a four-month streak of 0.3% monthly gains. "Today's inflation print should be tailwind to risk assets by removing one of the bricks in the wall of worry the market is facing."


Quantum Trade Back In Stock Market
----------------------------------


The stock market's latest frenzy — quantum computing — saw a revival Wednesday.


**D-Wave Quantum** ([QBTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QBTS)) [announced a partnership](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/quantum-computing-stocks-quantum-stocks-dwave-carahsoft/) with Carahsoft Technology designed to increase government adoption of its quantum computing solutions. That followed **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) announcement of Quantum Ready, a new program from its Azure cloud-computing business.


**Rigetti Computing** ([RGTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGTI)) soared 22%. **IonQ** ([IONQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IONQ)) vaulted 33%, while **Quantum Computing** ([QUBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QUBT)) skyrocketed 55%. Those stocks had come down substantially from their December and early-January stock market rallies.

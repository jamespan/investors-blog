The stock market finished mixed on Monday, but investors appeared to show a fair degree of restraint in their selling. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq proved it cannot be the leader every day in a bull market.




While the Nasdaq composite cooled off, down almost 0.9%, it certainly reflected hesitancy among fund managers to load up further after [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's decisive statement](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jackson-hole-federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-rate-cuts-labor-market-sp-500/) Friday on monetary policy.


Plus, [one of the largest companies on the U.S. market](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-preview-fiscal-q2-2025-earnings/) and the linchpin of the AI investing theme, Nvidia, is slated to report earnings on Wednesday, alongside beleaguered cybersecurity group leader **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)).


While the Nasdaq failed to reclaim 18,000, a psychologically meaningful price level, it held above the 50-day moving average, another important technical level. Also, the Nasdaq's nearly 0.9% decline Monday was a small portion of a 6.7% advance accomplished in the prior two weeks.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500, in contrast, eased just 0.3%. At 5,616, the large-cap benchmark remains in the black for the third quarter, up nearly 2.9% since July 1. On Monday, small caps also faded. The S&P SmallCap 600 reversed off its intraday high of 1,424, squandering an early 0.8% increase. It closed just 0.1% lower for the day.



![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP082624-249x300.jpg)Decent market breadth helps explain why the S&P 500 and S&P 600 both fared quite well. Early data on the NYSE showed winners beating losers by a nearly 4-3 margin. That's better than on the Nasdaq, where [declining issues outnumbered rising ones 2,410 vs. 1,975](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/daily-market-statistics).

Meanwhile, volume cooled on both main exchanges vs. Friday. So, while the Nasdaq did receive the brunt of the day's selling, it also avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


As the Market Pulse shows, since the Aug. 13 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), [heavy professional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) remains scant.


How Now, Shining Dow?
---------------------


Monday's stock market action also saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise to an all-time high of 41,420. The blue-chip gauge finished at 41,240, up less than 0.2% and off that peak. Nonetheless, the Dow Jones' gain, coupled with another all-time peak by the NYSE Composite, reaffirmed the expanding breadth of the stock market advance.


When the breadth of the stock market improves, so do investors' chances of making money going long.


[On MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF), subscribers can view a 10-day moving average of the advance-decline lines on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq. On the former, visible by punching in "GMIAA" on a daily chart only, the NYSE's advance-decline line has been ramping higher since the beginning of July. The A-D line has also been leading its 10-day moving average on a bullish upward slope since late last week.


Going all the way to early November, the NYSE's A-D line broke a 13-week downtrend and has been stroking higher highs and higher lows since then.


That's the kind of technicals you want to see in a bullish stock market.


And how about the Nasdaq? The picture is less rosy. Since July of 2023, the Nasdaq's A-D line actually has not cracked its long-term downtrend yet. But, after the advance-decline line hit a nadir for the year amid the early August sell-off, it's been climbing well.


Going back to the Dow industrials, it's not often that you see a blue chip such as **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) make the Market Pulse as part of the "Leaders Up In Volume" section. Yet the beverage giant is actually outperforming the S&P 500 year to date. The megacap beverage play has also given recent buyers a smooth ride after shares cleared a flat base at 64.36 on July 17.


The 80 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) ranks Coca-Cola within the top third of the Dow industrials. At least seven others headed into Monday's session scored an 80 RS Rating or higher.


The Dow Jones' newfound strength raises the question: Is value beginning to surpass growth in the stock market?

Battle Between Growth And Value
-------------------------------


One way to answer this: Compare the iShares S&P 500 Value ([IVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IVE)) exchange traded fund with iShares S&P 500 Growth ([IVW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IVW)).


Over the past 12 months, the value ETF has lagged the growth ETF (up 21.8% vs. 32.7% since Aug. 25 last year). However, the value fund narrowed the gap over the past three months, up 5.7% vs. a 6.5% lift by its growth counterpart. And, since the start of the third quarter, iShares S&P 500 Value has taken over the race, rising 6.5%, while iShares S&P 500 Growth has mustered only a 0.8% gain.


Outside the stock market, crude oil futures expiring in October jumped more than 3% to $77.16 a barrel on the Nymex amid oil facility closures in Libya and the ongoing military conflict between Israel and Hamas and Lebanon.

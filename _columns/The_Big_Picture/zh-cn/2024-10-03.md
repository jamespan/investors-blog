  Stock Market Falls As Wall Street Braces For Crucial Jobs Report

The stock market finished a seesaw session lower Thursday, as Wall Street braced for a September jobs report Friday that could have implications on Fed rate policy.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% to hold just above the 42,000 price level. The S&P 500 dipped nearly 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite moved down a fraction. The small-cap Russell 2000 index lost 0.7% and is now 3.5% off its Sept. 18 high.


Volume dropped on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with consumer discretionary and materials leading the downside. The energy, technology and communication services sectors were the only advancers.


The Aug. 28 distribution day on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell off the overall count due to the passage of time, a small dose of bullish news in a mostly quiet session.


The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to its highest level since Sept. 3, closing at 3.85%.


The [probability for a 50-basis-point cut](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) in the fed funds rate — which is now at 4.75% to 5% — at the Nov. 7 Federal Open Market Committee meeting eased to 34.6% on Thursday. That's down sharply from 49.3% a week ago. Concurrently, the chances for a quarter-point cut to a range of 4.5%-4.75% ticked higher to 65.4% from 50.7% a week ago.


Ahead of Friday's stock market open, the Labor Department will release its monthly employment report. The U.S. economy is expected to add 132,500 jobs in September, down from August's 142,000 jobs. The unemployment rate is estimated to hold steady at 4.2%, per Econoday estimates.


Fed policymakers have said they are keenly watching the labor market as they gauge future interest-rate decisions.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) were among the handful of winners Thursday with gains of 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively.


On the downside, **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) were the biggest losers during the session, down 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively. But **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) combined to shave more than 75 points off the Dow.


[Most of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended lower as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) exchange traded fund fell 0.1%. Notably, Mag 7 stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) bounced bullishly from its 50-day moving average line. Conversely, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) skidded another 3.4%, and is close to adding a handle to a cup base that would make the new entry 264.86.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dipped 0.3% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) hit more new highs.


What To Do Now
--------------

Amid the stock market uptrend, IBD has an 80%-100% recommended exposure threshold, which means that investors should remain heavily invested. Investors who need to add more exposure should look for market leaders breaking out past correct entries.


But investors should avoid complacency, as the sudden drop Tuesday was a reminder that major selling could surface at anytime. The current environment still requires [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means incrementally adding and reducing exposure to stay in sync with the broad market. Watch for sell signals and other abrupt character changes in your holdings.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list featured no new stocks. Meanwhile, there are just six ideas appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list. That suggests there aren't whole lot of new buying opportunities ready to emerge.

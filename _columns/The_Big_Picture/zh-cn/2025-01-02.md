  Stock Market Kicks Off 2025 With More Losses; Apple, Tesla Slide

The stock market closed modestly lower in the first session of the new year Thursday, kicking off 2025 in the same way that 2024 ended: in the red.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4% for its fourth consecutive loss, while the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. For the S&P, it was the fifth straight drop and third straight session below its 50-day moving average. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined less than 0.2%, making it five straight down days. The small-cap Russell 2000 index outperformed with a 0.1% gain, although it had been up as much as 1.4%.




Four of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with energy and utilities pacing the gainers. The energy sector rallied around 1%, as oil prices rose to their highest levels since October, with West Texas Intermediate futures trading around $73.10 per barrel.


The consumer discretionary, materials and real estate sectors were the day's biggest losers, each down at least 1%.


Losses weren't broad: More stocks rose than fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE. First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) was flat, indicating there was more selling in the Nasdaq big caps.


Volume was slightly lower on the Nasdaq but higher on the New York Stock Exchange from Tuesday's preholiday session. The increased volume resulted in a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the S&P 500, offsetting its Nov. 25 distribution day that expired due to time. That leaves both indexes with a worrisome number of higher-volume declines over the past several weeks.

----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) were the top performers Thursday, with gains of 3% and 1.3%, respectively.


On the downside, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) sold off 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively. [News reports Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-iphone-discounts-china/) said that the consumer electronics giant cut iPhone prices in China to compete with domestic rivals such as Huawei.


In the Nasdaq 100, **Constellation Energy** ([CEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEG)) (up 8.4%) and **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) (up 3.8%) were among the best stocks on the day, while **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) and **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)) tumbled 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively.


The [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended mixed Thursday as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) dropped 0.5%. Nvidia was the biggest advancer, as it continues to build its double-bottom base below the 50-day line. Meanwhile, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) rallied 2.3% to find support at the 50-day line.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) plunged 6.1% after the [company reported record fourth-quarter deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-deliveries-q4-2024-tesla-stock/) early Thursday, but the number came in below analyst expectations. The company failed to hit its target of annual vehicle unit growth compared to 2023.


The EV maker said it produced 459,445 vehicles in Q4 and delivered 495,570 units globally. Tesla also deployed 11 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products. For the full year, Tesla energy storage deployments totaled 31.4 gigawatt-hours. Tesla delivered 1.789 million vehicles while producing 1.773 million units in 2024.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP010225-259x300.jpg)


This week's declines caused IBD to lower its recommended exposure level to 40%-60% from 80%-100% before Monday's close. And Thursday saw more losses, as the major stock indexes reversed from early gains to end lower.


On the upside, the Nasdaq found much-needed support at the 50-day line. The last time the tech-heavy index closed below that level was Sept. 11.


Amid the recent weakness, investors should continue to utilize diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). It's important to monitor positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules, especially if the major indexes continue to weaken.


If the market is able to mount a rebound, then be on the lookout for stocks breaking out past correct buy points. But relatively few stocks are setting up.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured only one new stock, while the Near Pivot list has dwindled to five stock ideas. **Ralph Lauren** ([RL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RL)) is approaching a 237.16 buy point in a consolidation.

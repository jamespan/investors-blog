The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new high Friday, as the major stock indexes rallied into the close and investors warmed up to cooler-than-expected inflation data.




The Dow moved up 0.6% to set another record close, its 26th of 2024, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 climbed 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index moved up 0.7%.


For the week, the Dow industrials rose 0.9% to extend a win streak to three weeks. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% on the week, while the Nasdaq had a weekly loss of 0.9%.


All 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher Friday, with consumer discretionary, industrials and technology the biggest winners. Volume dipped on the Nasdaq and rose substantially on the New York Stock Exchange compared with Thursday's session.


Looking ahead to the coming week, the stock market is closed Monday for Labor Day. And the U.S. Labor Department's employment report will take the spotlight on Friday.

Dow Jones Winners: Intel, Amazon
--------------------------------


Early Friday, the [core personal consumption expenditures price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/pce-price-index-july-core-inflation-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/), the Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge, showed that price pressures continued to fade in July. Yet solid wage data hinted that next week's jobs report may be stronger than expected.


Inside the Dow Jones index, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and [Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks/) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) were among the biggest gainers Friday, with advances of 9.5% and 3.7%, respectively.


On the downside, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) were among the Dow losers on the session.

What To Do Now
--------------


The Nasdaq tentatively regained its 50-day moving average, a key benchmark that the tech-heavy composite has been struggling with since Aug. 22. A decisive breach of that level that takes out Wednesday's lows would likely indicate further weakness, while a continued rebound would be bullish for the market's prospects.


Still, it's normal for the market to pull back and consolidate after a sharp rally since the Aug. 5 market low, so IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60% to 80%.


This environment clearly puts investor emphasis on [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means that incrementally raising exposure remains a priority. Investors should see how their existing positions and the latest buys perform before putting more capital to work.


For those who are making progress, it makes sense to add more exposure. If not, they should then hold off until more opportunities surface.

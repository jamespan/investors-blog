  Stocks Continue To Mend In Abbreviated Session; What If There's No Santa Claus Rally?

Santa Claus left presents for Wall Street Tuesday, as the major indexes extended a rebound during a shortened session and made investors feel better about the stock market outlook.  


The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 climbed for a third straight day, drawing closer to erasing the losses from the Dec. 18 rout.  


The S&P closed back above the 6,000 level after Tuesday's 1.1% increase. It had already regained the 50-day moving average and Tuesday closed back above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The Nasdaq led with a gain of nearly 1.4%.  




Despite a four day rally of 2.3%, the Dow remains below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) and below the 43,449 close that preceded the Dec. 18 market sell-off. The Dow climbed 0.9% Tuesday.  


The Russell 2000 rose but is a clear laggard in December, down more than 7% for the month. Small caps, often more sensitive to interest rates, have been hurt at least partly by a surge in the 10-year Treasury yield. The yield is up about 50 basis points from a Dec. 6 low.  


Recommended Exposure Level Raised
---------------------------------


Volume fell by about 2 billion shares each on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, because the stock market closed early at 1 p.m. ET. Financial markets will be closed all day Wednesday for Christmas.  


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund, which found support at its 50-day line the past few days, outperformed with a brilliant 4.2% jump.  


With the Nasdaq and S&P regaining important chart levels and growth leaders also rebounding, IBD on Tuesday raised its recommended exposure level to 80%-100% after several days at 60%-80%. Investors can now buy some stocks or add to existing positions — carefully.  


There's a limited supply of institutional-quality stocks near buy points. Moreover, some bearish market trends remain that investors must take into account as they seek to increase exposure.  


Distribution, Breadth Hurt Stock Market
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP122424.jpg)[Distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) have piled up the past 2-1/2 weeks in the Nasdaq. Four days of heavier-volume losses suggest institutional investors are taking profits.  


Market breadth remains an issue, too.  


As [The Big Picture mentioned Monday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-risks-nasdaq-dow-jones-sp500-small-caps/), the advance-decline lines of the NYSE and Nasdaq are trending lower this month and diverging from the main indexes.  


IBD's tracking of [52-week highs and lows](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-dec-23-2024/) (which excludes stocks with [EPS Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) below 60) also shows a bearish trend. Since Dec. 13, the number of new lows have topped new highs almost every day.  


To understand the divergence, investor just need to compare the performance of various indexes in December. In short, big caps and growth stocks have dominated while other indexes lag.  


The iShares S&P 500 100 ETF ([OEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OEF)), which tracks the S&P 100 index, found support in a pullback to its 50-day moving average Friday and has bounced to nearly a new high. It's up 2.5% this month.  


Vanguard Megacap ETF ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)) is up 1% and iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) is up 4.6% in December. No wonder the growth-focused Nasdaq is up 4.2% this month.  


But indexes with less exposure to growth and big caps tell a different story. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) is down more than 5%; First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) is off 2.5%; and iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) is down 6.2%.  


Historic Performance Of Santa Claus Rally
-----------------------------------------


Tuesday marked the beginning of the Santa Claus Rally, a seasonal phenomenon first discovered by the editors of the Stock Trader's Almanac in 1972. They found that the stock market tends to climb in the final five sessions of the year and the first two of the following year.  


Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, says that since 1950, the S&P 500 (or its predecessor) has generated average returns of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period. That beats the market's average seven-day return of 0.3%.

The Santa Claus Rally also correlates closely to January and following year's returns, Turnquist added.  


"When investors are on the 'nice' list, and Santa delivers a positive Santa Claus Rally return, the S&P 500 has generated an average January and forward annual return of 1.4% and 10.4%, respectively," Turnquist wrote in a report.  


But what if there's no Santa rally and stocks fall from here until Jan. 3? The S&P 500 historically has fallen an average of 0.02% in January. It also climbed an relatively soft 5% for the following year.  


The Stock Trader's Almanac puts it in more gloomy terms. "Santa's failure to show tends to precede bear markets, or times (that) stocks could be purchased later in the year at much lower prices."

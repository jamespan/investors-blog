The stock market ended Friday mixed despite a key inflation gauge coming in cooler than expected. The latest jobs report and a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell now loom in the coming week.  
尽管一项关键的通胀指标低于预期，但股市周五收盘涨跌互现。最新的就业报告和美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔的讲话将在未来一周内公布。




The Nasdaq composite had the toughest session out of the major indexes Friday, dropping 0.4%. Nevertheless, it notched a weekly gain of 1% and is now up 2.3% for September.  
纳斯达克综合指数周五在主要指数中表现最艰难，下跌 0.4%。尽管如此，它还是录得 1% 的周涨幅，目前 9 月份上涨了 2.3%。


The tech-heavy index sits clear of its short-term moving averages as well as its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It also holds a gain of 20.7% for the year so far. The index also lost its Aug. 22 distribution day due to time.  
这个以科技股为主的指数避开了短期移动平均线和 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)。到目前为止，它还保持了今年 20.7% 的涨幅。由于时间原因，该指数也失去了 8 月 22 日的分发日。


The S&P 500 reversed lower, falling 0.1% Friday. The benchmark index rose 0.6% for the week and holds a 1.6% gain for the month. The index sits near an all-time high and is up 20.3% in 2024.  
标准普尔 500 指数反转走低，周五下跌 0.1%。基准指数本周上涨 0.6%，本月上涨 1.6%。该指数接近历史高位，2024 年上涨 20.3%。


Advancers led decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both indexes.  
纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克的涨幅领跌。这两个指数的成交量均较低。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high after rising 0.3% Friday. Its weekly gain came in at 0.6%. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) fared best on the much-watched index while **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) lagged.  
道琼斯工业平均指数周五上涨 0.3% 后收于历史新高。其每周涨幅为 0.6%。**雪佛龙** （[CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)） 和 **Visa** （[V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)） 在备受关注的指数中表现最佳，而 **Amazon.com** （[AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)） 则落后。


Small caps outperformed Friday, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.7%. Despite this, the Russell ended the week down 0.6%. Growth stocks were also solid, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund ending the session up 0.6%. It held above its major moving averages despite a weekly decline of 0.9%.  
小盘股周五跑赢大盘股，罗素 2000 指数上涨 0.7%。尽管如此，罗素指数本周收盘下跌 0.6%。成长型股票也很稳健，Innovator IBD 50 （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 交易所交易基金收盘上涨 0.6%。尽管每周下跌 0.9%，但它仍高于其主要移动平均线。


Powell Speech, Jobs Report Due鲍威尔讲话，就业报告即将公布
--------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP092724.jpg)Friday's big report indicated that inflation was subsiding, which bolstered the Fed's recent move to cut rates. The Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index for August rose 0.1%, in line with economist estimates. It was up 2.2% year-over-year, below views for 2.3%. Core PCE, which strips volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.1% vs. July, lower than expected. The annual lift of 2.7% was in line.  
周五的大报告显示，通胀正在消退，这支持了美联储最近的降息举措。8 月份个人消费支出价格指数上涨 0.1%，与经济学家的估计一致。它同比增长 2.2%，低于 2.3% 的观察结果。剔除波动较大的食品和能源价格的核心 PCE 较 7 月份上涨 0.1%，低于预期。2.7% 的年增长率是一致的。


Fed Chair Powell will be giving a speech at the National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting on Monday, which could offer further insight into future policy.  
美联储主席鲍威尔将于周一在全国商业经济学协会年会上发表演讲，这可能会为未来政策提供进一步的见解。


With the Fed now focusing more on the employment side of its dual mandate, labor data is even more important. The coming week sees a slew of reports. Job openings are set to drop on Tuesday while the ADP employment report is slated for Wednesday.  
随着美联储现在更加关注其双重任务的就业方面，劳动力数据变得更加重要。未来一周将看到大量报告。职位空缺将于周二下降，而 ADP 就业报告定于周三发布。


But the key reading comes Friday, when the U.S. employment report is released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfarm payrolls are seen rising by 142,000 while the unemployment rate is seen coming in at 4.2%, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).  
但关键数据出现在周五，届时美国劳工统计局将发布美国就业报告。[根据 Econoday 的数据](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)，非农就业人数预计将增加 142,000 人，而失业率预计为 4.2%。


It's the tail end of the current earnings season, but there are a few [noteworthy reports due over the next week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-nike-rallies-powerfully-ahead-of-results/). These include cruise operator **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)), Dow Jones giant **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Paychex** ([PAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAX)) and **Levi's** ([LEVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEVI)).  
这是当前财报季的尾声，但[下周将发布一些值得注意的报告](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-nike-rallies-powerfully-ahead-of-results/)。其中包括邮轮运营商嘉**年华** （[CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)）、道琼斯巨头**耐克** （[NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)）、**Paychex** （[PAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAX)） 和 **Levi's** （[LEVI）。](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEVI)

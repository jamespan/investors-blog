The stock market ended Friday mixed despite a key inflation gauge coming in cooler than expected. The latest jobs report and a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell now loom in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite had the toughest session out of the major indexes Friday, dropping 0.4%. Nevertheless, it notched a weekly gain of 1% and is now up 2.3% for September.


The tech-heavy index sits clear of its short-term moving averages as well as its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It also holds a gain of 20.7% for the year so far. The index also lost its Aug. 22 distribution day due to time.


The S&P 500 reversed lower, falling 0.1% Friday. The benchmark index rose 0.6% for the week and holds a 1.6% gain for the month. The index sits near an all-time high and is up 20.3% in 2024.


Advancers led decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both indexes.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high after rising 0.3% Friday. Its weekly gain came in at 0.6%. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) fared best on the much-watched index while **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) lagged.


Small caps outperformed Friday, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.7%. Despite this, the Russell ended the week down 0.6%. Growth stocks were also solid, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund ending the session up 0.6%. It held above its major moving averages despite a weekly decline of 0.9%.


Powell Speech, Jobs Report Due
------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP092724.jpg)Friday's big report indicated that inflation was subsiding, which bolstered the Fed's recent move to cut rates. The Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index for August rose 0.1%, in line with economist estimates. It was up 2.2% year-over-year, below views for 2.3%. Core PCE, which strips volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.1% vs. July, lower than expected. The annual lift of 2.7% was in line.


Fed Chair Powell will be giving a speech at the National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting on Monday, which could offer further insight into future policy.


With the Fed now focusing more on the employment side of its dual mandate, labor data is even more important. The coming week sees a slew of reports. Job openings are set to drop on Tuesday while the ADP employment report is slated for Wednesday.


But the key reading comes Friday, when the U.S. employment report is released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfarm payrolls are seen rising by 142,000 while the unemployment rate is seen coming in at 4.2%, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


It's the tail end of the current earnings season, but there are a few [noteworthy reports due over the next week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-nike-rallies-powerfully-ahead-of-results/). These include cruise operator **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)), Dow Jones giant **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Paychex** ([PAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAX)) and **Levi's** ([LEVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEVI)).

Chipmaker **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) pulled back sharply on the stock market Friday following its previous low-volume breakout, a bearish sign. It ended the day back in its buy zone above a cup-with-handle entry of 175.45.

The major indexes got off to a positive start Tuesday after inflation data came in lighter than expected. But the relief didn't hold, as seesaw action left the stock market mixed. Investors are shifting their focus to another inflation report on Wednesday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed near session highs for the second straight day, with a 0.5% gain. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) gave the Dow much of its strength, but **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) lagged. Nvidia extended its losses for the fifth straight day.




The S&P 500 closed up 0.1% after erratic trading. The Nasdaq composite closed in the lower half its trading range and ended the day down more than 0.2%. It was the Nasdaq's fifth straight decline.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and the NYSE from Monday's totals.


The stock market faces another big test with the consumer price index for December due Wednesday. Earnings season will gather speed with a few major banks reporting Wednesday.


After a positive reversal Monday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 weren't able to sustain the buying into Tuesday's close. With all three major indexes remaining below the 50-day moving average, Investor's Business Daily maintained its recommended exposure at 20%-40%.


A bright spot in Tuesday's action was the Russell 2000, which extended a rebound from the 200-day moving average with a 1.1% gain.


Stock Market Breadth Mixed
--------------------------


Despite the mixed close, advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and nearly 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq. But stocks [making new highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jan-13-2025/) have been few while those making new lows have been hitting triple digits over the past four trading sessions on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

Equal-weighted exchange traded funds outperformed, indicating that big caps were relatively weaker.  The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) gained 0.8% while the top 100 S&P stocks underperformed. The iShares S&P 100 ETF ([OEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OEF)) fell 0.2% on Tuesday.


The S&P's biggest winners were **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)), **Celanese** ([CE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CE)) and energy stock **Vistra** ([VST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VST)), one of Tuesday's additions to [IBD SwingTrader.](https://swingtrader.investors.com/)


United Rentals (which rose on [news of an acquisition](https://www.investors.com/news/united-rentals-sp-500-he-equipment-services-deal-pauses-repurchase-plan/)) and Celanese are trying to rebound from downtrends. But Vistra moved into a buy zone from a buy point of 168.67. **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) weighed the most on the S&P 500.



Inflation headed in the right direction on Tuesday. The producer price index increased 0.2% in December, lower than economists' projected 0.3% rise. Year over year, inflation was in line with expectations and rose 3.3%. But the real surprise lay in core inflation, which was unchanged vs.  estimates of a 0.2% increase. Annual prices that producers received edged above estimates of 3.4%.


The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note drooped two basis points to 4.78%.


On Wednesday, the consumer price index is due before the opening bell. Economists expect an increase of 0.3% from November and 2.9% annually. Core inflation estimates sit at a 0.2% monthly increase and a 3.3% annual gain. Investors will also get a reading on the retail sector Thursday, with retail sales for December expected to rise 0.5%.


Potential tariffs from the Trump administration and export curbs by the Biden administration are adding some uncertainty to the market outlook. Meanwhile, Treasury yields near 14-month highs and upcoming earnings reports will test a market that many consider richly valued.

The laggards of 2024 are rotating into market leadership. Energy, health care and materials are taking positions as top [January winners](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/from-worst-to-first-last-years-stock-market-laggards-see-strong-start-to-2025-a4a307d5). The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) has gained 5.3% year to date. Health Care Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) has risen 1.7%, while Materials Select Sector SPDR ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) has tacked on 3.6. In comparison, the technology and software sector funds are down roughly 2% in the new year.

Major stock indexes eked out modest gains in the stock market Tuesday as a weak reading on U.S. consumer confidence was offset by big gains for Chinese stocks.




Stocks opened slightly higher, shrugging off a big move for China indexes overnight. The Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index both jumped 4.1% after China announced a series of [stimulus measures](https://www.investors.com/news/peoples-bank-china-stimulus-biggest-since-covid-alibaba-jd-nio-fcx-alb-cat/) to prop up an economy that's been slow to recover.


The Krane CSI China Internet ETF ([KWEB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KWEB)) soared 10%, helped by strong gains for top holdings **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)). Tencent gapped out of a 19-week flat base with a 50.89 entry. The 5% buy zone went up to 53.43.


The news out of China fueled big moves for several copper producers in IBD's Mining-Metal Ores group. **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) and **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) gapped up and closed with gains of 7% and 8%, respectively. But both stocks are still more than 10% off their highs.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq climbed more than 0.5% and retook the 18,000 level. But it stopped short of taking out last week's high near 18,100. Volume rose slightly from Monday and breadth was just OK, with winners beating losers by about 4-to-3.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) jumped 4% and gave an early buy signal to aggressive traders. But with the stock still below its late-August high, Nvidia still has [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/david-ryan-how-to-spot-and-understand-overhead-supply) to work through after several higher-volume declines since late July.


**Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), also known as TSMC, jumped 4% and reclaimed a 175.45 handle entry.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP092424--227x300.jpg)Besides Nvidia, other top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), up more than 2%. Netflix topped a 697.49 entry last month but never got going. But five weeks of sideways price action brought an alternate buy point at 711.43 into play. Netflix is still in the buy zone from both entries.


The S&P 500 reversed slightly higher for a gain of nearly 0.3%, good for an all-time closing high. Volume also rose on the NYSE as advancing stocks beat decliners by about 8-to-5.


NYSE-listed **Smartsheet** ([SMAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMAR)) surged 6.5% on news [it's being taken private](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/smartsheet-stock-blackstone-vista-equity-acquire-software-maker/) by private equity firms Vista Equity Partners and **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)) in an $8.4 billion transaction.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2% and hit another all-time high despite a 5.5% downdraft for **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)). Shares slumped after the Justice Department [filed an antitrust suit](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-stock-antitrust-doj-debit-card-credit-card-chargeoffs/) against the company, accusing it of monopolizing the debit-card market.


The Russell 2000 also gained 0.2% as the small-cap index sets up for a possible upside breakout. A move above last week's high of 2,259.25 would do it.


Weak Consumer Confidence
------------------------


The selling picked up the pace in the stock market just after 10 a.m. ET, when the latest reading on consumer confidence came in much weaker than expected. While August's Consumer Confidence Index reading was revised slightly higher to 105.6, September's reading of 98.7 was well below the 103 consensus estimate. But buyers started pushing indexes higher again around 10:45 a.m. ET.


The next notable piece of economic data comes Friday with the release of the Personal Income & Spending report for August. Inside the report, the core personal consumption expenditures index, on a year-over-year basis, is expected to rise slightly to 2.7% from 2.6% in July. But after a big rate cut by the Federal Reserve last week, committee members are more focused on the underlying health of the economy rather than a sudden pickup in inflation.


With the stock market still acting well and major stock indexes at or near all-time highs, it makes sense to have aggressive exposure to stocks.


Plenty of top-rated growth stocks — including [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) names **SharkNinja** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)), **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Ensign Group** ([ENSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENSG)) — are well extended past proper entry points.


But the stock market did serve up a few technical breakouts early in the session. In the restaurant group, **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) continued its low-volume rally but a 1.4% intraday gain faded to a loss of 0.2% by the close.


Group peer **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) also tried to break out but it also erased early gains. Note that the stock tried to break out with a lagging [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/).

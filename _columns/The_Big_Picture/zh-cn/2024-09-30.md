The stock market was on its way to another day of mild action until Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech set sellers loose. Yet, bulls ultimately prevailed and the S&P 500 closed with another record high.  
股市正在进入又一个温和的一天，直到美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔的讲话让卖家松手。然而，多头最终占了上风，标准普尔 500 指数以另一个历史新高收盘。




The major indexes tripped after Powell's remarks became public around 2 p.m. ET. While his prepared comments didn't have any big surprises, the Fed chair suggested that another half-point rate cut is unlikely this year.  
鲍威尔的言论在美国东部时间下午 2 点左右公开后，主要股指下跌。虽然他准备好的评论没有任何大的惊喜，但这位美联储主席表示，今年不太可能再次降息半个基点。


"This is not a committee that feels like it's in a hurry to cut rates quickly," he said in [comments to participants](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-futures-dip-as-investors-await-key-economic-data?mod=home-page) at the National Association for Business Economics in Nashville, Tenn. As he did at the rate-cut decision earlier this month, Powell said economic data will guide the Fed's path.  
“这不是一个急于快速降息的委员会，”他在田纳西州纳什维尔的全国商业经济学协会（National Association for Business Economics）[上对与会者发表评论](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-futures-dip-as-investors-await-key-economic-data?mod=home-page)时说。正如他在本月早些时候的降息决定中所做的那样，鲍威尔表示，经济数据将指导美联储的路径。


The S&P 500 was down slightly and suddenly lurched lower when the Powell headlines came out. It fell as much as 0.6% in the initial stock market reaction. The Nasdaq, which had been nearly unchanged, dropped as much as 0.5%.  
标准普尔 500 指数小幅下跌，当鲍威尔的头条新闻公布时突然走低。在股市的最初反应中，它下跌了 0.6%。几乎没有变化的纳斯达克指数下跌了 0.5%。


But both indexes bounced back and rallied in the final half-hour of trading. The S&P and Nasdaq rose 0.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed fractionally higher. The Dow also hit an all-time closing high.  
但这两个指数在交易的最后半小时都反弹并反弹。标准普尔和纳斯达克指数上涨 0.4%，而道琼斯工业平均指数收盘小幅上涨。道琼斯指数也创下历史收盘新高。


Small caps also jumped late, with the Russell 2000 increasing 0.2% and at the day's highs. Its 2,200 level appears to be firming.  
小盘股尾盘也尾盘上涨，罗素 2000 指数上涨 0.2%，处于当天高点。其 2,200 水平似乎正在走稳。


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Friday's totals.  
纳斯达克和纽约证券交易所的成交量较上周五的成交量有所增加。


Stock Market Caps A Winning September股市上涨 9 月
---------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP093024.jpg)The stock market closed the month with a 2% gain for the S&P 500 — its fifth consecutive monthly gain. The Dow also climbed for a fifth-straight month — up nearly 1.9% — while the Nasdaq added 2.6%. All three major indexes had been down as much as 5.8% in September but bounced back.  
股市上月收盘时，标准普尔 500 指数上涨 2%，这是连续第五个月上涨。道琼斯指数也连续第五个月攀升，上涨近 1.9%，而纳斯达克指数上涨 2.6%。三大指数在 9 月份均下跌了 5.8%，但随后反弹。


Not a bad performance for what's historically the worst month of the year in the stock market.  
对于历史上股市一年中最糟糕的月份来说，这是一个不错的表现。


Fresh off a three-week win streak, the main indexes go into the final quarter of 2024 with some momentum, even while indexes have moderated since the mid-September surge. The amount of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), though, is a bit high.  
刚刚连续三周上涨后，主要指数以一定的势头进入 2024 年最后一个季度，尽管指数自 9 月中旬飙升以来有所放缓。不过，[分发天数](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/)有点高。


Barring any new bearish signals, IBD continues to recommend 80%-100% exposure to stocks.  
除非出现任何新的看跌信号，否则 IBD 继续建议 80%-100% 的股票敞口。


On Tuesday, a series of economic reports will land, including readings on manufacturing and job openings.  
周二，一系列经济报告将发布，包括制造业和职位空缺数据。


Keep in mind that the stock market faces some risks that aren't necessarily in the form of economic data. Dockworkers were set to go on strike at midnight. Port shutdowns would have ripple effects across the U.S. economy. Israel is stepping up military operations into Lebanon, as the Middle East conflict widens. Farther off in the distance, election uncertainty is another Wall Street worry.  
请记住，股市面临一些风险，这些风险不一定以经济数据的形式出现。码头工人原定在午夜罢工。港口关闭将对整个美国经济产生连锁反应。随着中东冲突的扩大，以色列正在加大对黎巴嫩的军事行动。在更远的地方，选举的不确定性是华尔街的另一个担忧。


Stock Market Leadership 股票市场领导地位
--------------------------------


Among the breakouts in the MarketSurge 250 index, there's been some success. **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) are some of those.  
在 MarketSurge 250 指数的突破中，取得了一些成功。**Corcept Therapeutics** （[CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)）、**JD.com** （[JD）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD) 和 **Booking Holdings** （[BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)） 就是其中的一部分。


There's not many technology stocks in the current leadership. **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) broke out of a cup with handle Sept. 19 but has backtracked an 8% gain from the 175.45 buy point. **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) hasn't been able to break out of its own cup with handle.  
目前的领导层中没有多少科技股。**台积电** （[TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)） 在 9 月 19 日突破了带手柄的杯子，但已从 175.45 买入点回落了 8% 的涨幅。**Arm** （[ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)） 无法打破自己的带手柄杯。


Rather, the leadership in today's stock market rests mainly in industrial, financial, utility and building-related industries.  
相反，当今股市的领导地位主要在于工业、金融、公用事业和建筑相关行业。


The IBD 50 index added 0.5% Monday. Health care leaders such as **Hims & Hers** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)), **ADMA Biologics** ([ADMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADMA)) and **BeiGene** ([BGNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGNE)) led the index.  
IBD 50 指数周一上涨 0.5%。如**Hims & Hers**（[HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)）、**ADMA Biologics**（[ADMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADMA)）和**BeiGene**（[BGNE）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGNE)等医疗保健领导者引领了该指数。


Traders Cut Odds Of Half-Point Rate Cut交易员降低半个百分点的降息几率
------------------------------------------------------


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose nearly five basis points to 3.78%. The two-year yield, which is more sensitive to the fed funds rate, rose eight basis points to 3.65%.  
10 年期美国国债收益率上涨近 5 个基点至 3.78%。对联邦基金利率更敏感的两年期国债收益率上涨 8 个基点至 3.65%。


After Powell's comments, odds for a half-point rate cut at the November policy meeting fell to 36%, from more than 53% before the speech, according to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html).  
根据 [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) 的数据，鲍威尔发表评论后，在 11 月政策会议上降息半个基点的几率从讲话前的 53% 以上降至 36%。


Powell echoed comments that the economy remains sound and that with "an appropriate recalibration" of policy, the labor market can avoid trouble while inflation moves further down.  
鲍威尔回应了经济仍然稳健的评论，并且通过“适当调整”政策，劳动力市场可以在通胀进一步下降的同时避免麻烦。


Earlier Monday, Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman said that while inflation is cooling, "core inflation is still uncomfortably above" the Fed's 2% target.  
周一早些时候，美联储理事米歇尔·鲍曼 （Michelle Bowman） 表示，虽然通胀正在降温，但“核心通胀率仍令人不安地高于”美联储 2% 的目标。


Bowman, who was the lone dissenting vote on the Fed's half-point rate cut Sept. 18, explained that a "more measured approach would have avoided the risk of [unintentionally signaling concerns](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240930a.htm) about underlying economic conditions." She also worried that bringing rates down too fast could raise expectations for a similar cut at a later meeting and that it could risk unleashing pent-up demand.  
鲍曼是 9 月 18 日对美联储降息半个基点的唯一反对票，他解释说，“更谨慎的方法可以避免无[意中发出对](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240930a.htm)潜在经济状况的担忧的风险。她还担心，过快降息可能会提高对稍后会议上类似降息的预期，并可能释放被压抑的需求。

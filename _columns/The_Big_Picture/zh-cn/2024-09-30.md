  Stock Market Fights Back After Powell Speech; Where Market Leadership Is Right Now

The stock market was on its way to another day of mild action until Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech set sellers loose. Yet, bulls ultimately prevailed and the S&P 500 closed with another record high.




The major indexes tripped after Powell's remarks became public around 2 p.m. ET. While his prepared comments didn't have any big surprises, the Fed chair suggested that another half-point rate cut is unlikely this year.


"This is not a committee that feels like it's in a hurry to cut rates quickly," he said in [comments to participants](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-futures-dip-as-investors-await-key-economic-data?mod=home-page) at the National Association for Business Economics in Nashville, Tenn. As he did at the rate-cut decision earlier this month, Powell said economic data will guide the Fed's path.


The S&P 500 was down slightly and suddenly lurched lower when the Powell headlines came out. It fell as much as 0.6% in the initial stock market reaction. The Nasdaq, which had been nearly unchanged, dropped as much as 0.5%.


But both indexes bounced back and rallied in the final half-hour of trading. The S&P and Nasdaq rose 0.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed fractionally higher. The Dow also hit an all-time closing high.


Small caps also jumped late, with the Russell 2000 increasing 0.2% and at the day's highs. Its 2,200 level appears to be firming.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Friday's totals.


Stock Market Caps A Winning September
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP093024.jpg)The stock market closed the month with a 2% gain for the S&P 500 — its fifth consecutive monthly gain. The Dow also climbed for a fifth-straight month — up nearly 1.9% — while the Nasdaq added 2.6%. All three major indexes had been down as much as 5.8% in September but bounced back.


Not a bad performance for what's historically the worst month of the year in the stock market.


Fresh off a three-week win streak, the main indexes go into the final quarter of 2024 with some momentum, even while indexes have moderated since the mid-September surge. The amount of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), though, is a bit high.


Barring any new bearish signals, IBD continues to recommend 80%-100% exposure to stocks.


On Tuesday, a series of economic reports will land, including readings on manufacturing and job openings.


Keep in mind that the stock market faces some risks that aren't necessarily in the form of economic data. Dockworkers were set to go on strike at midnight. Port shutdowns would have ripple effects across the U.S. economy. Israel is stepping up military operations into Lebanon, as the Middle East conflict widens. Farther off in the distance, election uncertainty is another Wall Street worry.


Stock Market Leadership
-----------------------


Among the breakouts in the MarketSurge 250 index, there's been some success. **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) are some of those.


There's not many technology stocks in the current leadership. **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) broke out of a cup with handle Sept. 19 but has backtracked an 8% gain from the 175.45 buy point. **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) hasn't been able to break out of its own cup with handle.


Rather, the leadership in today's stock market rests mainly in industrial, financial, utility and building-related industries.


The IBD 50 index added 0.5% Monday. Health care leaders such as **Hims & Hers** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)), **ADMA Biologics** ([ADMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADMA)) and **BeiGene** ([BGNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGNE)) led the index.


Traders Cut Odds Of Half-Point Rate Cut
---------------------------------------


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose nearly five basis points to 3.78%. The two-year yield, which is more sensitive to the fed funds rate, rose eight basis points to 3.65%.


After Powell's comments, odds for a half-point rate cut at the November policy meeting fell to 36%, from more than 53% before the speech, according to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html).


Powell echoed comments that the economy remains sound and that with "an appropriate recalibration" of policy, the labor market can avoid trouble while inflation moves further down.


Earlier Monday, Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman said that while inflation is cooling, "core inflation is still uncomfortably above" the Fed's 2% target.


Bowman, who was the lone dissenting vote on the Fed's half-point rate cut Sept. 18, explained that a "more measured approach would have avoided the risk of [unintentionally signaling concerns](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240930a.htm) about underlying economic conditions." She also worried that bringing rates down too fast could raise expectations for a similar cut at a later meeting and that it could risk unleashing pent-up demand.

Considering all the stock market has already gone through this week — a rumble in the artificial intelligence trade and a decision from the Federal Reserve — it's holding up rather well. After the close Wednesday, a few major earnings reports added to a hectic week.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished 0.5% lower, as their trading ranges held inside the prior day's highs and lows. That's a sign volatility is returning to normal after Monday's rout in AI-related stocks.




On Monday, the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX for short, shot up to its highest level since Dec. 20. The VIX spiked more than 20% above its 10-day moving average, a sign of elevated market fear that, ironically, often signals market lows.


Will the market continue to hold up?


Despite seesaw trading Wednesday, the major stock market indexes passed important tests. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 held above their 50-day moving average, the spot of a dangerous break on Monday. Both indexes also avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) because volume fell on the Nasdaq as well as the New York Stock Exchange. Declining stocks led advancers by 12-to-7 on the NYSE and by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.


Leading growth stocks showed relative strength as Investor's Business Daily's IBD 50 index added 0.3%.


The Nasdaq 100 index, down 0.2%, also held above its 50-day line. The Russell 2000 small-cap index lost less than 0.3% but has met resistance at the 50-day moving average. The S&P MidCap 400 index lost 0.4% and closed slightly below its 50-day average.


Dow Leading Stock Market
------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP012925-.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3% but is the only major index that's up this week so far, nearly 0.7%. On Wednesday, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) combined for most of the Dow's 136-point loss.


The Dow industrials, which lagged in 2024's superb market performance, are this year's early leaders. The index is up more than 5%, compared with a 2.7% gain for the S&P and a 1.7% increase for the Nasdaq. The Russell 2000 is up 2.4%.


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) are among the components carrying the Dow's performance in 2025.


Despite the stock market's weakness Wednesday, a few high-rated stocks extended a trend of breakouts from proper bases. Even while AI-related stocks have taken a beating this week, buy opportunities are emerging in other sectors, including financials.


On Wednesday, **Stifel Financial** ([SF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SF)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base in heavy volume. The firm [beat fourth-quarter views](https://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/stifel-financial-stock-earnings-e7572af1?mod=md_stockoverview_news) and raised its quarterly dividend.


Scores of earlier breakouts are adding gains.


Big Earnings After Market Close
-------------------------------


After the close Wednesday, Microsoft, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) were mixed after their quarterly reports were released. In sum, the stock market appeared to be more or less content. Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which counts with those stocks among its largest holdings, was up 0.4% in extended trading. S&P 500 futures rose modestly.


Stocks traded lower Wednesday morning and fell some more when the Fed released its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET. Yet, the major indexes came off session lows as Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke to reporters.


As most expected, the Fed funds rate was left unchanged. But in a significant change, the policy statement removed prior phrasing about improvement on inflation, and instead cited that "inflation remains somewhat elevated."


Still, Powell [sounded relatively upbeat](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-jan-jerome-powell-trump-tariffs-sp-500/) although still cautious about cutting interest rates.


Waiting To See What Inflation Does
----------------------------------


Economists and analysts now expect the Fed to wait and see what happens with inflation and a number of factors that may influence prices.


"After reducing the federal funds rate by 100 basis points (or one percentage point) over the past three meetings, to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, it looks like a plateau has been reached," said Kathy Jones, managing director and chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. Jones made her comments in a post on Schwab's website.


She added: "With inflation stalled above the Fed's 2% target, the unemployment rate low, and economic growth running in the 2.5% to 3.0% range, there is little reason for adjusting policy." Jones also said there are risks on tariffs, immigration and taxes that could push up inflation.


Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Economic Research at Fitch Ratings, said in an email he expects the Fed to proceed carefully.


"The glide path is still in favor of a soft landing. However, the uncertainty around tariffs and labor supply will keep the Fed on its toes," Sonola said. "Inflation and inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted, and a Fed that preaches data dependence will be reluctant to front-run ever-changing policy. It's looking more like a wait-and-see Fed."

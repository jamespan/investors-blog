Small caps shined Wednesday as the major indexes battled back from the prior session's stumble and showed that the stock market can brush aside an occasional day of heavy selling.


The S&P 500 bounced 0.5% as financials and utilities performed best. The Nasdaq composite, which shed 1% Tuesday, regained a more moderate 0.3%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index made a mild gain, while software and other technology groups made up 11 of the 22 worst-performing industry groups Wednesday.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8% to a record closing high. Rebounds by **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) contributed nearly 150 points to the Dow's 337-point gain.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, although breadth was positive. Keep in mind that Tuesday's volume was the highest so far this month.


Advancers topped decliners by about 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by about 13-to-4 on the NYSE, according to FactSet. The ratio of [52-week highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-15-2024/) to new lows continues to favor bulls.


The IBD 50 index, a gauge of growth leaders, rose 0.5%. It extended a 2 1/2-month uptrend.


Stock Market Responds To Distribution Day
-----------------------------------------


One day after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 logged a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/), buyers quickly stepped in. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq didn't quite make up Tuesday's losses, but the Dow surpassed Monday's close of 43,065.


In a sign of stock market resilience, indexes have tended to recover soon from bouts of institutional-size selling i.e., distribution days.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP101624.jpg)The Nasdaq responded to its distribution days on Sept. 20, Oct. 1, and Oct. 7 with rebounds within a few days, if not the very next session. The same can be said of the S&P 500's Sept. 17 stalling day and its distribution days on Sept. 18 and Oct. 7.


That's not to downplay the importance of distribution days. They are especially helpful in spotting stealth selling even while the stock market is rising.


But the way the major indexes are behaving, there's reason for optimism. The current tally of four distribution days each on the Nasdaq and S&P is tolerable.


Other signs support the case for 80%-100% exposure, as IBD currently recommends. One of those is the re-emergence of small caps.


Small Caps Boost Stock Market
-----------------------------


The Russell 2000 made a 52-week closing high after the index climbed 1.6% Wednesday. It was the highest close since November 2021, and the fourth consecutive gain.


So far this month, the Russell is up 2.5%, outperforming the Nasdaq's 1% gain, the S&P 500's 1.4% climb, and the Dow's 1.8% increase.


With the economic growth outlook improving and better visibility into interest-rate cuts, the Russell has rallied off the lows of its rising price channel, says Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial. Further, strength in banking stocks, which make up the index's largest sector by weighting, has offered support.


"Despite the improving absolute performance, the (Russell) vs. S&P 500 ratio chart still remains in a downtrend and below its declining 200-day moving average," Turnquist said in a report to clients. "A close above the July highs would validate a trend reversal in favor of small caps outperforming."


By some measures, 40% of the Russell 2000 index companies on the stock market are not profitable. But while not as abundant as midcaps and big-cap leaders, investors can find some good small-cap choices.


In the IBD 50, **TG Therapeutics** ([TGTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGTX)), with a market cap of $2.79 billion, regained its 50-day moving average. A large number on the list have market caps below $5 billion, including **Harrow** ([HROW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HROW)), **Atour Lifestyle** ([ATAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATAT)), **Vital Farms** ([VITL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VITL)) and **Travere Therapeutics** ([TVTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TVTX)).


Also, there's **Argan** ([AGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGX)), **Hims & Hers** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)), **Powell Industries** ([POWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWL)) and **BBB Foods** ([TBBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBBB)), the latter of which was Wednesday's [IBD 50 Stocks to Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/bbb-foods-tbbb-stock-grocery-store/).


Breakouts To Watch
------------------


In another positive sign, several more high-rated stocks topped buy points in Wednesday's trading, mainly in health care.


**United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)) broke out of a flat base in active trading. **Globus Medical** ([GMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMED)) cleared the 74.21 buy point of another flat base. And **Alnylam Pharmaceuticals** ([ALNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALNY)) broke out above a 287.55 buy point.

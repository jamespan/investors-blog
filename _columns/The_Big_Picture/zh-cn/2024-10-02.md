The stock market made a muffled rebound on Wednesday. It came a day after Middle East tensions cranked higher following Iran's barrage of 180 missiles at Israel, an attack that led to little damage. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged a response.  
股市周三出现了沉闷的反弹。此前一天，伊朗向以色列发射了 180 枚导弹，这次袭击几乎没有造成什么破坏，中东紧张局势加剧。以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡 （Benjamin Netanyahu） 承诺做出回应。




None of the major equity indexes waged a gain of 0.1% or more. The Nasdaq composite rose almost 15 points, or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 inched up 0.79 point. Small caps dipped ever so slightly; the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund edged down 0.30 point. Finally, the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average rose all of 39 points, even though at least seven of its 30 components rose 1 point or more.  
没有一个主要股指上涨 0.1% 或更多。纳斯达克综合指数上涨近 15 点，涨幅不到 0.1%。标准普尔 500 指数小幅上涨 0.79 点。小盘股小幅下跌;iShares Russell 2000 （[IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)） 交易所交易基金小幅下跌 0.30 点。最后，价格加权道琼斯工业平均指数全部上涨了 39 点，尽管其 30 个成分股中至少有 7 个上涨了 1 点或更多。

-----------------------


The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq exchange, inched about 0.1% ahead. Yet the index reversed nicely after falling nearly 0.7% in early trading. The rebound followed a 1.4% shellacking on Tuesday.  
追踪纳斯达克交易所 100 家最大的非金融公司的纳斯达克 100 指数小幅上涨约 0.1%。然而，该指数在早盘交易中下跌近 0.7% 后出现良好反转。在周二下跌 1.4% 之后反弹。


A [MarketSurge daily chart](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) shows the Nasdaq 100 — as well as its tracking ETF, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) — finding support at the rising 21-day exponential moving average. QQQ retook its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Sept. 11.  
[MarketSurge 日线图](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF)显示纳斯达克 100 指数及其跟踪 ETF Invesco QQQ Trust （[QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)） 在上升的 21 天指数移动平均线找到支撑。QQQ 在 9 月 11 日重新夺回了其 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)。


The tiny moves by the stock market benchmarks telegraphed a wait-and-see mode for equity trading desks. And it's easy to understand why.  
股市基准的微小波动预示着股票交易部门进入观望模式。原因很容易理解。


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP100224-250x300.jpg)For starters, a [U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for September](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) arrives early Friday. Wednesday's ADP private-sector jobs data did not produce much reaction in the stock market. Yet for some observers, the data created more uncertainty.  
首先，[美国 9 月非农就业报告](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)将于周五早些时候公布。周三公布的 ADP 私营部门就业数据并未在股市产生太大反应。然而，对于一些观察者来说，这些数据带来了更多的不确定性。


Watch Friday's Payrolls 观看周五的工资单
--------------------------------


Peter Berezin, chief strategist at BCA Research, pointed out that the September figures — 143,000 net growth vs. an Econoday forecast of 121,500 — "bode well for the economy," in a note sent to clients. "And if they are confirmed by Friday's jobs report, I will probably ratchet down my 12-month recession probability (currently 70%)."  
BCA Research 首席策略师 Peter Berezin 在发给客户的一份报告中指出，9 月份的数据——净增长 143,000 人，而 Econoday 预测为 121,500 人——“对经济来说是个好兆头”。“如果周五的就业报告证实了这些情况，我可能会降低 12 个月衰退的可能性（目前为 70%）。”


Yet Berezin also highlighted that ADP payrolls fell 260,000 on a seasonally unadjusted basis, "the worst showing for any September since the series began in 2010." Why was this a head-scratcher for Berezin? He added the average change in September from 2010 to 2019 was a much milder 38,000 in net private-sector jobs lost.  
然而，Berezin 还强调，未经季节性调整的 ADP 就业人数下降了 260,000 人，“这是自 2010 年系列赛开始以来任何 9 月份的最差表现”。为什么这对 Berezin 来说是一个令人头疼的问题？他补充说，从 2010 年到 2019 年 9 月的平均变化是私营部门净失业人数要温和得多，为 38,000 个。

Interestingly, investor sentiment has soured in some quarters even though the major averages have mostly posted solid gains in the past several months.  
有趣的是，尽管主要平均指数在过去几个月大多录得稳健的收益，但投资者情绪在某些季度已经恶化。


For instance, the bullish ratio in the weekly Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers has rebounded to 55.4% in the latest week, up from a year-to-date low of 43.5% in mid-September. However, the current level is still slightly below the 56.9% reading seen in the start of the year. And as of Wednesday, the Nasdaq has gained 19.4% year to date. The S&P 500 has rallied 19.7%, while the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) index has marched ahead 12.8%.  
例如，Investors Intelligence 对时事通讯作者的每周调查中的看涨比率在 9 月中旬的年内低点 43.5% 最近一周反弹至 55.4%。然而，目前的水平仍略低于年初的 56.9%。截至周三，纳斯达克指数今年迄今已上涨 19.4%。标准普尔 500 指数上涨了 19.7%，而景顺标准普尔 500 等权重 （[RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)） 指数上涨了 12.8%。


Demure Stock Market Trading端庄的股票市场交易
------------------------------------


Volume fell mildly on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange vs. Tuesday.  
与周二相比，纳斯达克和纽约证券交易所的成交量均小幅下降。


What actually moved more actively on Wednesday?  
周三实际上什么动作更活跃？


The Dow Jones transportation average fell 0.8% following the second day of thousands of members of the International Longshoremen union walking out on the job at dozens of U.S. ports. The union is campaigning for a big wage hike as well as limits by management to add automation that could cut operating costs.  
道琼斯运输平均指数下跌 0.8%，此前第二天，国际码头工人工会的数千名成员在美国数十个港口上班。该工会正在争取大幅提高工资，并要求管理层限制增加自动化，从而降低运营成本。


The Dow Jones transports have made virtually no progress since hitting a multiyear high of 16,717 back in July of 2023.  
道琼斯运输指数自 2023 年 7 月创下 16,717 点的多年高点以来几乎没有取得任何进展。


Going back to the broader stock market, breadth was slightly negative, offering a touch of divergence with the microscopic gains seen in the indexes.  
回到更广泛的股市，广度略为负值，与指数中的微小涨幅略有不同。


Early data showed 1,985 stocks advancing on the Nasdaq, while 2,164 issues declined. On the NYSE, losers beat winners by roughly 200 stocks.  
早期数据显示，纳斯达克有 1,985 只股票上涨，而 2,164 只股票下跌。在纽约证券交易所，失败者比赢家多出大约 200 只股票。


Food Stock Thumped 食品库存重创
-------------------------


Nonetheless, investors decided to load up on tech stocks and select banking names. Looking at the daily action of [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), fiber-optic telecom, chip equipment, fabless semiconductors and computer hardware led the upside. These groups — as well as semiconductor manufacturing, foreign banks, security software and heavy construction — all advanced 1% or more.  
尽管如此，投资者还是决定增持科技股并选择银行名称。从 [IBD 的 197 个行业团体](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/)的日常行动来看，光纤电信、芯片设备、无晶圆厂半导体和计算机硬件领涨。这些集团——以及半导体制造、外国银行、安全软件和重型建筑——都上涨了 1% 或更多。


In contrast, investors jettisoned some defensive stocks.  
相比之下，投资者抛弃了一些防御性股票。


Packaged-food titan **Conagra** ([CAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAG)) dived 8% on an earnings warning from management. Shares gapped down and almost closed beneath the 200-day moving average.  
包装食品巨头**康尼格拉** （[CAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAG)） 在管理层的财报警告下下跌 8%。股价跳空下跌，几乎收于 200 天移动平均线下方。


Conagra, which lost all gains from a breakout point at 30.66 in a very shallow [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/), shows declining earnings and sales for four quarters in a row. It holds a stale [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 57 on a scale of 1 to 99.  
康尼格拉在一个非常浅的[带手柄杯](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/)中失去了 30.66 的突破点的所有收益，连续四个季度的收益和销售额下降。它的[每股收益评级](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/)为 57，范围为 1 到 99。

The dull moves overall in U.S. stocks lately haven't stopped traders from rushing back into Chinese equities.  
最近美国股市的整体沉闷波动并没有阻止交易员急于重返中国股市。


China ETFs have had a very toasty October ever since the government announced a series of interest-rate cuts late last month to boost homeownership and consumer activity.  
自从政府上月底宣布一系列降息以促进房屋所有权和消费者活动以来，中国 ETF 在 10 月份的表现非常热烈。


**PDD** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), which has had huge success in China with its app-based e-commerce websites as well as the Temu shopping app outside China, rallied nearly 5% in heavy turnover. At the session high of 155, PDD also crossed an early [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 152.22 within its unusual-looking base that features a 29% plunge on Aug. 26 following second-quarter results.  
**拼多多** （[PDD）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD) 凭借其基于应用程序的电子商务网站以及中国境外的 Temu 购物应用程序在中国取得了巨大成功，其营业额大幅上涨了近 5%。在盘中高点 155 时，拼多多还突破了 152.22 的早[盘买入点](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)，该基础在其不寻常的底部内，在第二季度业绩公布后，该基础在 8 月 26 日暴跌 29%。


Needless to say, the base does not fit the mold of an [outstanding double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/).  
不用说，底座并不适合[出色的双底](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/)模具。


Beyond The Stock Market: India And China超越股票市场：印度和中国
----------------------------------------------------


Wilbur Ross, former U.S. Commerce Secretary in the Trump administration and author of a new autobiography, "Risks And Returns: Creating Success In Business and Life," notes that China faces very difficult odds in maintaining a solid pace of economic growth.  
特朗普政府前美国商务部长、新自传《风险与回报：在商业和生活中创造成功》的作者威尔伯·罗斯 （Wilbur Ross） 指出，中国在保持稳健的经济增长步伐方面面临着非常困难的困难。


The veteran financier believes China stands to lose in a future in which the world steps further away from the globalization of trade. In the past, companies capitalized on lower manufacturing costs in building and assembling products across different countries.  
这位资深金融家认为，如果世界远离贸易全球化，中国将会输。过去，公司利用较低的制造成本在不同国家/地区构建和组装产品。


But companies have found this outsourcing strategy also carries the risk of building excessive inventories as well as  a failure to maintain a high degree of quality. In recent years, "reshoring" and "near-shoring" have become serious buzzwords in the business and economic spheres.  
但公司发现，这种外包策略也存在建立过多库存以及无法保持高质量的风险。近年来，“回流”和“近岸外包”已成为商业和经济领域的流行语。


"We're clearly moving away from an era of free trade and globalization," Ross told IBD in a phone interview. Ross, who had numerous dealings with Chinese government officials, calculates China has gained a net $10 trillion in combined international trade surpluses and net foreign direct investment into the country since its admission into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. As both of these economic inputs decrease for China, "it's going to be a problem."  
“我们显然正在远离自由贸易和全球化的时代，”罗斯在电话采访中告诉 IBD。罗斯曾与中国政府官员打过交道，他计算出，自2001年12月加入世界贸易组织以来，中国的国际贸易顺差和外国直接投资净额总计达到10万亿美元。随着中国的这两项经济投入减少，“这将是一个问题”。

Demographics Gloom, Less Consumer Boom人口结构悲观，消费热潮减少
---------------------------------------------------


Ross adds that China's negative population trends, caused by a now-scuttled one-child family policy, combined with a very high savings rate, limit the potential for the Middle Kingdom to achieve the government's stated goal of growing GDP by 5% annually. A less-developed pension and health care system in China both force Chinese middle-class workers to limit their consumption.  
Ross 补充说，中国的负面人口趋势是由现已失败的独生子女家庭政策造成的，再加上非常高的储蓄率，限制了中国实现政府每年增长 5% 的 GDP 的既定目标的潜力。中国欠发达的养老金和医疗保健体系都迫使中国中产阶级工人限制消费。


In contrast, Ross sees big potential in India. The country suffers from a heavy-handed bureaucracy. Labor rules that are much stricter for enterprises with 100 or more employees vs. smaller operations hamper the competitiveness of Indian companies, according to Ross. India also needs to do more to build out its infrastructure to allow further growth. But Ross believes newly reelected Prime Minister Mahendra Modi is "clearly making moves that are constructive for India" to make Indian enterprises more competitive in the global arena. "India has a shot at not only maintaining economic growth of 7% but to even top that rate."  
相比之下，Ross 看到了印度的巨大潜力。这个国家饱受严厉的官僚主义之苦。罗斯表示，与小型企业相比，拥有 100 名或更多员工的企业的劳动规则要严格得多，这阻碍了印度公司的竞争力。印度还需要做更多工作来建设其基础设施，以实现进一步增长。但罗斯认为，新当选的总理马亨德拉·莫迪（Mahendra Modi）“显然正在采取对印度具有建设性的举措”，以使印度企业在全球舞台上更具竞争力。“印度不仅有机会保持 7% 的经济增长，甚至有可能超过这个增长率。”


"China has done a very good job with developing its high-speed trains and electrical power infrastructure. India has a quite a bit of catching up to do," Ross added. Yet he sees two phases that could evolve in the rivalry between the two economic powers.  
“中国在发展高速列车和电力基础设施方面做得非常好。印度还有很多工作要做，“罗斯补充道。然而，他认为这两个经济大国之间的竞争可能会演变为两个阶段。


First, India does a lot more to develop its infrastructure to support a growing economy. Second, India becomes a direct threat to China in exports. India's highly skilled technology workers, business management expertise and lower wages overall all pose as competitive advantages.  
首先，印度在发展基础设施以支持不断增长的经济方面做得更多。其次，印度在出口方面成为对中国的直接威胁。印度的高技能技术工人、商业管理专业知识和较低的总体工资都构成了竞争优势。

India Stocks Today 今日印度股票
-------------------------


The iShares MSCI India ETF ([INDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INDA)) has cooled off in recent days. But at 58.01, the exchange traded fund keeps a solid gain of 18.9% year to date.  
iShares MSCI 印度 ETF （[INDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INDA)） 最近几天有所降温。但该交易所交易基金今年迄今保持了 18.9% 的稳健收益，为 58.01。


The ETF traded at 25.40 at the start of October 2012. A total gain of 128% sounds nice, but the compounded annual growth rate of 7.1% is surely less glamorous.  
该 ETF 在 2012 年 10 月初的交易价格为 25.40。128% 的总收益听起来不错，但 7.1% 的复合年增长率肯定不那么迷人。


**HDFC** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)), the largest Indian lender on the U.S. exchanges, sank 0.1% for a fifth straight drop. HDFC had been building a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) since it peaked at 67.16 on July 2. But the stock fell short of a true breakout to 52-week highs.  
美国交易所最大的印度贷款机构 **HDFC** （[HDB）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB) 下跌 0.1%，连续第五次下跌。HDFC 自 7 月 2 日达到峰值 67.16 以来一直在建立[新的基础](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/)。但该股未能真正突破至 52 周高点。


**MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)), a big winner since its August 2023 breakout, is down 6.5% so far in September.


Going back to China, the iShares Large Cap China ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) gapped up 6% to 35.19. Volume vaulted 364% above the fund's 50-day average. Its year-to-date gain has improved to nearly 47%.


Yet since October 2012, the fund has climbed a trifling 2.6%.

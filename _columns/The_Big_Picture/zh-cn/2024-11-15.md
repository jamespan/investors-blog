Stocks ended the week sharply lower Friday after comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell continued to weigh on the markets. Going forward, the latest earnings report from artificial intelligence titan **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) could move stocks in the coming week.


The Nasdaq composite ended Friday down 2.2%. This meant the tech-heavy index suffered a weekly decline of 3.2%. It has fallen in two of the past three weeks and undercut its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The Nasdaq remains above its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and is up more than 24% for the year.




The S&P 500 also backed off, falling 1.3% for the day. It notched a weekly decline of 2.1% and has now fallen in three of the past four weeks. The benchmark index sits a sliver below its 21-day line and holds a gain of 23.1% for 2024.


Decliners led advancers around 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 added a fresh distribution day while the Nasdaq avoided one due to lower volume.


As the S&P 500 ended virtually on its 21-day line, [Investor's Business Daily is continuing to recommend exposure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) at the 80% to 100% level, but shifting to the lower end of this range makes sense due to the bearish action.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best out of the major indexes with a 0.7% drop Friday. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) was the best performer as its post-earnings bounce continued while **Amazon.com** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) lagged.


Small caps also had a tough session on the stock market, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.4% Friday. While off highs it remains up nearly 5% for the month. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.6% for the day and skidded 5.8% for the week.


Powell Comments Hit Stocks, Nvidia Earnings Due
-----------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP111524.jpg)Comments made by Fed Chair Powell Thursday that there is no need to rush on lowering rates once again weighed on the market. He said the strong economy means central bankers have the luxury of taking decisions "carefully."


Boston Fed President Susan Collins echoed this opinion when she said a December rate cut is "not a done deal." [The CME Fedwatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) now rates the likelihood of a cut in December as less than 60%.


Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 0.4% in October compared with the previous month, above expectations for a 0.3% increase. This was despite September's sales figure being revised upward to an 0.8% increase from previously reported growth of 0.4%.


There will be a sprinkling of economic data in the coming week. It includes housing starts and building permits readings on Tuesday as well as existing-home sales data and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey on Thursday. On Friday comes the S&P services and manufacturing PMI reports, as well as the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey.


But the key event in the coming week is [on the earnings front](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/), with **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) set to post results on Wednesday. The firm's results and outlook should have a big impact on AI-related stocks. Other noteworthy reports come from Dow Jones highflier **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and [Leaderboard stock](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **Viking** ([VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)).


Applied Materials Hits This Stock Market Group
----------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday mostly lower](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Utilities and financials fared the best, while health care and technology lagged the most.



As ever, investors could get a deeper insight into the [action on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) by examining the performance of Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups.

Additionally, the chip equipment group struggled, weighed down by post-earnings underperformance from **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)). Applied Materials stock plunged 9.2% after its revenue outlook came in below expectations.

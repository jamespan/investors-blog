Stocks ended the week sharply lower Friday after comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell continued to weigh on the markets. Going forward, the latest earnings report from artificial intelligence titan **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) could move stocks in the coming week.  
在美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔的言论继续打压市场后，股市周五收盘大幅走低。展望未来，人工智能巨头英**伟达** （[NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)） 的最新收益报告可能会在未来一周影响股市。


The Nasdaq composite ended Friday down 2.2%. This meant the tech-heavy index suffered a weekly decline of 3.2%. It has fallen in two of the past three weeks and undercut its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The Nasdaq remains above its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and is up more than 24% for the year.  
纳斯达克综合指数周五收盘下跌 2.2%。这意味着以科技股为主的指数每周下跌 3.2%。它在过去三周中有两周下跌，并低于其 [21 天指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)。纳斯达克指数仍高于其 [50 日线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)，今年上涨了 24% 以上。




The S&P 500 also backed off, falling 1.3% for the day. It notched a weekly decline of 2.1% and has now fallen in three of the past four weeks. The benchmark index sits a sliver below its 21-day line and holds a gain of 23.1% for 2024.  
标准普尔 500 指数也回落，当天下跌 1.3%。它每周下跌 2.1%，现在在过去 4 周中有 3 周下跌。该基准指数略低于其 21 日线，2024 年上涨 23.1%。


Decliners led advancers around 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 added a fresh distribution day while the Nasdaq avoided one due to lower volume.  
纽约证券交易所的下跌股以 2 比 1 的比分领先，在纳斯达克指数以近 3 比 1 的比分领先。标准普尔 500 指数增加了一个新的发行日，而纳斯达克指数由于成交量较低而避免了一个。


As the S&P 500 ended virtually on its 21-day line, [Investor's Business Daily is continuing to recommend exposure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) at the 80% to 100% level, but shifting to the lower end of this range makes sense due to the bearish action.  
由于标准普尔 500 指数几乎在其 21 日线收盘，[《投资者商业日报》继续建议在](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) 80% 至 100% 的水平进行敞口，但由于看跌行动，转向该区间的低端是有道理的。


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best out of the major indexes with a 0.7% drop Friday. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) was the best performer as its post-earnings bounce continued while **Amazon.com** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) lagged.  
道琼斯工业平均指数周五下跌 0.7%，在主要指数中表现最好。**华特迪士尼** （[DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)） 表现最佳，其财报后反弹继续，而 **Amazon.com** （[INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)） 则落后。


Small caps also had a tough session on the stock market, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.4% Friday. While off highs it remains up nearly 5% for the month. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.6% for the day and skidded 5.8% for the week.  
小盘股在股市上也经历了艰难的交易，罗素 2000 指数周五下跌 1.4%。虽然从高点回落，但它本月仍上涨了近 5%。Innovator IBD 50 ETF （[FFTY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY) 当天下跌 1.6%，本周下跌 5.8%。


Powell Comments Hit Stocks, Nvidia Earnings Due鲍威尔的评论打击了股市，英伟达财报到期
------------------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP111524.jpg)Comments made by Fed Chair Powell Thursday that there is no need to rush on lowering rates once again weighed on the market. He said the strong economy means central bankers have the luxury of taking decisions "carefully."  
美联储主席鲍威尔周四表示无需急于降息，再次令市场承压。他说，强劲的经济意味着央行行长们可以“谨慎”地做出决定。


Boston Fed President Susan Collins echoed this opinion when she said a December rate cut is "not a done deal." [The CME Fedwatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) now rates the likelihood of a cut in December as less than 60%.  
波士顿联储主席苏珊·柯林斯 （Susan Collins） 回应了这一观点，她表示 12 月降息“尚未达成协议”。[CME Fedwatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) 现在将 12 月降息的可能性评为低于 60%。


Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 0.4% in October compared with the previous month, above expectations for a 0.3% increase. This was despite September's sales figure being revised upward to an 0.8% increase from previously reported growth of 0.4%.  
与此同时，美国商务部报告称，10 月份零售额与上月相比增长 0.4%，高于预期的 0.3%。尽管 9 月份的销售数据从之前报告的 0.4% 增长上调至 0.8%。


There will be a sprinkling of economic data in the coming week. It includes housing starts and building permits readings on Tuesday as well as existing-home sales data and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey on Thursday. On Friday comes the S&P services and manufacturing PMI reports, as well as the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey.  
未来一周将有大量经济数据。它包括周二的房屋开工和建筑许可读数，以及成屋销售数据和周四的费城联储制造业调查。周五将发布标准普尔服务和制造业采购经理人指数报告，以及密歇根大学的消费者调查。


But the key event in the coming week is [on the earnings front](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/), with **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) set to post results on Wednesday. The firm's results and outlook should have a big impact on AI-related stocks. Other noteworthy reports come from Dow Jones highflier **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and [Leaderboard stock](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **Viking** ([VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)).  
但未来一周的关键事件[是财报方面](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/)，**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 将于周三公布业绩。该公司的业绩和前景应该会对 AI 相关股票产生重大影响。其他值得注意的报告来自道琼斯高端公司**沃尔玛** （[WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)） 和[排行榜股票](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/)**Viking** （[VIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIK)）。

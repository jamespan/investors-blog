Major stock indexes were little changed Wednesday as the market's uptrend continued to moderate with a dull trend setting in. But small caps got hit hard.  
主要股指周三变化不大，因为市场的上升趋势继续放缓，趋势变得沉闷。但小盘股受到重创。


The S&P 500 inched up a fraction after indexes faded in afternoon trading. It was the S&P's fourth-straight close with a move of less than 0.4%.  
标准普尔 500 指数在午盘交易中下跌后小幅上涨。这是标准普尔指数连续第四次收盘，涨幅不到 0.4%。


The Nasdaq composite wavered between gains and losses and finished nearly 0.3% lower. It had moved only about 0.1% the previous three sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1% after being up as much as 0.5%.  
纳斯达克综合指数在涨跌之间徘徊，收盘下跌近 0.3%。在前三个交易日中，它仅波动了约 0.1%。道琼斯工业平均指数在上涨 0.5% 后上涨 0.1%。




Small caps, however, came under concentrated fire. The Russell 2000 slid 0.9%. The 10-year Treasury yield reversed two basis points higher to 4.448%, which may have impacted small caps more than other stocks.  
然而，小盘股受到集中攻击。罗素 2000 指数下跌 0.9%。10 年期美国国债收益率逆转上涨 2 个基点至 4.448%，这可能比其他股票对小盘股的影响更大。


Volume surged on the Nasdaq. It was the most since the Sept. 20 triple-witching session and the 16th consecutive day of above-average trading. Wednesday's higher volume gave the Nasdaq its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) since clearing the slate clean last week. Volume eased on the New York Stock Exchange.  
纳斯达克的成交量激增。这是自 9 月 20 日三重交易日以来的最高水平，也是连续第 16 天高于平均水平的交易。周三的成交量走高使纳斯达克指数自上周清盘以来首次[出现派息日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/)。纽约证券交易所的成交量有所下降。


Another Rate Cut Coming? 新一轮降息即将到来？
-----------------------------------


Indexes opened higher after the October consumer price index [met economists' forecasts](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-oct-ppi-federal-reserve-sp-500/). The cooling trend appeared to stall. But bond traders still raised bets on a quarter-point cut in interest rates next month. [Odds for such a cut](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) stood at 82% late Wednesday, up from about 59% on Tuesday.  
在 10 月消费者价格指数[达到经济学家的预测](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-oct-ppi-federal-reserve-sp-500/)后，指数开盘走高。降温趋势似乎停滞不前。但债券交易员仍然提高了对下个月降息 25 个基点的押注。周三晚些时候[，这种降息的几率](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html)为 82%，高于周二的约 59%。


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP111324.jpg)Despite the stock market's moderating trend, the S&P 500 is up 4.9% this month and just had its best nine-day performance since August. The Nasdaq's 6.3% gain month-to-date is a nine-day best since September, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  
尽管股市呈缓和趋势，但标准普尔 500 指数本月上涨了 4.9%，刚刚创下自 8 月以来最好的 9 天表现。根据道琼斯市场数据，纳斯达克指数本月迄今上涨 6.3%，是自 9 月以来的 9 天最佳水平。


The fact that the stock market has hardly budged since last week's rally should be taken as a positive sign.  
自上周的反弹以来，股市几乎没有变化，这一事实应该被视为一个积极的信号。


While indexes were relatively quiet, many high-rated stocks rose sharply in higher volume during the session, including **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)), **Paymentus** ([PAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAY)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)). Cava's winnings were pared substantially by the close.  
虽然指数相对平静，但许多高评级股票在盘中大幅上涨，包括 **Cava** （[CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)）、**Paymentus** （[PAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAY)） 和 **Shopify** （[SHOP）。](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)Cava 的奖金在收盘时大幅减少。


Stock Market Sentiment Bubbling股市情绪冒泡
-------------------------------------


Investor optimism has bulged since last week's U.S. elections removed a big uncertainty and raised the prospects for more business-friendly policies in Washington.  
自上周美国大选消除巨大不确定性并提高华盛顿出台更有利于商业政策的前景以来，投资者的乐观情绪不断上升。


The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) fell to 0.59 on Monday, the lowest — and most optimistic — reading so far this year. The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, on Wednesday fell for the sixth time in the past seven sessions. The so-called stock market fear gauge is at the lowest since July 23.  
[周一，看跌期权与看涨期权的成交量比率](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall)降至 0.59，这是今年迄今为止最低也是最乐观的读数。芝加哥[期权交易所波动率指数](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) （VIX） 周三在过去七个交易日中第六次下跌。所谓的股市恐惧指标处于 7 月 23 日以来的最低水平。


A Charles Schwab survey found that retail investors and active traders are significantly more bullish than they were in late October. A survey of Schwab clients conducted after the Nov. 7 Fed rate cut shows 56% are bullish and 15% are bearish about equities. In late October, 36% were bullish and 20% were bearish. Among active traders, 29% in the survey said they plan to add risk before the end of the year.  
嘉信理财 （Charles Schwab） 的一项调查发现，散户投资者和活跃的交易员明显比 10 月下旬更加看涨。11 月 7 日美联储降息后对嘉信理财客户进行的一项调查显示，56% 的客户看涨，15% 的客户看跌股票。10 月下旬，36% 的受访者看涨，20% 的受访者看跌。在活跃的交易者中，29% 的调查表示他们计划在年底前增加风险。


The Investors Intelligence Advisors Sentiment report, which tracks market newsletters, saw the number of bullish advisors climb to 60.3% from 56.7% a week ago. That level indicates a complacent market that could be in for a pullback.  
追踪市场通讯的 Investors Intelligence Advisors Sentiment 报告显示，看涨顾问的数量从一周前的 56.7% 攀升至 60.3%。该水平表明一个自满的市场可能会出现回调。


"The reading remains in the high-risk danger zone above 55% for the fifth-straight week," the report said. That's the highest concentration of bulls since late July, when they exceeded 60% for seven weeks. For reference, the Nasdaq suffered a four-week correction of nearly 16% from mid-July to a bottom on Aug. 5.  
“该读数连续第五周保持在 55% 以上的高风险危险区域，”报告称。这是自 7 月下旬以来多头的最高集中度，当时它们连续七周超过 60%。作为参考，纳斯达克指数从 7 月中旬到 8 月 5 日触底，经历了近 16% 的四周回调。


The latest bears reading fell to 20.7%, from 21.7%. "That is the fewest bears since early August but a further contraction for this reading is typically seen before a major market top," the firm noted.  
最新的空头读数从 21.7% 降至 20.7%。该公司指出：“这是自 8 月初以来最少的空头，但通常在主要市场顶部之前看到该读数的进一步收缩。


FOMO Tempts Investors FOMO 吸引投资者
--------------------------------


Those sentiment indicators reflect a solid market but are also a symptom of fear of missing out, or FOMO. Strong stock market gains can seduce investors into piling into stocks, perhaps too late or too early.  
这些情绪指标反映了一个坚实的市场，但也是害怕错过或 FOMO 的症状。强劲的股市上涨会诱使投资者涌入股票，也许为时已晚或太早。


A market uptrend is the correct time to buy or add stocks. Investor's Business Daily continues to recommend 80%-100% exposure.  
市场上升趋势是购买或添加股票的正确时机。投资者商业日报继续推荐 80%-100% 的敞口。


After the S&P 500 had its best week of the year and the Nasdaq enjoyed its second best, investors can savor some winnings. But the downside is that the postelection, post-Fed meeting rally has left many stocks extended from buy areas.  
在标准普尔 500 指数创下今年最好的一周，纳斯达克指数创下第二好的一周后，投资者可以享受一些收益。但不利的一面是，大选后、美联储会议后的反弹使许多股票从买入区域延伸。


Investors have to resist the temptation to buy stocks that are not in proper buy areas. Regardless of how well the market looks, a poorly timed trade can erase any benefit from a strong market.  
投资者必须抵制购买不在适当购买区域的股票的诱惑。无论市场看起来有多好，不合时宜的交易都会抹去强劲市场带来的任何好处。


Remember to focus on institutional-quality stocks. Most important, buy only when a stock climbs to a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) from a proper base, or when it finds support in a pullback to the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). A handful of stocks have formed three-weeks-tight patterns, too.  
请记住专注于机构级股票。最重要的是，只有当股票从适当的底部攀升至[买入点](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/)，或者在回调至 [10 周移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)中找到支撑时，才买入。少数股票也形成了为期三周的窄幅形态。


At the same time, avoid overcommitting to stocks. If a sell signal occurs, don't ignore it.  
同时，避免过度投资股票。如果出现卖出信号，请不要忽视它。

The stock market staged a rebound Monday after last week's setback, as most major indexes climbed. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) fell amid fresh fears for its Blackwell chip just two days before its earnings report. After the close, **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) rallied after it avoided a Nasdaq delisting.  


Dow Jones industrials lagged for most of the trading day and finished 0.1% lower, weighed by underperformance in **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), Nvidia and **Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)). Those three stocks accounted for about 85 points off the Dow. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) fell to its lowest close since Aug. 12.  




But **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) held the biggest gains in the Dow, up 2.6%. The stock remains in a clear downtrend and below a downward-sloping [50 day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is just 11 out of 99.  


The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq remained in the green most of the trading day. More importantly, they passed a test of support at their [21-day exponential moving averages.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)  


Midmorning gains faded in the afternoon, but both indexes closed higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% while the Nasdaq rose 0.6%, as the latter ended a four-day losing streak.  


The S&P 500 fell 2% last week but ended right at its [21-day lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Friday. The Nasdaq ended a notch below the 21-day moving average on Friday but rose back above it on Monday.  


The fact the two indexes have held those price levels is one reason [Investor's Business Daily recommended exposure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) remains 80%-100%.  


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP111824-213x300.jpg)Volume was lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq from Friday's totals. Advancers led decliners on the New York Stock Exchange but were more or less evenly matched with decliners on the Nasdaq.  


Small caps trimmed most gains. The Russell 2000 closed only 0.1% higher, ending a four-day losing streak.  


Stock Market: Magnificent Seven Stocks Nvidia, Tesla
----------------------------------------------------


Monday's key movers included Nvidia, AI server maker Super Micro Computer and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).  


Super Micro rose 16% after reports that the company would [meet the deadline](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/smci-stock-super-micro-seeks-to-avoid-delisting/) to file a plan to become compliant with the Nasdaq's listing requirements. After the close of trading, shares rallied another 22% after the company avoided getting kicked off the Nasdaq.  


The company [submitted a compliance plan](https://ir.supermicro.com/news/news-details/2024/Supermicro-Announces-Appointment-of-BDO-USA-as-Independent-Auditor-and-Filing-of-Compliance-Plan-with-Nasdaq/default.aspx) to the Nasdaq that gives it a time extension to complete listing requirements. In addition, Super Micro said it has secured BDO USA, P.C. as its independent auditor.  



Tesla rose 6% amid news that President-elect Donald Trump's team [will look into a federal framework](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stocks-rises-team-trump-national-self-driving-rules/) for self-driving vehicles that can replace the requirement for approval by individual states.  


Nvidia closed below a 140.76 buy point after a report that the [Blackwell chip causes overheating](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-blackwell-overheating-ai/) when connected to servers. Nvidia will report its [third-quarter earnings after market close on Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-2/).  


Stock Market Leaders Bend Lower
-------------------------------


For now, the Trump rally remains intact. However, some leading stocks have given up most of their gains from breakouts that occurred in the past few weeks.  


The Recent Breakouts list on [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) shows **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) has erased much of its 15% gain after breaking out on Nov. 6.  


**Axos** ([AX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AX)) rallied past a buy zone but has stalled, trading just above a 79.15 buy point.  


Dow Jones component **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) rallied 9% after a Nov. 8 breakout, while **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rose as much as 7% after breaking out on Nov. 6. Both have given up most of those gains.  


**Charter Communications** ([CHTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHTR)) has fallen below its buy point of 386.28 after rising past its 5% buy zone.  


IBD 50 Shines In Stock Market
-----------------------------


But stocks in the IBD 50 outperformed. The index rose 1.4%.  


**Affirm** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)), **Robinhood** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)), **Root** ([ROOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROOT)), **Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) and **Doximity** ([DOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS)) were big winners, gaining more than 5% each.  


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell one basis point to 4.41%.  


Housing data is in the spotlight this week. On Monday, a housing market survey of homebuilders rose in November to 46 from 43 in October. It also beat estimates of 43, according to [Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/?_gl=1*1iay3pk*_gcl_au*OTAzNDI2ODY3LjE3MjQyNTY4NDA.*_ga*MTQzMjcxNDIzMi4xNzMxNDE4OTMw*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczMTk1MDgyMi4zLjEuMTczMTk1MTg3My42MC4wLjA.).  


On Tuesday, housing starts and building permits for October are due, with existing-home sales for October due on Thursday.  


The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index and the Purchasing Manager's Index — both for November — will wrap up the major economic data for the week on Friday.

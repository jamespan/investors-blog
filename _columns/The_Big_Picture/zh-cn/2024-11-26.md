After a day of outperformance Monday, the Russell 2000 lagged the stock market Tuesday. But the Nasdaq composite outperformed, helped by strength in large-cap technology stocks like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)).  
在周一跑赢大盘一天之后，罗素 2000 指数周二落后于股市。但纳斯达克综合指数表现出色，得益于 **Amazon.com** （[AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)）、**Microsoft** （[MSFT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT) 和[排行榜](https://leaderboard.investors.com)股票 **Meta Platforms** （[META）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META) 等大型科技股的强劲表现。




The Nasdaq composite extended its winning streak to four sessions, rising 0.6% in lower volume. The S&P 500 rose for the seventh straight session and marked an all-time closing high, also up 0.6% in lower volume. The S&P 500 suffered a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) Monday, raising the index's distribution-day count to three.  
纳斯达克综合指数将连涨势头延续至四个交易日，在成交量较低的情况下上涨 0.6%。标准普尔 500 指数连续第七个交易日上涨，创下历史收盘新高，成交量较低，也上涨了 0.6%。标准普尔 500 [指数周一](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/)停滞不前，该指数的派发日数增加到三个。


The major stock indexes strengthened a bit during the final hour of trading after President Joe Biden announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah. But small caps sat out the rally, with the Russell 2000 down 0.7% at the close.  
在乔·拜登总统宣布以色列与真主党达成停火协议后，主要股指在交易的最后一个小时小幅走强。但小盘股未能反弹，罗素 2000 指数收盘下跌 0.7%。


After a pullback, Amazon is back in a buy zone from a 201.20 alternative entry. (It had topped a 195.37 handle entry Nov. 1.) Microsoft popped above a couple of short-term moving averages as it tries to break out of a downtrend. Meta Platforms is only 5% off its high as it forms a flat base. Meta tried to reclaims its 50-day moving average but closed just below the line.  
回调后，亚马逊从 201.20 的替代入场点回到买入区域。（它在 11 月 1 日的 195.37 句柄条目中名列前茅。Microsoft 在试图突破下跌趋势时突破了几个短期移动平均线。Meta Platforms 仅比其高点低 5%，因为它形成了一个平坦的基础。Meta 试图收复其 50 天移动平均线，但收盘价略低于该线。

Despite the gains, declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by nearly 2-to-1. The ratio was less than 2-to-1 negative on the Nasdaq.  
尽管上涨，但下跌的股票数量与纽约证券交易所上涨的股票数量之差接近 2 比 1。纳斯达克的比率低于 2 比 1。


The Dow Jones industrials made it five up days in a row, paring a 0.7% morning loss to a gain of 0.3% by the close. It also made a record closing high. A sell-off in **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) was offset by strength in Amazon and Microsoft. Amgen shares closed off lows but still fell nearly 5% after the company reported good, but not good enough, trial results for its highly anticipated [weight-loss drug, MariTide](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-weight-loss-drug-maritide-eli-lilly-zepbound/).  
道琼斯工业指数连续五天上涨，收盘时收盘时下跌 0.7%，上涨 0.3%。它还创下了创纪录的收盘新高。**安进** （[AMGN）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN) 的抛售被亚马逊和 Microsoft 的强劲抵消。安进股价收于低点，但仍下跌近 5%，此前该公司报告了其备受期待[的减肥药 MariTide](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-weight-loss-drug-maritide-eli-lilly-zepbound/) 的良好但不够好的试验结果。


The stock market shrugged off comments from President-elect Donald Trump late Monday, who said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico. He also announced an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs could dramatically raises prices for American consumers who have already been dealing with inflation. ETFs tracking Mexico, Canada and China stocks fell.  
股市周一晚些时候对当选总统唐纳德·特朗普的评论不屑一顾，特朗普表示，他将对从加拿大和墨西哥进入该国的所有产品征收25%的税。他还宣布对来自中国的商品加征 10% 的关税。关税可能会大幅提高已经在应对通货膨胀的美国消费者的价格。追踪墨西哥、加拿大和中国股市的 ETF 下跌。


PCE In Stock Market's FocusPCE 是股票市场的焦点

It should be a quiet, low-volume session Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but a key piece of economic data looms large with the release of the Personal Income and Spending report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Inside the report, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge — the core personal consumption expenditures index — is expected to show prices up 2.8% in October from a year ago. That would be a slight increase from 2.7% in September.  
在感恩节假期之前，周三应该是一个安静、低成交量的交易时段，但随着美国东部时间上午 8：30 个人收入和支出报告的发布，一项关键的经济数据迫在眉睫。在报告中，美联储首选的通胀指标——核心个人消费支出指数——预计将显示 10 月份物价比一年前上涨 2.8%。这将比 9 月份的 2.7% 略有增加。


The stock market didn't react much to the 2 p.m. ET release of the minutes from the early-November Fed meeting. Committee members acknowledged the possibility of gradual rate cuts so long as the U.S. economy continues to perform as expected.  
股市对美国东部时间下午 2 点发布的 11 月初美联储会议纪要没有太大反应。委员会成员承认，只要美国经济继续按预期表现，就有可能逐步降息。


The stock market isn't focused on inflation like it once was because inflation is heading in the right direction. It's still above the Fed's preferred target of 2%, but the economy continues to perform well — so much so that the odds for another quarter-point rate cut at the December meeting have been fading. Futures traders see a 60% chance of another rate cut in December, down from 75% about a month ago.  
股市不像以前那样关注通货膨胀，因为通货膨胀正在朝着正确的方向发展。这仍然高于美联储首选的 2% 目标，但经济继续表现良好——以至于在 12 月的会议上再次降息 25 个基点的可能性一直在下降。期货交易员认为 12 月再次降息的可能性为 60%，低于大约一个月前的 75%。

With so many stocks out of position and well-extended past proper entry points, it's important to be discerning with new buys. The common pitfall now is to buy a lagging stock in an industry group just because it's setting up in a base and near a buy point.  
由于如此多的股票处于不利位置，并且已经很好地超过了适当的切入点，因此辨别新的买入是很重要的。现在常见的陷阱是，仅仅因为一个行业集团的股票位于底部并接近买入点，就购买该股票。

In the insurance sector, **Chubb** ([CB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB)) is forming a flat base and could try to break out of a downtrend soon. But it has a weak [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-relative-strength/) of 63. The big leaders in the group are **Lemonade** ([LMND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMND)) and **Goosehead Insurance** ([GSHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSHD)). Buying the true leaders in a group on pullbacks is a generally better strategy than buying a laggard breakout.  
在保险板块，**Chubb** （[CB）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB) 正在形成平坦的基础，并可能很快尝试突破下跌趋势。但它的[相对强度评分](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-relative-strength/)很弱，只有 63。该集团的主要领导者是 **Lemonade** （[LMND）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMND) 和 **Goosehead Insurance** （[GSHD）。](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSHD)在回调时买入一组真正的领导者通常比买入落后的突破更好。


**Western Digital** ([WDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC)) rallied sharply for the second straight session and closed just below a 73.50 entry. New buyers are watching to see if Western Digital can break out of a cup-with-handle base. But the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is lagging badly on the weekly chart.  
**西部数据** （[WDC）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC) 连续第二个交易日大幅上涨，收盘价略低于 73.50。新买家正在关注 Western Digital 是否能够打破带把手杯的基础。但该股的[相对强弱线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/)在周线图上严重滞后。


Homebuilders lagged after strong gains Monday. After plunging more than 14 basis points Monday to around 4.26%, the 10-year Treasury yield added four basis points to 4.30%.  
房屋建筑商在周一强劲上涨后落后。在周一暴跌超过 14 个基点至 4.26 左右后，10 年期美国国债收益率上涨 4 个基点至 4.30%。


**Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) joined the [Leaderboard Leaders list](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Monday when it was near the top of a buy zone from a 71.95 buy point. Tuesday's modest decline in lower volume looked orderly in light of Monday's 5.2% gain higher volume.  
**Taylor Morrison Home** （[TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)） 周一加入了[排行榜领导者名单](https://leaderboard.investors.com)，当时它从 71.95 的买入点接近买入区的顶部。鉴于周一成交量上涨 5.2%，周二成交量的小幅下降看起来是有序的。


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is an example of a recent breakout that still looks actionable. The security software bellwether is getting support at its 21-day exponential moving average as it holds in a buy zone from an alternate entry of 384.  
**Palo Alto Networks** （[PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)） 是最近突围的一个例子，看起来仍然可操作。安全软件风向标在其 21 天指数移动平均线获得支撑，因为它处于 384 的备选条目的买入区域。

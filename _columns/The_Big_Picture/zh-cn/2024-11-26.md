After a day of outperformance Monday, the Russell 2000 lagged the stock market Tuesday. But the Nasdaq composite outperformed, helped by strength in large-cap technology stocks like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)).  
在周一跑赢大盘一天之后，罗素 2000 指数周二落后于股市。但纳斯达克综合指数表现出色，得益于 **Amazon.com** （[AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)）、**Microsoft** （[MSFT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT) 和[排行榜](https://leaderboard.investors.com)股票 **Meta Platforms** （[META）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META) 等大型科技股的强劲表现。




The Nasdaq composite extended its winning streak to four sessions, rising 0.6% in lower volume. The S&P 500 rose for the seventh straight session and marked an all-time closing high, also up 0.6% in lower volume. The S&P 500 suffered a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) Monday, raising the index's distribution-day count to three.  
纳斯达克综合指数将连涨势头延续至四个交易日，在成交量较低的情况下上涨 0.6%。标准普尔 500 指数连续第七个交易日上涨，创下历史收盘新高，成交量较低，也上涨了 0.6%。标准普尔 500 [指数周一](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/)停滞不前，该指数的派发日数增加到三个。


The major stock indexes strengthened a bit during the final hour of trading after President Joe Biden announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah. But small caps sat out the rally, with the Russell 2000 down 0.7% at the close.  
在乔·拜登总统宣布以色列与真主党达成停火协议后，主要股指在交易的最后一个小时小幅走强。但小盘股未能反弹，罗素 2000 指数收盘下跌 0.7%。


After a pullback, Amazon is back in a buy zone from a 201.20 alternative entry. (It had topped a 195.37 handle entry Nov. 1.) Microsoft popped above a couple of short-term moving averages as it tries to break out of a downtrend. Meta Platforms is only 5% off its high as it forms a flat base. Meta tried to reclaims its 50-day moving average but closed just below the line.  
回调后，亚马逊从 201.20 的替代入场点回到买入区域。（它在 11 月 1 日的 195.37 句柄条目中名列前茅。Microsoft 在试图突破下跌趋势时突破了几个短期移动平均线。Meta Platforms 仅比其高点低 5%，因为它形成了一个平坦的基础。Meta 试图收复其 50 天移动平均线，但收盘价略低于该线。

Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) was by far the day's best performer, up 1.6%. The ETF hit an all-time high and is still near an 82.50 entry.  
在标准普尔 500 指数的 11 个板块中，公用事业精选行业 SPDR ETF （[XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)） 是当天迄今为止表现最好的，上涨 1.6%。该 ETF 创下历史新高，仍接近 82.50 的入场点。

Despite the gains, declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by nearly 2-to-1. The ratio was less than 2-to-1 negative on the Nasdaq.  
尽管上涨，但下跌的股票数量与纽约证券交易所上涨的股票数量之差接近 2 比 1。纳斯达克的比率低于 2 比 1。


The Dow Jones industrials made it five up days in a row, paring a 0.7% morning loss to a gain of 0.3% by the close. It also made a record closing high. A sell-off in **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) was offset by strength in Amazon and Microsoft. Amgen shares closed off lows but still fell nearly 5% after the company reported good, but not good enough, trial results for its highly anticipated [weight-loss drug, MariTide](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-weight-loss-drug-maritide-eli-lilly-zepbound/).  


The stock market shrugged off comments from President-elect Donald Trump late Monday, who said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico. He also announced an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs could dramatically raises prices for American consumers who have already been dealing with inflation. ETFs tracking Mexico, Canada and China stocks fell.  


PCE In Stock Market's Focus
---------------------------


It should be a quiet, low-volume session Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but a key piece of economic data looms large with the release of the Personal Income and Spending report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Inside the report, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge — the core personal consumption expenditures index — is expected to show prices up 2.8% in October from a year ago. That would be a slight increase from 2.7% in September.  


The stock market didn't react much to the 2 p.m. ET release of the minutes from the early-November Fed meeting. Committee members acknowledged the possibility of gradual rate cuts so long as the U.S. economy continues to perform as expected.  


The stock market isn't focused on inflation like it once was because inflation is heading in the right direction. It's still above the Fed's preferred target of 2%, but the economy continues to perform well — so much so that the odds for another quarter-point rate cut at the December meeting have been fading. Futures traders see a 60% chance of another rate cut in December, down from 75% about a month ago.  


Watch The Stock Market Leaders
------------------------------


With so many stocks out of position and well-extended past proper entry points, it's important to be discerning with new buys. The common pitfall now is to buy a lagging stock in an industry group just because it's setting up in a base and near a buy point.

In the insurance sector, **Chubb** ([CB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB)) is forming a flat base and could try to break out of a downtrend soon. But it has a weak [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-relative-strength/) of 63. The big leaders in the group are **Lemonade** ([LMND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMND)) and **Goosehead Insurance** ([GSHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSHD)). Buying the true leaders in a group on pullbacks is a generally better strategy than buying a laggard breakout.  


**Western Digital** ([WDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC)) rallied sharply for the second straight session and closed just below a 73.50 entry. New buyers are watching to see if Western Digital can break out of a cup-with-handle base. But the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is lagging badly on the weekly chart.  


Homebuilders lagged after strong gains Monday. After plunging more than 14 basis points Monday to around 4.26%, the 10-year Treasury yield added four basis points to 4.30%.  
房屋建筑商在周一强劲上涨后落后。在周一暴跌超过 14 个基点至 4.26 左右后，10 年期美国国债收益率上涨 4 个基点至 4.30%。


**Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) joined the [Leaderboard Leaders list](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Monday when it was near the top of a buy zone from a 71.95 buy point. Tuesday's modest decline in lower volume looked orderly in light of Monday's 5.2% gain higher volume.  
**Taylor Morrison Home** （[TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)） 周一加入了[排行榜领导者名单](https://leaderboard.investors.com)，当时它从 71.95 的买入点接近买入区的顶部。鉴于周一成交量上涨 5.2%，周二成交量的小幅下降看起来是有序的。


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is an example of a recent breakout that still looks actionable. The security software bellwether is getting support at its 21-day exponential moving average as it holds in a buy zone from an alternate entry of 384.  
**Palo Alto Networks** （[PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)） 是最近突围的一个例子，看起来仍然可操作。安全软件风向标在其 21 天指数移动平均线处获得支撑，因为它处于 384 的备选条目的买入区域。

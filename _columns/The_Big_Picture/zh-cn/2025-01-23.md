The stock market closed higher Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading the way. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 extended win streaks, and there were plenty of new breakouts among leading growth stocks.


The Dow Jones index rose 0.9%, bringing its win streak to four days, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.5% to make the first record close of the new year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended up 0.2%. Both the S&P and Nasdaq reversed higher and also extended their win streaks to four days.




And the small-cap Russell 2000 index gained 0.5% in another positive price reversal. All four major stock indexes finished at session highs.


All 11 S&P 500 sectors climbed, with health care and industrials pacing the gainers. The technology and consumer discretionary sectors were the day's laggards.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq, but slightly higher on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Driving the market higher Thursday was [President Donald Trump's remote comments](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-sp500-nasdaq-nvidia-nvda-stock-4/) at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He emphasized the importance of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies in the U.S. He also demanded that OPEC countries cut oil prices. Oil fell to $74.20 per barrel.


Trump also indicated corporate tax rates for domestic producers could fall to 15% and that he would demand that interest rates fall, noting that "with oil prices going down, I'll demand that interest rates drop immediately."

Stock Market Rally: What Investors Should Do Now
------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MP_5x6_012325-215x300.jpg)Recent bullish action caused IBD to raise its recommended exposure level to 80%-100% from 60%-80% Tuesday.


The Jan. 10 distribution day on the S&P 500 dropped off the count after the index climbed 5%, just barely, above that day's closing price.


Despite the continued strength, investors should continue to utilize diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of theÂ [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). It's important to monitor positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules, like a sharp break of the 10-week moving average.


Fourth-quarter earnings season is ramping up, which can lead to big gap downs, so ensure you have a sufficient profit cushion to withstand those potential declines.


If the market is able to extend its rally, then be on the lookout for stocks breaking out past correct buy points. And more stocks are poised to move higher.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured 10 new stocks, notably **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), which topped a 194.80 buy point after the company's [strong guidance and new stock buyback](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-aerospace-q4-2024-earnings-ge-stock/). And the Near Pivot list has increased to 44 ideas. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) is approaching a 638.40 buy point in a flat base.

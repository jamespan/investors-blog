The stock market rally gained traction Tuesday as Americans went to the polls and cast their ballots for the 47th president of the United States.  
周二，随着美国人前往投票站为美国第 47 任总统投票，股市反弹越来越受欢迎。


Bullish earnings from **Astera Labs** ([ALAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALAB)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) had technology investors in a good mood right from the start. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4% in higher volume and reclaimed its short-term moving averages. The Nasdaq's Oct. 1 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) fell off the count because enough time has passed (25 sessions) to make it irrelevant. That brings the Nasdaq's count down to three.  
**Astera Labs** （[ALAB）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALAB) 和 **Palantir Technologies** （[PLTR）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR) 的看涨收益从一开始就让科技投资者心情好。纳斯达克综合指数上涨 1.4%，收复了短期移动平均线。纳斯达克 10 月 1 日[的发行日](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/)没有被计算在内，因为已经过去了足够的时间（25 个交易日）使其变得无关紧要。这使得纳斯达克指数的数量减少到三个。




Stocks held strong gains early even when the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.366%. But the yield reversed lower and was trading around 4.28% near 4:30 p.m. ET. That helped the Russell 2000 small-cap index outperform with a gain of 1.9%. The small-cap index is back above all of its key moving averages and less than 2% from an all-time high.  
即使 10 年期美国国债收益率跃升至 4.366%，股市早早仍保持强劲上涨。但收益率逆转走低，在美国东部时间下午 4：30 附近交易于 4.28% 左右。这帮助罗素 2000 小盘股指数以 1.9% 的涨幅跑赢大盘。小盘股指数回到其所有关键移动平均线上方，距离历史高点不到 2%。


The surge in the 10-year yield since mid-September comes even as the Federal Reserve gets set to cut its key lending rate by another 25 basis points Thursday. That would bring the federal funds rate down to a range of 4.50%-4.75%. Futures traders tracked by [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) think there's a 76% chance that the Fed will cut by another 25 basis points at the December meeting.  
自 9 月中旬以来，10 年期国债收益率飙升，尽管美联储周四准备再将其关键贷款利率下调 25 个基点。这将使联邦基金利率降至 4.50%-4.75% 的区间。[CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) 追踪的期货交易员认为，美联储在 12 月会议上再次降息 25 个基点的可能性为 76%。


Stock Market Today 今日股市
-----------------------


The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with gains of 1.2% and 1%, respectively. Volume on the NYSE rose slightly from Monday. It was a bullish session despite uncertainty about the presidential and congressional races. Polls show a tight race for control of the White House and Congress.  
标准普尔 500 指数和道琼斯工业平均指数分别以 1.2% 和 1% 的涨幅收盘。纽约证券交易所的成交量比周一略有上升。尽管总统和国会竞选存在不确定性，但这是一次看涨的会议。民意调查显示，白宫和国会的控制权竞争激烈。

The Dow Jones jumped above its 50-day line and reclaimed the 42,000 level. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 are back above their short-term moving averages.  
道琼斯指数跃升至 50 日线上方，收复 42,000 点水平。纳斯达克、标准普尔 500 指数和罗素 2000 指数回到其短期移动平均线上方。


Breadth was strong and improved as the session wore on, with advancing stocks beating decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1. Over on the NYSE, winners beat losers by nearly 5-to-1. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), one of the better gauges of breadth on the NYSE, jumped 1.2% and reclaimed its 50-day moving average after three straight closes below the line.  
随着交易日的进行，广度强劲并有所改善，上涨的股票以近 3 比 1 的比分击败纳斯达克下跌的股票。在纽约证券交易所，赢家以近 5 比 1 的比分击败了输家。Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF （[RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)） 是纽约证券交易所较好的广度指标之一，在连续三个收盘低于该线后上涨 1.2% 并收复 50 天移动平均线。

**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which is set to join the Dow Jones industrials Friday before the open, jumped 2.8% in light turnover. After sellers knocked the stock off highs Monday, Nvidia rallied back above its 10-day moving average. Now the AI chip leader has its sights set on its recent high of 144.42. Nvidia is now the world's most valuable company — just in front of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) — with a market capitalization just above $3.4 trillion.  
**英伟达** （[NVDA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA) 将于周五开盘前加入道琼斯工业指数，其轻成交量上涨 2.8%。在卖家周一将股价从高点上反弹后，英伟达反弹至 10 天移动平均线上方。现在，这家 AI 芯片领导者将目光投向了近期的高点 144.42。Nvidia 现在是全球市值最高的公司，仅次于**苹果** （[AAPL），](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)市值略高于 3.4 万亿美元。


AI-related stocks generally performed well after Astera Labs reported [Q3 revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/astera-labs-alab-stock-rockets-q3-report/) of $113.1 million, up 206% year over year and nicely above the $98 million consensus. Q4 revenue guidance was also above expectations. The stock blasted out of a very deep, first-stage cup-with-handle base. But keep in mind that ALAB has more than doubled after hitting a low of 36.02 in August. Rather than chase the stock, it's best to watch for a low-volume pullback at this point  
在 Astera Labs 报告[第三季度收入](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/astera-labs-alab-stock-rockets-q3-report/)为 1.131 亿美元后，人工智能相关股票普遍表现良好，同比增长 206%，远高于市场预期的 9800 万美元。第四季度营收指引也高于预期。枪托从一个非常深的第一级带手柄杯底座中喷出。但请记住，ALAB 在 8 月份触及 36.02 的低点后已经翻了一番多。与其追逐股票，不如在此时观察低成交量回调


Palantir, another big player in the AI space as a provider of data analytics software, soared more than 23%. The stock market leader reported its fourth straight quarter of [accelerating revenue growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-palantir-earnings-news-q32024/). But it's way past a proper entry after shares surged 21% in August, also on strong earnings.  
Palantir 是 AI 领域的另一家大公司，是数据分析软件提供商，股价飙升超过 23%。这家股市领导者报告了其连续第四个季度[加速收入增长](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-palantir-earnings-news-q32024/)。但在 8 月份股价飙升 21% 之后，它也远未进入一个合适的市场，这也是由于强劲的收益。


**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), yet another AI stock, is trading tightly just above its 10-week moving average with earnings due Thursday after the close.  
另一只人工智能股票 **Arista Networks** （[ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)） 的交易价格紧随其 10 周移动平均线上方，财报将于周四收盘后公布。


Stocks To Watch 值得关注的股票
-----------------------


There's no doubt that a large number of growth stocks continue to act well. But there's also an ample supply of top-rated growth stocks that are extended far past proper entries. At this point, it's a good idea to put the big leaders on a watchlist and wait for alternate entries.  
毫无疑问，大量成长股继续表现良好。但也有充足的顶级成长型股票供应，这些股票的有效期远远超过了适当的入场时间。在这一点上，最好将大领导者放在观察名单上并等待替代条目。


The stock market has served up plenty of chart breakouts, including recent new issue **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)), which gapped up sharply last week after reporting strong earnings. If Reddit can hold below last week's high, a short consolidation phase, or [shelf](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-shelf-pattern-and-why-it-is-perfect-pyramiding-tool-in-growth-stocks/), could yield a new entry.  


Enterprise software stock **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and GPS device leader **Garmin** ([GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)) are also good candidates for the watchlist after earnings breakouts last week.  
企业软件股 **Twilio** （[TWLO）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO) 和 GPS 设备领导者 **Garmin** （[GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)） 在上周财报突破后也是观察名单的良好候选者。


**Affirm** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)), known for its buy-now-pay-later model, has been holding support at its 10-week line with earnings due Thursday after the close. It's still a compelling growth story amid booming revenue growth in recent quarters. It's also right on the cusp of profitability.  
**Affirm** （[AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)） 以其先买后付模式而闻名，一直在其 10 周线处保持支撑，财报将于周四收盘后公布。在最近几个季度收入增长的繁荣中，这仍然是一个引人注目的增长故事。它也正处于盈利的风口浪尖。



Stocks building bases are tougher to find. But if you do find them, make sure the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is at or near highs.  
建立基础的股票更难找到。但是，如果您确实找到了它们，请确保[相对强度线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/)处于或接近高点。


While several homebuilders have come under selling pressure, **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) has a bullish relative strength line as it forms a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 71.95 entry. In the medical products group, **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) is near the top of a flat base with a 243.98 buy point.  
虽然一些房屋建筑商面临抛售压力，但 **Taylor Morrison Home** （[TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)） 的相对强弱线看涨，因为它形成了一个 71.95 的平坦[底部](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/)。在医疗产品组中，**Insulet** （[PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)） 接近平底顶部，买入点为 243.98。

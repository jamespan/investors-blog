When the stock market sells off like the way it did on Monday, the bullish investor would like to see at least one of the major indexes quickly rebound with sound and fury. That is, you want to see a solid gain in higher turnover than the prior session.




Tuesday hardly showed such action.


Instead, in what became a feeble rebound attempt by the major benchmarks, the Nasdaq composite (up nearly 0.2%) and the S&P 500 (up less than 0.1%), got overshadowed by decent gains in more sector-specific indexes.


More specifically, the small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 0.3%. Even better were the Dow Jones transportation average (up almost 0.7%, finishing near session highs) and the S&P SmallCap 600 (up 0.5%).


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Leading stocks, meanwhile, behaved more or less in a sedate manner, save for a new breakout by Chinese social media maven **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) and quiet runaway moves by a small herd of trucking stocks (think **J.B. Hunt** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)), 101.31 buy point; and **Old Dominion Freight** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)),  buy points at 95.07 and 102.59; and **Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)), 58.10 buy point).

Check out the latest edition of IBD's screened [New Highs list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-sep-26-2017/). The biggest sector among the 281 Nasdaq and NYSE-listed companies hitting a 52-week or all-time high was Banks at 25.


Business Services ranked 2nd with 17 stocks and included the likes of IT and management consultant **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)) (126.63 entry in flat base) and super-thinly traded engineering firm **NV5 Global** ([NVEE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVEE)) (40.30 entry); Finance was 3rd at 14, Building 4th at 13.


The new highs list is one of the best tools that any investor, professional or individual, can use to track sector rotation in the market.


As noted in a recent [Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stocks-up-why-apples-rally-isnt-over-this-index-is-leading-lately/) column today, over the past eight weeks, the Dow transports have stood head and shoulders above the rest. Its 8.5% gain from an Aug. 24 low of 9010 towers over both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.


The S&P 600 on Tuesday notched an all-time new high and has outperformed the Nasdaq composite, gaining 8.2% from its mid-August low near 813.


While the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 remains low, signifying a relative dearth of intense professional selling, it's no time to be complacent. As top stocks build new bases and break out, the savvy investor will step to the sidelines when the base itself is shabby looking, or the day-to-day price action is too wild. Such things give a subtle clue that a top dog is tiring and that a real correction could be in store.


Market veterans are not hesitating to note that the market has been sucked dry of volatility.


Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial, notes that we are currently in "the second longest streak without a 3% correction for the S&P 500, suggesting volatility could come at any time."


White notes that on Sept. 11, the current bull market became the second largest since World War II as its 270% gain by the S&P 500 edged out a 267% rise from June 1949 to August 1956. The biggest bull run of them all? A 417% pole vault during the Go Go 1990s.


Year to date, the Nasdaq still harbors a terrific lead over the other major benchmarks. At 6380, the market cap-weighted Nasdaq composite is still up 18.5%, crushing the S&P's 11.5% gain.


But if smaller banks, oil companies, cyclicals, transportation and NYSE-listed travel and leisure-related names continue to rally, they could help boost the S&P 500's already solid advance. And if stocks such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and the like pull back further in price and spend more time below their 50-day and 10-week lines, the Nasdaq could see its advance slow significantly.


Are we seeing a reversion to the mean, indexeswise?


Quite possibly. It is in fact very unusual for an index such as the Nasdaq to greatly outdistance the S&P 500, and vice versa. Many of the biggest companies in the latter have a disproportionately large impact on the former.


Keep watching the changes in ratings and behavior of these two indexes via the "What's The Market Trend?" page, a PDF link at the bottom of this story.


Right now, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are similar in that their respective advance-decline lines continue to rise and reach new high ground. That's bullish. So is the fact that both indexes have been generally riding on the north side of their 50-day moving averages.


While the S&P 500, however, shows a strong Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-, the Nasdaq has a sour D rating, indicating that over the past 13 weeks, institutional investors have been net sellers of stock.


Now, a D or even E rating for the Nasdaq is not an automatic signal to go 100% cash. All it means is that volume has been unusually heavy during down days in the market lately.


And for sure, particularly from late July to mid-August, the Nasdaq suffered some big declines in above-average turnover. Yet over the past six weeks, those types of declines have diminished in number.


The Dow Jones industrials, which has a small numbers of decent outperformers this year, scores a B+ Accumulation Rating amid the cyclical upturn in the economy and a budding rebound in commodity prices.

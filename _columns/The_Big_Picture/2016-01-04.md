A New Year's celebration on Wall Street Monday was far from happy, at least for the bulls, as a rout in China stocks overnight fueled a broad sell-off, putting the market in a correction.


After falling as much as 3.2%, the Nasdaq ended near its session high but still lost 2.1%. The Dow gave up 1.6% and the S&P 500 fell 1.5%. Small caps lagged again, with the Russell 2000 down 2.4%. The IBD 50 slumped 2.6%.


Volume rose sharply from Thursday's light levels. Breadth was bad, but not horrendous, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers on the Nasdaq by roughly 3-to-1. NYSE Losers topped winners by just over 2-to-1.

Headed into Monday, all four groups ranked inside the top 30 of IBD's 197 industry group rankings.


Negative sentiment was fueled by a 6.9% plunge in the Shanghai Composite. Over the weekend, China's official manufacturing index rose slightly but signaled contraction for a fifth straight month in December.


A U.S. manufacturing index fell to the worst since June 2009.


Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic ties with Iran in response to the storming of its embassy in Tehran. After trading as high as $38.39 a barrel, crude oil futures eased 0.8% to settle at $36.76 a barrel.


The market has seen its share of distribution the past few months, but its character changed dramatically Monday. Leading growth stocks, pillars of strength in recent weeks, finally succumbed to institutional selling, with many breaking below their 50-day moving averages.


**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) gapped below its 50-day line in more than double the average volume. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) also gapped down in heavy volume.


It's been a challenging market for several weeks now, with sudden shifts in direction. When the stock market looked like it was ready to head lower, it went higher, and vice versa.


From Dec. 2 through Dec 11, the Nasdaq flashed five distribution days in eight sessions. That put the market in a correction. But a bullish upside reversal on Dec. 14 and two straight solid gains after that put the market back in a confirmed uptrend. More distribution followed right after that.


The best course of action for investors now is to stay on the sidelines for now. Wall Street's appetite for growth stocks has been indecisive, to say the least.

Stocks spent most of the session in the red Thursday, and action became uglier as the day unfolded.

  

The Nasdaq skidded 1.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow dropped 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively. The IBD 50 lost 1.6%.

  

Volume rose on the Nasdaq but fell on the NYSE, adding to the Nasdaq's distribution-day count.

  

The market had a lot to contend with Thursday.

  

Negative international news piled up: Israel began a ground invasion of Gaza. Tensions increased in eastern Ukraine after a commercial airliner apparently was shot down. And fighting persisted in Iraq, though Iranian forces seem to have tipped the balance against the insurgents.

  

The market also didn't get much help from economic news.

  

First-time jobless claims were modestly less than feared, but the housing sector delivered a staggering miss.

  

Housing starts for June were worse than even the most bearish analysts imagined. June's numbers came in 13% below the consensus view and 9% below the lowest estimate in the range.

  

Homebuilder stocks fell, but volume was not especially strong. The Building-Residential/Commercial industry group is now near its 200-day moving average, an area where it found support in April.

  

If there was any consolation for stock-market bulls, it was that bulls aren't hanging their hopes on the housing stocks.

  

Sector leadership currently is in the transportation, computer, auto and energy stocks.

  

With the uptrend under pressure, investors should be cautious about buying stocks or adding shares to their holdings. This is a good time to study opportunities that could emerge if the uptrend finds new life.

  

For many stocks, strength is now defined by how a stock declines. Look for retreats in soft volume. That indicates funds aren't dumping shares.

  

Charts showing this kind of soft action include oil and gas explorer **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), home furnishings retailer **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), railroad equipment supplier **Wabtec** ([WAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAB)) and chip designer **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)).

  

A few stocks generally rising in this conflicted market also exist. They include, insurer **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)), miner **Randgold Resources** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)), real-estate developer **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)), rental equipment provider **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) and **Canadian Pacific Railway** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)).

  

After the close, **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) rose despite mixed Q2 results. **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) beat on the top and bottom lines. Blue initially rose in after-hours trade but then fell 1% below the day's close.

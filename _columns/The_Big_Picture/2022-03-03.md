The stock market ended lower Thursday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq sold off after reversing from early gains. Despite Thursday's weakness, the rally attempt remains intact.




**Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)), **Boyd Gaming** ([BYD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYD)), **Commercial Metals** ([CMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMC)), **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) and **Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) are among the stocks to watch ahead of a potential [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


Stock Market Today
------------------


The stock market reversed lower Thursday, as a second round of Russia-Ukraine talks [failed to reach an agreement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-forces-advance-in-southern-ukraine-ahead-of-cease-fire-talks-11646307424) on a cease-fire. However, the two sides did agree on civilian evacuations. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the invasion is going according to plan, as his forces [entered the city of Kherson](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-forces-advance-in-southern-ukraine-ahead-of-cease-fire-talks-11646307424) to become the first regional capital to come under Russian occupation since the start of the invasion.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% Thursday, while the S&P 500 reversed 0.5% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off 1.6%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 slid 1.3%. Top growth stocks also ended lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 0.1% in a day of tight price action.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP030322-256x300.jpg)The 10-year Treasury yield ticked down to 1.84% in the wake of Wednesday's surge back above 1.86%. On March 1, the 10-year Treasury yield traded as low as 1.68%. West Texas Intermediate crude briefly traded above $116 a barrel before reversing lower to close around $107.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to also be lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Rally Attempt
--------------------------


Thursday was Day 6 of the ongoing rally attempt, which means a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) — signaling the start of a new uptrend — is possible anytime now. Market bottoms often happen when investors least expect it, so be ready with a [well-researched watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist). The [market trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) remains a "market in correction."


During market corrections, investors should be in cash. But don't tune out. Instead, keep a watchlist of top-performing stocks that are trying to hold up during the market weakness. Use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) to help you identify some emerging market leaders.

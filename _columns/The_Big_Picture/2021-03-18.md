Dow Reverses From Record Highs, Tech Stocks Dive As Yields Spike; Nike Slides On Earnings
==========================================================================================

The stock market sold off Thursday, as Treasury yields spiked to 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another record high before reversing lower, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dived. But Dow component Nike slid on mixed results after the close.




The Nasdaq sharply underperformed, tumbling 3%. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, while the Dow Jones industrials reversed 0.5% lower. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 2.9%.


Leading growth stocks also sold off sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 2.7% Thursday. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [No. 23-ranked](https://www.investors.com/research/medifast-stock-looks-to-rebound-after-run-strong-momentum/) **Medifast** ([MED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MED)) broke down through its 50-day moving average, sliding 7.5%.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each picked up a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Despite the new distribution day Thursday, the Nasdaq's count remains at five. That's because the Feb. 10 distribution day fell off due to time. Distribution days older than 25 trading sessions are no longer considered relevant to the current stock market trend.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![MP031821](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP031821-220x300.jpg)Last Wednesday, IBD's market outlook was upgraded to confirmed uptrend due to strength outside the Nasdaq. And that divergence continued Thursday. The Nasdaq struggled mightily, giving up its key 50-day moving average, even as the Dow 30 set another record high.


High-growth technology stocks remain under pressure, as the 10-year Treasury yield spiked as high as 1.754% before easing to 1.73% by the market close.


During the relatively new stock market uptrend, investors should be constantly looking for the next wave of leaders, but watchful of fast deterioration as the market tries to find clear direction. While tech and growth stocks largely are out of favor, there are opportunities in real economy stocks.


One of the best ways to identify the next cycle of leading stocks is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If a stock is outperforming the broader market, the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, the line will point lower.

For example, the RS line of [Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/williams-sonoma-stock-offers-multiple-buy-points-tears-higher/), **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), surged to new highs.


Dow Jones Leader Nike Reports Earnings
--------------------------------------


Dow Jones leader **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) ended Thursday about 3% away from a 148.05 buy point in a flat base, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)Â chart analysis.


Late Thursday, Nike reported [mixed fiscal Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-nike-earnings-q3-2021-adidas-partners-peloton-apparel/). The company's earnings topped estimates, but revenue fell short of targets. Nike stock tumbled more than 4% in extended trade before slashing losses.

Stocks To Watch: Vista Outdoor, Williams-Sonoma
-----------------------------------------------


Amid the day's tech-driven carnage, there were several bright spots, particularly in leisure and retail stocks.


**Vista Outdoor** ([VSTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VSTO)) continued to rebound from its 50-day line Thursday, rallying 1.6%. Shares also moved above an [early entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/tesla-stock-showed-early-buy-point-dow-jones-leader-microsoft-nvidia-stock/) at 33.60, but closed below the buy point after slashing gains. Keep in mind that IBD urges investors to buy fewer shares at alternative buy points to mitigate the additional risk.


Vista, which owns a number of outdoor-recreation brands, is a new addition to [IBD Leaderboard.](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Per Leaderboard commentary, "the stock also cleared a trend line that touches most of the highs over the past several weeks."


[Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/williams-sonoma-stock-offers-multiple-buy-points-tears-higher/), Williams-Sonoma, staged a breakaway gap past a 151.26 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) following the [company's strong Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/wsm-stock-buy-point-williams-sonoma-earnings/). The company's earnings jumped 85% to $3.95 a share. Revenue rose 24% to $2.29 billion, the third straight quarter of accelerating top-line growth. Same-store sales also accelerated.


During [breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/), investors can also use the high price of the first five minutes as a proper buy point using a five-minute chart. Buy shares as close as possible to that price. For Williams-Sonoma, that buy point was 160.49.

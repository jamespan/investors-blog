  Software Stocks Lead Another Stock Market Rally, But Sellers Hit Oil & Gas Stocks

The stock market continued its winning ways Tuesday as the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 officially broke out of downtrends after last week's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).




A strong day of outperformance for software stocks helped boost the Nasdaq composite to a gain of 0.9%, its eighth consecutive gain. It's the longest Nasdaq win streak since an 11-day run that ended Nov. 8, 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Large-cap technology stocks did most of the heavy lifting, but breadth was weak again with losers beating winners by a small margin.


Among the [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) stocks, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) extended their winning streaks to eight sessions and are near the top of bases. But it would be better if these stocks pull back from sharp rallies off their lows and form handles.


The challenge right now for growth investors is finding stocks that aren't ripe for pullbacks after strong moves off lows.


But several stocks have been holding gains well after bullish earnings reports and are good candidates for the watchlist, including **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **FTAI Aviation** ([FTAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTAI)) and **FTI Consulting** ([FCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCN)). Tight, sideways trading could present new entries. The latter two stocks are just above buy zones.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP110723-240x300.jpg)The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) rallied nearly 1%, helped by a 28.5% gain for enterprise software firm **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), which [reported strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ddog-stock-datadog-earnings-news-q32023/) and gave bullish guidance. Other cloud software stocks rallied on the news, including **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)). Both stocks soared 11%.


Five of the day's top performing industry groups hailed from the software sector.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lagged with gains of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. A sell-off in oil and gas stocks weighed on the S&P 500, but the index still rallied for the seventh straight session.


Declining stocks beat advancers on the NYSE by about 4-to-3.


**SLB** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500, down 5.6%. SLB closed just above its 200-day line. A slew of other oil and gas stocks fell 2% to 3% in the S&P 500.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled at $77.37 a barrel, down 4.3%.


In the oil field services group, **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) flashed an unequivocal sell signal with a sharp break of the 50-day line. The provider of offshore marine support and transportation services reported another quarter of exceptional growth, but earnings missed expectations by a wide margin. For 2024, the company said it expects revenue of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, just above the $1.35 billion consensus.

**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) were top performers in the Dow Jones industrials with gains of around 2%. But **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Dow Inc.** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) lagged with losses of 0.8% to 1.8%.


After jumping 10 basis points Monday, the 10-year Treasury gave back most of that gain Tuesday and is once again testing support at the 50-day moving average.


What To Do Now
--------------


The stock market continues to perform well after follow-through days for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 last week. More stocks are flashing buy signals, either by breaking out of new bases or finding support at key moving averages.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) has been increasing exposure since last week. The model portfolio is currently around 80% invested and holds 11 stocks. We increased the **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) position on a strong day overall for security software stocks. The group jumped 2.2%.



But the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are starting to look overbought after multiple up days in a row. That means a pullback could come at any time.


Stock market bulls want to see a low-volume pullback for the major stock indexes as opposed to a sharp pullback in higher volume. If [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) start to crop up in the indexes, that would be a sign to start playing some defense by trimming some winners.


The Nasdaq closed just below its Oct. 12 high of 13,714. It's still a potential resistance level to watch. So far, though, the bullish action in market-leading growth stocks means that a year-end stock market rally could still have more left.

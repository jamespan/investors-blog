S&P 500 Firms Up, But Nasdaq Lags, Small Caps Slide; Stock Market Still Lacks Clear Direction
==============================================================================================

Major stock indexes shook off some morning weakness, and the S&P 500 closed near session highs Monday — just like an index should act in a confirmed uptrend.




With a [follow-through signal on the S&P 500 Friday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-late-extends-rebound-leading-stocks-improve/), the stock market's posture improved. Investors should be building up their portfolios, adding institutional-quality companies that break out of sound bases or other proper entries.


But the stock market's pesky problem this year is a lack of consistency, and it didn't go away with the [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). (The follow-through confirmed a rally attempt started in early March.)


While the S&P 500 took care of a 0.8% decline with steady afternoon progress, the Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 were left out in the cold. The Russell 2000 tumbled nearly 2.7% and is meeting resistance at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


![MP032921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP032921-241x300.jpg)Although the Nasdaq trimmed losses, it still lost 0.6%. The Nasdaq — hit with losses in solar and semiconductor shares — is about 3% below its 50-day average.


The Nasdaq 100 almost wiped away all of its 1.1% morning decline. It finished down just 0.1%.


Stock Market Still Choppy
-------------------------


Indexes and leadership have struggled to sustain direction in 2021. The current uptrend will need both to settle on a higher course, or risk more whipsaw action. Choppy markets require more effort to harvest any gains, and investors need to stay keenly aware of [sector rotation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-sector-rotation/) and where breakouts are occurring.


And then you have to watch out in case breakouts start to unwind, like **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) saw during a fast rotation out of cyclicals.


CF recently climbed out of a rare chart pattern, the [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/), as noted in [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). Shares have sunk below the 48.98 entry.



With growth stocks wavering and new leadership struggling for clear definition, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average is now the leading major index this year. It is up 8.4% since Jan. 1, compared with 5.7% for the S&P 500. The technology-packed Nasdaq, which last year romped to a 43.4% gain, is only 1.3% higher for 2021.


The Feb. 22 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the S&P 500 dropped off because it's too far back in time. Still, the S&P 500 has five distribution days and the Nasdaq a half-dozen. That's a higher-than-normal amount of high-volume losses over the past five weeks.


Lower Volume, No True Breakouts
-------------------------------


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE, which spared the Nasdaq from a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). But even as sellers dissipated through the session, breadth was bearish. Declining stocks led advancers by 2-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 3-1 on the Nasdaq.


The stock market Monday saw little in terms of breakouts. **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) topped a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/), but closed below the 24.56 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). A few others reversed lower from buy points, such as **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)).


If there weren't breakouts to keep investors interested, there were headlines that may end up being among the biggest of the year.



Financials fell as a crisis unfolded at some major banks. **Nomura** ([NMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMR)) and **Credit Suisse** ([CS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CS)) gapped down sharply after warning of possibly billions of dollars in losses after [a hedge fund was forced to sell vast holdings to meet margin requirements](https://www.investors.com/news/banking-stocks-credit-suisse-nomura-reel-from-archegos-hedge-fund-fire-sale/). Reports said the fund was Archegos Capital Management, which is said to be the seller behind drastic sell-offs in **Viacom** ([CBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBS)), **Discovery** ([DISCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DISCA)) and other media stocks.


Dow component **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) climbed 2.3% after its hobbled [737 Max program got a huge boost](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/boeing-stock-southwest-american-airlines-eye-big-fleet-moves/). Longtime customer **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) ordered 100 737 Max jets and signed for options on 155 more planes. Boeing shares regained a 244.18 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a cup base.


The [Suez Canal reopened](https://www.investors.com/news/suez-canal-sage-takes-positive-turn-oil-prices-go-negative/) after a container ship was dislodged from the crucial shipping lane connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Dozens of other cargo and tanker ships were rerouted during the nearly weeklong jam.

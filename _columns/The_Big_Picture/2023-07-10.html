<p>The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY" target="_blank">FFTY</a>) jumped 2.8%, with 15 names up 3% more just before the close. <a href="https://leaderboard.investors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leaderboard</a> stock <strong>DraftKings</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG" target="_blank">DKNG</a>) jumped 8% to an all-time high, while <strong>Alphatec Holdings</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATEC" target="_blank">ATEC</a>) gained 4.9% and reclaimed a 17.13 buy point in strong volume,</p>
<p>Small caps also outperformed, lifting the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM" target="_blank">IWM</a>) to a gain of 1.7%. After getting turned away at the 1900 level last month, the Russell 2000 small-cap index is quickly approaching the level again. Midcaps also performed well, with the SPDR S&amp;P MidCap 400 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY" target="_blank">MDY</a>) up 1.3%.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial rallied 0.6% as weakness in <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT" target="_blank">MSFT</a>) and <strong>Apple</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL" target="_blank">AAPL</a>) was offset by gains of at least 2.5% for <strong>Intel</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC" target="_blank">INTC</a>), <strong>Amgen</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN" target="_blank">AMGN</a>) and <strong>Home Depot</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD" target="_blank">HD</a>).</p>
<h2>Stock Market Today</h2>
<p>The Nasdaq composite added edged up 0.2% in slightly higher volume. Large-cap technology stocks like <strong>Tesla</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA" target="_blank">TSLA</a>), <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL" target="_blank">GOOGL</a>) and Microsoft lagged in the <a href="https://marketsmith.investors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MarketSmith Growth 250</a>, but the declines didn't have much effect on the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ" target="_blank">QQQ</a>), which closed barely higher after erasing earlier losses.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>
<p>The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW" target="_blank">QQEW</a>) jumped 1.8%. So it wasn't surprising to see strong breadth on the Nasdaq again, with winners beating losers by just over 2-to-1.</p>

<p>Top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included security software stocks <strong>Zscaler</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS" target="_blank">ZS</a>), <strong>Fortinet</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT" target="_blank">FTNT</a>) and <strong>CrowdStrike</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD" target="_blank">CRWD</a>). All three closed with gains of at least 4%. Zscaler gave an early buy signal with a heavy-volume move above last week's highs. Fortinet jumped to an all-time high, but it's extended after a breakout over the 70 level. CRWD stock bounced nicely off its 50-day line.</p>

<p>Leadership is broad-based in the security software group. Headed into Monday, the group ranked 23rd out of 197 industries tracked by IBD based on six-month price performance. Another leader in the group, <strong>Palo Alto Networks</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW" target="_blank">PANW</a>) first joined <a href="https://leaderboard.investors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leaderboard</a> on May 24. We increased the position on June 1.</p>
<p>Two artificial intelligence stocks in the Nasdaq 100 — <strong>Adobe</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE" target="_blank">ADBE</a>) and <strong>Marvell Technology</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL" target="_blank">MRVL</a>) — also moved well. Both stocks are holding gains well after rallying on earnings. After five straight up weeks in May and June, ADBE stock is trading tightly near highs and holding support at its 10-day line. MRVL stock is near a first test of its 10-week line after a low-volume pullback.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 picked up 0.2% in lower volume. Advancers beat decliners on the NYSE by a little more than 2-to-1.</p>
<h2>What To Do Now</h2>
<p>The confirmed uptrend continues to show signs of strength with a manageable <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distribution-day count</a>. Five distribution days for the S&amp;P 500 since June 7 might seem like a lot, but three of those showed declines of 0.2% to 0.4%. The other two declines were less than 1%.</p>
<p>It's OK to let your winners run in the current stock market environment, but be discerning with new buys and be careful not to chase extended stocks. It might be tempting to buy a leader like <strong>Super Micro Computer</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI" target="_blank">SMCI</a>), but it's about 20% above its 10-week moving average. At this point, it's best to wait for SMCI to form a new base.</p>
<p>Speaking of bases, <a href="https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBD 50</a> stock and enterprise software firm <strong>Datadog</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG" target="_blank">DDOG</a>) closed well off highs with the stock market Friday. But DDOG reclaimed the 100 level Monday and closed just below a 103.80 entry.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns medium-6 leftchart"><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=weekly&amp;symbol=DDOG"></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Synopsys</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS" target="_blank">SNPS</a>), a provider of electronic design automation software, is forming a flat base as it holds support at the 10-week line.</p>
<h2>Economic Data/Earnings</h2>
<p>The latest reading on consumer inflation is due Wednesday with the release of the <a href="https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumer price index</a>. The producer price index, which measures wholesale inflation, follows one day later. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate by another 25 basis points at the conclusion of the two-day meeting on July 26.</p>
<p>After a breakout last week to its highest level since November, the 10-year Treasury yield hit a high of 4.09% before reversing lower, along with the Invesco Deutsche Bank U.S. Dollar Bullish ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP" target="_blank">UUP</a>). The yield was trading around 4% just after 4:30 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>The one thing the stock market has going for it is a weak dollar. After getting turned away at the 200-day line, UUP fell below its 50-day line Monday. U.S. firms that sell their products overseas tend to do well when the greenback is weak.</p>
<p>Financial stocks will be in focus at the end of the week, with Q2 results from <strong>JPMorgan</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM" target="_blank">JPM</a>), <strong>Citigroup</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C" target="_blank">C</a>) and <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC" target="_blank">WFC</a>) due Friday before the open.</p>
<p>JPM stock is the healthiest among the three. The first buy signal came on June 29, when JPM jumped 3.5% in heavy volume. It's still holding above its short-term moving averages and is in buy range from a 143.37 entry.</p>

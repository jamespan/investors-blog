  Stock Market Builds Its January Gains; As Earnings Season Ignites, Don't Forget This Critical Factor

The stock market is all about earnings. But wait. Don't forget about sales too.




**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and **Howmet Aerospace** ([HWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HWM)), two leading companies in two wholly different industries, reemphasized this second point about why the stock market does what it does.


Intuitive, the pioneer and leader in robotic surgical systems, [issued preliminary sales figures for the fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/isrg-stock-jumps-on-q4-revision-new-buy-point-in-play/) that pleased Wall Street. And Howmet, defying the continued bludgeoning of shares in industry peer and hobbled Dow Jones Industrial Average component **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), flew nearly 3.5% and into new high ground in big volume.


The reason? At least a pair of sell-side Wall Street analysts praised the company's fundamentals. Bernstein reportedly noted that it delights in the pricing power of the engineered metal products firm.


Strong prices mean solid sales. And growing sales and margins act as the cornerstone of superior earnings increases.


Stock Market Today
------------------



From a 30,000-foot view of the stock market, these small corporate anecdotes may not seem like much. But they add up. And with the [fourth-quarter earnings season](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) about to accelerate on Friday, investors can benefit from using these pieces of information to help understand what is really going on.


The [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), meanwhile, behaved the way it should in a confirmed uptrend that is in its third month of life.

A Short-Term Summit?
--------------------


Perhaps it's no surprise that the Nasdaq composite is leading the way with its 0.8% advance to 14,969. At one point, the tech-enriched index floated up to a session high of 14,998, just a few points below 15,000, a psychological level.


This means the Nasdaq, having marked a fourth up day in a row, has now lifted 19% from its Oct. 26 low of 12,543.


Back then, the Nasdaq likely gave most investors a pretty sour taste, at least technically. The index sawed right through its 200-day moving average, which was still rising.


More than three months later, the composite has now created an 11% cushion above its still-rising 200-day line. It also stands 4.7% above the upward-sloping [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) as well.


Volume fell on both main exchanges vs. Tuesday. Perhaps some investors decided to stay on the sidelines ahead of a fresh take on U.S. consumer prices. The [key economic data](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) hits the wires before the open on Thursday.


Meta Leads The Megacap Names
----------------------------



All but one of the Magnificent Seven megacap techs advanced. Stock market leader **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), a [half-size position on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), scored a nearly 3.7% gain in brisk turnover.


Zoom out a little more, and the 20 top-performing industry groups on the day include education and media software, security software, desktop software, financial software, internet content and computer networking companies. All of these groups rallied 1.3% or more, according to early data. (Please see the final numbers at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 waged a nearly 0.6% rise. Like the Nasdaq, the large-cap benchmark opened with slight gains but steadily moved higher throughout the remainder of the session. The S&P 500 Wednesday made its highest close since Jan. 4, 2022.



Adding to the bullish action, the Russell 2000 wiped away an early loss of more than 0.7% after 45 minutes of action to land nicely on its feet, up 0.1% on the day. The Dow Jones industrials rose almost 0.5%, even getting some help from a 2-point gain in Boeing. The jet and satellite behemoth is still trading near its own 50-day moving average.


Robert Maltbie, president of micro- and small-cap research firm Singular Research, believes smaller equities provide strong opportunities in the coming years. One reason? Valuation.


"The total value of stocks in the Russell 2000 is around $2.7 trillion. That's less than Apple stock alone," Maltbie told IBD. Apple's valuation as of Wednesday: $2.9 trillion.


Maltbie also manages the Argonaut 2000 Fund, which in December ranked among the top 4% in Eureka's Hedge Fund Index. Argonaut reports the fund's 5-year annualized performance of 15% also ranks in the top of all mutual funds over that time frame.

Even Small Caps Need Focus On The Top Line
------------------------------------------


Maltbie notes that with as much as an estimated $6 trillion sitting on the sidelines in mainly money market funds, a return of even just a portion of that money could have dramatic effects on quality small-cap issues â€” in general, those stocks with market values of under $2 billion.


"Valuations in the overall market are pretty fair, and interest rates are coming down faster than most people think," Maltbie added.


Analyst coverage among micro-cap stocks is notoriously thin. This means it can be difficult to even value a company based on earnings as no published estimates exist. So, Singular Research focuses on companies with substantial sales and compares candidates with their respective industries in terms of price-to-sales ratios.


Stock Market Internals
----------------------


While the Nasdaq proved the leading index within the stock market, the actual market internals looked a shade better on the NYSE side. Why? Advancers beat decliners by roughly a 4-3 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, data on Thinkorswim showed. On the Nasdaq, falling issues edged out gainers 2,152 to 2,045.


Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average of Nasdaq-listed stocks hitting 52-week highs has cooled in the past two weeks, now at 122 vs. the 10-day average of stocks making new lows at 62. That's still a good ratio. [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) plots this data on "NASDQ" on the daily chart.


On the NYSE side, the 10-day moving average of stocks making new highs, at 74 as of Wednesday, sharply beats new lows at 11. See "NYEXG" on MarketSmith for a detailed look.


Bullishness in the weekly Investors Intelligence survey cooled to 54% vs. 57.1% last week. See the [IBD psychological market indicators section](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) for details.

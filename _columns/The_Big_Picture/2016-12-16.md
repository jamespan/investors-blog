Stock Indexes Falter; Can Apple Clear Base On Base?
====================================================

Stocks stumbled Friday but stayed in the neighborhood of the week's new highs.


The Nasdaq trimmed 0.4%, while the S&P 500 shaved off less than 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average closed virtually flat.


![mp121616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP121616-189x300.png)Trade rose across the board. Friday was a quadruple witching day, which usually lifts volume.


The Nov. 10 distribution day fell off the Nasdaq, but the Nasdaq suffered additional distribution Friday, albeit with witching volume.


While the week was slightly negative for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, the Dow Jones industrial average mustered a 0.4% gain.


The blue chip Dow has outperformed the Nasdaq and S&P 500 during the so-called Trump rally.


Blue chips rarely lead a vigorous rally, but seven Dow components have delivered double-digit percentage gains since the Election Day close.


They are **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), up 31%; **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), 21%; **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), 15%; **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), 13%; **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), 12%; and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), each up 10%.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Looking for a winning stock? [Focus on EPS growth](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-a-winning-stock-focus-on-eps-growth-in-recent-quarters/) in recent quarters.*

The Dow, though, hasn't kept pace with small caps. Yet the small caps have fallen in two of the past three weeks. The S&P 600 fell 1.9% in the week ended Dec. 2 and 1.8% in the past week.


For individual investors, results could be either satisfying or frustrating, depending on how they played the Trump rally.


Yet those two camps could be in similar situations now.


How so?


Many winning stocks hit the 20% to 25% profit-taking level, so those who took profits are looking for new stocks to buy.


Those who missed the train are also looking for stocks to buy.


What's out there?


The pickings aren't as abundant as five weeks ago. But here's a tip: Look for base-on-base patterns.


The base on base consists of a base whose lows are around the highs of the previous pattern. Moves out of a base on base can be powerful. Generally they are better bets for big gains than secondary buy points.


Stocks that have or could be shaping a base on base include: discount retailer **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), biotech **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), and construction aggregates provider **Summit Materials** ([SUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUM)).


**U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)), another stock from the concrete industry group, is working on a base with a potential buy point at 67.71.

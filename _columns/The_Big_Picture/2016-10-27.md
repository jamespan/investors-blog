Stock indexes in the U.S. showed more signs of institutional selling Thursday as the market awaited the first reading on third-quarter GDP.


The Nasdaq lost 0.7% and broke under its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). The S&P 500 fell 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.2%. The IBD 50 dropped 1.3%.


Volume rose across the board, lifting the [distribution-day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) count to seven apiece for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The market uptrend remains under pressure.


A cluster of distribution days has frustrated the bulls. In the past 15 trading days, either the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 or both have incurred distribution in six sessions, including each of the past three days.

However, despite all the distribution, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 aren't far off their highs. Many leading stocks are still in fine shape, although some have dropped below the 50-day line this week.


Losses were broad on the indexes Thursday. Declining issues led rising issues by a 5-to-2 ratio on the NYSE and 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. For top-rated stocks, it was worse. In the IBD 50, losers led winners by a 6-to-1 ratio.


Among leaders moving in volume, the balance favored the losers, as the Market Pulse shows.


After hours, the market got some bad news. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) posted Q3 earnings that were 33% below the Street's consensus view. Amazon stumbled 5% in after-hours action.


Amazon had been one of the true leaders of this year's market. The big cap closed regular trading up 70% from its closing low Feb. 9. Thursday's earnings report threatens to puncture the confidence that bulls have in Amazon and in this market.


Persistent bulls always have a fallback position, and at this juncture it's **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). The megacap company topped the Street's figure on earnings by 5% and on revenue by 2%. The stock rose almost 1% in after-hours trading.


Small caps, which often serve as a gauge for boldness, also took a hit Thursday. The S&P 600 fell 1.1%, underperforming the big cap S&P 500 for the third consecutive session.


On the plus side, bank stocks logged gains Thursday. Over the past four weeks, the super regionals and money center groups have risen 9% and 6%, respectively. Banks are expected to profit as interest rates rise, and the Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates in December.


In economic news, reports were mixed. First-time jobless claims came in slightly higher than expected. Pending home sales in September rose 1.5%, topping views for 1%. Durable goods orders in September slipped 0.1% vs. views for a 0.2% gain. But the prior flat reading for August was revised upward to 0.3%.


On Friday before the open, the first reading on Q3 GDP will be released. The Street expects 2.5% growth, which would be the best in five quarters. The range of estimates runs from 2.2% to 3.1%.

Stocks Trim Some Losses As Iran Strike Elevates Risk Of War
============================================================

The stock market staggered early Friday from geopolitical fears, but the major indexes reduced losses and the market's decline seemed ordinary by session's end.




The Nasdaq composite was down more than 1.2% and the S&P 500 was off 1.1% at the open on news that a U.S. airstrike killed a top Iranian general. The attack sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and it was a reminder that some market risks lie far from Wall Street.


But after the shock wore off, the stock market started working off some of the losses. The Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.8% lower and the S&P 500 ended off 0.7%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose slightly NYSE. The increase in volume, small as it was, was enough to add a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) to the S&P 500. Still, the number of distribution days is light.

The ISM manufacturing index was 47.2 in December, below the 50 mark for the fifth straight month. "This matches the streak during the 2015-16 collapse in oil prices as the most persistent factory contraction since the Great Recession," BMO Capital Markets economist Michael Gregory said in a note.


Stock Market Economic Risks
---------------------------


The stock market suffered a larger decline Dec. 2, when the previous ISM report came out. The Nasdaq slid 1.1% that day as trade worries also pervaded the stock market.


While indexes pared losses, they also closed well off session highs. In all, the day's action didn't look like the start of a new war.


Stepping back from Friday's action, the major indexes' upward price trends remained intact.


As is typical on a day of geopolitical risk, investors fled to havens such as bonds and gold. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell 9 basis points to 1.79%. Bullion rose 1.5% to above $1,550 an ounce. Utilities won favor as investors sought [shelter in dividends](https://www.investors.com/research/what-is-a-dividend/). The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) rose 0.2%.


With the threat of war suddenly rising, [defense stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/defense-stocks-higher-u-s-kills-top-iranian-commander/) were the fifth-best industry group in the stock market, up more than 3%. **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), **L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)), **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)), **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) and other military contractors outperformed.


No region is more closely tied to crude oil than the Middle East, and Friday's news sent oil prices higher. U.S. crude rose above $63 a barrel, touching the highest level since April at session highs. Oil exploration, drilling and oilfield services were among the top industry groups Friday.

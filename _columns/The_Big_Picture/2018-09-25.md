Stock Market Mixed, But Leaders Shine; What The Nasdaq Needs To Do Now
=======================================================================

The stock market wandered aimlessly Tuesday, but the indecisive tone masked strength in leading stocks.




The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.2% after a session of minor movement. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% after erasing a small gain. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3% and closed near session lows. The Dow industrials just had a strong week in which they rose more than 2.2%, so some giveback seems natural.


Small caps were up as the Russell 2000 added 0.2%. The index is trying to hold above its 50-day moving average.


Volume was lower on the NYSE and Nasdaq, as if to underscore the sleepy session.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MP_092518-229x300.jpg)The market might be keeping its powder dry until the Federal Reserve comes out with its decision on interest rates Wednesday afternoon. But almost all investors and economists expect the Fed to raise the benchmark rate by a quarter point, so there's no real suspense.


With the major indexes mixed, there was no clear leadership. Mining, defense and software were notable advancing sectors, though investors didn't find much to buy in those areas. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), a new member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), [is in buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) from a 364.64 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) as it holds near last week's breakout.


Breakout attempts in Brazilian miner **Vale** ([VALE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VALE)) and **BHP Billiton** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) were uninspiring.


Leading Stocks Outperform
-------------------------


But the IBD 50 performed well, rising 1.2%. Only seven of the 50 stocks closed lower, and a few made impressive gains.


**Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) soared 11% to a new high in double its usual volume. RBC Capital [raised the price target](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/trade-desk-ttd-stock-price-target/) to 170 from 126, citing a new product that offers a media planner, user interface and an artificial intelligence engine.


**Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/), clearing the 53.51 buy point in more than triple the average volume. After an Aug. 10 breakout that went nowhere, investors will look for a better performance this time around. The gym operator [joined Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) for the second time in nearly six months.


**Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) topped the 436.52 buy point of a [lopsided double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). Volume was heavy. The base, however, is a riskier late-stage pattern, and the relative strength line has not made a new high.

There were a few breakouts outside the IBD 50, too.


**SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) broke out of a shallow [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), gapping past the 122.61 buy point in more than three times the normal turnover. The German company is in the enterprise software industry group, which has been a market leader for months and has been a steady provider of good breakouts, attractive pullbacks and new bases.


But while the software sector remains in favor, semiconductors continue to sputter. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 1.7%. Raymond James downgraded chip stocks Tuesday, warning that the [semiconductor industry has "entered a cyclical downturn."](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-downgraded-cyclical-concerns/)



That's hurting the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which is basically at the same spot it was on the market close of Sept. 5. The Dow and S&P 500 have outperformed the Nasdaq in that time, and much of the reason has been the weakening of chip stocks.


The Nasdaq's Test
-----------------


The Nasdaq this week is rising from a pullback to the 50-day moving average. The composite rose from that level several times since July. This month, however, the Nasdaq has been reluctant to rally back. This is the third time in as many weeks that it dips to the 50-day line, tries to rebound, then runs out of breath. However, the dips have remained very mild.


8000 is still looking like a key area of upside resistance for the Nasdaq. Watch for the index to beat 8000 and stay above the psychologically important round number if it's to rebound with conviction.


The energy sector was strong, even with oil prices flat. **Oasis Petroleum** ([OAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OAS)) broke out of a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/), but closed slightly below the 14 buy point.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 3.10% and is nearing the 2018 peak of 3.11%. The market is baking in expectations of higher interest rates. That may explain why utility stocks, which compete with bonds for yield investors, were down. The SPDR Utilities ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) slid 1.4%.


But other rate-sensitive stocks were little changed. Real estate investment trust industry groups fell 0.1% and 0.2%, while banks were modestly lower.

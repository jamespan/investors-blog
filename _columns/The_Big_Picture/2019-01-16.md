Stock Market Rally Led By Goldman Sachs; Nasdaq Stalls After Early Pop
=======================================================================

The stock market extended gains Wednesday, led by a rally in banks and airline stocks. But while there was plenty of green in Wednesday's session, the action in leading growth stocks was dubious at best. And the Nasdaq composite showed [stalling action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) as an 0.8% gain faded to less than 0.2% by the close. The S&P 500 also showed stalling action.




**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) were the stars of the day, up nearly 10% and 7%, respectively. The big gains weren't enough to help the S&P 500, which could only manage a gain of 0.2% by the close. The index is bumping up against its 50-day moving average, a key level reclaimed by the Nasdaq composite Tuesday.


Goldman was the top performing stock in the Dow Jones, boosting the blue-chip index to a gain of 0.6%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added 0.7%. Volume on the Nasdaq rose from Tuesday. Higher volume and stalling action resulted in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq, its first since a new uptrend was confirmed by the S&P 500 on Jan. 4. Volume rose on the S&P 500, giving the index its second distribution day, also a stalling session.


Growth Stocks Lag
-----------------


Growth stocks had a hard time finding their footing Wednesday as Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) edged lower by 0.1%. It was weighed down by weak performances from **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and Edwards **Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)). All three ended with losses of more than 3%.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MP_2x1_19.jpg)United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) surged more than 6% [on strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/delta-air-lines-earnings-q4-delta-air-lines-stock-united-airlines-earnings-united-airlines-stock/). The move lifted the airline group to a gain of nearly 2%. The outright leader in the group at this point is **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)). After finding support at the 50-day line, it's working on a cup-shaped base with a 65.45 buy point. Spirit's fundamental picture is just as compelling as its chart. Revenue growth has accelerated for four straight quarters, and the company sports big [annual earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/annual-earnings/). Profit in 2018 is expected to jump 32%, with growth of 45% expected in 2019.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The Nasdaq composite climbed above its 50-day line with conviction Tuesday, rising 1.7% in higher volume. It got turned away at the line in early December, just after the Nasdaq's follow-through day on Nov. 28. Stalling action Wednesday by the index isn't a deal breaker for the nascent rally by any means.


Clearly, the S&P 500's Jan. 4 follow-through is working better than two prior ones flashed by the Nasdaq on Nov. 7 and Nov. 28. But it's always nice to see a healthy crop of base breakouts from top-rated growth stocks, and it's here where growth investors have been left largely disappointed. To be sure, it raises questions about the quality of the rally.


But the stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend until proven otherwise. Institutional selling has been well contained since Jan. 4. The bulls can also feel good about a fair amount of intriguing setups among top-rated growth stocks.


Bullish Setups In Stock Market
------------------------------


In the enterprise software space, **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) continue to show relative strength. Twilio reversed lower Wednesday after touching a new high, but it's too extended. Workday, on the other hand, is working on a cup-shaped base with a 172.77 entry. ServiceNow is in a first-stage consolidation that shows a conventional entry at 206.39. And Salesforce is back near highs in a second-stage consolidation.


Outside of the software sector, **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)) is working on a cup-shaped base with a 74.83 entry. Health care provider **LHC Group** ([LHCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHCG)) is in a similar pattern with a 107.61 buy point. And [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com). **Attunity** ([ATTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATTU)) is closing in quickly on a 23.95 buy point, but it's a thin stock with an average daily dollar volume of just over $10.5 million. The stock was featured in Wednesday's [Stock Spotlight](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/leading-stocks-big-data-firm-attunity/) column.


Watch for more high-profile earnings reports Thursday, Results from **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) are due before the open. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) report after the close.

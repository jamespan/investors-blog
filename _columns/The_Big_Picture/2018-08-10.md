U.S. stock indexes outperformed Friday but in a way that hurt. American investors found consolation only by pointing to bigger losses on exchanges outside the U.S.




The iShares All Country World Index ([ACWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACWI)) slid 1.2%. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each lost 0.7%. The 30-component Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.8%.


Small caps held up best. The S&P 600 dipped 0.15%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

The catalyst was Turkey, a nation with a GDP roughly the size of Illinois'.


[Financial troubles have weighed on Turkey this year](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/dollar-hits-high-trump-fed-hurt-turkey-emerging-markets/). As the CIA World Factbook notes, economic dynamism has given way to "populist spending measures" and the use of "regulators to target political opponents."


If that sounds like a bad way to run an economy, then consider how much worse those who have loaned money to Turkey are feeling right now.


According to the Bank for International Settlements, Turkish borrowers owe banks $83 billion in Spain; $38 billion in France; $19 billion in the United Kingdom; $18 billion in the U.S.; $17 billion in Italy; and $14 billion in Japan.


These numbers might sound big, but in the context of international banking they are not so big.


At least, the U.S. stock market seems to think so.


In the big money-center group, **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) lost 2.4%; **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), 1%; **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), 0.7%; and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), 1.3%. Yet, volume was only moderately above average for Citigroup and was below average for the other three.


On a more optimistic note, advertising platform operator **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) rocketed 37%.


Online homemade goods marketer **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) rose 5%.


Former leaders **Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)) and **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)), both from the 3D printer group, popped 3.5% and 9.5% respectively.


A Bullish Signal?
-----------------


The put/call volume ratio closed at 1.11 Friday, the highest close since a 1.19 reading on April 2. The Nasdaq bottomed that day and then rose about 15% to its July 25 peak. However, the April 2 reading was the most recent of several prior to that. From March 22 to April 2, the put/call ratio closed above 1.15 four times. High readings of about 1.15 or higher often occur around short-term lows.


Earnings season will continue in the coming week. Companies reporting include **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)).

  Nasdaq Again Climbs As Stock Market Shows This Remarkable Trait

The stock market was slow to get going Monday, but picked up the pace and extended an advance that shows little if any fear among investors.




The S&P 500 climbed 0.4% and topped last week's highs. That continued a pattern of higher highs and higher lows dating back to the April 2 low. In fact, Monday's close was the highest since Jan. 29. That leaves the index only a fraction away from regaining its prior high at 2872.


The Nasdaq climbed 0.6%, extending its win streak to five days. The Dow Jones industrial average's 0.2% gain was smaller, and the Dow took a while longer to wipe away early losses than the other two indexes.


The Russell 2000 rose 0.7%. The small-cap benchmark closed above the 50-day moving average, winning its battle with the 50-day line at least for one day.

Monday's trading started dull, with modest losses across the board. It seemed the market was hung over from a huge week of earnings reports. But by lunchtime, buyers started to grow more confident. Indexes kept advancing and closed near session highs.


Still, market leadership was muted, with no sectors standing out much more than others. Semiconductors, consumer discretionary, technology and financial stocks increased more than 0.5%, based on the performance of SPDR sector ETFs.


With most of the biggest earnings reports out of the way, the market finds itself near new highs and in amenable shape. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have good Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of B-. Distribution days are nowhere near totals that should cause worry.


The NYSE advance-decline line has been flat for about a month but is near highs. The Nasdaq's A-D line is drifting downward, however. A divergence like that may signal a pullback in the index. But there have been similar divergences in the past that haven't necessarily resulted in market declines. After a divergence in October to mid-September and another in February to mid-March, the Nasdaq continued higher.

One remarkable aspect of today's market is how little fear it's showing, despite earnings reports, tariff squabbles and an expanding probe into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.


The put-call volume ratio is dwelling below 1.0, and hasn't reached an elevated level since it hit 1.19 on April 2. The [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), better known as the Vix, displays similar calm. It is near three month lows. Even during the tech sell-off of July 26-30 the Vix rose only modestly and the put-call ratio got only to 0.94.


When fear indicators get too low, it suggests the market is getting complacent and may be topping. Yet, that's not evident in the numbers. The put-call ratio needs to fall to 0.5 or 0.6 to start signaling a potential top.


If investors had something to gripe about it was the relatively small number of breakouts.


**Softbank** ([SFTBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFTBY)) and **Shutterstock** ([SSTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSTK)) made solid price and volume moves as they topped buy points. **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) broke out of a cup with handle base. Volume was only 7% more than average, although megacaps sometimes make successful breakouts in unimpressive volume. PepsiCo announced that [longtime CEO Indra Nooyi is stepping down,](https://www.investors.com/news/pepsi-ceo-indra-nooyi-steps-down-female-ceo/) and is being replaced with company President Ramon Laguarta.

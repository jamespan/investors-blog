  Stock Market Ends Win Streak; How Retail Did On Black Friday

After three straight days of record highs, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq took a holiday on the day after Thanksgiving, but did nothing to derail a solid uptrend for the stock market.




Yes, indexes closed practically at session lows, and selling was broad as a four-day win streak ended. Declining stocks led advancers by a 2-1 ratio on the NYSE and by about 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq. But the major indexes remained in upward-tilting price trends.


With the stock market closing early at 1 p.m. ET, volume naturally was lower. Volume was higher compared with 1 p.m. on Wednesday. If the trend had held up through a normal session, it would have amounted to a day of heavy institutional selling, or [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The S&P 500 and [Dow Jones Industrial Average](http://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis)Â each lost 0.4% while the Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.5%. That shaved a tiny bit of what was a productive November for the stock market.


The S&P 500 added 3.4% for the month, the Nasdaq tacked on 4.6%, and the Dow gained 3.7%. For all three, it was the best month since June. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have now improved their performance for three months in a row.


Looking to December, historically it has been a good month for the market. Since 1950, December has been the S&P 500's best month, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. For the Nasdaq it is the second-best month.


Stock Market Rising Calmly
--------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP120219-248x300.jpg)Indeed, this stock market continues to steam higher, with hardly a hiccup. The main indexes have not seen a loss greater than 1% since Oct. 8.


The uptrend that started with the Oct. 3 low has been characterized by low volatility, which reflects a confident market.


The average percentage change in the S&P 500 index so far this year is 0.59%, well below the 30-year average of 0.74%, David Kelly, JPMorgan Funds' chief global strategist, noted in a report last Monday. "In short, for a plain vanilla portfolio this year, all is calm and all is bright."


Only a few [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remain, so there's not much standing in the way of the market's continued advance. Of course, investors are smart to be on guard for a normal pullback after such heady gains.


On Black Friday, the retail sector was weaker than the main indexes. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) fell 0.8%. The market in general was broadly lower. All 11 S&P sectors declined.



U.S. [online retail sales were expected to surge 21%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/black-friday-online-sales-expected-to-jump-21-percent/) from last year's Black Friday. Shares of major chains such as **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) (an [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) member) were little changed.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 0.5%. The wild-trading **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) made the biggest move on the list again, down 8.5%. But the stock finished up 20% for the week.

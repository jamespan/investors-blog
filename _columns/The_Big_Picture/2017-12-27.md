It was another good day for the bulls Wednesday as major stock indexes didn't stray far from recent highs, ending with gains of 0.1% or less in light trade.


Weaker-than-expected readings on consumer confidence and November pending home sales did little to stir negative sentiment.




 Overall, the stock market is on solid ground as 2017 winds down. The Nasdaq composite has lost ground in four of the past six sessions, but over that time, it's only down 0.8%. The Nasdaq briefly crossed the 7000 level last week, but it's been trading below the round number ever since. Still, the index's price action has been constructive as [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) have dropped off the Nasdaq's count. For the bulls, going into 2018 with a light distribution-day count is just what the doctor ordered.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average has been trading in tight, sideways fashion just below the 25,000 level, while the S&P 500 has been biding time just below the 2700 level.

Oil and gas names lagged after some nice outperformance lately, but many high-quality names are making a case for a leadership in 2018. [Leaderboard](https://wwww.investors.com/leaderboard) member **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) snapped a six-session win streak, falling 2% to 123.19. It's still holding comfortably above a 115.03 entry. Group peer **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)), meanwhile, is holding just above a 108.05 flat-base entry. Shares eased 1% to 108.36.


Select retail names have also seen inflows. Inside the IBD 50, **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) broke out powerfully from a cup-with-handle base with a 46.34 buy point. Shares jumped 8% to 48.97. The 5% buy zone went up to 48.66. Outside of the IBD 50, **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) is crafting a flat base with a 100.23 buy point.


Meanwhile, it looks like a good first test of support so far for IBD 50 name **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)). But after a heavy-volume pullback to the 10-week moving average, the stock is rising in light volume. That's one yellow flag. The other is that the stock's latest breakout over a 145.40 buy point was from a riskier late-stage base.


Will semiconductor stocks kick back into gear in 2018? It's possible, but technical damage has been done to some leaders that could take some time to repair. Stocks like **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), among others, haven't recovered much after slicing their 50-day moving average lines in heavy volume in late November.


The so-called FANG names are a mixed bag. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are holding up well after recent breakouts, but it's a slightly different story when it comes to **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Apple has fallen below its 176.34 buy point but is still holding above the 50-day moving average. Big sellers were in the stock Tuesday after analysts raised concerns about flagging iPhone X demand. And buying demand has completely dried up in Netflix as it treads water below the 50-day line.


Financials could have more left in the tank in 2018 after recent breakouts, although the 10-year Treasury yield has been getting some resistance near 2.50%. It fell 6 basis points to 2.41% Wednesday.


Over the next several days, make time to do some post-analysis of your buys and sells in 2017. Which stocks were handled well? Which were handled poorly? As always, learn from past mistakes and try not to repeat them.

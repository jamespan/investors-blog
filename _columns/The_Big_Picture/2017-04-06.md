U.S. stock indexes kept the tone low key Thursday, showing no inclination to add to the previous session's nasty reversal.


The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, while The S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


A few stocks were doing well Thursday despite market nervousness.


Construction and mining equipment maker **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) rose almost 2%. The stock pegged a third daily gain in a row, retaking its 50-day line as it works on a shallow consolidation.


Caterpillar suffered earnings and revenue declines in 2015-16. Analysts expect earnings to decline 8% this year, while revenue dips 1.6%. The turnaround isn't expected until 2018, when earnings are seen jumping 41% on a revenue pop of about 6%.
Building-sector play **Fortune Brands** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)) climbed 2% to clear a 61.77 buy point in a long, cup-with-handle base.


China-based stocks trading on U.S. exchanges were also logging gains. Online retailer **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) stormed 6% higher. Internet-content provider **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) popped 5%. Education stocks **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) and **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) added 3% and 1%, respectively, and hit new highs.

Top-rated groups — such as chip equipment makers, biotechs, computer-related groups and superregional banks — were mostly up but not by much.


Still, the bulls had to be relieved and ready to accept anything short of a sell-off.


On Wednesday, stocks fell hard in the final two hours of trade after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its March meeting. The minutes found the Fed describing stock prices as "quite high relative to standard valuation measures." The Fed also raised the issue of "balance sheet normalization," reaffirming the principles "announced in September 2014."


The Fed's mention of the balance sheet plan (divesting itself of its massive bond holdings) articulated in 2014 was a way of reassuring the market that this was nothing new.


However, whether it was talk of the balance sheet or stock valuations or both, the market didn't like it. The stock indexes reversed off sizable gains intraday Wednesday to finish in the red.


It's always possible that Wednesday's attribution of blame was misplaced. The Nasdaq has been finding consistent resistance around 5930, and the S&P 500 keeps testing its 50-day line.


Data On Job Cuts And Jobless Claims; Payroll Numbers Friday
-----------------------------------------------------------


In economic news Thursday, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported the U.S. job cuts rose 17% in March vs. February but fell 2% from the year-ago level. Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims came in about 6% lower than expected.


Those numbers came on the eve of Friday's employment report, being released before the market's open. The Street expects 175,000 jobs added. The range of estimates runs from 125,000 to 202,000.


What Does History Say About Fed-Inspired Losses?
------------------------------------------------


Bulls might find some comfort from the most famous occasion when the Fed tried to play stock analyst.


On the evening of Dec. 5, 1996, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in a speech in Washington, D.C., wondered aloud, "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values?"


Just asking the question, without offering an answer, was enough to unnerve markets.


Major European markets fell 4% on the news. On Dec. 6, the Nasdaq dropped 3% intraday and then reversed to trim the loss to 1%.


Did the negativity find legs from there? Not really. The Nasdaq showed choppy action for a handful of days, marking an intraday low Dec. 17. The low was about 4% below the Dec. 5 close. From that low, the Nasdaq gained almost 12% over the next six weeks or so.


Bulls would gladly accept such a scenario this time around.

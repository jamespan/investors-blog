  Stocks Reverse Lower, And Why The Nasdaq Is Suddenly In A Precarious Spot

Friday's flaccid action carried over to Monday, when the stock market reversed lower and left the Nasdaq composite in a precarious spot.




The Nasdaq reversed lower on Friday, and repeated that bearish form Monday, only with greater intensity. The composite gave up an early gain of about 1% and spent most of the day dropping. It closed 1.7% lower, marking a fifth consecutive decline.


The S&P 500 also reversed lower and closed near session lows, off 1.6%. Both indexes are now testing their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). In the April-August market rally, that moving average provided consistent support for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. A break of the 21-day line in September was an early sign of that month's woes.


So, watch for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to hold at their 21-day lines. If they fail, the stock market could be in for a rough few weeks, or perhaps longer.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP_2x1_101920-266x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average also is testing the [21-day average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It is still a safe distance above the low of Sept. 30, when it made a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) that caused IBD to change its [stock market outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) to "confirmed uptrend." The Dow fell 1.4% Monday.


A close below the Dow's Sept. 30 low would be a bad sign for the stock market's uptrend. A week ago, the Nasdaq made its own follow-through. But that positive signal is now compromised. The Nasdaq closed sharply below the Oct. 12 low. The optics on the Nasdaq's chart are not so good as they were on Columbus Day.


Distribution For The Nasdaq
---------------------------


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which caused a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the composite. It was the first distribution day for the Nasdaq of the new market uptrend. The S&P 500 still has two, because NYSE volume fell. That's still a minor amount of institutional selling, but the third in the past five sessions. Such clustering can be a bad sign.


Is it time to turn cautious on the stock market?


Keep in mind that the major indexes had climbed three or four weeks in a row, and some consolidation now is nothing abnormal. Last week, the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) fell below 0.6%, an unusually low reading that suggests the market is getting frothy. On Monday, the ratio climbed to 0.65.



[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) fell 1.5% Monday, but its stocks weren't altered much at all by the selling.


A survey of the IBD 50 had little in terms of chart damage. Breakouts for **Virtu Financial** ([VIRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIRT)) and **SciPlay** ([SCPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCPL)) have failed. SciPlay shares slid 5.5% Monday. **Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)) remains wounded.


But aside from that, IBD 50 charts reflect strength. About half the 50 stocks are well on their way with new bases, and about 10 are above the latest buy points.


The market's pause has given some bases a chance to [form a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/). **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and perhaps **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) now show such shakeouts.


Multiple Risks For Stock Market
-------------------------------


The stock market faces multiple risks, such as coronavirus spikes, next month's election and stimulus talks. (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for a pre-election stimulus deal.) For now, third-quarter earnings are on the immediate horizon. More than 400 companies report this week, and about 1,000 next week.


Companies appear to be beating lowered expectations, with analysts forecasting the second-largest drop in S&P 500 earnings since Q2 of 2009.


So far, about 10% of the S&P 500 companies have reported Q3 results, and 86% have topped the consensus estimate, according to FactSet. That's trending above the five-year average of 73%. Notably, earnings are 21.7% above estimates, way above the five-year average of 5.6%.


On the revenue side, 82% of S&P 500 companies have topped sales estimates, beating the five-year average of 61%. S&P 500 revenue is trending 3.6% above estimates, which is also above the five-year average of 0.7%.

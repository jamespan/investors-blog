A mixed finish for [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/)? Well, that could be the understatement of the month.




For days, large caps and techs teased IBD readers with this thought: Even if the economy is going to reopen, the big winners of last year are not going to act shy this year. All five [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) are not only trading above their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/); they're also leading their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) upward.


The Nasdaq composite, bastion of most internet, chip, software and social media giants from America, on Tuesday had just marked its highest close since Feb. 16. The market cap-weighted index went into Wednesday's session up nearly 5.7% for the month.


So, the Nasdaq's shyness around 14,000 seems understandable. Wednesday's 1% decline to 13,857 takes back roughly a third of last week's 3% advance.


![MP041421_3](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP041421_3-218x300.jpg)Meanwhile, cyclical, commodity and value stocks today regained the limelight, if for a day. Strong results from Wall Street's biggest firms helped attract money back into banks of all sizes. A 4.4% jump in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices boosted energy stocks.


Stocks Today: Financials Thriving
---------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average mustered less than a 0.2% advance. The NYSE composite edged up slightly more than 0.2% and marked a new all-time high of 16,076. Superregional banks and smaller banks from the Midwest, Northeast and South all rallied 1% or more. You'll probably see scads of small lenders hit IBD's daily new highs lists on Wednesday, as in weeks past. (Go to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) for the full updated list.)


SPDR S&P Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) exchange traded fund gained 1.1%.


Midcap stocks also outperformed the Dow industrials. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) rallied nearly 0.6% and hit new highs.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF rose 1%, good enough to close back above its 50-day line.


The S&P 500 surrendered the prior day's 0.3% advance, falling 0.4%.Â Early data indicated a moderate rise in NYSE volume vs. Tuesday. This means the S&P 500 has a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on its books. But the low count reflects the strength of this confirmed market uptrend lately. (On Friday, the 500 rallied sharply enough to render distribution days noted on March 18 and March 23 as irrelevant.)


Nasdaq volume edged nearly 2% lower.


[IBD Live show panelists on Wednesday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) addressed this frequent, capricious shift in market leadership, which now appears to change on a daily basis. Yet for now, the market continues to trend higher. The breadth of leadership is still broad. And heading into the thick of first-quarter corporate results, the active investor should find no shortage of CAN SLIM-quality companies carving [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/) that could set up new [strong breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


How 'Dr. Doom' Sees Interest Rates And The Stock Market
-------------------------------------------------------


Henry Kaufman, author of the newly published book "The Day The Markets Roared: How A 1982 Forecast Sparked A Global Bull Market," sees the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 30-year bond rising from Tuesday's close at 2.32% to a range of 2.75% to 3% by year's end.


"It's not a reflection of monetary policy. It's a reflection of the economy getting back to normal," Kaufman told IBD. He also thinks the Federal Reserve faces a "very difficult" task in trying to achieve an average inflation rate of 2%. Why? For starters, there will be overshoots in price increases well past 2%. When that happens, will the Fed be able to adhere to a strict discipline of responding to the change? Kaufman suggests the target inflation rate may become "malleable."


"In terms of its capacity to control inflation, it has a checkered performance," Kaufman said. "The Fed lately has more willingness in its monetary policy to accept a higher rate of inflation. But the problem is it is not willing to cope with anticipating inflationary expectations."


The 1980s: Golden Age Of Bond Dealing?
--------------------------------------


Kaufman served as chief economist at Salomon Brothers. The bank, featured in books such as "Liar's Poker," was one of Wall Street's most powerful institutions, particularly in the fixed income markets, in the 1970s and 1980s. Kaufman's book not only details how he came to the conclusion back in August of 1982 that the cost of borrowing money was going down as then-Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker worked to break the back of inflation. It also offers an inside look at what it's really like to be a professional forecaster on Wall Street.


"Forecasting is something that people cannot do on the sly. It requires a high focus of attention," Kaufman said.


To do well in stocks, you need the same type of daily attention on the price-and-volume action of the stock market and its [current leadership](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


Cboe data showed the U.S. Treasury 10-year note's yield rose 2 basis points on Wednesday to 1.64%.

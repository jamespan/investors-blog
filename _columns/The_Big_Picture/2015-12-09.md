Breakouts Still Struggle As Markets Log New Distribution Day
=============================================================

Four trading sessions after IBD's market outlook got a downgrade to "uptrend under pressure," stocks succumbed to yet another heavy sell-off Wednesday.


The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.5%, nearly matching its 1.7% sell-off on Dec. 3 as it sank for a third straight session.


Volume rose 6%, saddling the leading index with a ninth distribution day in the past 25 sessions.


The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. NYSE turnover grew mildly to boost the large-cap index's distribution count to eight.


Homebuilding, biotech, game software and some media and telecom groups commanded the downside with losses of 2% or more. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), one of the best-performing megacap names in recent years, slipped under its 50-day moving average. Regional lender **Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) briefly tested its 50-day line.


With such clear evidence of intense professional selling blanketing the market, the message is clear: Investors are better off being largely in cash and avoiding making new buys until the market's strength returns.

So investors who benefit from big profit cushions in their stocks may choose either to hold through a stock's mild correction or to take profits if institutional buying support disappears at the crucial 10-week moving average.


As for recent new buys, however, breakouts are simply not getting upward traction. As the S&P 500 chart on Page B2 shows, the NYSE advance-decline line is slumping. The new high list (on B5) remained puny in size.


While the media focus this week has been on weakness in crude oil prices, that story line really hasn't changed this year. Commodity-linked stocks have been a sore spot for the market. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB commodity index (see Page B12 in today's paper) finished the day at 177.56, down 23% since Jan. 1.


In some ways, the market's technical trend is murky. The Nasdaq composite remains above both key support lines, the 50-day moving average and the longer-term 200-day. And this week, the 50-day has crossed back above the slower-moving 200-day line.


That's generally a bullish sign. It means that the index's near-term gains have accelerated.


At 5022.87, the Nasdaq lies 4% below its all-time high at 5231. Not quite yet what you would define as a full-blown correction. But further sell-offs in heavy volume would darken the view.

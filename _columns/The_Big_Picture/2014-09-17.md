The stock market rose, then gave back most of the day's gains Wednesday even after the Federal Reserve made it clear that it's still in no hurry to raise the cost of money.


For now, the market's uptrend stayed intact. Most leading stocks did well, but the price gains were mostly accompanied with dull volume. Such action can be expected in an environment in which the market uptrend is under pressure.


The IBD 50 advanced 0.4%.


The Nasdaq edged 0.2% higher, recouping more of Friday's and Monday's steep losses. During that decline, the composite fell more than 1.5%.


The S&P 500 rose 0.1% and finished in the lower half of the day's range. NYSE volume was slightly higher, giving the large-cap index a stalling session. The 500 was up as much as 0.6% intraday, and came within a hair of painting a new record high.


Wednesday's stalling day does not go into the distribution day count. IBD's rules say there must first be a greater number of true distribution days than stalling days for the second stalling session to count.


The first stall day came on Aug. 26, when the index rose 0.1%. The index notched a pair of distribution days on Sept. 9 and 12.


The U.S. central bank, following a two-day meeting, further reduced its purchases of bonds and mortgages to $15 billion a month. At the start of the so-called QE 3 easing program two years ago, the Fed was buying $85 billion worth of mortgages and Treasury securities. Yet the Fed does not feel the labor market and inflation have reached the point where it can tell the market when it will begin raising the rate on overnight loans to banks. Higher rates generally cool activity.


On Wednesday, the government reported a 0.2% month-to-month decline in consumer prices in August; economists expected no change. The 1.7% year-over-year increase was below the Fed's 2% inflation target.


Not all stocks showed stalling action. Big gains in air freight, trucking and railroad stocks boosted the Dow transports to a 1% gain. As seen in IBD's stock research tables (which start on this page), the transportation sector is ranked No. 1 among 33 broad sectors.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 0.7%. Banks rallied. Steel stocks also had a strong day, with both **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X))noting that the steel markets have stabilized. The former noted fewer plant outages. U.S. Steel cleared a 28.90 double-bottom entry on July 30.

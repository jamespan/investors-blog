Stocks Pare Losses; Bases Form In IBD 50's Most Interesting Sector

Will the stock market ever find its way?


The major indexes Tuesday continued a pattern of minor price movements, providing only some crumbs of guidance for investors trying to figure out its next move.


The Nasdaq composite cut a 0.5% loss to 0.1% on a mix of telecom, software and chip outperformance. Its volume rose. The Russell 2000 was more impressive, erasing all losses to end with a fractional gain.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP_6x5_041817-193x300.png)The S&P 500 trimmed a 0.6% early loss in half. Higher NYSE volume gave the S&P a new [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), despite its best efforts. The indexes have piled up a fair number of distribution days even as they've flattened.


The message to investors: Keep exposure reduced. But the fact stocks are holding steady despite tensions in the Korean Peninsula and earnings season now in its core leaves room for optimism.


The Dow Jones industrial average came out worse for the wear, down 0.6%. Two of its components suffered sizable losses after disappointing quarterly reports. **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) gapped below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume after the company missed Q1 sales expectations. J&J, which makes everything from Band-Aids to surgical equipment, cited pricing pressures.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) missed first-quarter sales and profit expectations, sending shares down nearly 5%. It was the latest blow to a financial sector that has been staggering since March.


Until the market makes a turn in a clear direction, investors are left grasping for indications. Signals from the indexes' 50-day moving averages are mixed and not much help. Perhaps the best indicator for the market may be the stocks in your own portfolio.


The Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 are holding above those lines. But the S&P 500 and Dow have spent a few days below their lines. The Russell 2000 has spent the better part of the past six weeks below its 50-day average, and that could be the market's soft underbelly. Small caps act as a more dynamic engine for the market because so much of the growth economy is represented in that index. The median IBD 50 company has a market cap of $4.7 billion, basically a midcap.


Last week, the [CBOE market volatility index](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) made a signal that in the past has sent the market higher, when it climbed more than 20% above its 10-day moving average. But in a trendless market, the signal went for naught.


Perhaps the best market indicator right now is indeed the leading stocks, and that's inconclusive as well. The IBD 50 is basically at the same spot it was two months ago.


More than a dozen IBD 50 stocks are forming bases, and most of those are in the technology sector. **Zebra Tech** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)), **Macom Technology** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)), **Microchip Tech** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) and **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) could break out in due time.


While a handful of leading breakouts have panned out (**Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) for instance), there's no great safety in breakouts. **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)), **InterDigital** ([IDCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDCC)) and **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)) are examples of stocks below their buy points.


If the market is not quite telling a dramatic story, some yarns can be found by studying the [Stocks On The Move](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=up). One is that industrial and health care stocks are limping. **Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)) plummeted 11.5% on [news of an acquisition](https://www.investors.com/news/cardinal-health-plunges-on-this-big-deal-with-medtronic/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo) and a weak outlook. **W.W. Grainger** ([GWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWW)) slid 11% on [weak results and forecasts](https://www.investors.com/news/grainger-miss-outlook-cut-sends-shares-hurtling-as-industrials-waver/).


Cardinal had formed a long saucer with handle, but failed to break out with force. Grainger had shown bearish signs as early as March 9, when the stock dropped 2.5% and undercut its 50-day moving average. Grainger failed to rebound back above the critical support line.


U.S. stocks opened lower Tuesday after a sell-off in Europe spilled over to Wall Street. In London, the FTSE 100 plunged 2.5%, the CAC 40 in France 1.6% and the German DAX index lost 0.9%. The selling came after British Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap election for June 8 in a bid to solidify public support ahead of talks to exit the European Union.


Vanguard FTSE Europe ([VGK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VGK)) and iShares MSCI Eurozone ([EZU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EZU)), two of the most widely held Europe ETFs, fell 0.5% but pared losses during U.S. trading hours.


Housing starts in March fell 6.8% to a 1.22 million annualized rate, worse than expected. Yet homebuilding stocks were unshakable. The industry group closed 0.5% higher and is one that investors can harvest for new opportunities â€” provided the market can make up its mind, of course.

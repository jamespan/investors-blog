Stock Market Sell-Off Routs Top Tech Stocks; Tech Giants AMD, Apple, Nvidia, Tesla Plunge
==========================================================================================

The stock market sold off sharply Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged as much as 1,026 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite crumbled as much as 5.8% before paring losses. Tech giants AMD, Apple, Nvidia and Tesla crumbled, part of a broad sell-off in growth stocks.




The Nasdaq ended 5% lower, easily lagging behind the other major stock indexes. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 3%. The S&P 500 fell 3.5%, while the Dow Jones industrials traded down 2.8%, or 807 points, weighed down by an 8% plunge in shares of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Apple stock's two-day loss is 9.9% and it is already 12% off Wednesday's all-time high.


Leading growth stocks underperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) declined 5.4%. In the IBD 50, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) was one of the worst performers, down 8.5%. Elsewhere, **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) lost 9% and 7%, respectively.

Nasdaq, S&P 500 Add Distribution Day
------------------------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both fell sharply Thursday in higher volume, adding a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to their counts. The Nasdaq now has two, while the S&P 500's count rose to three. Those are still low distribution numbers, but the market's character has changed.


The Nasdaq's 5% decline was its biggest fall since June 11, when the composite tumbled 5.3%. In the aftermath of that session, the Nasdaq went on an unlikely eight-session win streak to hit an all-time high. Few investors could have guessed that would transpire, underscoring the importance of methodically raising and lowering exposure instead of plunging in and out of the market at the first sign of a shift.


Still, the market is now weaker, and investors should be taking some profits and cutting losses short. Another way to mitigate risk is to reduce or move off margin. The [use of margin](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-margin-trading/) can substantially multiply returns, but losses can accelerate quickly.


[Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-surges-nasdaq-hits-new-high-semiconductor-stocks-lead/) warned that Investors Intelligence's latest weekly sentiment survey of stock market newsletter writers showed that the bulls rose to 61.5%. It was the highest reading this year and the most bulls since September 2018, just before a sharp market pullback occurred. It's a contrarian indicator because sentiment tends to be very bullish near market tops and very bearish near market bottoms.


The [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks are a solid gauge of how stock market leaders perform on a daily basis. On Thursday, not one of the 18 remaining members traded higher, reflecting broad selling, while two other Leaders were removed due to weak action. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) sold off 9.3 and 9%, respectively, but stayed on the list.

Stocks To Watch: Amazon, Netflix
--------------------------------


Despite Thursday's stock market sell-off, **Amazon.com** ([AMNZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMNZ)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are still in or near buy zones.


Amazon.com briefly fell below its 3,344.39 buy point in a flat base amid Thursday's 4.6% drop. Still, investors should wait to see strength before any potential purchases.


Netflix is shaping a cup base with a 575.47 buy point, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares fell 5% in above-average volume Thursday and remained in the base.


A new handle could be forming, which would offer a 557.49 buy point. For now, there are only two days in the handle, which requires a minimum of five sessions. With one day left in the trading week, the stock is set to close slightly higher for the week. If the stock closes down for the week, then that would also qualify as a handle.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Amazon stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) and [Netflix stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netflix-inc-nflx.aspx) show best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Both stocks are IBD Leaderboard members.

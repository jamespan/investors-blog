The stock market kicked off the week with a quiet, yet constructive session Monday after bullish gains Friday. IBD's market outlook went back to confirmed uptrend Friday, helped by an all-time closing high for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)).




The stock market — and the bond market — shrugged off comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen over the weekend that Federal Reserve rate hikes would be a "plus." After slumping more than 6 basis points Friday to 1.56%, the 10-year Treasury yield inched up 1 basis point to 1.57%.


The Fed's next meeting is June 15-16. The Fed has made it abundantly clear it's in no hurry to raise interest rates, but it could start to taper its monthly bond-buying program before the end of the year.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Small caps led the way Monday, with the Russell 2000 up 1.4%. The small-cap index is home to several meme stocks like **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)), **Express** ([EXPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPR)) and **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)), which soared again Monday.

**U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) was another top gainer in the Russell 2000, up 29%, after **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) agreed to buy the company for $1.29 billion, or $74 a share.


**CareDx** ([CDNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNA)) also outperformed in the Russell 2000, up 8%. The medical products firm broke out over a handle buy point of 83.68. CareDx was one of several strong movers in the IBD 50, helping fuel the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) to a gain of 1.9%. Other top gainers included **PLBY** ([PLBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLBY)), **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)), **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) and **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)).


InMode joined the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) watchlist Friday, when it was forming a narrow [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) base. It topped the 87.10 buy point early Monday, but a 10% intraday gain faded to 5% by the close.


Nasdaq Outperforms
------------------


The Nasdaq composite added 0.5% after soaring 1.5% Friday. Some beaten-down names in the Nasdaq 100 were among the best performers Monday, including **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)), **Match** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) and **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)).


Advancing stocks topped decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 2-to-1.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.4%, weighed down by a decline of nearly 2% for **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)). A May breakout over a 237.88 buy point didn't get far. Now, Caterpillar stock could be poised for a test of its 50-day moving average, which is just below the stock's latest buy point.


The S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, with winners having a slight edge over losers. Nasdaq volume rose, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Friday's totals.


Sellers were in mining stocks and steel stocks Monday. Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)), **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)), **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) and **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) ended with losses of 2% or more.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


Friday's gains in the major stock indexes came in lower volume, but the bulls have plenty of reasons to feel good about the confirmed uptrend. The [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) count is still a bit elevated on the S&P, with six higher-volume declines since May 4. But unequivocal signs of institutional selling — big percentage declines in higher volume — have been few as the index continues to hold near highs.


The Nasdaq composite shows four higher-volume declines since May 4. Three of those declines showed losses ranging from 1% to 2.5%, but the index continues to hold above its 50-day moving average.

And IBD growth screens continue to deliver compelling setups, whether it's stocks forming [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), stocks trading tightly near highs after a breakout or stocks finding support at their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) for the first time after a breakout.

Market Movers
-------------


Health care was one of the top performing sectors Monday, with the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) up 0.4%. Top-10 holding **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) scored a huge breakout, rising 10% to 222.52. Shares were strong after **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) received Food & Drug Administration approval for its Alzheimer's candidate aducanumab. Biogen stock soared 38% on the news. In March, Eli Lilly released favorable data for its experimental Alzheimer's treatment donanemab.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) followed through after the stock broke out of a downtrend Friday on strong earnings. DocuSign shares rose another 3% Monday, topping its April 28 high.

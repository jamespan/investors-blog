The stock market ended the week on firm footing as major stock indexes gapped up at the open and closed with bullish gains in lower volume.




A strong earnings report from [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) helped fuel a 2.1% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock reclaimed a 518.80 buy point with conviction, rising 5% to 529.75. The managed care group was one of the day's top performers, rising nearly 4%. **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) also moved well in the group, up 4.5%.


Meanwhile, [bullish Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/wells-fargo-stock-earnings-miss-pnc-citi/) from **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) sparked strong gains for Dow financial stocks like **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)). But all three stocks remain in downtrends. Citigroup gapped above its 50-day moving average and broke out of a downtrend.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Stronger-than-expected retail sales in June fueled positive sentiment in the stock market. But Wall Street also got more good news when some inflation components of the Empire State manufacturing index and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey eased inflation concerns.

The latter two reports lessened the chances of a 100-basis-point hike at the Federal Reserve meeting on July 26-27. The market is fully expecting a 75-basis-point hike, but the chances of a 100-basis-point increase have dropped to 31%, down from around 80% Thursday morning.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP071522-273x300.jpg)Investors bought bonds Friday, sending the [10-year Treasury yield](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/inverted-yield-curve/) lower by 3 basis points to 2.93%. A price chart of the 10-year yield (0TNX in [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)) shows recent resistance at the 50-day line. Meanwhile, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ([TLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLT)) has moved nicely off lows and continues to hold above its 50-day line. The ETF added 0.6%.


The Nasdaq composite rose 1.8% and looks ready for another rendezvous with its 50-day moving average. Stock market bulls want to see the index back above this key level. If it can do that, a tradable rally could gain even more traction.

The S&P 500 jumped 1.9%, also helped by broad-based strength in financial stocks. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) was the top performing S&P sector ETF, up 3.4%. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by nearly 5-to-1.


Individual stock action has been improving in recent days. That's a good thing, but when it comes to new buys, think risk management and keep positions small to start. Don't raise exposure too quickly, especially amid plenty of uncertainty and not much in the way of setups.



Money continued to flow into health care stocks. **Option Care Health** ([OPCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPCH)) closed strongly after breaking out past a cup base with a 31.18 buy point. Shares jumped nearly 8% in strong volume. Q2 results are due July 27 before the open.

The S&P 500 broke a seven-day win streak after broad selling hit the stock market Tuesday, although indexes rebounded and showed they are not ready to roll over from record highs. Leading stocks were mostly solid.




The S&P 500 ended 0.2% lower but was down as much as 0.9%. The recovery from the low indicated that institutional investors are not so eager to take profits. By a single point, the S&P 500 reached a ninth consecutive record high.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% but held above its 50-day moving average. Only six of the 30 components rose, including **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Its 1.5% gain came in the highest volume since June 18, 30% above average. The stock is in buy range from a 137.17 buy point that initially saw light trading.


The Nasdaq composite erased losses and closed 0.2% higher, thanks to strength in the technology sector. The Nasdaq made a record closing high and is working on a modest three-day win streak.


![MP070621_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP070621_2-186x300.jpg)Software stocks shouldered much of the tech sector's outperformance as iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) climbed 1.1% to a new high.


Software Leading Stock Market Again
-----------------------------------


Since May, the software sector has moved toward reclaiming a leadership role in the stock market. IBD's software sector was lagging, [up only about 4% this year](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jul-02-2021/). But now, there's new strength in it. The specialty enterprise software industry group has climbed to No. 89 out of 197 groups, from 168 six weeks ago.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), one of the stock market's flagship techs, broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and closed above the 3,524.96 buy point. Volume was nearly double its average. The Pentagon [canceled its disputed JEDI cloud-computing contract,](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-news-pentagon-cancels-jedi-contract/) which had been awarded to **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Amazon challenged the $10 billion contract. Microsoft shares were nearly flat.


Amazon's breakout, which follows Apple's last week, should be taken as a positive sign for growth investors. Also on Tuesday, **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base, clearing a 224.04 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in active trading.


Declining stocks led advancers by roughly a 2-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and NYSE. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE after quiet trading Friday, ahead of the three-day July 4 weekend. The increase in volume resulted in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500. But the index's positive reversal suggests this is one of those distribution days by name only, rather than a true example of institutional-size selling.


Distribution On S&P But Total Still Light
-----------------------------------------



Indexes have worked off distribution, something that should give investors motivation to remain with heavy exposure or to even increase it. It's been difficult to find sustained gains after months of sector rotation. That's put stock picking at a premium. But profitable trades have been possible. One important strategy is take profits once they climb to 20%, and certainly sell before sizeable gains diminish.


Financial and cyclical sectors fell as commodity and bond markets were active.


The energy sector was Tuesday's worst performing, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) down nearly 3.3% and closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time since April 30. The price of U.S. crude fell about 2% to $73.70 a barrel.


Major oil producing countries failed to reach an agreement on raising output after the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia clashed over quotas. The [dispute threatens the overall OPEC+ pact to curb output](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-opec-meeting-production-quotas-july-2021/), and could loosen limits on production.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped 6 basis points to 1.37%, a drop that surprised traders. The yield is now at the lowest point since February, extending a decline from a late-March peak.


Financials, Chinese Stocks Hurt Stock Market
--------------------------------------------


Financials, which are sensitive to yields, came down broadly. SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) and SPDR S&P Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) fell nearly 3%.


The iShares China Large-Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) tumbled 2.8% to a May 17 low as a crackdown in China hit most U.S.-traded Chinese stocks. Chinese authorities are [tightening rules for companies listed abroad](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-revise-rules-and-strengthen-supervision-of-overseas-listings-11625572533?mod=hp_lead_pos1) or those that try to sell shares in other countries.

The IBD 50 rose 0.7% on a good mix of rising tech, financial, health care and consumer stocks. But foreign financials **UP Fintech** ([TIGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIGR)) and **dLocal** ([DLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLO)) sold off sharply.


Small caps saw little bounce as the Russell 2000 lost 1.4%.

Stocks stumbled early on, but battled back to end little changed Monday.

  

The Nasdaq slipped 0.1% after having been down as much as 0.8% intraday. It marked the sixth close near its intraday highs in the past seven sessions. The S&P 500 ended up a fraction after falling as much as 0.6%. It has climbed in four of the past five sessions.

  

Small-cap stocks also finished off their session lows, but the Russell 2000 lost 0.5%. Small caps have had a rough going since the start of the month: The Russell 2000 has slumped 4.5%, while the S&P 500 has gained nearly 1%.

  

The IBD 50 fell 0.4% for its second straight loss. But only four components lost 2% or more in above-average trade.

  

Stocks were down in Monday's early going despite merger news and mixed economic data.

  

Deep discount retailer **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) agreed to buy **Family Dollar Stores** ([FDO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDO)) in $8.5 billion cash and stock deal.

  

Real estate information provider **Zillow** ([Z](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Z)) announced that it was buying rival **Trulia** ([TRLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRLA)) for $3.5 billion in stock.

  

On the economic front, the July flash service-sector PMI from Markit dipped less than expected and remained above the 50 level, which signals expansion. But pending home sales unexpectedly fell in June.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges from Friday's light pace. But breadth was negative on the session. Losers beat winners 9-to-7 on the NYSE and by a little more than 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.

  

Even though not all of the major averages finished in the plus column, Monday was still positive amid an environment with a high number of distribution days.

  

The market has shown resilience in recent weeks. On July 17, stocks sold off, but three days later, the S&P 500 was already at a new high. And last week, big buyers came to support what were initially iffy breakouts in **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). Chipotle scored a new high Monday, while Under Armour nabbed a record closing high.

  

Earnings reports have been the catalyst behind the resurgence in a number of big-cap leaders. But quarterly reports have not been kind to some big caps such as **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).

  

Earnings do matter for growth stocks.

  

Several more earnings reports are due Tuesday, with notables such as **Trinity Industries** ([TRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRN)), **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) and **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) due to report.

  

Tuesday also marks the start of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting. The central bank's policy statement will be out Wednesday.

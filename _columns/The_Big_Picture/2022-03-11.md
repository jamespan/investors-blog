The stock market ended a painful week on a sour note as indexes fell after President Joe Biden intensified pressure on Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Stocks endured a bearish reversal that further dampened investor enthusiasm.




An enthusiastic open soon petered out on the Nasdaq. It was the day's worst index as it fell 2.2%. It is continuing to fall away from its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The S&P 500 gave up 1.3%. It has now been on a downtrend that stretches back to early January.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared relatively better as it fell 0.7%. But this was a fifth straight week of losses for the blue chip index.


The S&P [sectors all closed lower,](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) with technology and communication services the worst performers.


Small caps swooned, with the Russell 2000 giving up 1.6%. Growth stocks also flagged. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.5%.


Volume for the session was mixed. The heaviest selling was on the Nasdaq, where volume rose, while selling was slightly on the New York Stock Exchange compared to the previous day.


One crumb of comfort is the fact volatility seems to be easing. The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, was up only 2.5%. Monthly options are also set to expire the coming week, which could serve as an inflection point.


Biden Takes Aim At Putin
------------------------


Headline risk remains severe at the moment, and this was amply demonstrated Friday. An early bounce after Russian President Vladimir Putin touted "certain positive shifts" in talks with Ukraine soon gave way to bearish action after more sanctions were unleashed.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP-031122.jpg)Biden announced that the powerful G7 nations are moving to revoke Russia's "most-favored nation" trading status. This frees the West to levy higher tariffs on Russian goods. The U.S. is also banning imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds. The U.S. had already banned the import of Russian oil.


However, Biden again resisted calls for a direct U.S. intervention in the conflict, saying a "confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III."


But it is always darkest before the dawn. While it is not yet clear when indexes will find their footing, now is an ideal time to be building a robust watchlist.


"Long-term investors should be bargain-hunting now, but be careful with anything that touches China," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya told IBD. "Even when the Ukraine crisis finds some calm, U.S.-China relationships will remain complicated." IBD advises to stay in cash until a rally confirmation occurs.


He said it has been tough for investors to buy the dips as growing uncertainty of when inflation will peak is "complicating Fed tightening expectations."


These Industry Groups Show Strength
-----------------------------------


It is key for investors to track the top performing industry groups. On Friday, oil and gas royalty trusts, farm machinery and construction machinery makers and dairy products providers were the best performers.


**Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) has been a solid performer in the farm machinery space this year. It managed to turn in a gain of 3% Friday and move back above an old cup-with-handle entry of 388.20.


On the downside, consumer electronics retailers, auto manufacturers and makers of medical and database software were the worst performers.


Power infrastructure stock **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)), hospital operator **HCA Healthcare** ([HCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA)) and insurance play **Assurant** ([AIZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIZ)) attempted breakouts, but such moves are untrustworthy in the current environment.

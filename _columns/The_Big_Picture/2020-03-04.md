  Stocks Erase Prior Day's Rout, But Volume Is Weaker; Health Care Sector Leads

All it took was one day for the stock market to erase Tuesday's sharp losses after the main indexes rallied roughly 4% Wednesday. Still, a bottom is not completely clear.




The S&P 500 jumped 4.2% and climbed back above the 200-day moving average after spending four days below it. The Nasdaq composite surged 3.8%, more than canceling Tuesday's 3% sell-off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 4.5%.


Certainly, Wednesday's gains were large enough for a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). The big advance appropriately came on the fourth day of a rally attempt that began with Friday's bullish reversal. But the third ingredient for a bottoming signal was missing: Volume came in well below Tuesday's totals.


A big recovery like Wednesday's begged for higher volume, especially after Tuesday's rout came with an increase in turnover.

One positive is that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain above their Friday lows. But getting a solid follow-through could take a while. The stock market remains unsettled after the severe beating it took last week. Swings of 1,000 points on the Dow and wide price bars on indexes and leading stocks illustrate a market that is still unsure of its direction.


The Covid-19 virus continues to cause disruptions to supply chains, and millions worldwide are avoiding shopping, travel and other activities.


In China, where the coronavirus originated, there are some positive signs. The number of new cases is slowing. In a report Wednesday, Nomura said **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) supplier Hon Hai expects to restore full production by the end of March and has not had any order cancellations. "We find the news slightly better than hoped and thus a positive for Apple," Nomura added.


No doubt it's already too late to undo the economic damage the coronavirus outbreak has caused to the global economy. The question remains: How much worse can it get? It all depends on when cases outside China begin to slow.


Wednesday's session had the feel of a follow-through day even though volume was missing compared with Tuesday's Fed-fueled session. Aggressive investors could start nibbling on good setups. But quickness is key. Boost cash if the market reverses.


Service Sector Contracts
------------------------


The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index for February marked the first contraction of U.S. service sector activity in four years. IHS noted a minor increase in demand and a further contraction in new business from abroad as customers held back on orders due to coronavirus uncertainty.


The Fed's Beige Book found [anecdotal evidence of slowing due to the coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/beige-book-economy-held-up-amid-coronavirus-impact/). The survey covered a period when the disease was beginning to impact businesses.


The 10-year Treasury yield held below 1%. Even as stocks rallied, investors remained in the safe haven of bonds. Gold prices, another haven asset, were steady after rising more than 3% Tuesday.


While volume was weaker, breadth was bullish. Winners swamped decliners by a nearly 6-1 ratio on the NYSE and by nearly 7-to-2 on the Nasdaq. That should help the advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE, which were at or near new lows even as indexes rebounded.


Health Care Sector Leads Stock Market
-------------------------------------


Health care stocks led the stock market higher Wednesday as the market cheered results of Super Tuesday. Former Vice President Joe Biden's strong showing in [Super Tuesday primaries](https://www.investors.com/news/unitedhealth-stock-cvs-stock-get-joe-biden-boost-bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all/) weakened the outlook for leftist rival Bernie Sanders, who has threatened to replace private health insurance plans with an expanded Medicare.


"While there are many moving parts roiling markets, Wednesday's snapback in U.S. equities from Tuesday's loss, in part, reflects the resurgence in Joe Biden's prospects," BMO Capital Markets Economic Research economist Sal Guatieri said in a research note. "Markets seem content with either the status quo (Trump retaining the presidency) or a centrist Democrat taking over the reins and implementing more incremental changes than revolutionary ones, as proposed by ... Sanders."


Managed care providers were the No. 2 industry group out of 197. Drugstores, medical services, medical research and biotechs were among the top 15 groups.


The health care sector led the stock market. Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) surged nearly 6%.

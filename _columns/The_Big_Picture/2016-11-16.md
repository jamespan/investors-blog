Stocks Finish Mixed As Recent Breakouts Hold Up; Nasdaq Rebounds
=================================================================

Exactly one week after Donald Trump's win — what some political experts are calling one of the biggest political upsets in history — the stock market took a well-needed breather in the right manner.


You could sum the day up in four words: small declines, lower volume.


Yet, that would not totally describe the picture. Money flowed back into some tech sectors, propping the Nasdaq up nearly 0.4% while most of the other major indexes declined mildly.


Fiber-optic telecom, integrated computer systems, fabless semiconductor, enterprise software and tech services stocks all rallied 1% or more.


The S&P 500 stepped less than 0.2% lower. The Dow Jones industrials, more important these days because some of its components are authentic leaders in the current new uptrend, fell almost 0.3%.


Small caps, meanwhile, were roughly flat. The Russell 2000 ended unchanged. The S&P SmallCap 600 inched half a point higher.


For the [CAN SLIM investor](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), mild declines in lower volume are ideal after a market changes in character. And it did so last week — blasting sharply higher in the heaviest volume in months.


What caused the general decline on Wednesday? Was it short-term traders taking some profits? Perhaps.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *The market is in a confirmed rally, so it's time to look for possible purchases. AMD broke out Wednesday on a Google deal, one of [four chip stocks in or near buy range](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-breaks-out-on-google-deal-4-chip-stocks-in-or-near-buy-range/).*

Was it also the latest batch of economic data on Wednesday? Perhaps yes, but only to some degree. U.S. industrial output was flat in October, but the Econoday consensus forecast only saw a 0.1% gain. Wholesale prices in October were flat, well below economists' views for a 0.3% lift. And U.S. crude oil inventories spiked again, up 5.3 million barrels in the latest reported week. Crude oil traders reacted, sending near-term West Texas Intermediate futures down 0.8% to $45.46 a barrel.


On the other hand, the economic outlook wasn't all so gloomy, especially in terms of prices. The Atlanta Federal Reserve reported a 2% jump year over year in its survey of business inflation expectations. That's the level that the Fed and Chair Janet Yellen are eyeing as the minimum threshold for beginning to dismantle its cheap-money policy, which has been in place since December 2007.


The market still highly anticipates a quarter-point hike in short-term interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets on Dec. 13-14. The CME Group's FedWatch survey currently shows a 91% probability that the rate on overnight loans to big banks will go up to a 0.5%-0.75% target range.


![mp111616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP111616-176x300.png)Technically, the market continues to flex strength.


The Nasdaq finished high in the day's range, and it's now sitting just 1% below an all-time peak of 5342. It doesn't guarantee that the composite index will make another pelican dive below its 50-day moving average, as it's done no fewer than four times since early October. But a higher number of stocks on the all-electronic exchange are participating in the rally. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line continues to rise.


On the NYSE, winners beat losers by a slim margin, roughly 14 to 13. Yet that's an encouraging trend as more money has flowed into beaten areas such as banking, construction materials, machinery, steel and biotechnology.


And among the companies that have broken out, the pullbacks are looking normal so far.


**Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) fell 3.6% in heavy volume to close at 220.85. Such a loss is digestible, given that the concrete and aggregates play gapped up sharply on Nov. 9 following the election and burst past a 206.46 cup-without-handle entry point. It rose more than 19% for the week in huge volume.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and a slew of super-regional banks also are still extended past proper buy points despite losing ground. Don't chase. Don't buy more than 5% past the proper entry, because you never know how long and big a pullback will be. Right now, patience is key.

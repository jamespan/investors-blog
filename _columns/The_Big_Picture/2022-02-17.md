The stock market sold off Thursday on escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions, as the S&P 500 broke below a key level, placing an already struggling uptrend even under more duress.




The stock market opened squarely lower Thursday and headed further south throughout the session, closing at the day's lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 1.8% Thursday, while the S&P 500 moved down 2.1% to break below its 50-day line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 descended 2.5%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Along the Russia-Ukraine border, Ukraine soldiers and Russia-backed separatists each reportedly accused the other of violating cease-fire rules, raising concerns that small-scale skirmishes could trigger broader military action. The Ukrainian military reported one village school was hit by 32 artillery rounds, according to the Washington Post.


Russia has deployed an estimated 150,000 troops near Ukraine's border. Russia claimed over the past several days it had withdrawn some of those troops. U.S. officials say those claims are unconfirmed, and that Russia actually appears to be reinforcing troops in the area.

The Nasdaq's [distribution-day count](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) rose to four. Higher NYSE volume meant the S&P 500 upped its count to three days of institutional selling since the Jan. 31 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


Stock Market Uptrend In Question
--------------------------------


The stock market remains in an uptrend under pressure, and Thursday's sharp losses are another confirmation of a struggling market. Investors still have the option to buy new breakouts — but make sure they're perfect setups — and need to proceed with caution.


Chip stocks were hit particularly hard Thursday. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) slid 4%, as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) dived 7.5% following the [company's fourth quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-chipmaker-beats-fourth-quarter-targets/). Meanwhile, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) descended 4.5%, closing right at its long-term 200-day line. Both chip giants are far from any potential buy point.


Among leading chip stocks, **ON Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) is forming a cup with handle with a 67.23 buy point, while **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)) is tracing a cup base with a 64.10 entry.


Top growth stocks were also down sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 2.8%. The ETF of top growth stocks snapped a two-day winning streak.

Stocks To Watch: Anthem, Deere, Northern Oil, Wyndham
-----------------------------------------------------


**Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)), **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)), **Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) and **Wyndham Hotels & Resorts** ([WH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WH)) are among the stocks holding up despite the struggling stock market.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock and managed health care giant Anthem is trading about 4% below a flat base's 470.12 buy point following a brief breakout move on Feb. 9. Shares are holding above their 50-day line, which is a support level. For now, investors should wait for a decisive move past the entry before deciding to purchase shares.


Deere is back below a cup-with-handle's 388.20 buy point after Thursday's 2.6% fall. The 5% buy zone goes up to 407.61. The [relative strength line](https://click.email.investors.com/?qs=60468479a912983152095d19fbe4037c07b1b2ae2e5848cbff2ddd15cd84722d79fecfe4612f6c517e1f4e162fbbde5aecba6e1eff143441ea1915e5e08f7516) hit its highest level since May during the breakout, which was a sign of strong stock market outperformance. Deere reports its [fiscal first quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/deere-stock-deere-earnings-q1-2022/) Friday morning, so the stock carries extra risk right now.


[Tuesday's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-energy-leader-northern-oil-approaches-new-buy-point/) pick, Northern Oil & Gas, is about 5% away from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/)'s 25.57 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares rose 0.6% Thursday.


[Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/wyndham-hotels-stock-nears-buy-point-with-earnings-on-tap/), Wyndham Hotels, is trying to break out past a flat base's 91.51 buy point. But like many breakouts during the current stock market volatility, the stock failed to hold its buy point Wednesday and is now about 4% below it. [Wyndham stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-wyndham-hotels-and-resorts-wh.aspx) shows a strong 96 [IBD Composite Rating,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) per [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)

Nasdaq Regains 50-Day Line; Uptrend Resumes
============================================

Stock indexes advanced confidently Thursday as the market awaited Britain's vote on whether to stay or leave the European Union.


The Nasdaq and IBD 50 thrust 1.6% higher. The S&P 500 trailed with a 1.3% pop. Small caps and chip stocks outperformed: The S&P 600 gained 2% and the Philadelphia semiconductor index bolted 2.6%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


The Nasdaq regained its 50-day moving average, and the S&P 500 padded its cushion above its own 50-day line.

Although the market had not been in an outright correction, Thursday's follow-through was a bullish sign. This means the green light is on for IBD-style investors to buy strong stocks breaking out of valid chart patterns.


Results from the British vote weren't available during the U.S. session. About 80% of the tally was expected to be determined by midnight Eastern time. The vote is nonbinding and would require the support of Parliament if voters choose to leave the EU.


The Federal Reserve's bank stress tests were released after the market's close. Of 33 banks tested, all passed the test.


A slew of other financial news, though, was mostly disappointing.


On the bearish side, the Chicago Fed National Activity Index for May checked in at -0.51 vs. a revised 0.05 in April. New home sales for May fell about 2.5% shy of expectations but that was against a tough comparison: April's level was the highest in eight years. Leading indicators for May also failed to hit the consensus mark, -0.2% vs. views for +0.2%.


On the bullish side, first-time jobless claims were about 4% fewer than expected. And the PMI Manufacturing Index Flash for June came in at 51.4, topping views for 51.


Action among leading stocks was quiet. Most top-rated stocks rose but in below-average turnover.



**Universal Forest Products** ([UFPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UFPI)) completed a breakout that it first attempted June 15, when it cleared the 89.01 entry intraday but failed to close above it. On Thursday, Universal Forest gained 3.95 to 91.49 in volume 47% above average.


The small-cap company, which is thinly traded, makes wood and wood-alternative products, such as roof and floor trusses.


Tech outsourcer and consultant **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)) slid as much as 2%, brushing its 50-day line. However, the stock bounced off the line to erase all but 0.1% of the loss and to close high in the day's range. The action pointed to institutional support.


Four stocks that recently cleared buy points showed decent follow-up action Thursday.



Paris-based **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) added 1.76 to 47.08 in quiet volume. The ad-tech firm is now 8% past a 43.44 buy point and also extended from a bounce off the 10-week line.


**Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)) edged up 0.25 to 38.49 in trade 40% above average. The network products provider is 12% above a 34.24 buy point.


**Tile Shop** ([TTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTS)) advanced 0.73 to 19.78 in volume 42% above its usual pace. The tile store chain remains in the 5% buy zone.


**Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) popped 2.56 to 25.08 in triple volume. The stock dropped more than 7% below a 24.32 buy point Wednesday but regained the entry Thursday.


What's ahead: Total returns from Britain's EU referendum should be available early Friday. Durable goods orders for May will be released before the market's open. Also, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge will be released a half-hour after the market's open. The Russell indexes' annual rebalancing will take effect at Friday's close.

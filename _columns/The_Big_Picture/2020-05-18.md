  Stocks Surge Broadly On Vaccine Trial; One Index Got Left Behind The Rally

Buyers didn't let up all day Monday, sending the stock market to formidable gains. But one group of stocks surprisingly lagged.




Robust gains took indexes above short-term price areas — the latest sign that this market does not stay scared for long. And Monday's market was awash with optimism after encouraging news on a coronavirus vaccine trial.


The S&P 500 surged nearly 3.2%, rising past its April 29 near-term high. The Nasdaq composite jumped 2.4% and cleared last week's high at 9251. The Dow Jones Industrial Average did not quite top its April 29 high but still soared 3.9%, its best day since April 6.


But it was small caps that shined the brightest. The Russell 2000 roared more than 6% and gapped above a narrow trend line traced over the index's highs since April 29. For the small-cap benchmark it also was the best day since April 6.

Many smaller companies don't have the cash reserves or resources to withstand a crisis like coronavirus. But with more of the U.S. economy reopening, sentiment is improving around these companies.


Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq, and breadth was impressive. Advancers led decliners by more than 8 to 1 on the NYSE and by 9 to 2 on the Nasdaq. Gains Monday were sufficient to remove the May 13 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) from the S&P 500. (The index rose more than 5% from that day's close.) The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) was already light, reflecting a positive bias where the good sentiment prevails over the bad.


Stock Market Not Scared For Long
--------------------------------


Monday's bubbly performance showed the stock market does not want to quit, despite huge question marks on the economy, profits and the labor market.


Each time the stock market has looked to be in trouble, it has found a way to rebound. Study the most severe declines since early April: The Nasdaq sold off 4.4% on April 1, 3.5% on April 21, 3.2% on May 1, 2.1% on May 12 and more than 1.5% the next day. Yet, each time the index was back above those bad sessions' price bars in just a few days.


Sentiment is always an important part of the stock market, and the current market is certainly emotional. How else can you explain a market moving up so well when [economic indicators are in the tank](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) and earnings are down?


Stock Market Cheers Vaccine Trial
---------------------------------


Monday's rally came after hopeful news on the coronavirus front.



**Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) shares soared 20% to a record high after the [biotech reported positive results from an initial-phase trial of its coronavirus vaccine](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-mrna-stock-flies-promising-phase-1-test/). The biotech tested the vaccine in healthy adults and, in all age groups, participants began showing antibodies against Covid-19.


The stock market also liked the latest comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. In an interview on CBS' "60 Minutes" Sunday, he said [more steps are still possible to rescue the economy](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/full-transcript-fed-chair-jerome-powell-60-minutes-interview-economic-recovery-from-coronavirus-pandemic/). "There's a lot more we can do," Powell said. "I will say that we're not out of ammunition by a long shot."


In another positive indication, the S&P energy sector rumbled more than 8% higher as [oil prices extended a rebound](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-have-gone-full-180-rally-gains-momentum/). West Texas Intermediate futures for June delivery climbed 11.7% to a two-month high of $32.72 per barrel. Brent oil prices rose 7% to $34.82 per barrel. The supply cuts from major oil producers and the gradual reopening of world economies are helping to normalize the oil market.


There was a blemish on Monday's stellar day: Leading stocks lagged noticeably. The IBD 50 index rose only 0.4%. Some stocks that had run up ceded some gains. **Zynex** ([ZYXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZYXI)), **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)) (the target of short sellers) slid 3.5% to 8.7%.


Investors did find some [more breakouts Monday](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/new-highs-bullish-up-session-yields-several-solid-breakouts/).


**Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) gapped up past the 80.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on analyst comments. **S&P Global** ([SPGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPGI)) broke out of a cup with handle with a 308.51 buy point. But volume was weak.


**Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)) jumped above a 119.75 entry in heavy trading. Its [relative strength line is at new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) too. Scientific equipment makers **Cogne**x ([CGNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGNX)) and **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)) also topped [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

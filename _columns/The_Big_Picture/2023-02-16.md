==========================================================================================

The stock market sold off sharply Thursday on rate-hike fears in the wake of the Labor Department's hotter-than-expected wholesale inflation data.




Midday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said that he pushed for a higher interest-rate increase at the most recent Fed meeting and could see a more aggressive rate hike ahead. News of his comments appeared to send the market averages back to their session lows.


As the stock market uptrend tries to stick, there are still stocks that are in new buy zones. Three breakout stocks to watch are [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)), [recent IBD 50 Stocks To Watch pick](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-super-micro-computer-hits-fresh-buy-point/) **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) and **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)).


Inflation, Jobless Claims, Earnings Results
-------------------------------------------


January's producer price index from the Labor Department rose 0.7% on the month, hotter than the 0.4% estimate. That amounts to a year-over-year increase of 6%, down from 6.2% in December. The monthly core rate rose 0.5%, hotter than the 0.3% estimate, with an annual rate of 5.4%.


Meanwhile, weekly first-time unemployment claims fell to 194,000, vs. 195,000 in the previous week. They were expected to rise to 200,000. The combination of rising prices and a firm job market gives the Fed more room to continue with a tight monetary policy for longer.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MP021623-259x300.jpg)Also Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey for February fell to -24.3 vs. -8.9 in the previous month.


On the earnings front, **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) plunged nearly 16% after the [company's 2023 revenue outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-stock-shopify-earnings-q42022/) fell short of expectations.


**Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)), Dow Jones member **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), **Toast** ([TOST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOST)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) were also big earnings movers Thursday.


Albemarle shares gained 4.7% after the [lithium miner topped fourth-quarter earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/lithium-stocks-livent-slips-on-2023-outlook-albemarle-on-deck/). The stock briefly topped a 292.08 cup-with-handle entry. Cisco shares jumped 5.2% after [beating earnings expectations](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/cisco-earnings-report-due-is-another-dividend-hike-in-the-cards/), breaking out past a 50.81 buy point.


[CROX stock](https://www.investors.com/news/crocs-stock-surges-after-earnings-beat-optimistic-2023-outlook/) advanced 4.4% after the shoemaker topped fourth-quarter revenue views early Thursday and reported an optimistic 2023 outlook with profits exceeding analyst views. Streaming video platform Roku [smashed estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/roku-stock-surges-on-growth-in-new-users-in-holiday-quarter/) for new users and revenue in the fourth quarter, sparking an 11% surge.


Twilio leapt more than 14%. But Toast shares plunged nearly 23%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3% and the S&P 500 lost 1.4%. The Nasdaq declined 1.8%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1%. After four straight days of closing near session highs, indexes closed at the day's lows.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the prior session. Thursday's declines in higher volume gave the S&P 500 a third [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), while the Nasdaq received its second dose of institutional selling.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 2.4% Thursday as the ETF of top growth stocks ended a three-day win streak. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) declined 6% Thursday, ending a three-day win streak. Shares are just 7% away from a 24.21 buy point in a cup with handle.


IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains in a confirmed uptrend amid strong gains this year since the Jan. 6 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), with the Nasdaq up some 13% year-to-date through Thursday's close. Given the market's strength, it makes sense to maintain an exposure level of 60%-80%.


Despite Thursday's losses, the recent pullback has been pretty textbook. Many recent breakouts are faring well and holding above recent buy points, with a few exceptions, like **Credo Technology** ([CRDO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRDO)) and Toast.


If more and more breakout gains start to fade, then you should begin to reduce your exposure to match the market action. As usual, be sure to take some profits at the [20%-25% profit zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) and follow your sell rules.

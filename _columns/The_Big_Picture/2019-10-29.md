title: Nasdaq 100 Sinks More Than Key Indexes; Could This Be The No. 1 Surprise In Q4?

If you are heavy in the [FAANG plays](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/), then you probably weren't such a happy camper on Tuesday. But as for everyone else, the session was probably what the stock market needed: a nice rest after some heady gains in recent weeks.




The Nasdaq 100 fell nearly 0.8% as some of the biggest techs in the U.S. markets fell 2% or more. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.6%. So compared with those losses, a dip of less than 0.1% for both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have felt like a victory.


And Tuesday's session for small caps? Even better. The Russell 2000 marched 0.3% higher, pulled forward by toasty gains in medical, oil and gas, cyclical, food, commercial services and a few select consumer-oriented stocks.


Tuesday's action may have some readers wondering: Could small caps be one of the nicest surprises in stocks in the current quarter?

From Oct. 1 through Tuesday's action, the S&P SmallCap 600 advanced 3.4% — prevailing over a 2% lift by the 500 and a 0.6% rise by the Dow industrials.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and edged higher on the NYSE. But the S&P 500's loss was too small to consider Tuesday a [day of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), or truly significant institutional selling. The Sept. 24 distribution day on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 expired on time Tuesday.


Industry Group Watching
-----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP102919-239x300.jpg)For a day in which most of the major indexes played small ball, the fact that scores of industry groups rose 1% or more may feel quite surprising. (See the full daily performance of 197 IBD industry groups at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


After all, the market's gains have not been rip-roaring since the [Aug. 13 Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bulls-get-third-major-buy-signal-this-year-why/) highlighted a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) taking place that same day. Yet, big gains in some emerging new leading sectors of the market would not feel like a surprise at all for the veteran IBD reader.


Four Positive Elements Today
----------------------------


Plus, more positive trends are emerging. Here are four:


One, the new-highs list continues to fatten. Go back to August and September, and it was extremely rare to see more than 50 or 75 companies make a 52-week or all-time high. Yet [Monday's stock market action](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-28-2019/) marked the sixth session in a row that more than 100 issues trading on the Big Board hit new highs. Tuesday likely made it the seventh straight session.


Two, other components of the stock market's internals keep improving.


The 50-day moving average of the S&P 500 is aiming to slope higher for a third straight week. The NYSE's advance-decline line has made new highs. And the Nasdaq's A-D line is ramping up for a fourth straight week.


(Go to the General Market Indicators link at the bottom of every Big Picture column to see the NYSE's A-D line, found inside the S&P 500's daily chart.)


Three, small caps are showing more liveliness.


The S&P 600, up 0.4% Tuesday, now truly faces a test of technical resistance that stretches all the way to early November. The 990 price level has been one heavy ceiling on the index. However, banking shares have been showing a little more pep. A strong move past 1000 in the S&P 600 may induce a change in thinking on Wall Street about this sector of the stock market.


The average market cap of S&P 600 companies is $1.7 billion. In other words, it would take 646 firms with that market value to match the $1.1 trillion value of **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Four, individual leaders in top-performing sectors and industry groups lately are helping chartists make money.


Not On The Nasdaq
-----------------


Cyclicals are gaining more mojo ahead of the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday. CME Group on Tuesday showed a 97.3% chance of a quarter-point rate cut.



**Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) and fellow RV maker **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) have vaulted higher in recent weeks. The former hauled past a 41.71 correct buy point in a nearly three-month cup with handle, then rolled ahead more than 20% in less than three weeks. Such a gain spurs a [special sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/).


Winnebago's RV and mobile manufacturing group ranks No. 1 for six-month relative price performance among the 197 industry groups.


**Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) fell more than 1% for a second straight session. A move past a 52.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [shallow cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) has so far produced an 18.5% paper profit. That falls a bit shy of the 20%-25% profit target. Still, never let a decent gain turn into a disappointing round trip.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) currently shows seven companies on the Leaders list, all of which have gotten extended beyond the 5% buy zone. Another eight Leaderboard names are on the [Leaders Near A Buy Point list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). This means they are either close to a [true breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) or trade within the [proper buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) after recently breaking out.

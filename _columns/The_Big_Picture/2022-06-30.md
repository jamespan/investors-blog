Stock Market Drops As Nasdaq Sets Record Loss For First Half Of The Year
=========================================================================

The stock market ended firmly lower, even after slashing much of its losses Thursday, as the Nasdaq composite finished with a record-setting loss in the first half of 2022.




But auto parts leader **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)), Dow Jones giant **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and top biotech **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) are showing signs of strength.


Ahead of the market open Thursday, [the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/key-fed-inflation-rate-eases-in-may-but-dow-jones/) came out, with the personal consumption expenditure price index rising 0.6% for May, with a year-over-year increase of 6.3%. Both numbers came in slightly lower than consensus Econoday estimates. Personal income rose 0.5% in May, in line with estimates but [lower than the previous month](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/key-fed-inflation-rate-eases-in-may-but-dow-jones/). The PCE price index is one measure of U.S. inflation, tracking the change in prices of goods and services purchased by consumers throughout the economy.


Meanwhile, the Labor Department said first-time unemployment claims fell to 231,000, down from a revised 233,000 in the prior week.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MP063022_2-241x300.jpg)The 10-year Treasury yield ticked lower to 2.97%, its first close below 3% since June 7. In mid-June, it hit its highest level since April 2011, at 3.48%. Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices fell more than 3%, with West Texas Intermediate trading at $106 a barrel. In early March, WTI briefly topped out above $130.


On the earnings front, **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) [beat Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal third quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mu-stock-micron-delivers-dismal-outlook/) and matched views on sales. However, it badly missed estimates with its guidance for the current quarter. MU stock fell in extended trading after closing about 44% off its 52-week high.


Stock Market Rally Struggles
----------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.8%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off 1.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.7%. Volume rose on the NYSE and inched higher on the Nasdaq, so the S&P 500 gained its first [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) while the Nasdaq added its second day of institutional selling of the new market uptrend.


Through the first half of 2022, the Nasdaq is down about 29% year to date, its worst first half on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 15.3% year to date, its worst first-half performance since 1962. And the S&P 500 closed down 20.6% year to date, its worst first half since 1970's 21% drop.


Top growth stocks ended barely lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.2%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), Chinese stock leaders **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) and **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) rallied 6.3% and 0.6%, respectively. DQ shares are sharply above a 53.70 buy point in a consolidation, while Li Auto stock is above a 37.55 buy point.


Among the S&P sectors, utilities were the clear winner, rising 1.1%. Energy was the biggest laggard, dropping 2%, while consumer discretionary, technology, communication services and materials each fell more than 1%.


The already-struggling stock market rally faced more difficulty Thursday, as the major stock indexes ended with moderate losses, even after cutting into heavy losses at the market open.


On Tuesday, the [stock market outlook was downgraded](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/sellers-hit-stock-market-hard-hurting-nascent-uptrend-oil-gas-stocks-rise-but-solar-shares-stumble/) to "uptrend under pressure." Given the extremely challenging environment, investors should remain on the defensive and focus only on stocks showing exceptional fundamental and technical strength.

Stocks To Watch: AutoZone, UnitedHealth, Vertex
-----------------------------------------------


Despite the struggling stock market rally, a few stocks are holding up much better than others, including **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)), Dow Jones health care giant **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)).


AutoZone shares moved further above their cup with handle's 2,130.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) and are in the 5% buy area, which goes up to 2,237.13. Shares were up 0.4% Thursday.


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) UnitedHealth is in buy range past a [double bottom's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) 507.36 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares are in a [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/), which goes up to 532.72, as they drifted 0.4% lower Thursday. Keep in mind that the weak market environment should keep you away from buying most stocks. With AZO's RS line at new highs, the Dow Jones leader is a top stock to watch.


[IBD Big Cap 20 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) Vertex Pharmaceuticals is holding just above an alternate entry at 279.23 in the wake of the stock's failed breakout past a 276.10 [cup-with-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/). The stock's snapback after the sell signal, along with an [RS line right at new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), is a bonus for the chart. Vertex shares gained 0.5% Thursday.

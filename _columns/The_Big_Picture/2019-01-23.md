Stock market bulls breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday as Wall Street endured another whipsaw session.




The stock marked opened nicely higher early Wednesday, helped by strong earnings reports from **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)). The Dow Jones jumped 1.2% early, but a wave of selling knocked the blue-chip index to a loss of 0.4% near midday. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.9% before reversing lower to an intraday loss of nearly 1%.


But selling pressure in the stock market abated by the close as major stock indexes held above their 50-day moving averages. The Dow Jones ended with a gain of 0.7%. The S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite edged higher by 0.1%. The Russell small-cap index eased 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday.


[Distribution](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), or higher-volume declines in the stock market, has been limited since the S&P 500 confirmed a new uptrend on Jan. 4. This, plus the fact that more bullish setups in individual stocks are starting to emerge, is working in the bulls' favor for now.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MP012319.jpg)It remains a challenging environment for breakouts, but with the market still in a confirmed uptrend, it makes sense nibbling at top-rated stocks breaking out of bases.


Stock Market Gainers
--------------------


To be sure, stock market bulls are encouraged by a multitude of bullish charts that could yield breakouts if the market uptrend can add to the gains of the past few weeks.


For large-cap investors, Procter & Gamble boasts strong technicals. It's just below a 96.99 entry after shares gapped up Wednesday on [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-stock-procter-gamble-earnings-q2-2019/). The stock closed off highs but still rose nearly 5% to 94.84.


Also in the Dow, **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) is working on the right side of a shallow base with a 190.98 buy point. **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), meanwhile, is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 58.79 entry.


Growth Stocks On The Move
-------------------------


For growth investors, **LHC Group** ([LHCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHCG)) topped a 107.61 buy point but backed off. Shares closed at 107.07, up 3.2% after making [a new high](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/stock-breakouts-fizzle/). LHC Group was featured in Tuesday's IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/lhc-stock-lhc-earnings-lhc-group-home-health-care/).


Enterprise software leader **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) also joined the breakout ranks early Wednesday but a 3.1% early gain faded. Shares closed at 171.66, up 0.5%, after topping a 172.77 buy point earlier in the session.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Tencent Music** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) followed through after Tuesday's breakout from an IPO base, but a 4.3% gain faded to 1% by the close.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) is also showing strength. After a failed breakout over a 72.10 buy point, a handle is in place with a 72.32 entry.


Other IBD 50 stocks in healthy technical setups **Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).


Semiconductor Earnings
----------------------


A trio of semiconductor stocks reported earnings late Wednesday and rose in after-hours trading. **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) jumped 7%; **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) soared 8% on a big [earnings and sales beat](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/xilinx-stock-xilinx-earnings-q3-2019/) and **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) added 1%.


Xilinx was featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/options-trading-semiconductor-earnings-xilinx-stock/) story as a possible call option trade ahead of earnings.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor index lagged again Wednesday after shedding nearly 3% Tuesday.

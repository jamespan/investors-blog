title: Stocks Fall, Fear Up, Natgas Skyrockets; 3 Reasons Why Apple Needs A Break

Apple falls for a fifth session in a row, losing 11% of its market value in the process. Major indexes careen from the upside to the downside early, then up and down a second time by day's end. Natural gas futures rally more than 17% — in a single day.


Not your typical Wednesday session on Wall Street. So, what can investors do to get a handle on all this volatility?


First things first. Let's study the daily action of the major indexes. And Wednesday's performance gave little to cheer about.


During a market in a confirmed uptrend, stocks typically begin a shade weaker but end stronger. Wednesday's session showed the opposite. The Nasdaq composite opened with a solid gain of more than 1.1%. But by day's end, the tech-centered composite index dropped 0.9%.


In other words, an intraday swing of roughly 2% to the downside is no way a key index should behave when the overall market direction should be up. Such action also seems to fortify the case that the uptrend is still under pressure.


The S&P 500 mirrored the action in the Nasdaq. The large-cap benchmark quickly boiled away its early rise of 0.9% and lost nearly 0.8% by the close.

Even worse, volume increased on both sides.


The significant drops by both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 in higher volume vs. the prior session translated into a [session of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or unusually intense professional selling. And since the [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) on Wednesday last week, the Nasdaq has now scored its first such distribution. The S&P 500 now has two.


IBD's research finds that when the major indexes pick up serious distribution days immediately after a follow-through, chances rise quickly that the fledgling market rally will get shot down fast. So, is the Nasdaq's distribution day, coming five days after the Nov. 7 follow-through, going to doom the rally?


While no one knows with crystal-ball clarity, all IBD readers can certainly appreciate the impact that the [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/), plus **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), are having on the Nasdaq composite itself.


According to the top of the Nasdaq daily chart in the General Market Indicators PDF page, Apple and the four FANG members (**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Google operator **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))) together make up nearly 23% of the entire value of the Nasdaq market. That's not a misprint — it's 23%.


And what if you add **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) into the mix? That ratio goes up to 29%. Nearly three of every 10 dollars of market value is housed in those six megacap techs.


Look at the daily charts of those six longtime leaders. All of them, except Microsoft, are trading below their long-term 200-day moving averages. Ditto for the Nasdaq composite and the Nasdaq 100.


So, even though the major indexes remain above their Oct. 29 near-term lows, it's no wonder that the Nasdaq remains more than 12% below an all-time peak of 8133.


The S&P 500, which got hammered down for a fifth straight session and also took out its 200-day line, lies 8% beneath a 2940 all-time peak.


The S&P SmallCap 600, off 0.8% on Wednesday, has fallen 14% below its all-time high. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) also dropped 0.8%. At 30.22, it's now 22% below this year's peak of 38.79. The ETF rallied 34% in 2017.


Apple Stock Analysis
--------------------



The iPhone, Macbook, Apple Watch and digital services giant certainly deserves a break. One reason: Shares have climbed nearly 98% after breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle on Jan. 6, 2017. At the time, the breakout point was 118.12. Since then, it has formed numerous bases.


And in recent months, Apple did what many market leaders have done throughout bull and bear cycles: It did a complete round trip of gains from a later-stage breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 194.30 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). This is a second reason to believe that Apple needs a lot of time to recover.


A Third Test Of The 200-Day For Apple In 2018
---------------------------------------------


Apple is actually no stranger to the 200-day moving average. It survived tests of institutional support at this long-term technical level both in February and April, then went on to form additional bases. But a big drop down to the 200-day line alone means that the stock is taking a well-needed breather.


A third reason why Apple may not move to new highs with gusto? The concerns about slowing growth, and even a potential drop, in iPhone sales are evidently real. Wall Street has shaved its growth forecasts for the Cupertino, Calif., titan.


Over the past six quarters, adjusted earnings per share grew on average 28% vs. year-ago levels, according to data from IBD sister firm William O'Neil + Co. But the Street now sees full-year profits rising just 14% in fiscal 2019 (ending in September next year) and up 10% in fiscal 2020.


So, for the stock market to maintain its bullish bent, what needs to happen?


Breadth needs to improve. That certainly wasn't the case Wednesday.


On the NYSE, losers beat winners by a 3-2 margin. On the Nasdaq, declining issues topped gainers 2 to 1.


New highs need to increase, which would suggest more stocks are positioning to breakouts. On Wednesday, fewer than 50 companies on the Nasdaq and NYSE made 52-week or all-time highs. Nearly 450 stocks made new lows.


Fear Is Growing
---------------


Meanwhile, bearishness among options traders and pundits has increased. This is ultimately bullish for stocks. Why? Bearish investors tend to sit on the sidelines, hoping their prediction that stock prices will keep falling will come true. But if equity prices don't fall, these players may be forced to get back in.


The Cboe notched an intraday put-call volume ratio of as high as 1.22. See the final tally calculated by IBD for all major options exchanges by going to the [Psychological Market Indicators section](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/). On Oct. 18, IBD's put-call ratio surged to 1.26, nearly matching the 1.27 peak seen on Feb. 9.

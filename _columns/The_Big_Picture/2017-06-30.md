Stocks Indefinite, But Dow's Apple Shows Subtle Progress
=========================================================

U.S. stock indexes stepped hesitantly Friday, with the direction mixed and the volume light.




The Nasdaq retreated 0.1%, while the S&P 500 rose almost 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average made the biggest footprint, up 0.3%. The small cap S&P 600 was flat, according to preliminary data.


Volume fell across the board.


The stock market will be open Monday but closed Tuesday for the July 4 holiday. With some traders willing to skip all or part of Monday's session, the market won't likely be back to full strength until Wednesday.


Another factor to consider in the volume picture is the recent pattern of up on falling volume, and down on rising volume.


This is often a bearish sign, though in this case it might point to a chickenlike market.


Bold strokes, up or down, are not finding follow-up.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MP_063017.png)June proved to be a negative month for the Nasdaq, ending a streak of seven monthly advances in a row, according to William O'Neil + Co. data. The S&P 500 had no long streak at stake and rose for the third month in a row.


The market has begun the summer season, a time when a pullback often emerges in the Nasdaq. (See Thursday's Big Picture for the details on [the summer lows](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-get-the-shredder-is-a-summer-pullback-underway/) of the past eight years.)


Many bulls would be grateful for a decline. A pullback of 10%, 15% or more could set the groundwork for a vigorous rally.


A strong pullback can drive out the weak holders, thinning the ranks of potential sellers.


The key element for the individual investor is to put some money on the sidelines for later placement. If and when a summer low is put in, the goal isn't to buy stocks at lower prices but to buy stocks that have a chance for strong run-ups.


A fundamentally strong stock, operating in an aggressively bullish atmosphere, can outperform the indexes decisively.


On Friday, the market wasn't doing anything decisively. The indexes were mixed, and volume was far off Thursday's pace.


The day's best gainer in terms of breadth, among IBD's 197 industry groups, was instructive. Homebuilders nailedÂ a 2.7% gain, but this led to [no breakouts](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/this-stock-is-a-rarity-in-the-homebuilder-space/).


Oil- and gas-field services stocks were the stars for the week, up almost 7%, per preliminary data. West Texas intermediate crude oil also rose 7%.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) lost about 1.5% for the week, but [successfully tested](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-rebounds-one-reason-why-the-apple-stock-run-is-not-over/) its mid-June lows. Chart readers see that as a positive, despite the weekly loss. Apple has been consolidating since mid-May. If Apple can build a base, it would only be at stage two.

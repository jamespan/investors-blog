The stock market finished mixed on Friday, but key indexes closed the week in the red.




Thursday's body slam of the Nasdaq proved too much for the composite index to recover all of its losses quickly. After sliding 3% that day, one day after an important Federal Reserve meeting, the Nasdaq rebounded nearly 0.8% Friday. It closed near session highs.


At 13,215, the tech-weighted index lost 0.8% for the week. Since March 3, the Nasdaq has spent nine of the past 13 sessions staring up at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) rather than looking down at this crucial technical level.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![MP031921](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP031921-267x300.jpg)The S&P 500 succumbed to a wave of selling in the dying minutes of Friday's session as weekly and monthly equity options and futures expired. It squandered a 0.4% afternoon gain to fall less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 0.7%; and financial, consumer and industrial components backtracked. The S&P 500 closed the week down nearly 0.8% and the Dow was off less than 0.5%.


The weekly losses hint at growing angst on Wall Street over the cost of money. Long-term interest rates have soared, on percentage terms, since early August. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond has more than tripled from 0.50% to as high as 1.75%, according to Cboe market data. Are inflationary pressures rising? Will corporations still borrow as much to pay dividends and buy back stock? Will equities become less attractive vs. bonds?


Opinions on these issues have clearly played out in recent weeks in the stock market. At some point, the choppy action will end. Eventually, a handful of stocks will grow into big market winners.


A New Magnificent Seven?
------------------------


The following seven names all belong to [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), a proprietary screen that generates stock ideas for [discussion on IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A). However, the more you check out other automated stock lists across Investors.com, the more likely you'll find a company making multiple screens. **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) and fintech play **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) offer two fine examples. Headed into Friday's trade, both companies made the [Sector Leaders list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders). Both rank high in [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).Â Both InMode and 360 DigiTech have scored immense gains from their latest [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).



You don't want to chase them higher. Instead, keep them on a watchlist and look for [good secondary entries](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/add-trading-playbook-rebound-10-week-line/). Or, a brand-new good base may blossom.


**Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) cleared a 151.26 [cup-base buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) Thursday after issuing torrid fourth-quarter growth. China's social media firm **Joyy** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) has made some tight weekly closes lately. **Tencent Music** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)), a new [earnings call option play on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/earningoptions) reporting Q4 results Monday, former Leaderboard member **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) and **ZIM Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) have also shown extraordinary [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/).


Joyy is slated to report its fourth-quarter results on Thursday after the market close.



The Street expects the midcap firm to post a 22% rise in Q4 earnings vs. a year earlier to $1.17 a share as sales drop 6% to $1.03 billion, according to FactSet. In the year-ago quarter, Joyy posted a 49% plunge in profit and a 61% top-line gain.


Analysts also forecast Joyy's earnings growth to accelerate, rising 6% last year to $4.14 a share and 27% to $5.26 in 2021.


The stock is trying to hold its 10-week moving average while perhaps forming a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-zim-integ-shipping-svcs-zim.aspx), ZIM scores an enviable 96 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/).


Beyond Nasdaq
-------------


Small caps rebounded mildly Friday. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF gained 0.8% after it slumped 3% the prior day. The ETF dropped 2.8% for the week. The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) (VIX) reversed lower, down 3.9% to 20.74.


According to IBD research, when this index rises more than 20% above its 10-day moving average, it can confirm a positive reversal in the market following a meaningful correction in stock prices.


On Monday afternoon trading, [the VIX](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) fell another 8%.

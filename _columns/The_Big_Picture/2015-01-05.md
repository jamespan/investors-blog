Sellers were back in the market Monday, prompting a shift in IBD's market outlook to market in correction.

  

Another sharp drop in oil prices and uncertainty about Greece and its status in the eurozone fueled another day of institutional selling.

  

The Dow lost 1.9%, the S&P 500 1.8% and the Nasdaq 1.6%. Volume rose from Friday's levels.

  

All three indexes closed below their 50-day moving averages. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 1.5% but managed to close above its 50-day line. The IBD 50 held up relatively well, falling just 1.1%.

  

The put-call volume ratio ended at 1.16, indicating a fearful market. In the past, the market has bottomed when this gauge showed fear was rampant.

  

But headed into Monday, an elevated distribution-day count and overall weak action in growth stocks already made for a risky market. Monday's weak action raised the risk profile even more for growth investors.

  

Conditions are too risky to buy stocks, so investors should be raising cash. They also should definitely avoid buying on margin. It's imperative to cut losses short.

  

Unabated selling continued in the energy sector Monday. Five of the day's 10 worst-performing industry groups hailed from the sector as crude oil plunged again. Oil ended at $50.04 a barrel, down 5%. Oil's descent accelerated after the U.S. Dollar Index broke out in September. Crude is denominated in dollars.

  

Meanwhile, the euro has been weakening in anticipation of European Central Bank stimulus. Expectations are growing that the ECB could deliver quantitative easing measures on Jan. 22, especially in light of news Monday that inflation in Germany slowed to its lowest level in five years.

  

In Greece, fears are growing that an anti-austerity party could gain control in Greece's general election Jan. 25. Last week, a final parliamentary vote to elect a new Greek president failed.

  

The news isn't all bad in the growth space. Several fabless chip stocks are holding up well. IBD 50 components **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) are trading tightly and holding above their 10-week lines after recent breakouts.

  

Two others in the group rose in heavy volume Monday: Small cap **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) added 9%, padding gains after a breakout over 16.25. **Silicon Motion** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) continued work on the right side of a base, rising nearly 4%.

Stocks started on a negative note Friday, but the indexes reversed to finish solidly higher.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each popped 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9%.

  

The IBD 50 led the pack with a 1.2% gain.

  

Volume rose across the board. Friday was an options expirations day, which tends to boost volume.

  

The S&P 500 finally made a decisive move above a boxlike trading range dating back to late December. Whether the index can hold above the former resistance level is the challenge now. The Nasdaq broke above its previous trading range on Feb. 12.

  

Friday's market opened with a loss and then staged a positive reversal. This sort of action is typical in bull markets.

  

The current uptrend is showing more signs of bullishness: New highs are back to healthy levels; sector leadership is showing a less defensive bias; the NYSE advance-decline line is near highs; the percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day line is the highest since late November; and the distribution count has dropped sharply.

  

On Friday, the S&P 500 lost its Jan. 14 distribution day because of time, the index's third improvement for the week. The Nasdaq also dropped three distribution days during the week.

  

This has left the uptrend in better shape. While some might be tempted to consider the development a mere technicality, individual investors should keep in mind what the count represents: fund managers selling shares. And for the past two weeks, funds have shown little interest in selling stocks.

  

Over the past five weeks, breakouts also have fared better. Not too long ago, many breakouts were stalling or rolling over in the 5% buy zone. More stocks now are cutting through resistance. From breakouts in the past five weeks:

  

Network security provider **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) is up a stunning 61% from a 43.59 buy point.

  

Infotainment systems company **Harman International Industries** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)) is 20% above a 113.98 buy point.

  

Communications infrastructure firm **CommScope** ([COMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COMM)) is sitting 15% above a 26.99 buy point.

  

Fuselage and propulsion systems maker **Spirit AeroSystems** ([SPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPR)) is nearly 13% above a 45.48 entry.

  

Cloud-based software developer **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is 11% over a 71 buy point. And **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) is sipping on an 11% gain above an 84.30 buy point.

  

The market has done especially well in the context of worrisome news events in Greece, Ukraine, West Coast ports and the oil patch. West Texas intermediate crude oil fell about 2% to under $51 a barrel.

  

On Friday, Europe kicked the Greece can down the road, offering Greece a four-month bailout extension. The stock market had already staged a positive reversal before the news became official about an hour before the close. The indexes, though, did appear to get additional thrust from the news.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 rose 2.3%; the Nasdaq, 1.3%; the S&P 500, 0.6%; and the Dow, 0.7%.

  

Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) on Monday; **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), Tuesday; **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), Wednesday; and **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)), Thursday.

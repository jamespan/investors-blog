The stock market took a breather following Wednesday's strong gains, as the major stock indexes finished quietly mixed ahead of Friday's pivotal July jobs report.




The Labor Department's [July jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-why-the-july-employment-data-may-deliver-a-jolt-for-dow-jones/) is set for release Friday morning. The U.S. economy is expected to have added 250,000 jobs in July with an unemployment rate of 3.6%. A solid jobs report could be bad news for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other indexes. Many investors are counting on the economy being weak enough for the Federal Reserve to shift from rate hiking to rate cutting in the first half of 2023.


On Thursday, initial unemployment claims rose to 260,000 vs. 256,000 in the previous week, in line with Econoday estimates. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked down to 2.67%, and is trying to rebound after hitting its lowest level since early April this week.


On the earnings front, **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) shares reversed nearly 2% lower despite [strong earnings.](https://www.investors.com/news/lithium-stocks-livent-albemarle-earnings-due-as-ev-makers-jockey-for-supply/) **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)) traded down 2.7% and are falling further below a 138.56 buy point. **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) jumped almost 7% and is now out of buy range beyond a 33.54 cup-with-handle entry. **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) [tumbled more than 16%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ftnt-stock-fortinet-stock-fortinet-earnings-q2022/), breaking down below its 50-day line.


Stock Market Trend
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lost 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq moved up 0.4%, closing at its highest level since May 4. The small-cap Russell 2000 dipped 0.1%.

Top growth stocks ended modestly higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose nearly 0.4%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Global Blood Therapeutics** ([GBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBT)) soared more than 41% following a [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-03/global-blood-therapeutics-is-said-to-draw-takeover-interest) that the company is "attracting takeover interest." The company makes drugs to treat sickle cell disease.


Energy stocks continued to struggle this week, as oil prices extended losses. West Texas Intermediate dropped almost 3%, trading below $89 a barrel for the first time since mid-February. The Energy Select Sector ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) sold off 3.7%, on pace for an 8.6% weekly decline.

In a year in which it seems anything can or will happen, investors rediscovered a fact about the Donald Trump presidency: His tweets can move a stock market higher too.




With less than four weeks to go before the Nov. 3 elections, President Trump did an about-face from his prior-day announcement that no new deal would get passed through Congress to help cure the U.S. economy from coronavirus. He called upon House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to draw up a new bill that would send $1,200 checks to aid families.


This time, Wall Street responded bullishly.


The Nasdaq started the session strongly and gained 1.9%. It finished virtually at session highs. The tech-weighted composite index also marked its highest close since Sept. 3. The Nasdaq 100 also rose 1.9% and is sculpting a third straight weekly advance.


Stocks Up Broadly, Treasury Bonds Down
--------------------------------------


The S&P 500 did not run far behind, as its 1.7% gain lifted the benchmark to a four-week high. Just [four industry groups among the 197 tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) fell: auto and truck replacement parts, transport equipment, coal and super- and mini-markets. (Go to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to see more details on the best- and worst-performing industry groups.)


On the NYSE, advancing issues torched retreating ones by a nearly 3-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, the bullish breadth shined even brighter. Winners beat losers by nearly 10-to-3.


Big investors poured out of long-dated U.S. government bonds again. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rocketed 8 basis points on Monday to 0.78%, then fell two-100ths of a percentage point on Tuesday. But it gained another 5 basis points on Wednesday to 0.81%.


Where's The Volume?
-------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP102720-182x300.jpg)The Nasdaq claimed a 1% gain or more for the sixth time since Sept. 22. If volume jumped Wednesday vs. the prior session, then no doubt the day could have qualified as a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).


[No major stock market bottom since 1900](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-follow-through-day-sparked-a-market-bottom-one-century-ago/) took place without a follow-through day.


IBD analysis found that leading up to the time of Trump's discouraging late-afternoon tweet on Tuesday, turnover on the Nasdaq on Wednesday had been tracking lower. Then it really fell off the pace in the final hour of the regular session.


Yet investors who have been assiduously [building a watchlist](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) since the September correction have seen a decent number of highly rated growth stocks that have been building [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), rallying back above a key technical level such as the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/add-trading-playbook-rebound-10-week-line/) or [breaking out to new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Plus, this positive action has served to bolster the significance of a [follow-through day on Sept. 30 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gives-bullish-signal/).


What Will Drive The Stock Market Next?
--------------------------------------


Meanwhile, while the first big wave of earnings news is still at least a week away, IBD readers may want to pay close attention to signs that the job market is continuing to recover.


Thursday's latest report on weekly initial jobless claims will get plenty of focus from the institutional crowd. [(Please see the current Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), which includes the range of estimates among economists polled. Econoday also reports revisions of data reported earlier.)


Watch This Sector
-----------------


Small caps enjoyed an even bigger bounce. After reversing in nasty fashion for a 0.3% loss on Tuesday, the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund roared 2.2% higher on Wednesday. That sent the popular ETF to the highest close since Feb. 24 â€” when the IBD current outlook for stocks got a downgrade to "uptrend under pressure."


One day later, on Feb. 25, IBD's outlook sank into "correction." But after stocks bottomed on March 23, the small-cap ETF has rallied 67% from its year-to-date low of 95.69.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 1.9% on Wednesday.


After rising a solid, if not torrid, 8.4% in the July-to-September period, the ETF now holds a 3.5% gain in the fourth quarter. That tops a 1.7% gain by the S&P 500 over the same time frame.


Simply put, growth is getting back more of its mojo.


Take a look at the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) lately, and the regular IBD reader would agree that it's no longer the bastion of tech, e-commerce and specialty financial services companies like it was just months ago. More retailing and consumer spending-oriented stocks fill the list now. [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), meanwhile, has expanded to 16 half-size positions.


Solar Firms Burn The Bears
--------------------------


**JinkoSolar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)), up 17% on Wednesday in volume that ballooned more than five times its 50-day average, has made an amazing run past a 24.01 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [long, deep cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/). And it's not alone. The solar energy industry group ranks No. 1 among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD for six-month relative performance.



The move seems a bit beyond hyperbolic. And yet, one would normally look for [climax-top action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/) only after a true growth stock has climbed for at least 18 weeks since a good breakout.


Why has JinkoSolar done so well?


It simply goes beyond strong fundamentals. (Earnings per share have risen 6%, 233%, 442% and 69% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Q2 revenue rose 19% to $1.2 billion.) Currently the short interest has been huge.


[MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF)'s JinkoSolar weekly chart shows that around four days' worth of the stock's average daily volume, or roughly 9.6 million shares, have been sold short. That's more than 29% of JinkoSolar's total float of 32.6 million shares. When a stock makes 52-week or all-time highs, short sellers are forced to buy back shares and cover their short positions.


Talk about exceptional risk when it comes to [short selling](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-short-side/).

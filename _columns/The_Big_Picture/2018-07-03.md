Market Action Worsens Late, And One Indicator To Watch When Traders Return From Holiday
========================================================================================

It wasn't supposed to be a day for much stock market action Tuesday, but sellers swarmed in the final hour to make the session eventful.




The market traded most of the half session with little change as traders looked to an early close at 1 p.m. ET and the July 4 holiday Wednesday. But in the final hour Tuesday, indexes reversed lower and ended the day in bad shape.


The late slide came after news that a [Chinese court temporarily banned sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/micron-stock-china-ban/) of certain **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) chips in that country. The ruling involved a patent dispute with Taiwanese rival **United Microelectronics** ([UMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UMC)).


Micron and chip stocks sold off, and the selling spread to other sectors.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP070318-253x300.jpg)The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell the most, down 0.9%. But the composite remained above support at the 50-day moving average. That's shaping up as a critical defensive perimeter for the market.


The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fell 0.5%. Both have spent more than a week trying to get a lift off the 50-day or 200-day moving averages, and on Tuesday the S&P closed slightly below the 50 day line and the Dow below the 200-day average.


The Indicator To Watch
----------------------


After Tuesday's early close, the market had a day and a half to mull its next move. Certainly, the Dow's and S&P 500's behavior at their key moving averages will be a key element to watch.


Small caps led. The Russell 2000 climbed 0.2% even though it pared its gains. In a positive signal, the small-cap benchmark is rising from a pullback to the 50-day moving average.


Of course, the half session meant that volume was well below Monday's total. But volume was tracking higher when compared to 1 p.m. Monday. So, if Tuesday had been a normal session, it easily could have been a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the market, adding to an already swelling count.


The S&P 500 did lose its May 29 distribution day because it passed the five-week period in which distribution days are counted.


Automakers were the worst performing industry group Tuesday, down 6%, despite mainly positive June sales.

Major auto stocks have been [weakening on a multitude of troubles](https://www.investors.com/news/june-auto-sales-gm-ford-fiat-chrysler/). President Trump is aiming his trade attacks at the auto industry. Automakers also face a market glut, high vehicle prices and rising interest rates.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) reported a 55% jump in second-quarter production. The company built 5,000 Model 3 cars in the last week of June. But some analysts are skeptical that Tesla can sustain such a rate. The stock cleared the 360.60 buy point of a V-shaped base, then turned and triggered [the 7%-8% sell rule](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/). Shares have plunged more than 9% this week.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) fell more than 2%, doing no favors for the tech sector. The federal probe on the data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica has expanded to include the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, reports said.


The energy sector was mainly higher after the price of [crude oil briefly topped $75 a barrel](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/03/oil-libya-declares-force-majeure-on-supplies-demand-slowdown-looms.html) on worries about supply from Canada and Libya. But oil futures reversed lower sharply, sliding below $73 a barrel.

title: Stock Market Climbs As ECB Raises Interest Rates For First Time In 11 Years

The stock market ended higher Thursday, as investors digested a rate hike by Europe's central bank for the first time in more than a decade and worse-than-expected economic data. Next up, earnings season continues Friday, with reports due out from **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)).




The European Central Bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points Thursday morning. Expectations were for a 25 to 50 basis-point increase, though bankers had reportedly considered a larger-than-50-point hike. The increase is the bank's first in 11 years. The ECB's target deposit rate had been in negative territory since 2014.


On the economic front, the Labor Department said first-time jobless claims rose to 251,000 vs. 244,000 in the previous week. Econoday estimates had expected initial jobless claims to fall to 240,000. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing index — an indicator of industrial manufacturing trends — came in at a surprising drop of -12.3. Econoday consensus was looking for an increase of 0.4 for July. This makes it two months in a row with a negative report. June's -3.3 was the first negative report since 2008.


The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled to 2.91%, snapping a three-day winning streak and more than erasing this week's gains. Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices retreated sharply, sliding more than 3%, with West Texas Intermediate futures falling to $96 a barrel. Data Wednesday showed U.S. gasoline stockpiles rising, suggesting consumers were fatigued with high prices.


On the earnings front, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was a star performer, surging nearly 10% after [reporting strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-back-above-key-benchmark-ahead-of-q2-earnings/) late Wednesday. Other key earnings movers included **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)), **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)).


Stock Market Trend
------------------


The stock market uptrend shrugged off the ECB's rate hike and weaker-than-expected manufacturing data, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq led the way with a 1.4% advance. The tech-heavy composite rose for a third straight session and is up five of the last six days.


The S&P 500 followed up with a 1% rise, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed from solid losses to ascend 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 also gained 0.5%.


Volume dropped on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, and appeared to also fall on the NYSE.


Following Wednesday's gains, the Nasdaq has zero [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Now, the S&P 500 is losing three of its own and is down to one. The June 30, July 13 and July 14 distribution days were wiped out due to the 5% advance rule.


Top growth stocks ended higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.4%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) tumbled more than 5%, closing below its 50-day line.

Stocks To Watch: Lantheus, Quanta Services, Verra
-------------------------------------------------



Amid a stock market rally that perking up, these are among the stocks holding up the best, including **Lantheus** ([LNTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNTH)), **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)) and **Verra Mobility** ([VRRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRRM)). These three stocks boast relative strength lines at new highs, which indicates big stock market outperformance.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Lantheus gave up its 73.88 buy point Thursday, just one day after the stock broke out past the latest entry. Per Leaderboard commentary, Lantheus has proven itself one of the strongest stocks in the market currently after soaring out of a double-bottom base in February.


IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Quanta Services continues to build a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a 138.56 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Meanwhile, an [early entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) at 133.68 is also in play. It's a first-stage pattern, which IBD research shows is more likely to succeed.



Verra Mobility is trying to break out past a cup with handle's 16.83 buy point, but is just below the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) Thursday after a 0.8% rise. The stock's [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) continues to show tremendous strength as it hit a another new high this week. [Verra stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-verra-mobility-corp-vrrm.aspx) boasts a strong 96 out of a perfect 99 IBD Composite Rating, per the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)


Remember, the stock market volatility is a reason to remain conservative. But these three leaders are stocks to watch in a strengthening stock market rally.

Stocks Bounce Mildly As Market Grapples With Uncertainty
=========================================================

The stock market bounced meekly Tuesday, leaving its condition nearly as shaky as it was in Monday's sell-off. After a 2%-plus rout, a rebound was in the cards. But the 0.6% gain in the Nasdaq and the 0.3% rise in the S&P 500 were limp by comparison.

  

Volume fell on the Nasdaq, a sign that institutional investors were timid about putting more cash at work when they had the opportunity. NYSE volume, however, was higher.

  

Uncertain trading could continue this week as Greece heads to a July 5 referendum on financial reforms that its creditors have sought. Eleventh-hour attempts failed to avoid a default on a debt payment late Tuesday.

  

Although experts believe that U.S. financial institutions have little exposure to Greece's problems, the European crisis already has thrown Wall Street off track.

  

After weeks of dull action, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were making headway last week. A sense of relief seemed to come over the market as the Nasdaq hit all-time highs. Many leading stocks also started to rev up from stalled patterns.

  

But the Greek government's decision late Friday to call a referendum took global markets by surprise.

  

Even before then, the market was turning cautious; the number of distribution days kept rising, and leading stocks quickly started sputtering again.

  

The market hates uncertainty, and it's getting a large dose of it from Europe.

  

Wall Street is at a disadvantage from other measures, too.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are below their 50-day moving averages. For the Nasdaq, that position is especially noteworthy because the 50-day line provided a floor for the composite many times this year. The composite briefly reclaimed the 5000 level but closed just below it.

  

The advance-decline line for the Nasdaq has nosedived this week, breaking an encouraging trend in market breadth. The NYSE's A/D line is bending lower more steeply, as the graph on Page B4 illustrates (see the S&P 500 chart).

  

The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the main indexes have rapidly fallen to the far reaches of the distribution side.

  

But there are a few factors on which the market can continue to build on its nascent rebound.

  

The S&P 500 is testing support at the 200-day moving average this week. Earlier, the index rose from that long-term price indicator on Feb. 2 and crossed back above it on the Oct. 21 follow-through.

  

The put-call volume ratio spiked to 1.24 Monday. Such elevated levels of fear among options investors have signaled short-term market lows several times for over a year.

  

There have been few sell signals in the IBD 50 stocks. The IBD 50 on Tuesday rose 1.2%. **Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) helped a lot as it rebounded 5.4%.

  

One distribution day has now been deducted. The May 26 distribution has become too old to be relevant any longer. The 1.1% drop on the Nasdaq that day had been one of the most serious declines in higher volume.

  

A few more distribution days are due to expire in the next couple of weeks. But for the market to work off those distribution days, it will need to avoid making new ones.

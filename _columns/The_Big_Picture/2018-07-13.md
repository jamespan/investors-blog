title: Big Picture: Stocks Up Second Week In Row Despite The News

U.S. stock indexes scored gains for a second straight week, a remarkable feat considering the strange mix of news the market has had to deal with.




The Nasdaq was just above flat Friday, although it made a new high during the session. The S&P 500 inched up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4%. Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 fell 0.2%.


Volume was down on both major exchanges.


Over the past two weeks, the major indexes have gained roughly 3% to 4%.


Consider the news that the stock market has had to either shrug off or digest in the past two weeks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP071318-274x300.jpg)On July 2, Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross delivered a drop-dead message to the stock market. Rather than take pause from the market's thumbs-down on protectionism, Ross insisted that there was no level that the stock market can drop that would prompt a change in trade policy.


Other news that followed included the Federal Reserve's minutes, which showed concerns about both President Trump's tariffs and the flattening yield curve; new tariffs planned for Chinese imports that are rising beyond China's ability to match; and insults to America's NATO allies followed by Trump's insistence that he won the NATO dispute and "everybody in the room thanked me."


Banks Flop
----------


Meanwhile, banks reporting earnings were getting no thanks after topping the Street's estimates on earnings. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) and **PNC Financial Services** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)) topped views, but only PNC rose and it was a 0.2% gain.


**Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) came in under views and closed down 1%.


Money center banks since late January have been declining in a bearish pattern of lower lows.


Super-regional banks have done better, moving in a rolling sideways pattern since late January.


Retail Stocks Up
----------------


Meanwhile, select retail stocks were doing well Friday.


Home furnishings rose 2.8%, thanks in part to **RH**'s ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) 7% pop.


Specialty retail glided 1.4% higher. **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) led with a 2.8% gain, and the stock is approaching a 261.50 entry.


In the discount space, initial public offering **BJ's** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) jumped 6%. The late-June IPO has yet to sketch a base.


Technicals Improve
------------------


Technicals continued to improve in the market. The June 7 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) on the Nasdaq fell off because of time. So far this month, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have reduced their counts by two days each.


A distribution day involves a price drop in rising volume, which points to fund selling.


Earnings season will continue in the coming week. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) will report Monday. Chip equipment maker **ASML Holding** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and aluminum company **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) report Wednesday.

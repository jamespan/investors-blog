title: Stocks Wobble Their Way To Small Gains; Leadership Missing

Stocks settled for small gains Thursday, after wobbling back and forth without much conviction.


The Nasdaq banked a 0.1% gain after taking an almost 1% trip in both directions. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively.


The IBD 50 slid 1%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE.

So far, the best news for the uptrend is that the major indexes have stayed above their Jan. 20 lows despite conflicted trading.


During the past dozen sessions, the Nasdaq has pegged a handful of closes high in the day's range and several low in the range. Price action has been on the loose side.


Quality leadership also has failed to develop.


A quick review finds little on which to hang bullish hopes.


Stocks that broke out since the Jan. 20 low haven't done so well. (Because a follow-through day is a confirmation, some stocks broke out before the Jan. 26 follow-through confirmation.)


Restaurant chain **Chuy's Holdings** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)) and chipmaker **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) retook buy points but eventually triggered the 8% sell rule.


Medical equipment maker **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) cleared a 556.70 entry and is now about 1% under it.


Supercomputer maker **Cray** ([CRAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRAY)) broke out and is 6% past the 36.03 entry, making it one of the better performers.


Some stocks holding above buy points are from defensive groups: Data center real estate investment trust **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)), utility **NextEra Energy** ([NEE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEE)), water utility **Aqua America** ([WTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WTR)) and food distributor **Sysco** ([SYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYY)) have posted gains of 2% to 5%.


These gains are modest, not surprising among dividend stocks.


Bulls had pinned their hopes on recent good action from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), but the two stocks are struggling.


On Thursday, **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) cleared an 83.53 buy point in strong volume.


Overall, this continues to be an uptrend that is having difficulty proving itself.


Still, strict followers of CAN SLIM rules probably aren't hurting too much. Many of these breakouts have not risen enough to complete a full position. With small gains from buy points so far, investors should have only partial positions.


The individual investor can either quickly retreat to cash with a small loss or give the stock more time.

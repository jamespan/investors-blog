  S&P 500 Extends Losing Streak, At Critical Level Ahead Of Pivotal Jobs Report

The stock market ended mixed Thursday after a weaker-than-expected ADP jobs report. The S&P 500 closed at a key level, as Wall Street braced for the Labor Department's August jobs report Friday morning.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5% and the S&P 500 lost 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite gained nearly 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index declined 0.6%.


Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with health care and industrials the biggest losers. On the upside, the consumer discretionary, communication services and technology sectors closed higher.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That added a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the S&P 500, although its total is now only two.


Early Thursday, the ADP employment report, a gauge of private sector hiring and a precursor to Friday's jobs report, showed 99,000 jobs had been added in August. This was well below views for 140,000 and less than July's downwardly revised 111,000. This was the smallest gain since 2021.


But claims for jobless benefits fell by 4,000 from the previous week and came in lower than expected.


The 10-year Treasury yield fell more than three basis points to 3.73% — the lowest since June 28, 2023.


Early Friday, the August payroll report is expected to show 160,000 new jobs vs. July's much lower-than-expected 114,000 increase. The unemployment rate is expected to inch lower to 4.2%, per Econoday. The report is likely to influence the size of the Fed's rate cut later this month.

Stock Market Today
------------------


Inside the Dow Jones index, **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Coca Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) were among the biggest losersThursday, with declines of 1.9% apiece.


On the upside, **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) were among the five Dow gainers on the session.


[All but one of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended higher. Notably, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) jumped 4.9% to [flash an aggressive buy signal](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-china-fsd-ai-roadmap/). Microsoft was the sole decliner, down 0.1% to close further below its 200-day line.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.6% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)) is rebounding from support at the 50-day line.

What To Do Now: S&P 500 At Critical Level
-----------------------------------------


For now, the S&P 500 is critical to the stock market's immediate outlook. It closed three points below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) as it continues to test that important level of support. A clear drop below the line would surely worsen the outlook for stocks, but so far that hasn't materialized. And Friday's jobs report could be the catalyst in either direction.


The Russell 2000 also closed slightly below its 50-day line.


Amid the recent stock market weakness, IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 40% to 60%.


The current environment clearly puts investor emphasis on [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means incrementally adding and reducing exposure to stay in sync with the broad market.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list featured zero stocks, which makes sense after the current weakness. Further, there are only a handful of names appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list, suggesting there is a scarcity of buying opportunities.

Stock Market Leaders: TSMC, TransDigm, Tyler
--------------------------------------------


Still, stock market leaders to watch include **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) and **Tyler Technologies** ([TYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TYL)).


Taiwan Semi, better known as TSMC, built a cup with handle that offers a 175.45 buy point. But shares are below their 50-day line, as the relative strength line is starting to lag.


TransDigm, an aerospace components maker and an [IBD SwingTrader idea](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader), is back below a 1,369.58 buy point following last week's breakout move.


[Tyler Technologies](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tyler-stock-government-software-upgrades/), which provides IT services to government agencies, is tracing a flat base with a 593.50 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) charts. Tyler is on the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com/resources/webinars/platformFeatures?id=5034&node=p) Near Pivot list.

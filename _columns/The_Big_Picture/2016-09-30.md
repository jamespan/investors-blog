title: Stocks Recover Ground On Deutsche Bank Hopes

U.S. stock indexes Friday patched over the previous session's losses, leaving the indexes little changed for the week.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 popped 0.8% Friday, while the Dow advanced 0.9%. The IBD 50 rose 0.6%.


Volume fell on the NYSE but rose on the Nasdaq.


**Deutsche Bank** ([DB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DB)) set the market's tone for the second consecutive day — only this time the news was positive. The German bank's shares on the NYSE rocketed 14% on reports that the U.S. Justice Department would cut its settlement price from $14 billion to $5.4 billion. The proposed fine is over the mortgage-backed securities mess.


![mp093016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MP093016.jpg)On Thursday, Deutsche fell about 7% on news that some hedge funds were lightening up positions at the bank. Friday's action appeared to unwind that fear.


IBD 50 stocks were mostly up but only one stock moved in strong volume. Chip designer **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) jumped 2% to a new high. Volume was 64% above average.


The chip designer stocks are strong. The group is No. 10 of 197 industry groups in six-month price performance, according to preliminary data.


Chips have been in the top three among 33 sectors since late July.


Beyond chip stocks, the market has had difficulty — no doubt partly because the recent pullbacks in the indexes were only about 3.5% deep. That simply isn't enough to drive out the weak holders.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is encountering resistance at its 50-day line as it lags the Nasdaq.


For the week, the IBD 50 fell 0.4%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq inched up 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.


Companies reporting quarterly results in the coming week include chipmaker **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), which reports Tuesday. On Wednesday, lighting products maker **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)), **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) and **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) report.


Q3 earnings season doesn't officially begin until the week of Oct. 10, when some big banks report.


The Street is probably hoping that it has heard the last of bank flaps.


The Deutsche brouhaha puts the Justice Department in the odd position of working at cross purposes to the Federal Reserve. The Fed's intention throughout the economic recovery has been to make the big banks more stress-resistant. A $14 billion fine could ignite a panic and force Germany's government to arrange a rescue, which makes Justice's action seem more than a little odd.

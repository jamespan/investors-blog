Bullish Stunner Erases Day's Stock Losses
==========================================

Stocks dug a deep hole Thursday afternoon but then reversed in a stunning fashion.




The Nasdaq gained 0.4% after being down 3.3%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.9% and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.1%. Small caps in the Russell 2000's gauge rose less than 0.2%.


Volume faded on the Nasdaq and early figures showed lower NYSE volume.


The action was particularly impressive because the market has so little to feel good about.


Three negative items continue to weigh on the stock market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MP122718-268x300.jpg)Item 1, trade issues between the U.S. and China: Bulls got some good news recently, though it did not come with much conviction.


On Thursday, China Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said trade talks via phone were progressing.


A day earlier, Bloomberg News reported a U.S. delegation is expected in China the week of Jan. 7, though that report was based on anonymous sources and has not been confirmed.


Trade troubles are at least partly to blame for pulling the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 into bear market territory.


Item 2, the Federal Reserve: President Donald Trump as well as many market watchers fear the Fed is going too fast on rate hikes.


Yet, the Fed reduced its expectations from three to two rate hikes in 2019. The more cautious path is probably already baked into the stock market.


Item 3, the government shutdown: Historically the 20 shutdowns that have occurred since 1976 haven't been impact events for the stock market. The longest shutdown was 21 days. This shutdown will begin Day 7 on Friday.


Of the three items, the trade war probably carries the greatest risk to the economy and the stock market.


Yet, the stock market's No. 1 focus right now is the stock market itself.


Both major indexes have crossed under the bear market line of 20% off the high.


The Nasdaq fell almost 24%, while the S&P 500 dropped just over 20%. The indexes have recovered some. But until a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) appears, there's no reason to turn bullish.


IBD's follow-through day is the chief tool in identifying a new market uptrend.


In one sense, the fierce selling has been a useful development. Many stocks have been beaten up so badly that a base count reset is assured.


The difficulty is that few of those stocks have even started to build the right side of a potential base.


The successful investor always has a game plan ready for just about any contingency.


An investor's mental checklist should include three elements to look for: a stock market in a confirmed uptrend; leading industry groups; and top-performing stocks within the strongest industry groups.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, gold miners led the upside Thursday. Oil, transportation and steel took hard hits.


Groups moving up in the past three weeks include vehicle replacement parts, airlines, database software and software desktop.


Economic Data
-------------


First-time jobless claims came in at 216,000, roughly in line with expectations.


The release of new home sales for November was delayed because of the government shutdown.


Federal Housing Finance Agency's house price index for October inched up 0.3% vs. expectations for 0.2%.

Monday's session was a case of bad news and good news. The bad news was that stocks erased early gains. The good news? The Nasdaq and S&P 500 avoided a distribution day. Even better, one fell off the count for each index due to time.

  

The S&P 500 lost 0.5%, while the Nasdaq fell just under 0.2%. The Nasdaq tried to crack the 5000 barrier again but reversed in slightly higher volume.

  

Its decline was not enough to qualify as distribution. The S&P 500 also ended near its session low as volume fell 4% from Friday's level.

  

The IBD 50 snapped a six-session win streak, falling 0.3%.

  

The distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is getting lower but remains elevated. Because of this, aggressive exposure to stocks doesn't make sense. Keep exposure on the light side and keep new buys on a tight leash in case they don't work.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) gapped up early in the session after Apple Watch pre-orders impressed on Friday, but a 1.2% gain faded to a loss of 0.2% by the close. Volume was light. Apple's chart still looks good, however, as it works on a flat base with a 133.70 entry.

  

The Nasdaq was buoyed by large-cap names like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).

  

Netflix jumped more than 4% after UBS upgraded the streaming video service to buy from neutral and boosted its price target to 565 from 370. UBS cited strong international growth prospects.

  

The bulls like the fact that there's no shortage of decent-looking charts for investors to consider. The bears have some ammunition with a stubbornly high distribution-day count, plus first-quarter earnings season jitters due to a strong U.S. dollar.

  

Top-rated stocks rising in heavy volume were scarce Monday, but online ad company **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) obliged. Shares rose 3.5% in double the normal volume. The stock is back above its 50-day moving average as it works on a shallow, cup-shaped base with a 46.60 buy point.

  

It's a busy week for economic data. On Tuesday, watch for March retail sales data and the latest reading on producer prices. Later in the week, watch for the Fed beige book, March housing starts and Philly Fed manufacturing data.

  

Meanwhile, earnings reports are due Tuesday morning from the likes of **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)). **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) reports after the close.

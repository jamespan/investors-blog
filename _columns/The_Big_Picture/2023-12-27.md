The stock market decided again on Wednesday to respect the tradition of a Santa Claus rally as key averages marked new 52-week highs. Portfolio managers opted against disturbing what looks likely to be a phenomenal two-month rally since a new uptrend got confirmed on Nov. 1.




Commodities, meanwhile, acted with a bit more drama.


Light sweet oil futures, which rallied the past two straight weeks, slumped 2.2% on Wednesday. A weekly chart highlights crude oil's struggle to retake its 10-week moving average, which has been falling precipitously since the start of November.


Meanwhile, gold futures for February delivery expanded recent gains. Gold rose 0.9% to $2,088.90 per ounce. According to Dow Jones, the December-expiring gold contract on the Comex exchange made a record high of $2,081.90.


Going back to the stock market, the breadth of the advance continued to improve as the Nasdaq composite, Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 each climbed between 0.1% and 0.2%. Winners outpaced losers on the Nasdaq by nearly 5-3 and nearly 9-5 on the New York Stock Exchange.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, boosted by nine of its 30 components gaining 1 point or more. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) led the way. Goldman's 2.87-point move higher, or nearly 0.8%, caught the attention of the [IBD Live panel](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) during Wednesday's show. The small-cap Russell 2000 matched the Dow's rise.


GS stock has traded tightly for eight straight days after a two-day rally on Dec. 13-14 in which the stock jumped 8.7%. Put another way, it's built a handle on a long base, pinpointing a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 386.20.


Behind The Stock Market Strength: Keep Watching Interest Rates
--------------------------------------------------------------



Goldman and other Wall Street brokers look poised to reap the benefits of lower interest rates, a critical factor in the nearly breathtaking run by equities lately.


The yield curve in the Treasury market remains unfavorably inverted. That is, the return on short-term government debt, such as 3-month T-bills and 2-year Treasury notes, remains higher than a key benchmark for lending, the 10-year bond.


When rates on shorter-term bond instruments are higher than they are on the longer end, this unusual phenomenon discourages banks from making loans. However, third-quarter results by U.S. banks generally pointed to mild loan growth. They seemed to have also reported just minor increases in nonperforming loans.

Yields Keep Falling
-------------------


Plus, the yields on all three bonds noted above have come down sharply.


On Nov. 1, the 3-month, 2-year and 10-year bonds finished at 5.57%, 4.95% and 4.77%, respectively. On Wednesday, the yields closed at 5.44%, 4.20% and 3.79%, according to U.S. Treasury data.


So, the inversion in bond yields is still sticky. However, the CME FedWatch survey of bond traders is now seeing a high chance that the Federal Reserve will preemptively act to thwart a potential slowdown in the economy by trimming short-term interest rates.


From March 2022 through July 2023, the fed funds rate on overnight loans to major banks shot from a 0%-0.25% target range to 5.25%-5.5%. This rise was historic.


As of Wednesday, CME found that the probability of at least a quarter-point cut in the fed funds rate at the upcoming March 19-20 meeting has now risen to 90.3%. The chance of the central bank simply holding rates steady? Less than 10%.


The Fed held rates steady at its three prior meetings from September through mid-December.


Go out three months to June, and CME finds a small yet significant probability — almost 25% — that the fed funds rate could fall to at least the range of 4.25%-4.5%. That's one full percentage point below the current target. It means a lot for corporations that borrow to fund new investments, buy back stock, pay a dividend, or acquire other companies. All of these decisions have long-range impact on the future direction of the stock market.

Forecasts: Always Data Dependent
--------------------------------


Of course, these forecasts can swing dramatically. They could get influenced by fresh economic data that shows the rate of inflation won't keep pulling lower and toward the Fed's long-stated objective of 2% over the long haul.


Yet recent information on the job market, manufacturing, and prices at the consumer and wholesale levels have given investors a lot of confidence that the Fed is winning the battle for stable prices without harming the economy.


Some bullish stock market observers have dubbed it the "immaculate disinflation."


On Wednesday before the stock market open, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index showed a bigger than expected drop to -11 in December, well below the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of -6. A reading below zero indicates weakening conditions for factories in the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank's region.


With just two more trading sessions left in 2023 ahead of the three-day New Year's holiday, there likely won't be any earth-moving economic data this week. Weekly jobless claims come out early Thursday. In January, the stock market will greet fresh news on the jobs market for December as well as the latest on consumer prices.


Through Wednesday, the Nasdaq 100 has really shined with a gain of 54.5% since Jan. 1. It truly would be a stretch to expect such meaty advances in 2024 and beyond. Corrections often arrive when the stock market goes well beyond 8% annual gains. And part of that increase comes in the form of dividends. After a strong run-up by the S&P 500, now up 24.5% year to date, its annualized dividend yield has shrunk to 1.45%.


The Trader's Almanac View
-------------------------


With the major elections set for 2024, what has stock market history shown?


Jeffrey Hirsch and Christopher Mistal note in the newly published Stock Trader's Almanac for 2024 that "average election year gains for the Dow of approximately 7%-8% from today's levels around 34,000 would put the Dow at about 36,500 by the end of 2024. A similar move from 36,000 at year-end 2023 would put the Dow over 38,000, near our forecasted 'Super Boom' level of 38,820."


On Wednesday, the Dow industrials finished at a record close of 37,656.


Hirsch adds that since 1900, the Dow has shown an average gain of 8.8% in election years when a sitting president runs for reelection. The gain rises to 9.9% since 1950. And when an election does not feature a sitting president, the market's performance is poor. In such years since 1949, the S&P 500 has shown a 1.9% average yearly loss.


"The market hates uncertainty, and with a sitting president running, there is a good chance (that) market, economic and civic conditions will likely remain unchanged," Hirsch and Mistal wrote. "2024 has that power of incumbency going for it."

Stocks ended off their session lows, but leading stocks were hard hit Monday.

  

The Nasdaq fared the worst Monday. It dropped 1.2%, but ended above support at its 50-day line. At Monday's low, the tech-heavy index was down as much as 2%, erasing gains since the start of the new uptrend Feb. 11.

  

The S&P 500 trimmed a 0.9% loss to 0.5%. It bounced back after finding support near the 1850 level. Helped by **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), the Dow Jones industrials fell a scant 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1.3%.

  

Losers beat winners by about 5-to-3 on the NYSE and nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume dropped sharply on both major exchanges compared with Friday's busy session brought on by quadruple witching. Nasdaq turnover, however, was above average and above Thursday's pace.

  

The focal point of Monday's session took place in true market leaders, which showed more profit-taking. The IBD 50 tumbled 2.9% Monday, far worse than the Nasdaq and the volatile Russell 2000.

  

Medical stocks, which came under fire Friday, were again weak Monday. Biotechs **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) and **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) both slumped further below their 50-day moving averages. **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) and **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) both fell, yet found support at their 50-day moving averages.

  

Database software providers **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and **Tableau** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) also got hit. The former sliced its 50-day line, while the latter fell farther below its 50-day moving average breached Friday.

  

**Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) showed strength in the past two weeks, but sellers appeared to be taking over once again. At Monday's low, the stock nearly wiped out an 18% gain past a 48.10 buy point from a cup base.

  

Elsewhere, institutional favorite **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) breached its 50-day line with a big spike in volume.

  

With more leading stocks showing stress and a high amount of distribution days in the main market indexes, this not the time to be aggressive with new buys. Sell any stock that falls 8% below your purchase price. For stocks that you're holding, don't let a big double-digit gain get away.

  

Also, the market appeared to be favoring more defensive issues. Utilities were among Monday's best-performing industry groups. In Monday's IBD, which has rankings of all 197 industry groups (see Page B13), many utility groups made big jumps to the upside.

  

Leaders up in volume were scarce Monday, but **Antero Resources** ([AR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AR)) showed off its relative strength. The Leaderboard stock ended off its session high, but still closed 6% past a 62.14 buy point from a cup with handle.

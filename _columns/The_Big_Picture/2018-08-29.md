  Stock Market Hits New Highs, But One Signal Is Flashing Caution

Stock indexes notched new highs Wednesday, even as a psychological indicator flashed a yellow caution light.




The Nasdaq advanced 1%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the small-cap S&P 600 trailed with 0.2% gains.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE.


The yellow light came from Investors Intelligence. The bulls vs. bears survey signaled caution. The percentage of financial advisors that are bullish is now at 59.6%, the highest since January.

The S&P 500 peaked in late January and then eventually dropped about 12%.


Bulls vs. bears is a secondary indicator, which means it doesn't always work. However, it worked quite well in January.


Another psychological indicator has worked well on the sell side this year but it is not near a sell signal now. This is the current dividend yield of the Dow, a secondary indicator that is only worth considering when it is at an extreme level.


On Sept. 5, the yield hit a two-month high of 2.34% and then the yield began a steady decline.


From the Sept. 5 close to the Jan. 26 close, the S&P 500 rose almost 17%. The S&P 500's price peak on Jan. 26 came when the Dow yield hit a more than 12-month low of 1.98%. Then the market turned south.


So, this secondary indicator was spot on for the sell signal but less clear as a buy signal.


Where is the yield now? It's sitting comfortably at 2.10%, not too far above the 12-month average of 2.16%.


So, this secondary indicator is not yet at a level that would suggest trouble.


The conflict here between these two gauges is common to secondary indicators. They can and do send contradictory messages.


IBD-style investors will look at these secondary indicators, but more weight should be attached to the price and volume action of the stock market itself.


The [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count is not yet at a dangerous level. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 made new highs again, and the S&P 600 made a new closing high.


Breakouts on Wednesday included business software providerÂ **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and chip designer **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)). On Tuesday, Xilinx cleared a handle in its base.

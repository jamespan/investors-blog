  Stock Market Finishes Mixed As Small Caps Fall; Will Bulls See This New Trend Emerge?

Most investors who paid close attention to last week's signals in the stock market likely did not expect another big up day on Monday. So, the mixed session might actually turn out to be a blessing.




Smaller companies certainly underperformed in the face of a rebound in long-term interest rates Monday. While the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year government bond lifted 10 basis points to 4.66%, investors took profits in the Russell 2000, down 1.3%, and the S&P MidCap 400, off nearly 1%.


The key 10-year Treasury yield plunged nearly 30 basis points last week.


Meanwhile, a daily chart of the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) deserves a close look.


After shooting higher for five days in a row, the popular exchange traded fund for small-cap investors halted its winning streak. Volume was no doubt dull, compared with the above-average turnover witnessed in the prior three sessions.


Yet IWM ate a little bit into Friday's positive upward gap. The fund also never came close in an attempt to reclaim its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), which has been falling swiftly since Sept. 20.



Stock Market Indexes Keep Climbing
----------------------------------


However, other key equity indexes resumed last week's astounding climb. They were bolstered by comments made by the chairman of the world's leading central bank after [Wednesday's decision on interest rates](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-marks-this-bullish-shift-after-fed-chief-powells-decision-to-leave-rates-unchanged/). An [October nonfarm payrolls report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) also helped, by hinting that the red-hot jobs market is showing signs of cooling significantly.


The S&P 500 surged 5.9% last week and waged a follow-through on the fourth day of a new rally attempt on Thursday. It edged up 0.2% on Monday. The large-cap benchmark briefly tested buying support at its 50-day moving average, which may be showing signs of flattening out.


The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, staged its [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) one session earlier than the 500, rising 1.6% on Wednesday last week in accelerating volume. It gained 0.3% Monday. Its seven-day rally marks the first such instance in 2023.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 5.1% gainer last week, inched ahead 0.1%.


Meanwhile, TD Ameritrade announced Monday that its Investor Movement Index (IMX) registered at 5.64 in October, flat with September and below a 52-week high of 5.70 in August.


Joe Mazzola, director of trading and education at Charles Schwab, said in a news release that while the October reading "ranks on the low end historically, it's up significantly from this time last year at 4.25."


TD Ameritrade added that "clients were able to find opportunities in individual names and remained net buyers of equities particularly in the financial, industrial and consumer discretionary sectors." The IMX gets calculated by pulling a sample from its client base of funded accounts, including all accounts that completed a trade in the past month.

More Decliners Than Gainers
---------------------------


Breadth in the stock market was notably thin Monday. Falling stocks topped rising ones on the Nasdaq by more than a 5-3 margin. And on the New York Stock Exchange, losers led by more than 3-to-1.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP110623-1-270x300.jpg)Based on that information, one might think Monday's session was all about investors bidding up tech shares. But few tech industry groups actually led the day.


An early look showed at least 10 of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD on a daily basis rose 1% or more. They included one software industry subgroup, medical software. But the others ranged from shoe manufacturing and major discount retail chains to travel booking, diversified medical companies and soap.


While the new confirmed uptrend in the stock market is nascent, it makes sense to watch how emerging leaders handle last week's big rallies. Do they immediately surrender those gains, forcing new shareholders on their heels? Or do they absorb any sell-offs produced by those seeking profits, hold firm and eventually grind higher?


How To Get Good Stock Market Feedback
-------------------------------------


Consider the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), a key automated stock list targeting stock market leaders on Investors.com and IBD Weekly.


Some of last week's stars on the Big Cap 20 in terms of weekly gains included **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), a key digital platform for the hobby and consumer products markets. PINS was ranked No. 8 headed into Monday's action.


There also was cybersecurity giant and Leaderboard member **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), luxury automaker **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) and small- and midsize-business-oriented e-commerce platform **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)). Shopify ranked No. 19.


The average gain last week from these four stocks alone? A hefty 19.2%. And that's what you should expect from companies aiming to lead the stock market higher.


In contrast, the Nasdaq composite rose 6.6% last week while the Russell 2000 jumped 7.6%, ending a four-week slump.


Watching how the four stocks mentioned above do in the following weeks, as well as your new buys, may offer great feedback on how the new confirmed uptrend in the stock market is really faring. Facts, not opinions, give you a true signal on whether it's time to deploy more capital into your best ideas, or to proceed cautiously.

Racing To New Highs
-------------------


Ferrari's rally in 2023 served as one notable topic of discussion during [Friday's "IBD Live" show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) as it has thrived since getting spun off from Fiat Chrysler, which is now known as **Stellantis** ([STLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLA)). Ferrari cruised past a [trendline buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) near 315 last week as it put on the finishing touches on a [3-1/2 month flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/).



Notice on a weekly chart how the stock's character changed last week as RACE zoomed 11% higher for the week. Weekly volume surged to the highest amount since the week ended Feb. 3.


Fundamentals at the Italian sports car maker have accelerated. You often tend to see this in leading stock market winners, particularly near the start of their awesome price runs.


Ferrari's earnings per share dipped 2% to $1.30 in the fourth quarter of 2022, then rose 23%, 40% and 60% vs. year-ago levels in the next three quarters through Q3 of this year. Revenue climbed 10%, 18%, 19% and 33% over the same time frame.

One Statistic To Watch Daily
----------------------------


Speaking about facts, it's true that even though the Nasdaq and S&P 500 sport healthy double-digit gains, stocks generally have a tough time breaking out to new highs and keeping their short-term gains. But is the new highs list signaling a potential change?


With Friday's session, [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) showed that a combined 135 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE rose to 52-week or all-time highs. Just 49 made new lows. That's the kind of positive ratio you want to see when going long in the stock market.


On the [New Highs list at Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-nov-03-2023/), you can see which sectors house the most stocks making new highs by simply clicking on the phrase "New Highs."


On Friday, the Software, Retail and Consumer sectors ranked highest.Â This is a pleasant divergence from what's been happening over the prior six weeks.


MarketSmith analysis shows that on the NYSE, the 10-day average of stocks making new lows recently breached 250 vs. roughly 20 stocks per day making new highs. But that gap has started to narrow, even if just by a little.


Meanwhile, new lows on average sailed past 400 each day last week on the Nasdaq, compared with roughly 20 companies making new highs. You can track these statistics by going to the daily charts of "NYEXG" and "NASDQ."

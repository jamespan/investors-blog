Nasdaq, Small Caps Lead Sell-Off After Powell Hints At Longer Inflation Fight
==============================================================================

Will the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 begin a fourth leg down?




Judging by how stocks ended Wednesday, that likelihood increased sharply.


Heavy selling across the board during the final 90 minutes of trading highlighted how the current uptrend is still fragile. The Nasdaq composite dropped almost 3.4% on the day. Volume spiked and was 16% higher vs. Tuesday's total.


Ditto for the small-cap Russell 2000, which also retreated 3.4%, and the S&P 500, off 2.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost almost 1.6%. A four-point gain by component **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), good for a 2.8% advance and a jump back above the 50-day moving average, helped buffer the Dow's slide.


NYSE turnover also bulged.


Simply put, such negative price-and-volume action pointed clearly to heavy institutional selling.


Defensive areas of the market did not provide much relief. SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) fell almost 1%, reversing from an early gain of as much as 1.8%.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones transportation average slid more than 3.1%. Its moves hint at investors' feelings about the general economy. The Dow transports fell back below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and the index is now down almost 21% since Jan. 1.



Nasdaq Returns Its Post-Follow-Through Rally
--------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP110222--215x300.jpg)As seen in the accompanying Market Pulse, the actual number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or bouts of pronounced selling, remains low. But at 10,524, the Nasdaq effectively gutted all of its mild gains since a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-roars-back-to-life-amid-new-fed-hopes-these-stocks-shine-brightest/) took place on Oct. 21.


Due to this round trip of gains, plus continued checkered action among leading stocks and new breakouts, IBD's market outlook gets a fresh downgrade to "uptrend under pressure."


This means individual investors can raise cash quickly to avoid further downside. New buys should be made with the utmost care. As Wednesday's session showed, a majority of stocks followed the sharp drop by the indexes. At this stage of the market's cycle, it makes sense to keep exposure in stocks to no more than 20% of the total portfolio. An even smaller ratio? It's well justified.


The Federal Reserve was widely expected to make its fourth straight three-quarter-point hike in the fed funds rate, and the announcement at 2 p.m. ET made it official. The rate on overnight loans to large banks rose to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest since January 2008.


The Nasdaq and fellow equity indexes initially erased moderate losses and moved higher after the U.S. central bank's statement acknowledged that in deciding on the size of future rate increases, it would take into account several factors: the "cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."


However, [Fed chief Jerome Powell signaled at a news conference](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-hints-of-coming-pivot-sp-500-rises-with-powell-up-next/) roughly half an hour after the statement release that the "terminal interest rate" where the Federal Reserve would halt interest-rate hikes would be higher than originally thought. The original thinking among Fed officials held that it would be around 4.6%. Now it appears 5% could be closer to that peak in short-term rates.


With the fed funds rate now ranging between 3.75% and 4%, the [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html), which tracks futures activity, showed a 56.8% probability that the central bank will opt for a half-point rise to 4%-4.25% at its last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. Chances for a 75-basis point jump to 4.5%-4.75% fell to 43.2% from 49.7% on Tuesday.


The first rate hike in 2022 took place on March 16, when the Fed raised the fed funds rate to a 0.25%-0.5% range.


State Of The Nasdaq And S&P 500 Chart
-------------------------------------


Technically, the Nasdaq faced a key test of overcoming its 50-day moving average, which has been slowly falling again since the middle of September. Wednesday's decline made the failure of that test eminently clear.


The Nasdaq's rally is still alive, but it would take only a 4.2% drop from here for the composite index to undercut its Oct. 13 low of 10,089.



The S&P 500 appears to be in a little better shape. Yet Wednesday's drubbing yanked the large-cap benchmark back below key levels, including its own 50-day moving average.


In three major declines since topping in December at 4818, the index has fallen roughly 15%, 22% and 19%. These sell-offs have kept the S&P 500 in a bear-market-style downtrend of lower highs and lower lows.


Earnings Challenges
-------------------


Meanwhile, quarterly results continue to spur heavy selling in the tech sector.


While biotech and big pharmaceutical companies have on the whole done very well amid Q3 earnings season, software and semiconductor firms are still having a rough time.


Nasdaq-listed large-cap tech and cybersecurity firm **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), a solid winner after the stock market bottomed in late March of 2020, has been in basing mode since peaking in the final week of 2021. [The company edged Wall Street top- and bottom-line estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ftnt-stock-fortinet-earnings-fortinet-stock-q32022/), but its future billings forecast only met views. Shares dropped 15% after-hours on its quarterly results and undercut a near-term low of 45.74.



Notice on a weekly chart how the stock has had a tough time trying to sustain a rebound back above the 40-week moving average, a key technical level. The 40-week line represents the average closing price over the past 40 weeks and mimics the movement of the 200-day moving average on a daily chart.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond yield moved nominally. It rose less than 1 basis point to 4.05%.

Only These Industry Groups Rose
-------------------------------


Among the 197 industries tracked each day by IBD, just five industry groups rose on Wednesday. The tiny retail and wholesale office supplies group rallied 4.5%, a true anomaly in the day's brutal sell-off. Also up for the day: funeral services, computer hardware and peripherals, drug store chains and wholesale drug and supply firms.

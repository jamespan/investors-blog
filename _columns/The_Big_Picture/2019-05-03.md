Small caps and the Nasdaq led the stock market Friday, though volume on both major exchanges fell.




The Nasdaq rushed ahead 1.6% and made a new closing high, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% and 0.7%, respectively. Small caps led the session as the Russell 2000 spurted 2% higher.


The Russell, which has lagged the major indexes, punctured resistance going back to February at the 1600 level.


Volume was down about 5% on the Nasdaq. NYSE volume also fell, according to preliminary data.

Strength was evident and broadly based. Advancing issues led declining issues by a 7-2 ratio on the NYSE and by about 15-to-3 on the Nasdaq.


Jobs Numbers Lift Mood
----------------------


Economic data provided the initial thrust to the stock indexes. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 263,000 — about 46% more than expected. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.6%, the lowest level going back to October 1969.


Another boost to the stock market came from Warren Buffett. In a CNBC interview late Thursday, Buffett said **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)) has been buying shares of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


This was good news for more than just Amazon's sake. The online retailer has surged 174% since a follow-through June 30, 2016 confirmed a new market uptrend was underway. (For more about why one portfolio manager considers 2016 the start of a major bull market that is still underway, see IBD's [cover story](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-outlook-2019-new-bull-market/).)


The interesting thing here is that Buffett's team sees grounds for long-term optimism on Amazon stock despite those already huge gains.


Toss in Berkshire's big stake in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and the firm's long-term optimistic bent is confirmed. That optimism appeared to spill over into the general market.


MercadoLibre Roars
------------------


On Friday, Amazon rose 3.2% in volume 51% above average. The stock is closing in on a 2,050.60 buy point.


**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) joined the party with an even bigger whoop. The Latin American online retailer jumped 20% in heavy volume.


Other stocks making aggressive moves up included software security play **Zix** ([ZIXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIXI)), up 34.6%; and infrastructure products provider and November initial public offering **Arcosa** ([ACA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACA)), up 23.6%. Both reported earnings.

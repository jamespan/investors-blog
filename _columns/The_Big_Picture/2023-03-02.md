title: Stock Market Advances Even As 10-Year Treasury Yield Tops 4%; Salesforce Stages Breakaway Gap

The stock market ended higher and near sessions highs Thursday, as the [10-year Treasury yield closed above 4%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/10-year-treasury-yield-tops-4-for-first-time-since-november-d043cc) for the first time since November. Dovish comments from a top Fed official helped turned the market around.




Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic helped boost stocks to session highs, saying he is "firmly" in favor of staying with quarter-point interest-rate hikes.


While the stock market took the comments favorably, the bond market had little response. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.07%, on pace to extend a weekly win streak to six.


Initial weekly unemployment claims dropped to 190,000 vs. 192,000 in the previous week. They were expected to rise to 200,000, according to Econoday estimates. The sustained strength in the labor market is adding to market fears that the Federal Reserve could keep hiking interest rates for longer.


As the struggling stock market uptrend still tries to find its footing, there are leading stocks in or near buy zones, including Dow Jones leader **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), [IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)).


Jobless Claims, Earnings Results
--------------------------------


On the earnings front, **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)), **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), **DoubleVerify** ([DV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DV)), **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)), **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)), **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and**Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) were key movers in both directions.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP030223-217x300.jpg)Best Buy shares declined more than 2%, while Celsius reversed from sharp losses to end with a 6.3% advance. DoubleVerify shares jumped 4.8%, and Okta surged more than 13%. Snowflake tumbled 12.4% after its [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snow-stock-snowflake-earnings-snowflake-stock-q42022/) included a revenue outlook well below expectations. Splunk slashed losses to just a fraction, while Veeva Systems jumped 4.5%.


And **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) dived nearly 6% after the company's [disappointing investor day](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-investor-day-whats-on-tap-for-elon-musks-big-master-plan-3-party/) put off the unveiling of a next-generation vehicle until a "later date."


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly 1.1% and the S&P 500 rose 0.8%. The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 followed up with a 0.2% gain.


The Nasdaq's reversal caused it to regain its 200-day moving average, while the S&P 500 bounced off the 200-day line.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE from the prior session.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 0.1% Thursday as the ETF of top growth stocks continued to find support around the 50-day line.


In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) jumped 8%, adding to Wednesday's 22% earnings-fueled surge past a 105.56 cup-with-handle buy point.


Amid recent weakness, IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains in an "uptrend under pressure," which means investors should focus on managing risk in the face of a difficult market environment. Given the market's volatility, it makes sense to have a more conservative exposure level ranging from 40% to 60%.


Still, the market uptrend isn't over yet, so keep an eye out for new market leadership that could emerge, like Duolingo, and stocks that continue to hit new highs, like First Solar.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: First Solar, Palo Alto, Salesforce
-----------------------------------------------------------------


This week, First Solar shares vaulted past a 185.38 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a consolidation and hit a new high, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares finished Thursday just out of the 5% buy zone that went up to 194.65.


First Solar specializes in manufacturing thin-film solar panels designed for high efficiency. Companies use them mainly in utility-scale solar operations and some commercial installations.


[IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) Palo Alto Networks is closing in on a 193.01 buy point following [last week's earnings-fueled rally](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/panw-stock-palo-alto-earnings-q42022/). Shares are just 2% away from its entry. The stock is close to adding a handle, which would slightly lower the risk-optimal entry.


Meanwhile, the company has spent more than $3.4 billion making 10 acquisitions over the past three years. With roots in the "firewall" network security market, Palo Alto aims to build a broad, cloud-based security platform. Firewall appliances protect computer networks by blocking online intrusions and monitoring web-based apps.

Dow Jones leader Salesforce staged a bullish breakaway gap past a 178.94 buy point on [strong Q4 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-earnings-salesforce-stock-q42022/). Shares surged 11.5% Thursday.


Salesforce sells software under a subscription model. Its software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. The company has expanded into marketing, customer services and e-commerce. Salesforce said it has disbanded its "M&A committee," implying it will make no more big acquisitions, amid growing pressure from activist investors.

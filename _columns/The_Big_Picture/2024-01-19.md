  Stock Market Rallies As S&P 500 Hits Record High; Inflation Data, Earnings Deluge Loom

The stock market ended the shortened week with a flourish as the S&P 500 posted its first record close in more than two years. But more inflation data and a flood of earnings reports loom in the coming week.




Major indexes are continuing to look strong. The Nasdaq composite ended Friday with a muscular 1.7% gain, a big contribution to its weekly lift of 2.3%. It now has risen in 11 out of the past 12 weeks and is sitting pretty above its short-term [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The tech-heavy index is now up about 2% in January but remains shy of its 2021 highs for now.


The benchmark S&P 500 rose 1.2% for the day, hitting an all-time high in the process. It also rose more than 1% for the week, its 11th weekly gain out of the past 12. It climbed higher into positive territory for 2024. This is important, as when the benchmark index ends January with a gain it tends to auger well for the stock market.

Like the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed strength with a gain of more than 1%, also setting a record. Insurer **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) outperformed here after reporting strong earnings while **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) lagged.


Small caps also partook in the bullish stock market party, with the Russell 2000 rising 1%. A key point is the index held support at the 1,900 level, which previously was an area of resistance. Growth stocks also popped, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund ended the session up 1%.


Inflation Data, More Earnings On Tap
------------------------------------


Strong retail sales and jobless claims figures this week underlined continuing economic resilience even as the level of inflation eases.


More key inflation data is due in the coming week, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index reading for December due from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday. Core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is seen rising 3% year over year.


Other economic information set to drop includes U.S. Purchasing Managers Index data for services as well as manufacturing, with both due Wednesday. The preliminary fourth-quarter GDP reading comes Thursday.


Meanwhile, earnings season is beginning to intensify. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and chip-equipment firms such as **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) are among the key companies reporting in the coming week.

These Stock Market Areas Shine
------------------------------


Sectors in the [S&P 500 closed Friday in mostly positive territory](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Technology and financials made the best gains while utilities and consumer staples, both defensive areas, lagged.


As ever, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups offered a more granular view of the action in the [stock market today.](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)


Chip equipment and fabless plays, consumer-loan stocks, foreign banks and electronic consumer products firms all impressed. But the computer hardware group was strongest, aided by an outstanding post-earnings jump from **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)). It ended the day with a mammoth gain of 35.9%.


On the other side of the coin, educational software firms, food wholesalers, managed care plays and cable stocks all lagged.

Stocks slid Tuesday after the Federal Reserve sent a chill down Wall Street's spine.


The market, which has climbed for years thanks largely to the Fed's easy-money strategy, suddenly found itself in the central bank's cross hairs.


A Fed report accompanying Chairwoman's Janet Yellen testimony before the Senate Banking Committee warned that "equity valuations of smaller firms as well as social media and biotechnology firms appear to be stretched."

The Russell 2000 skidded 1%. The biotech industry group slid 3%. But Facebook (NASDAQ:[FB](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-facebook-inc-cl-a-fb.htm)), Twitter (NYSE:[TWTR](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-twitter-inc-twtr.htm)) and LinkedIn (NYSE:[LNKD](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-linkedin-corp-class-a-lnkd.htm)) fell modestly.


The comments — reminiscent of Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" admonition in late 1996 — sent stocks reeling.


Yellen did have some encouragement for the market. She noted that stock, real estate and corporate bond values aren't getting out of hand. She also sees the economy growing at "a moderate pace over the next several years." That suggested the Fed will keep monetary policy relatively loose. (See story on Page A1.)


Indexes trimmed losses, but the Nasdaq still fell 0.5% and the S&P 500 shed a hair less than 0.2%.


The result was a distribution day for the Nasdaq. The June 9 stalling day, the first instance of distribution after the May 27 follow-through, is now too far back on the Nasdaq chart to mean anything.


That leaves the S&P 500 and Nasdaq with five distribution days each. That's plenty of institutional selling in recent weeks to cause individual investors to keep their feet just above the brake pedal.


Tuesday's losses came at a bad time for some leading stocks that are trying to build cushions from their buy points, such as Foot Locker (NYSE:[FL](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-foot-locker-inc-fl.htm)) and Actavis (NYSE:[ACT](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-actavis-plc-act.htm)).


Yet, more than 15 stocks on the IBD 50 have managed to rise above their buy ranges and are now extended. About 10, however, have slipped below their entries.


The IBD 50 tumbled 1.3% Tuesday. Michael Kors (NYSE:[KORS](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-michael-kors-hldgs-ltd-kors.htm)) alone accounted for much of the poor performance. Barclays, Citi and Sterne Agee cut their share-price targets, citing increasing discounts at the luxury goods company.


Retail stocks generally fell after the government reported that retail sales rose 0.2% last month, missing expectations.


Transportation and financial stocks were bright spots.


Crude oil prices closed below $100 a barrel for the first time in two months. No wonder airlines and truckers rose, but the energy sector was broadly weaker on the news. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:[JPM](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-j-p-morgan-chase-and-co-jpm.htm)) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:[GS](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-goldman-sachs-group-inc-gs.htm)) each beat second-quarter views. Shares of both banks jumped in heavy volume.

Stocks Extend Dull Trading, As Some Key Breakouts Sputter
==========================================================

The stock market closed nearly flat Monday, extending a pause that's keeping growth investors perhaps a bit frustrated.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1%. Indexes traded in a narrow price range all day, and whatever gains existed in the afternoon faded in the final half hour.


Volume was way down after Friday's quadruple witching session, when the expiration of options and futures causes stock trading to swell.


Monday's session added to a trend of dull activity in the broad market. Since the Sept. 12 near-term high, indexes have been rangebound. The Nasdaq basically has traded between 8085 and 8240.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP092319-1-261x300.jpg)The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is manageable: three each on the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Indexes are holding above their 50-day moving averages. Market breadth remains good. In short, there are no clear signs of market top.


It's not necessarily bad for the market to get stuck in a rut. Stocks need to moderate themselves after producing gains.


Growth Lags In Stock Market
---------------------------


But the problem for IBD-style investors is that their favorite asset class is out of favor right now. The Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) is down 1.8% since market all-time peak on July 26, and the Russell 1000 Value ETF is off 0.3% — this, after growth was easily beating value. That lead is shrinking.


While the major indexes go horizontal, leading stocks generally are underperforming.


The IBD 50 is 13% off its 52-week high, compared with just 1% or 2% for the major indexes. The IBD 50 — up 0.2% Monday — is battling to hold above its 200-day moving average, and its 50-day average is sloping lower.


No surprise, many IBD 50 stocks are struggling to find their form.


**Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) gave back everything from Friday's [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past a 50 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It's a bad sign when a stock closes below the lowest price of the [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) day. The mortgage insurance firm remains in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


**Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) sputtered after its Sept. 6 breakout but bounced Monday after a Piper Jaffray analyst [initiated coverage with an overweight rating](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-stock-back-to-buy-point-analyst-sees-share-gains/). **Hexcel** ([HXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HXL)), **Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)), **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) are other top stocks slow to follow through on breakouts.


Stock Market Breakouts That Are Working
---------------------------------------


But a handful of breakouts are working out among top-rated stocks. Those include **AudioCodes** ([AUDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AUDC)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) and retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)).



The good news is that if the market can get off the couch, several top stocks are forming bases and could surge past [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) once they get some market winds in their backs. Those include **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) and **NMI** ([NMIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMIH)) and a few other financials that made it into [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) as part of a sector rotation.


The [quality of bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) is mixed, however. **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)) are trading mainly below the 50-day moving average. That makes for weak chart construction.


With the market dull, there was little leadership Monday.


Retail was the top sector, with discount chains, apparel, specialty and consumer electronics industry groups posting gains of 1.3% to 2.8%. The consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors also displayed relative strength.


Semiconductors also were higher than most. The Philadelphia semiconductor index climbed 1.1%.

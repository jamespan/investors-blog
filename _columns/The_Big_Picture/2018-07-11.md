title: Tariff Threats Penalize Stocks: 4 Key Risks To The Year's Current Gains

Renewed tariff threats and tit-for-tat penalties on imports between the U.S. and its key economic partners shoved stocks lower across the board on Wednesday. Tech issues, multinational giants, small caps: It didn't matter.




The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5% as semiconductor-related stocks were drenched by sellers. IBD's semiconductor equipment industry fell the hardest among all 197 industry groups, according to preliminary figures. The group fell more than 3%.


The S&P 500 dropped 0.7% while the Dow Jones industrial average, hurt by steep falls in its energy and industrial components, sank nearly 0.9%. The S&P SmallCap 600, one of the market's leaders so far in 2018, fell nearly 0.8%.


A 5% slide in U.S. crude oil futures slapped the entire energy sector. At least five oil and coal-related industry groups dropped 2% or more. Other commodity groups, including metal ores, chemicals and gold mining, also paced the market's decline with losses of 2% or more.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP_6x3_071118-229x300.jpg)Volume rose mildly on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session. This means the Nasdaq notched its sixth day of distribution, or pronounced institutional selling, over the past 25 sessions.


A market uptrend can survive the occasional harsh sell-off. Such declines keep investors honest and prevent stock prices from getting overly frothy.


NYSE turnover edged 3% lower.


The First Risk
--------------


The average size of the Nasdaq's six recent distribution days: -0.6%. In other words, some of the sell-offs have been significant, such as the 1.5% decline on June 27. However, they've also been mild enough to prevent the leading index from making the sort of correction that we saw in early February and in late March.


At its June 28 near-term low, the Nasdaq dropped no more than 5% below its all-time peak of 7806. The market would have to fall at least 10% to sink into an intermediate correction. More distribution days such as that one on June 28, the 0.9% retreat on June 21, or Wednesday's drop would further tilt the market toward a correction. In other words, it may take less than a 10% decline to put the market in a true correction.


The Nasdaq likely needed a break. It rose as much as 3.6% in the prior four-session advance. The advance-decline lines of both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 had been soaring. Tuesday, losers beat winners by a nearly 2-1 margin on Nasdaq, more than a 5-2 margin in the NYSE.


The Second Risk
---------------


It's all but certain that China will retaliate immediately if the Trump administration follows through on a plan to place a 10% tariff on another $200 billion in Chinese imports. A 25% tariff on some $34 billion worth of China goods went into effect on Friday. This time, the broader tariff plan would impact a much wider swath of consumer goods.



No wonder, then, that leading companies such as flooring products chain **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) and furniture and kitchen goods retailer **Williams & Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) got knocked so hard on Wednesday.


If more tariffs come into fruition, one has to wonder how consumer spending and behavior could change. The potential effects of inflation on everyday goods and big-ticket items should not be ignored. Energy costs in the U.S. are up, thanks in part to the surprising rise in crude oil this year. Consumption is said to make up two-thirds of the U.S. GDP, which grew just 2.2% in the first quarter of 2018.


Two More Market Risks
---------------------


True market leaders, in general, are still holding up. Just view the chart action of names such as **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) and **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) in the apparel and retail e-commerce space; **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) in the arenas of small business and financial transactions; [IBD Leaderboard name](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)) in China; and **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)), the chicken wing chain that was recently featured in [IBD's Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


But if the top leading stocks in screens such as [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), Sector Leaders and Global Leaders show big drops in heavy volume, you're getting an immediate sign that the savvy funds on Wall Street are locking in gains and raising cash. It never pays to defy the market.


Finally, has Wall Street gotten more complacent about the risks of anti-free-market policies? So far, no. Bullishness among newsletter editors polled each week by Investors Intelligence hasn't hit the 60% level for months. The put-call volume ratio rose to 0.95 on Wednesday, indicating that pessimism among options players is still healthy. But the CBOE Market Volatility Index is still relatively muted.

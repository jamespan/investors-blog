The stock market got a head start Friday after **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) jumped on earnings reports. Investors, though, didn't buy into the tech rally until late in the day.




The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.5%, thanks mainly to the thrust of the tech giants' post-earnings moves. Apple, Amazon and Facebook combine for more than 20% of the Nasdaq's weighting, and their shares climbed by 3.7% to 10.5%.


That explained why the Nasdaq outperformed even as losers led winners by about 2-to-1. On the NYSE, it was losers by about 9-7. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), another weighty Nasdaq component, fell 3.3% but bounced off its 50-day moving average. Analysts [expressed concerns about the company's ad revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-google-stock-googl-q22020/).


Big Techs Impress Stock Market
------------------------------


"In July, we wrote about tech stocks' relatively high bar for the quarter. But boy, did they deliver," Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, wrote in a report. "Results show that market leadership from the big tech companies can remain intact." Technology Q2 earnings are relatively strong vs. the S&P 500's estimated drop of 41.9%, and the sector is one of the few expected to have positive growth by Q4, Bell added.


![MP073120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP073120-252x300.jpg)While the Nasdaq held gains most of the day, other indexes were lackluster for much of Friday. Buyers didn't really come in until the last two hours of trading. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% after an uneven session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed higher, up 0.4%.


If institutional money was flowing into big caps, small caps paid a price. The Russell 2000 fell 1%.


The late buying didn't carry over to breakouts. About a dozen stocks topped [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But most faded by the close, including **Grocery Outlet** ([GO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GO)), **Credit Acceptance** ([CACC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CACC)) and **Hub Group** ([HUBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBG)). Some lacked volume on the breakout.


**Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)) did impress. It broke out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), rising 9.7% in heavy volume on a rumored buyout.


One factor weighing on the stock market was a stalemate in Congress on a new coronavirus aid bill. Talks continued late Friday, and the battle could remain an influence on Wall Street.


Four Events To Watch
--------------------


Four other events in the coming week will influence the stock market:


* [Earnings reports continue](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/five-software-leaders-including-fastly-stock-hold-gains-bullishly-ahead-of-earnings/). **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **BioMarin Pharmaceuticals** ([BMRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMRN)), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) are some to watch.
* The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are in trading ranges, so watch if they move above or below those. The S&P 500 traded between 3200 and 3280 the past seven sessions. The Nasdaq is in a three-week range between 10,182 and 10,839.
* The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is getting high on the S&P 500, and it will be at least a couple of weeks until any get old enough to drop off the count. Hence, there's potential for a dangerous buildup of distribution.
* The [July unemployment report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) comes out Friday as a key gauge of the coronavirus recovery. June saw a surprise jump of 4.8 million new jobs and a jobless rate of 11.1%.

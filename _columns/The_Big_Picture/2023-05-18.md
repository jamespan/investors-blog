The stock market ended higher Thursday, as the Nasdaq led the way with strong gains. The tech-heavy composite hit a new 2023 high, closing at its highest level since Aug. 19, 2022.




The stock market uptrend features a number of leading stocks in or near buy zones, with more added this week. **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are some of the most recent breakouts.


Economic Data, Earnings Movers
------------------------------


Early Thursday, the Labor Department said initial jobless claims dropped to 242,000, more than the expected fall to 255,000 vs. 264,000 in the previous week, per Econoday estimates. Also, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index for May improved more than expected, with a -10.4 reading compared to the Street's forecast of -20.0 vs. April's -31.3 reading.


On Thursday, key earnings reporters included **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Canadian Solar** ([CSIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSIQ)).


Dow Jones-listed Walmart rose 1.3% Thursday after the [company reported strong quarterly earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/why-does-walmart-have-the-edge-on-target-walmart-stock/) results and lifted its full-year profit outlook.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP051823-222x300.jpg)BABA stock tumbled 5.5% after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported fiscal fourth-quarter results early Thursday. Canadian Solar shares climbed nearly 4% on better-than-expected first-quarter results, retaking its 50-day line.


[Cisco Systems](http://investors.com/news/technology/csco-stock-cisco-earnings-cisco-stock-q12023/), also one of the 30 Dow industrials, reported April-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates. The company's outlook for its current quarter edged by views. CSCO stock reversed from sharp losses to move up 1.2%.


Stock Market Today: Nasdaq Hits New High
----------------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, adding to Wednesday's climb that saw the index retake its 50-day line. The S&P 500 moved up 0.9%, also making a new 2023 high. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced 1.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.6%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be slightly lower on the NYSE vs. the prior session. The Nasdaq's [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell to zero after the May 2 and May 3 days dropped off the count due to the 5% rally rule. The S&P 500's count remains elevated, at six.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed nearly 1.4%, closing back above its 50-day line. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) jumped 6.7%, hitting a new high.


There was broader participation in Thursday's advance. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) climbed 0.8% and First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) rallied 1.6%. On the NYSE and Nasdaq, advancers totaled about 10% more than decliners.


[Wednesday's bullish action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-another-bullish-step-can-it-overcome-these-3-obstacles/) on the Nasdaq prompted IBD to raised its recommended market exposure to 40%-60%. With more new highs Thursday, no distribution days on the Nasdaq and a growing number of high-profile breakouts, it makes sense for investors to raise their exposure to remain in sync with the market action.


At the same time, the Nasdaq's sharp two-day rally (the first back-to-back gains of more than 1% since early February) could mean the index is due for a pullback.

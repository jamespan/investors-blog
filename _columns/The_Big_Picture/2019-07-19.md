title: Stock Market Stages Ugly Reversal

U.S. stock indexes turned a nice pop early Friday but a negative reversal in the stock market undid the gains. Stocks suffering negative reversals included **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).




The Nasdaq rose about 0.5% at the open and then took a U-turn to a 0.7% loss. Large caps as gauged in the S&P 500 severed 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.5%. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.3%.


Volume in the stock market fell on both major exchanges. Friday was an options expirations day, which normally boosts volume. But Nasdaq volume and NYSE trade fell.


The S&P 500 barely dodged [distribution, a sign of fund selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The current market uptrend, though, has been written with a fine point. The indexes have lacked boldness on the upside and downside, although the Nasdaq climbed as much as 13.3% from its June 3 low. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 seemed ready for a pause, and their 1.2% losses for the week help the market consolidate gains.


Accumulation Missing In Stock Market
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP_4x3_071919-252x300.jpg)In the weeks after the Nasdaq confirmed June 7 that a new uptrend was underway, signs of accumulation have been scarce.


Apart from the Nasdaq's 1.7% gain in rising volume on the June 7 follow-through day, only one other instance has involved a gain of 1% or more in rising volume. On June 18, the Nasdaq climbed 1.4% in emphatic volume.


Both days were clear signs of accumulation, which points to institutional buying. But what kind of fund buying only shows up in two of the past 30 sessions?


On the bearish side, the Nasdaq has booked four days of distribution, though only one of those involved a big percentage loss. The Nasdaq fell 1.5% in rising volume June 25.


While distribution doesn't need to be dramatic in order to be valid (stalling actually involves a small gain), distribution days are most negative when they are teamed with wide price spreads and closes low in the day's range.


The price spreads have not been wide and loose on most of the distribution days. Wide and loose action is a bearish sign.

On Friday, breakouts included **Skechers USA** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)), up 12%; and **TechTarget** ([TTGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTGT)), up 3%. Microsoft scored a new high but then reversed to a slight gain.


The Fed's Negative Reversal
---------------------------


The Federal Reserve staged its own reversal Friday. After remarks Thursday that suggested New York Fed President John Williams favored aggressive rate cuts, the Fed issued a statement Friday saying Williams was talking general principles more than current conditions.


On Thursday, the CBOE FedWatch Tool gauged the likelihood of a half point rate cut at about 70%. But the probability dropped to 22.5% Friday after the Williams correction.

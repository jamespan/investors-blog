Leading Stocks Take More Heat As Nasdaq, S&P 500 Fall In Higher Volume
=======================================================================

Sellers dictated the action again Wednesday as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite lost ground for the third straight session. More importantly, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched another distribution day, or higher-volume decline. Top stocks Wednesday included [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) as well as retailers **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)).




Small caps fared the worst, with the Russell 2000 down 2%. The Nasdaq lost 0.9%, the S&P 500 gave back nearly 0.7% and the Dow Jones industrials eased 0.5%. Volume on the Nasdaq and the NYSE rose from Tuesday's levels. It was the Nasdaq's third [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in five trading sessions.


The distribution day count for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq has been on the rise, but recent higher-volume declines haven't had the feel of intense institutional selling. The one session that did feel like distribution was on Feb. 7, when the Nasdaq slumped 1.2%. The silver lining to the session was that the Nasdaq closed in the upper half of that day's range. Still, a heightened distribution-day count needs to be monitored closely as the Dow, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 get turned away at key price levels.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP030619-261x300.jpg)Out of the three major stock indexes, the Nasdaq composite gets the most credit for staying above key levels after several closes in a row above the 7500 price. This is occurring while the Dow Jones gets resistance near 26,000. For the S&P 500, the 2,800 level has been a tough nut to crack, and the Russell 2000 got turned away its 200-day moving average.


For growth investors looking to put new money to work, it's getting more difficult. Some interesting setups are out there, but they're few and far between. **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) is trading tightly just below a 45.16 handle buy point. **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), meanwhile, has climbed furiously up the right side of a deep base. It's also a breakout candidate, but a 66% pullback as the left side of the base formed makes the pattern seriously flawed.


Top Stocks In Retail
--------------------


Despite another down session Wednesday, well-performing stocks weren't hard to find, particularly in the retail sector. Abercrombie & Fitch gapped up powerfully over the 25 level as Wall Street liked the look of better-than-expected [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/abercrombie-stock-soars-q4-2018-earnings-beat/).


**Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) added 0.3% but closed well off session highs. It's still above the 93.46 buy point, but it's been a sluggish breakout so far from a later-stage base. Dollar Tree found support at its 50-day moving average with conviction, rising 5% in big volume.


Results from **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) due Thursday before the open. Shares are holding above the 50-day moving average and are only 7% off their high.


How Are Top Stocks Acting?
--------------------------


Top stocks in IBD growth screens faced more selling pressure as Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 1.3%. **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) and **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) led the downside, with losses of around 5%.


Some breakouts are struggling, including **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)) and **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)), but plenty more are working just fine. Count **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Nexstar Media** ([NXST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXST)), **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) among breakouts that are working.


Biotechs ended the session broadly lower as iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) fell 3%. The exchange-traded fund is down 4.5% so far this week. Some of the weakness in biotech was attributed to news that U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is resigning. Gottlieb has been widely lauded by industry executives for his efforts to speed the approval times of generic drugs, among other things.

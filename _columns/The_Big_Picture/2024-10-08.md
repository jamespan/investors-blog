The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 outperformed in the stock market Tuesday as oil prices plunged and the 10-year Treasury yield slowed its ascent, holding just above the 4% level.


The Nasdaq jumped nearly 1.5% in higher volume, picture-perfect price action for the bulls after the index marked a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) Monday. The Nasdaq is back above the 18,000 level with its sights now set on its late-September high of 18,327. A decisive move above this level would qualify as a bullish breakout.




The Nasdaq continues to perform well amid mild signs of institutional selling. Of the Nasdaq's five distribution days, only two show declines of 1% or more. Despite Tuesday's solid gain, Nasdaq breadth was relatively weak, with decliners having a slight edge over advancers.


Stock Market Today
------------------


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up 4%. The stock broke out of a downtrend this week, albeit in light volume. Fellow AI stock **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) also outperformed with its 3% gain. Broadcom rallied in light volume, although volume was up from Monday. Broadcom closed just above a handle entry of 180.25.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP100824_2-210x300.jpg)Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) also moved well in the Nasdaq 100, up 5.1% in higher volume. The security software stock broke out over a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) and cleared the 350 level. Palo Alto Networks shows some tight weekly closes near its 10-week line as it sets up in a base with an entry of 375.37. The company isn't the growth engine it once was, but it's still widely regarded as an institutional-quality name in the group.


**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) rallied nearly 3% after finding support at its 50-day moving average. But the stock closed just a hair below its 10-week line on the weekly chart.


The S&P 500 added 1% in lower volume, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 small-cap index lagged with gains of 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.


Breadth was barely positive on the NYSE as sellers hit oil and gas, mining and steel stocks. Just after the stock market close, West Texas intermediate crude oil futures were trading around $74 a barrel, down 4%, after hitting an intraday low of $72.69.


China Stocks Weaken
-------------------


Overall, it was another strong performance for the stock market despite broad-based selling in Chinese stocks. After soaring nearly 22% two weeks ago, and 6.7% last week, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) pared losses but still fell nearly 7%, while [IBD Sector Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) plunged 13%, snapping an 11-session win streak.


Sentiment was negative in Chinese stocks after China's top economic planning agency, in a highly anticipated briefing, didn't announce any new details regarding recently announced stimulus measures.


Some key economic headlines are on the horizon, including the release of the minutes from the Sept. 18 Federal Reserve meeting, due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. After that, the latest reading on consumer prices will be out Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, comes out Friday.

In light of the strong jobs report Friday, the market has dialed back rate-cut expectations for this year. For now, [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) expects a quarter-point cut at the November meeting, and another one at the December meeting. After soaring 23 basis points last week, the 10-year Treasury yield traded up to 4.06% Wednesday before backing off highs.


The stock market continues to perform quite well even as interest rates and the U.S. dollar rally. The Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) continues to hold gains after soaring above all of its moving averages last week.


Market Movers
-------------


Leadership has broadened out considerably. Online broker **Robinhood** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)) broke out over an alternate handle entry of 24.13. Volume was very heavy, unlike Robinhood's first breakout over a 21.54 handle entry last month.


**Docusign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) gapped up to a 52-week high on news it's replacing **MDU Resources** ([MDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDU)) in the S&P MidCap 400. The breakout comes after the e-signature firm cleared a 61.09 buy point in late September.


**Commvault Systems** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)), meanwhile, cleared a flat base with a 157.13 buy point on news the company's data protection solutions will be available on Amazon Web Services.


In the pollution control group, **Tetra Tech** ([TTEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTEK)) reclaimed a 48.26 entry with conviction, rising 3.5% in strong trade.

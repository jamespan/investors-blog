Stock Market Slammed As Jobs Data Raises These Fears; Elon Musk Move Hits Group
================================================================================

The stock market was lashed lower Friday after the latest jobs report raised worries over future Federal Reserve policy. Contrarily, a move by **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) CEO Elon Musk to slash his workforce made auto manufacturers the worst performing industry group heading into the weekend.




The Nasdaq was the index that suffered the most, dropping 2.5%. This means it closed the week down 1%, though it retained the bulk of last week's 6.8% gain.


The S&P 500 also had a tough time, falling 1.6%. It has traded tightly for the week, though.


Crucially, both indexes avoided another distribution day due to lower volume on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.

[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was telling, with every one closing lower except from the energy sector. Consumer discretionary and technology were the worst performers.


While the Dow fared a bit better, it still gave up 1%. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) were the worst laggards on the Dow.


IBD 50 Index Flexes As Small Caps Slip
--------------------------------------


In contrast to the major indexes, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), ended the day up 0.8%. While it is trending upward again, it remains down nearly 28% so far this year.


Small caps also managed to hold off the worst attention from the bears, with the Russell 2000 dipping 0.8%.


Jobs Report Hits Stock Market, Raises Fed Fears
-----------------------------------------------


Stocks were punished after the Labor Department reported the U.S. economy [added 390,000 jobs in May.](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-is-strong-but-wage-growth-cools-dow-jones/) This was above the 325,000 economists expected. The unemployment rate came in at 3.6%.


While job growth slowed compared to April, it may not be sufficient to prevent the Fed from continuing to hike interest rates beyond the summer. The job data poured cold water on enthusiasm that rose Thursday after private payroll data from ADP showed an estimated gain of 128,000 jobs in May, well shy of estimates.


Senior Federal Reserve officials, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, seem increasingly determined to tame inflation. An aggressive rate-hiking campaign could cause further pain for stocks.

Elon Musk Move Hits Auto Group
------------------------------


The daily performance of industry groups always tells a tale, and in Friday's case the auto group was the worst performing and highlighted one of the day's key storylines.


The group sold off after reports that Musk plans to slash 10% of his company's salaried workforce. The caveat is that he sees the number of hourly employees rising, an indication production will continue to ramp up.



The move also suggests Musk may be pivoting from growth at any cost to increasingly a focus on profitability. Given current investor appetite for growth at a reasonable price, this could actually be welcomed by shareholders in the long run.


But this was not the case on Friday, as TSLA stock closed down 9.2%. It lost support at its 21-day exponential moving average.


With Musk saying he has a "super bad feeling" about the economy and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) CEO Jamie Dimon also seeing trouble ahead, this could be the first in a spate of workforce rationalization programs from America's biggest firms.

=============================================

The stock market stumbled Tuesday as it stayed in its dull trading range.

  

The Nasdaq shed 0.7% and S&P 500 0.6%, although both came off lows that had cost each index around 1%.

  

The Russell 2000 skidded 1.5%. The benchmark small-cap index has been trading mainly below its long-term 200-day moving average the past couple of weeks. As a proxy of speculative demand, the Russell shows a nervous market.

  

Yet, some gauges of investor fear haven't reached panic levels that might shake buyers out of the sidelines. The put-call volume ratio surged to 0.94 Tuesday, which lagged readings that have coincided with many market bottoms.

  

Losing stocks led winners by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE.

  

Despite the broad selling, a wider perspective finds the indexes stuck in their price ranges, seemingly growing more comfortable to dwell within them.

  

The S&P 500 keeps finding support at the 50-day moving average but can't make it past the 1900 level. For the Nasdaq, its floor is near 4000 and the ceiling is around 4175.

  

Of course, this long trend won't last forever. Someday, there will be a decisive move one way or the other. Until a follow-through occurs, it's best to keep minimal to zero exposure to stocks.

  

With Tuesday's increase in volume, a habit of losses in higher trade and gains in lighter volume held true.

  

This bearish pattern is showing up in the dismal Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the major indexes.

  

Indecision also is evident in the leading stocks, where there's been a number of breakouts, but the weak advances from buy points have been frustrating.

  

In the IBD 50 — which fell 0.7% — **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)), **Iconix Brand Group** ([ICON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICON)) and **Air Lease** ([AL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AL)) are examples of stalled breakouts.

  

However, the IBD 50 also finds more than 20 stocks forming bases, some more sound than others. This indicates that if the market can get back on its feet soon enough, there will be plenty of good stocks to buy.

  

This is a time to closely track leaders for their potential, not necessarily for how they're acting now.

  

The retail sector was rattled Tuesday, and it showed just how much the market is willing to punish companies that miss expectations. Unusually cold winter weather chilled sales, but the market wasn't in a sympathetic mood.

  

**TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) plunged 8% to an eight-month low. **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) plummeted 18% and closed at the lowest level since June 2012. **Staples** ([SPLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLS)) swooned nearly 13%.

  

Retail industry groups accounted for six of the seven worst-performing groups Tuesday.

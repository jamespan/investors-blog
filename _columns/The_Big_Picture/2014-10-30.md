Stocks Overcome Weak Start, Post Respectable Gains
===================================================

Stocks posted decent gains Thursday after shaking off a weak start.

  

The Nasdaq tacked on 0.4% while the S&P 500 added 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 1.3%, mostly thanks to **Visa's** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) 10% gain.

  

The IBD 50 rose 0.7%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

With the market in a confirmed uptrend, individual investors should be looking for stocks to buy or positions to expand. They also should be aware of how emotions can ambush them. For example, in the first two weeks of this uptrend, some breakouts have done very well.

  

Biotech stock **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) is up 18% from a retaken 90.60 buy point. Building and wood product provider **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)) is 17% above a retaken 30.09 entry.

  

Drugmaker **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) is 10% above a 39.58 entry. Auto parts retailer **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is 10% above a 158.73 entry. Drugmaker **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) touched 23% above a 46.84 entry, triggering the eight-week hold rule.

  

The hold rule is designed to keep an investor in a stock that could become a big winner.

  

Strength in a new uptrend can trigger risky emotions: If an investor bought none of the above stocks, the natural reaction is to fear the train has left the station.

  

Yet IBD research shows that the leaders of a new uptrend tend to emerge in the first four weeks after a follow-through day.

  

That means new leaders could emerge in the next two weeks, assuming the uptrend stays on track. Some of those leaders may have already broken out and are lingering in buy zones. Others may break out or retake former buy points in the days ahead.

  

Patiently waiting for new opportunities makes more sense than pushing the panic button. Chasing stocks extended more than 5% beyond the ideal entry involves unacceptable risks.

  

Several stocks are holding near buy points and could become opportunities.

  

They include **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)), **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)), both from the rising real estate sector, plus new issue and human resource provider **TriNet** ([TNET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNET)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).

  

One encouraging development in this uptrend is the power being shown from previously dormant stocks. On Thursday, **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and Visa leapt higher. The credit payment industry group — stuck in rolling, sideways action since early January — is showing strength.

  

Economic news Thursday was mixed. The first take on third-quarter GDP growth was 3.5%, topping views for 3%. First-time jobless claims were slightly worse than expected.

title: Stocks Sink Late, But Score Big Wins For The Week; Breaking Down A Possible Bottom

A wave of late selling sent indexes near session lows at the close Friday. But the stock market still had a productive week, leaving a bottom still a possibility.




The Nasdaq shaved a 3.9% early drop to only 1% at the best levels of the day, but sellers swarmed in the final half-hour of trading. The composite ended 3.8% lower and the S&P 500 down 3.4%. Volume fell modestly.


There was no clear explanation for the late selling. The House of Representatives passed the $2 trillion economic rescue package about 1:30 p.m. ET, and the stock market — fully expecting passage — was undisturbed. President Trump signed it later in the day.


Perhaps investors decided to take money off the table before the weekend, aware that the coronavirus crisis has yet to peak. U.S. cases are [approaching 100,000 and deaths topped 1,200](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html#2019coronavirus-summary), according to the Centers for Disease Control. The [rate of infection is not slowing](https://beta.pivotalpath.com/covid19/), and health officials are bracing for a flood of hospitalizations.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP032719-274x300.jpg)In the context of the week's sharp bounce (the Nasdaq rose 9.1% for the week, the S&P 500 10.3%), Friday was an acceptable decline. It's significant that the major indexes are still trading above last Monday's lows. As long as that stays true, the window for a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) rally confirmation remains open.


That's the most important signal for investors to watch right now. Once a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) happens, investors can start getting back into stocks. But the [first moves need to be measured](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-etf-strategy-qqq-potential-uptrend/). Buy with discriminating taste and smaller numbers of shares.


That's because history is not on the side of a follow-through this time. Market corrections that start with severe breaks like the one this year are harder to extinguish; the first follow-through tends to fail.


It's been six weeks since the market peaked, and that's [long enough for many stocks to be in bases now](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-stocks-reveal-new-buy-points/). But most still have more ground to make up, so investors have time to do their research. You'll find that current bases generally are too deep and [V-shaped](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/). Bear markets result in ugly patterns, but they can still work out.

Stock Market Ends Mixed, But Technology Stocks Bounce Back; Apple, Facebook, Microsoft Hold Support
====================================================================================================

Growth investors breathed a sigh of relief in the stock market Wednesday as the rotation into financial stocks, airline stocks and oil and gas stocks abated — at least for a day.




The Nasdaq composite jumped 2%, but there wasn't much conviction behind the buying. After falling 1.4% Tuesday in lower volume, volume fell even more Wednesday. And breadth wasn't impressive on the Nasdaq, either, with advancing stocks beating declining stocks by about 9 to 7. The ratio was closer to 2-to-1 on the NYSE.


But for stock market bulls, the rally in technology stocks was a welcome change after two days of harsh selling. Large-cap technology stocks like **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) continue to hold support at their 50-day moving averages.


The S&P 500 rallied 0.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1%. After soaring 5.7% in the past two sessions, the Russell 2000 small-cap index ended mostly flat.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![MP111120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP111120-253x300.jpg)Solar stocks, semiconductor stocks and several software-related industry groups outperformed, including the enterprise software group, which rallied around 3%. But the enterprise software group has slipped to No. 89 in IBD's 197 Industry Group Rankings, down from a ranking of No. 18 three weeks ago. Still, several enterprise software stocks are holding up well, including [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) and **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)).


Despite a harsh sell-off in growth stocks on Monday and Tuesday, it's important not to lose sight of the fact that the stock market is still in a confirmed uptrend.


The S&P 500 is still holding nicely above last week's follow-through day with no distribution days. For the Nasdaq composite, it's a slightly different story. The index suffered a harsh [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) Monday and closed below the low of Thursday's follow-through day. That immediately called the Nasdaq's follow-through day into question. To its credit though, the Nasdaq fell 1.4% Tuesday but closed in the upper half of its range. The index also held support at the 21-day exponential moving average. The Nasdaq 100 fell 1.7% Tuesday but held support at its 50-day line.


IBD 50 Stocks Outperform
------------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) bounced back 3.2% but stopped short of reclaiming its 50-day moving average. Top gainers in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) included **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)). It closed just above the 50-day moving average after flashing a sell signal from a 151.51 buy point. At this point, it's best to wait for Etsy to form a new base before considering a buy.



The Nasdaq 100 delivered plenty of solid gainers Wednesday. **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) climbed back near a 354.08 buy point. **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) is just above a 70 buy point with earnings due Thursday after the close. It was featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-watch-biontech-stock-sets-up-palantir-breaks-out-from-ipo-base/) column as a possible earnings option trade.

Wednesday's session didn't deliver much in the way of base breakouts, and the Market Pulse isn't exactly a who's who of top-rated growth stocks, but **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) broke out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) with a 404.87 buy point.


Bullish Sentiment Rises
-----------------------


Wednesday's gains came even after the latest Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a jump in bullish sentiment. The bulls rose to 59.2% from 53.6%. The 59.2% reading is just below a reading of 61.5% in early September just before a sharp market pullback. The bears dropped to 19.4%, from 20.6%. The bears were at 41.7% in late March just before follow-through days for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in early April.


The survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms. In other words, when sentiment is overly bullish, it's time to be bearish — and vice versa.


The latest survey results, along with weak breadth Wednesday, are a reminder to stay cautious and don't make big bets in individual stocks. If you've been raising cash, it's OK to look for stocks to buy, but keep positions small to start.


Semiconductor Strength
----------------------


The bulls are certainly encouraged by the price action of several stocks in the semiconductor sector. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) is still in buy range from a 191.05 buy point. An initial breakout over a 184.71 buy point stumbled, but the exchange traded fund found support at the 50-day moving average.

Meanwhile, the chip-equipment group has delivered several breakouts recently from the likes of **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **FormFactor** ([FORM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FORM)) and **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)).


Other chip stocks like [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) are holding up well after recent breakouts.


Increased scrutiny from Chinese regulators has weighed on shares of **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), but **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) has shown impressive price action. The stock pared a 9% loss Tuesday to just 2.9%. Shares soared 8% Wednesday with earnings due Thursday before the open.

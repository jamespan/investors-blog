Stocks took a breather Thursday as the stock market rally attempt continued. Next up, Wall Street will shift its attention to Friday's employment report from the Labor Department.




Wall Street expects the September jobs report to show moderate strength, with 150,000 new jobs. The jobless rate is expected to tick down to 3.7% from 3.8%. Average hourly wages are seen growing 0.3%.


The 10-year Treasury yield settled a fraction lower Thursday, ticking down to 4.71%, just off its 16-year high that was set this week.


As the stock market correction lingers, [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) and **McKesson** ([MCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCK)) are stocks to watch in [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?).

In the Dow Jones Industrial Average, beverage giant **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) was the worst performer Thursday, diving nearly 5% and hitting a 52-week low. Shares continued to fizzle, closing nearly 20% off their 52-week high.


Top growth stocks bucked the market trend, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed 0.7% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Ares Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)) advanced 3.5%, moving further above its 50-day line and nearing a 52-week high.


What To Do Now
--------------


A stock market rally attempt remains intact on the Nasdaq since the tech-heavy index has yet to undercut its lows set on Sept. 27. Thursday was Day 7 of a rally attempt, so investors should be preparing for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). The S&P 500 already undercut its September low, so it's barely getting started with a rally attempt of its own.


With the stock market in a correction, IBD recommends an exposure level of 0%-20%. And now is a great time to continue curating watchlists of stock market leaders.


One way to do this is by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Keep an eye on stock charts in which the line is trending upward, which means the stock is outperforming the S&P.


The RS line is in all IBD charts and [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). In addition, the [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/) includes a list of top-rated stocks with lines at new highs. MarketSmith also has the ["RS Line Blue Dot" list](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/), which screens for RS lines at new highs.


Two useful [MarketSmith lists](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) to check — especially once the market is back to an uptrend — are "Breaking Out Today" and "Near Pivot." The latter shows stocks nearing buy points in bases, and the other flags stocks rising past buy points during the session.

Stock Market Leaders: Tesla, Duolingo, Costco
---------------------------------------------



Some stocks are forming bases during the market correction and should be studied, such as these:


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) member Tesla raced nearly 6% higher Wednesday, decisively retaking its 50-day line and moving into an alternative buy area. The buy zone starts at 254.77 and goes up to 258.40 for aggressive investors. TSLA stock is in a cup-with-handle base with a buy point at 278.98, per [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The EV giant was also added to [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) during Wednesday's bullish gains.


[IPO Leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/duolingo-stock-surges-past-new-buy-point-in-todays-stock-market-rally/) Duolingo is still below its latest [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 167.35 despite two days of gains. The new entry is the result of a handle forming on a double-bottom base. But it is just above a 162.20 buy point.


[Monday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/costco-stock-nears-buy-point-after-earnings-already-flashing-this-bullish-signal/), Costco, is trying to break out past a 571.16 buy point in a flat base. Shares dipped 0.4% Thursday, closing below their entry.


McKesson is breaking out past a flat base's 441 buy point and is in buy range. McKesson was [Wednesday's pick for IBD 50 Growth Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/okta-stock-cybersecurity-leader-forges-new-buy-point-amid-path-to-profitability/).

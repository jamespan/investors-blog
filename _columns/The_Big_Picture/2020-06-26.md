  Stocks Hammered By Renewed Coronavirus Fear; Will FAANG Stocks Bite This Uptrend?

A rash of new coronavirus cases in mainly Southern and Southwestern states dominated news headlines the past week. And Friday's stock market drop reaffirmed that the world's No. 1 economy is hardly showing any immunity to the most powerful virus in decades.




Small and large caps pretty much got smacked down with the same intensity. The Nasdaq sank 2.6%, a little worse than a 2.4% slamming of the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000, and fell 1.9% for the week. In the prior week, the tech-heavy composite gained 3.7%. Two [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) and rivals in online ads, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), [undercut their 50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Following the Federal Reserve's stress test results on the banking industry, the NYSE Financial Index shot 3.4% lower. **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) undercut and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since May 15. Volume rushed 55% above its 50-day average.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP062620_1-256x300.jpg)Most banking stocks have been laggards. In the [IBD stock research tables on Friday morning](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jun-25-2020/), Banks ranked No. 32 out of 33 sectors; S&Ls were No. 33. Both show massive declines year to date.


After the market close, these two rankings stayed the same. (Go to [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to see the full stock tables and the 33 sector rankings.)


Volume soared on both main exchanges. They saw a last-minute boost due to an annual rebalancing of the Russell equity indexes. However, turnover had run at a higher rate all day. The sharp declines in higher Nasdaq and NYSE volume point to distribution. One [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) by itself won't halt a bull market. But a quick series of serious distribution days, including a [vertical violation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/), would signal a serious turn in the market.


The S&P 500 has no doubt shown some real professional selling, and this has prevented the index from catching up with the Nasdaq. Friday marked the third decline of 2% or more in heavier turnover this month, including a 5.9% plunge on June 11 and a 2.6% lambasting on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 2.9% for the week, eclipsing the prior week's 1.9% gain.


Stock Market Leaders Today
--------------------------


Recent breakouts have not shown much gusto.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), another FAANG play, reversed for a 2.3% loss for the week. At one point, the video streaming giant rallied 3% past a 459.07 [flat-base buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). But the [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) never saw really big volume come in. Weekly turnover fell below its 10-week average for a ninth straight week.



However, some stocks bucked Friday's drop and ended with superb weekly gains. Stocks such as **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)), and fast-growing chicken wings chain **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) may deserve a spot on a [watchlist of true market leaders](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) that may develop a main or [secondary entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Fear rose, but not enormously.


The Cboe Volatility Index rose for the second time in three sessions. But even after Friday's 7.9% advance to 34.76, [the VIX](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vix-volatility-index-can-confirm-stock-market-bottoms-coronavirus-bear-market/) still lies nearly 59% below a historic peak of 85.47 set on March 18.

Stock Indexes Push Losing Streak To 9 Days
===========================================

U.S. stock indexes lost again Friday, extending their losing streak to nine days in a row.


The Nasdaq trimmed 0.2% for the day, after being up 0.6% earlier. The S&P 500 cut 0.2%, while the IBD 50 gained 0.2%. The small-cap S&P 600 defied the trend, rising 0.5%.


Volume fell across the board.


![mp110416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP110416-186x300.png)For the past several weeks, the stock market has been trying to price in a rather strange presidential campaign.


What stock groups have been benefiting the most over the past four weeks?


The big gainers include gold miners, steel, coal and the cement group. Only one, though, has risen in each of the past four weeks — cement.


The cement group could benefit regardless of who wins the election.


Building tycoon Donald Trump presumably knows what incentives to add and what obstacles to remove to help builders.


Hillary Clinton, like most Democrats, favors infrastructure projects, partly because it gives politicians something concrete to brag about.


Stocks within the cement group building first-stage bases include **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) and **Martin Marietta Materials** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)). Meanwhile, **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) is building a second-stage base.


The annual earnings outlook is strong for all three.


While fears of a market sell-off related to the election outcome linger, it isn't clear if this is media noise or a genuine concern among institutional investors.


Congressional pushback could block the questionable ideas of either Clinton or Trump.


Historically, how has the market done in the weeks immediately following a U.S. presidential election?


In the past nine elections beginning with 1980, the first move in the Nasdaq — encompassing several weeks after the election — was down in five cases and up in four cases.


The up moves were in the range of 8% to 18%. The down moves were split between severe moves in recessionary 2000 and 2008 (-35% and -27%) and moderate losses of 4% to 7% in the three other cases. But those moderate losses served as a prelude to nice rallies.


So in seven of the nine postelection markets, the bulls eventually prevailed.


If history means anything, the odds favor the bulls.


For the week, the IBD 50 lost 3.4%; the Nasdaq, 2.8%; the S&P 500, 1.9%; the small cap S&P 600, 1.6%; and the blue chip Dow, 1.5%.

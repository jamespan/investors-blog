The major stock indexes ended with strong gains Thursday, as the Nasdaq hit a record high. Amid the strengthening stock market, top stocks **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) are in new buy areas. But **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fell after they reported quarterly earnings after the close.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 led the major stock indexes higher Thursday, rallying 1.4% and 2%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 followed up with respective gains of 0.7% and 1%.


Leading growth stocks sharply climbed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 2.8%, rebounding from the key 50-day moving average. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) fell 1.4%. It is tracing a cup base with a 26.61 buy point. Meanwhile, the stock [triggered a buy signal](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/clf-stock-cleveland-cliffs-flashes-new-earnings-power-and-buy-signal/) during last week's sharp move back above its 50-day moving average.

What To Do Now
--------------


The stock market rally put in a strong performance Thursday. The Nasdaq set a fresh record high for the first time since Sept. 7, following its fourth straight gain. The Dow 30 and S&P 500 bounced back after Wednesday's moderate losses. Indexes climbed into the close, an improvement from the fading action of the previous two days.


With the Nasdaq at all-time highs and a limited amount of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), investors should remain optimistic about the health of the market. So, investors should be looking for new buying opportunities to incrementally increase market exposure. And, like always, be disciplined about your purchases. Don't chase extended stocks, and be sure to cut losses after sell signals.


Many high-profile breakouts continue to perform well despite some recent market stalling. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are all extended past their most recent buy points.



Key Earnings: Amazon, Apple
---------------------------


After the stock market close Thursday, titans Amazon and Apple both reported their quarterly earnings results, and neither was good.


[Amazon reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-drops-on-third-quarter-earnings-report-amzn/) disappointing Q3 results that fell short on earnings and revenue, as did its fourth-quarter outlook, sparking a 4% tumble in extended trade. The company reported adjusted earnings of $6.12 a share on revenue of $110.8 billion. Analysts expected Amazon to earn $8.92 on revenue of $111.6 billion.


Amazon shares closed Thursday up 1.6% and above their 50-day line, but still deep in a correction.


[Apple met earnings targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-falls-as-iphone-maker-misses-sales-target/) but fell short on revenue estimates late Thursday, as the stock slid about 5% in after-hours trade.


The after-hours sell-off wiped out Apple's 2.5% rally in the regular session. The stock is forming a new cup base with a 157.36 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Thursday's late weakness could be the start of a potential handle, which would offer a lower entry if the stock is able to find its footing.


With the two titans selling off in extended trading, the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, was down 0.6% after the close.

Major Indexes Rebound Furiously; Volume Inches Higher

Stocks blasted upward Wednesday, and even volume grew. Yet with the market still in correction mode, it's still relatively slim pickings for hunters of good stock breakouts.

  

On an ultra-skinny list of stocks that surpassed a proper buy point, two are NYSE-listed: **Universal Insurance** ([UVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UVE)) (seven-week cup with handle, 29.06 entry) and **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) (six-week base, 192.37).

  

The Nasdaq composite paced the rebound, rising 2.3% to halt a brutal six-day sell-off. Big gains by biotech and chip firms — two sectors that have been pummeled — helped the cause.

  

IBD's biotech-biomedical industry group jumped 4%. The Philly SOX rose 3.8%.

  

The S&P 500 rallied 1.9%. Companies with market caps of $3 billion or less lagged. The S&P SmallCap 600 gained 1.3%.

  

A better-than-expected monthly private-sector jobs report from ADP seemed to offset a big drop in the Chicago PMI index.

  

The rebound may have come as little surprise, given that stocks had appeared to reach a short-term oversold situation. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 had nearly taken out its Aug. 24 low of 1867.01.

  

After Wednesday's rally, there may be a bigger handful of high-quality stocks that are approaching proper buy points. Yet unless the overall market's health improves dramatically, new breakouts are likely to act as steel traps for the bulls.

  

It's positive to see psychological gauges hitting lows.

  

The weekly newsletter editor survey by Investors Intelligence now shows that nearly 1 out of every 4 pundits is bullish about the market going forward. However, just 35% of the crowd is outright bearish. It may take more market bloodshed before bearishness gets to high-enough levels that it can become an effective contrarian indicator.

  

The Nasdaq composite finished the third quarter down 7.4%. Sharp sell-offs that began in late-July — when IBD's Market Pulse shifted its outlook to "uptrend under pressure" from "confirmed uptrend" — led to the Nasdaq losing all of its gains for 2015.

  

The S&P 500 dropped 6.9% during the July-to-September period and is down 6.7% since Jan. 1.

  

IBD's stock research tables show that a small number of broad sectors still show year-to-date gains. Apparel now ranks at No. 2; as of Wednesday's paper, the sector sports a year-to-date gain of 20.6%; four stocks in the sector hold a Composite Rating of 85 or higher.

  

The S&Ls, building, food and beverage, and insurance sectors also are up mildly since Jan. 1.

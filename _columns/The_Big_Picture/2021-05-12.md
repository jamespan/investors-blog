Just as the stock market attempted to rebound, an alarming inflation report sent sellers right back into action Wednesday.




Tuesday's session left a good taste in investors' mouths as indexes pared big losses. But fresh evidence of rising inflation early Wednesday was too much bad news to ignore, and the stock market sold off.


The Nasdaq composite again took the hardest hit, as growth and technology shares came under heavy shelling. The Nasdaq plunged 2.7% and is at a six-week low. It undercut Tuesday's low and, opposite of that day's action, closed at session lows.

Having already violated the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), the index now looks at the March lows around 12,800 for a possible bottom. If it fails at that level, the next potential support might be down at the 200-day moving average, now around 12,450.


The S&P 500 lost 2.1%, the largest drop since Feb. 25. Unable to climb back above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), the index now faces a fresh test at the 50-day average, where support surfaced in early February, early March and March 25.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2% and closed below the 21-day line for the first time since March 4.


Lower Nasdaq Volume; Stock Market Volatility Spikes
---------------------------------------------------


Bad as the session was, there was one positive: Volume fell — albeit slightly — on the Nasdaq and was also  lower on the NYSE. That spares the stock market from another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), commonly known as the VIX, surged more than 25%. It's at a level that often marks market lows, although a similar signal last week failed to mark a bottom.


Growth stocks took another hit. But selling spread to more sectors. Financials, which were rising on higher yields, are down nearly 3% this week. The Dow utilities index, normally a haven, tumbled 2.3% Wednesday. The S&P Real Estate sector is down more than 3% for the week. Industrials, materials and retail — which last week looked just fine — are breaking stride.


Building leaders such as **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) and**Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) as well as [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)) and **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) are suddenly in technical difficulties in their respective charts.


With pervasive selling at hand, IBD downgraded its [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations) from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure."


Investors must immediately take more precautions. Narrow your stock purchases to only exceptional breakouts. Be sure to [cut any loss to 7% or 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), or [even less](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-breakouts-backtrack-to-retest-buy-points/). Avoid adding to existing positions. The idea is to reduce market exposure.


IBD 50 Plummets
---------------


Some indexes already are down about 10%, a decline that normally defines a correction.


The Russell 2000 is about 10% below its March peak and 8% off the April 29 high. The Russell 2000 fell 3.3% Wednesday. The IBD 50 is more than 10% below its April 27 high. The index plummeted 4.5% Wednesday, its worst day of 2021 so far.


Near-zero interest rates have helped stocks rebound from the coronavirus crisis. But since February, Wall Street has grown weary of inflation. Besides higher costs, the fear is that inflation will force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than planned to arrest inflation.


The [consumer price index jumped 4.2% in April](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/what-is-inflation-what-causes-inflation/) from a year ago, the highest rate since September of 2008. The price index rose 0.8% from March. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3% year-over-year and 0.9% from March — the sharpest monthly increase since April 1982.


U.S. Central Bank's Vice Chair Comments
---------------------------------------


The Federal Reserve has stuck to a dovish tone, saying the inflationary signals are just temporary. Following the surprising spike in April inflation, a top Fed official reiterated that price spikes are transitory, but acknowledged the central bank may have to act.


"If, contrary to our baseline view, demand relative to supply was excessive and persistent and pushed up inflation and inflation expectations to levels that were not potentially consistent with our mandate, we would not hesitate to act and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% longer-run goal," [said Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-increases-likely-to-prove-transitory-fed-official-says-11620824400).


Energy was the only S&P sector to rise Wednesday. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose almost 0.5%. U.S. crude prices jumped after the International Energy Agency said it expects global oil demand to return almost to its pre-pandemic norm by the end of the year. Gasoline shortages in much of the eastern U.S. also affected energy markets. Colonial Pipeline was trying to restore service on the major East Coast fuel pipeline.

  Stock Market Finds Silver Lining As Banking Woes Stir Bonds, Other Markets

Stock market indexes fought back from session lows and closed mixed Monday, as investors tried to figure out if some good will come out of the stock market's nervous moment.




The Nasdaq and S&P 500 shook off early selling and bounced off prior support levels. But late selling curbed gains.


The S&P 500 slid more than 1% in early trading but rebounded to close less than 0.2% lower. The index found support around 3800, where buyers also showed up during December's market swoon.


The Nasdaq composite, which has less exposure to banks and financials, climbed nearly 0.5%. The composite bounced from the 11,000 level — an area where both support and resistance is found going back to April.


Major components **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) climbed.


With financials weighing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% and is now below the 32,000 level.


Regional Banks Hurt Small Cap Index
-----------------------------------


The Russell 2000 slid 1.6%, making it the worst three-day stretch since June 2022. Financials, mainly regional banks feeling the brunt of panic selling, [account for one of the largest sectors](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239710/ishares-russell-2000-etf) in the Russell index, or more than 16% of the fund.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP031323-213x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE. Declining stocks topped advancers by an 8-5 ratio on the Nasdaq and about 14-5 on the NYSE.


While Monday's reversals helped to stop the bleeding, the stock market faces daunting obstacles.


All three major indexes are below their 50- and 200-day moving averages. Breadth has been weakening since early February, as the advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE show. The 10-day moving average of new lows has exceeded new highs since late February.


The fundamental backdrop is worrisome.


In the past few days, Wall Street has witnessed [the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-crisis-widens-as-signature-topples-funding-props-first-republic/). Venture capital-focused Silicon Valley Bank was shut down Friday. Trading in its parent **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) remains halted. Over the weekend, cryptocurrency specialist **Silvergate Financial** ([SI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SI)) and **Signature Bank** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) also collapsed. Other banks are feared to be vulnerable.


SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) lost 10% Monday, adding to last week's 14.7% demolition. SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) plummeted 12.3% following last week's 16% blowout.


Since the weekend, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Treasury Department have moved aggressively to contain the run on banks. The $250,000 FDIC limit was quickly removed, erasing one of the big question marks for depositors.


Fed's Tightening May Pause
--------------------------


While the stock market had reason to worry, there was a silver lining. Bond yields tumbled while odds grew for a Fed pause on raising interest rates.


The 10-year Treasury yield fell 18 basis points to 3.51%, capping the largest three-day yield decline since the Covid scare of March 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The 2-year Treasury yield tumbled nearly 56 basis points to 4.03%. That's the largest single-day drop since Oct. 20, 1987, the day after the Black Monday stock market crash.


Odds for the fed funds rate to be [unchanged at this month's Federal Reserve meeting rose above 35%](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-may-pause-rate-hikes-as-bank-stocks-keep-sliding-despite-new-rescue-fund/). Traders put the chances of a quarter-point hike at about 63%, while odds for a half-point increase went from above 80% after Jerome Powell's testimony last week to zero Monday.


What the bond market is saying is that if the banking crisis hurts the economy, there may be less need to raise interest rates. Tuesday morning, the consumer price index comes out, which is part of the equation on Fed policy. Economists forecast February CPI [to rise 0.4% from the previous month](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559227&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) and 6% on an annual basis as economic pressures moderate.


Stock Market Fear Elevated
--------------------------


As [The Big Picture noted Friday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/bank-crisis-worsens-stock-market-losses-what-to-do-now-as-indexes-lose-more-key-levels/), investor fear may be reaching excessive levels, which can be a bottoming sign for stocks.


The [Cboe S&P 500 Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX for short, surged early Monday to the highest point since October, above the 30 level. For the second straight session, the VIX rose more than 20% above its 10-day moving average. That's been a market-bottoming signal in the past, including September and June (but not August).


Still, the VIX is miles below the peaks at the Covid crisis in March 2020 and financial crisis in October 2008. Both times, it topped 80.


Nicholas Colas, *c*o-founder of DataTrek Research, found in historical data that, when the VIX rises from 20 or below to 30 or above, the S&P drops. And as the VIX falls from 30-plus levels back to 20, the S&P rallies.


The VIX's long-term average since 1990 has been 20, Colas explains. The standard deviation around that mean is 8 points. "A VIX of 20 in the current still-uncertain macro environment is too low, so stocks tend to top out when the index hits that level." As fear pushes the VIX to 28-36, stocks hit lows.


[Gold, oil and the dollar also moved](https://www.investors.com/research/investors-flee-to-bonds-gold-as-bank-crisis-unfolds-oil-and-dollar-fall/) in reaction to the banking troubles. Gold rose as investors sought havens, while falling yields took the greenback lower. Oil prices fell amid economic uncertainty.

  Dow Jones Dives As Stock Market Ends Quarter On Sour Note; Bears Feast On These Stocks

The bears continued to hold the ascendancy as they took another bite out of stock market investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared worst as the bulls continued to wilt.




The blue chip index closed at levels last seen in November 2020 as it dived 1.7% for the day and 2.9% for the week. It ended September down almost 9% and has now fallen in each of the past three weeks. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was by far the worst performer, plummeting 12.8% on quarterly results.


The Nasdaq composite fared only slightly better as it stumbled 1.5% for the day and surrendered 2.7% for the week. It did manage to hold just above its lows for the year, though a test seems imminent. It was the month's worst performer as it fell 10.3%.


The S&P 500 also fell 1.5% Friday, and now sits at a closing weekly low for the year. The broad index ended a chastening month with a 9.6% loss.


Rounding off a terrible picture for the major indexes is the fact volume rose on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Small Caps Dig In Amid This Hope
--------------------------------


Bears closed the quarter by mauling all corners of the market. The Russell 2000 fared best with a dip of 0.6% Friday. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) turned negative late as it slipped 0.7%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP093022-300x297.jpg)Stocks were walloped after the personal consumption expenditure price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, rose 0.3% in August. This represented a 6.2% year-over-year increase. This was hotter than economists expected.


The market averages have now fallen for a third consecutive quarter for the first time since 2009. The crumb of comfort for investors is the fact [IBD research finds](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-the-three-waves-rule-in-bear-market-declines/) bear markets form over three or four waves of intense selling. This looks to be the third leg.


Given the vicious reversals suffered already in 2022 it would be a balm, and a massive opportunity, if a bottom forms soon.


But the tones coming from the Fed remain as hawkish as ever. The central bank's Vice Chair Lael Brainard spoke out Friday to underline that inflation needs to be tamed.

These Industry Groups Suffer Most
---------------------------------


It is essential to keep a close eye on the best and worst-performing industry groups.



Nike's abysmal earnings report had a knock-on effect Friday as the shoe manufacturing group suffered most. Shoe retailers also wilted, with key Nike partner **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) falling away from the 50-day line as it sold off in high volume.


Automakers, a group dominated by **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), and cable service providers also lagged.


On the upside, department stores, mail order retailers, fiber optics plays and wholesale food stocks all outperformed.

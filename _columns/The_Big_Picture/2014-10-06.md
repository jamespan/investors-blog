Stocks tried for a third straight gain Monday but failed after hitting key resistance.


The Nasdaq fell 0.5%. It was up as much as 0.5% early in the session but turned tail after hitting a wall at its 50-day moving average. At Monday's low, the Nasdaq was off as much as 0.7%. Biotech, software and solar stocks were among some of the worst-performing industry groups.


The S&P 500 lost 0.2% after being up and down as much as 0.5% on the session. It poked above its 50-day line but failed to close above it. Thanks to a 4% jump in **Hewlett-Packard** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)), the Dow Jones industrial average slipped just 0.1%. The struggling tech giant announced that it is splitting into two companies.


Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 slumped 0.9%. The index corrected as much as 11% from its July 1 peak, more than double the declines of the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Early market gains were fueled by deal news. Beside the Hewlett-Packard announcement, drugmaker **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) announced that it's buying **Durata Therapeutics** ([DRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRTX)) for $675 million in cash. Medical gear supplier **Becton Dickson** ([BDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BDX)) agreed to buy **CareFusion** ([CFN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFN)) for $12.2 billion in cash and stock.


Volume fell on the NYSE but rose on the Nasdaq. Trade surged in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) supplier **GT Advanced Technologies** ([GTAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTAT)), which plunged 92% on a bankruptcy announcement.


Monday marked a setback for the major averages, which had bounced back Thursday and Friday.


Many leaders have been hammered recently, much more than in other times when the market has weakened over the past year or so. Leaders such as **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **U.S. Silica** ([SLCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLCA)) and **Trinity Industries** ([TRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRN)) have sliced their 50-day moving averages in big volume. **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) did so Monday.


After continued support at the 50-day or 10-week line, a decisive break of support in heavy trading can be used as a sell signal. Leading stocks such as **Polaris Industries** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) and **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) have triggered the 8% sell rule.


With the market in correction mode, use the time to work on your watch list. Be ready when the market follows through.


Earnings season starts this week and may bring more volatility. But reporting season will show what companies are delivering the big quarterly increases in earnings, which is the "C" in CAN SLIM. **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) are expected to post triple-digit gains.

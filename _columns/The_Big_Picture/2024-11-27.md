The stock market cooled off Wednesday, as the Nasdaq composite ended a four-day win streak and the S&P 500 snapped a seven-day win streak. Yet, indexes remained in position for a push into December.


Investors took some profits ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Nasdaq lost 0.6% while the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and continued to arm-wrestle the 6,000 level. The Oct. 23 distribution day for the S&P dropped off because 25 days have passed.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is leading this week with a 1% increase, fell 0.3%. It was its first drop in six sessions.


Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.1%. The index is nearing its record close of 2,442.74 set on Nov. 8, 2021, and is up more than 10% for November.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. While that indicated institutions sold in moderation, the eve of Thanksgiving tends to be quiet on Wall Street anyway, with many operatives taking a four-day break. The stock market will be closed Thursday and will shutter three hours early on Friday.


Advancing stocks topped decliners by a 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by about 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.


Stock Market Hits Techs, Likes Financials
-----------------------------------------


While selling certainly wasn't isolated to the technology sector, it was the area of most concern Wednesday. Of the 15 worst-performing industry groups Wednesday, semiconductor, software and other tech groups accounted for 10 of them.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP112724-2.jpg)Tech bellwether **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) trimmed losses and closed at its 50-day moving average. A lukewarm outlook, tariff risks and other factors [weighed on Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-earnings-china-trade-war-worries/).


**CrowdStrike**'s ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) [current-quarter outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crowdstrike-stock-crowdstrike-earnings-news-q32024/) and **Dell**'s ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) [soft sales outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dell-stock-slips-as-revenue-misses-forecasts-despite-earnings-beat/) also hurt the sector. **HP** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) plunged more than 11% after it [gave a cloudy outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hp-stock-earnings-q4-2024-hp-news/). **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) offered a [subscription revenue outlook that was below views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/workday-stock-workday-earnings-news-q32024/) and fell more than 6% in heavy volume. Dell and HP were the worst performers in the S&P 500.


Real Estate Select Sector SPDR ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) led the S&P sectors, up 0.7%. Several breakouts were seen in real estate investment trusts, including **Essential Property Realty** ([EPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPRT)) and **AvalonBay Communities** ([AVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVB)).


Financials also climbed. **The Hartford** ([HIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIG)) broke out of a flat base, although in light trading. **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) also broke out of a flat base but closed below the 585.82 buy point.


In general, growth stocks continue to perform well. The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) — which is designed to capture breakouts to new highs — is up 11.5% this month. That would make it the fund's best month in almost four years.


But the IBD 50 index underperformed with a 1% drop Wednesday.


If there's anything to complain about is that the November rally has left most quality stocks extended from buy areas. The more-recent breakouts in the [MarketSurge 250 index](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) have come from a mix of financial, energy, defense, tech and consumer companies.


Stock Market Seasonal Trends Favorable
--------------------------------------


Investors can be thankful for the stock market's blessings this year. The Nasdaq is up 27% and the S&P 500 has risen close to 26% year to date.


Friday's half session will cap a month in which the S&P and Nasdaq have moved up more than 5%. And next week, December brings a historically favorable trend for the stock market.


Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist for LPL Financial, says that since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average gain of 1.8% from Thanksgiving through year-end. The index has finished higher about 70% of the time. By comparison, the broad market's average gain is 1% — and up 63% of the time — during all six-week periods.


"When the index is higher on the year into Turkey Day, the average gain into year-end bumps up to 2.1%, with 75% of occurrences yielding positive results," he added.


The Stock Trader's Almanac says December is one of the top three months of the year. The Dow and Nasdaq have climbed an average of 1.6% since 1950 and the S&P is up 1.5% on average.


Market Gets Inflation, Economic Data
------------------------------------


Indexes opened lower Wednesday after a series of economic reports were released.


What is arguably the most important inflation gauge [offered no big surprises](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/pce-inflation-oct-federal-reserve-sp-500/). The personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index rose 0.2%, slightly under the 0.3% economists' forecasts. The 12-month headline inflation rate picked up to 2.3% from 2.1%, in line with forecasts.


The Fed tends to put more weight on core PCE, which removes food and energy prices. That price index rose 0.3% in October, and 12-month core inflation rose to 2.8%. Both met economists' consensus estimates.


Initial claims for unemployment benefits stayed at [213,000 the most recent week](https://ibd.econoday.com/byevent?fid=591316&year=2024&lid=0#top), below the 217,000 estimate culled by Econoday. The revised [third-quarter GDP climbed 2.8%](https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2024-second-estimate-and-corporate-profits), same as in the initial estimate and equal with forecasts.


Bond traders [raised the odds](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html) of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's December meeting to 70% vs. about 60% on Tuesday. Those odds crept higher the past week.

"Given the broad consensus-like reading across the slew of economic data releases today, we do not see any meaningful impact on the Fed's upcoming rate decision in December," Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. Fixed Income at Janus Henderson Investors, said in a report to clients.


"We still believe that a 25-basis point reduction to the policy rate is extremely likely. We feel the odds of a cut are still higher than the 70% currently implied in the futures market. In our view, it will take a combination of a very strong NFP (nonfarm payrolls) print and a higher than expected core CPI release to cause a pause at the December meeting."

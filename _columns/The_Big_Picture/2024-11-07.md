  Nasdaq, S&P 500 Rise To Record Highs As Fed Cuts Rates; Amazon, Broadcom Among Stocks To Watch

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite rallied Thursday as Wall Street reacted to the Federal Reserve's widely expected interest-rate cut and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.


But the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched lower after hitting another record high. The S&P 500 climbed 0.7% and the Nasdaq composite advanced 1.5%. Both also posted new highs and made most of their gains before the Fed announcement. The small-cap Russell 2000 index fell 0.4%.




Volume rose on the Nasdaq, but fell on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. The Nasdaq's more than 9 million shares were the most since the Sept. 20 triple witching session and the fourth largest total this year.


Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with consumer discretionary and communication services leading the upside. The financial sector was the clear loser Thursday, as the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.34%.


The [Federal Reserve cut its main policy rate](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cut-jerome-powell-trump-election-cuts-sp-500/) by 25 basis points on Thursday, citing a continuation of slower job gains. That placed the target rate at 4.5% to 4.75%. And Powell left the door open for more rate cuts in the future, as Wall Street expects.


Regarding a December rate cut, Powell told reporters, "We think that even with today's cut, policy is still restrictive."


Powell continued, "We're on a path to a more neutral stance." That makes it clear that more rate cuts are on the way, though Powell wouldn't commit to the timing of those cuts.

Stock Market Today: Earnings Movers
-----------------------------------


There were a number of big earnings movers Thursday, as third-quarter earnings season continues.


Among the biggest winners were **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)), **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) and **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)). AppLovin soared 46%, while Dutch Bros surged 28%. And Lyft raced up nearly 23%. Meanwhile, **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) reversed higher 4.1%, rebounding bullishly from the 50-day moving average.


On the downside, **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) plunged 16%, breaking down below the 50-day line. The e-commerce company had been building a flat base but that formation is gone now.


Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) were among the biggest advancers Thursday with gains of 4.7% and 2.9%, respectively, on the stock market today. It was Intel's last day in the Dow 30, set to be replaced by **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) before the open Friday.


On the downside, financials **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) all sold off sharply and gave back a chunk of the previous day's outsized gains.


[The Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended higher as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) climbed 2.3%. Notably, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) hit more new highs.


And the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund edged lower. Earnings-related losses of 15% to 26% for **Vital Farms** ([VITL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VITL)), **Klaviyo** ([KVYO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KVYO)) and **Clear Secure** ([YOU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YOU)) hurt the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). But **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)) jumped 8.6% to hit another high.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP-110724-216x300.jpg)Following Wednesday's powerful advance, IBD upped its recommended exposure from 60%-to-80% to 80%-to-100% to reflect the strengthening action in the major stock indexes. And stocks continued to post more all-time highs Thursday.


Despite the bullishness, the stock market environment requires diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). Following this week's sharp gains, many leading stocks are already extended beyond correct entries, so it's important to remain disciplined and not chase them. Be sure to buy stocks that are in proper buy areas, mainly within 5% of their buy points.


Amid the powerful gains, the question now will be whether these stocks can hold their gains and show continued strength, or if they'll pull back sharply.


The Nasdaq's remaining two [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) dropped off due to 5% gains from those sessions, while the S&P 500's Oct. 7 day fell off for the same reason. When the index advances 5% from the closing price of the distribution day, it is considered no longer relevant to the current market outlook.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), which briefly crossed above a 172.57 cup-with-handle entry. But it has a weak relative strength line.

-----------------------------------------------


Leaders to watch include **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).



Amazon shares continued a win streak to three sessions. It is extended from a 195.37 [buy point.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/)


Artificial intelligence behemoth Broadcom continues to rebound from its 50-day line, nearing an alternate entry at 186.42.

Stock indexes Thursday showed some resilience around their 50-day lines, but not enough to suggest that the battle for market direction is settled.


The Nasdaq shuffled 0.3% higher, while the S&P 500 was flat. Both indexes erased morning losses and closed near session highs. The IBD 50 slipped 0.3%.


Volume fell on the NYSE but rose on the Nasdaq.


Technicals improved a bit. A June 25 distribution day on the S&P 500 fell off the count because of time. After 25 sessions, a distribution day can no longer be considered current.


While signs of institutional selling remain high on the S&P 500, July has provided a steady stream of breakouts, and Thursday was no exception.


**Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), a heart pump maker, swung above a 76.70 buy point in a cup with handle. Volume was strong as the stock booked a 2% gain for the day. The midcap stock carries a Composite Rating of 99, putting it in the top 1 percentile among stocks in IBD's database.


The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.


Abiomed will report quarterly results before the open Tuesday.


Homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base. The stock nailed a 3% gain in twice its usual volume.


Breakouts are important, but recently they haven't set the market's tone as much as their follow-up action has.


In July, not including Thursday's session, 27 stocks with good liquidity and Composite Ratings of 90 or better broke out.


About 55% are still stuck in the 5% buy zone. Almost 30% have cleared the buy zone, but the additional gains are modest. Of the remaining stocks, 11% sank back below the buy point, and 4% (one stock) triggered the 8% sell rule.


While the 85% success rate does point to a market uptrend, the lack of big gains confirms the pressure part of the current outlook.


Only four of the 27 breakouts in July are up at least 10% from the entry.


The four are synthetic biology developer **Intrexon** ([XON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XON)), clinical research provider **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)), animal health care firm **VCA** ([WOOF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOOF)) and **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)), which cleared a 67.58 early entry.

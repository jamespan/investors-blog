The stock market ended Thursday with bullish action, as the major stock indexes reversed from early weakness to close with solid gains. The Nasdaq composite set another record high, snapping back from Wednesday's weakness.




The Nasdaq ended up 1.1%, easily outperforming the other major stock indexes. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded up 0.2%, weighed down by a 1.4% fall in shares of **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). The discount retail giant has been falling since it reported earnings on Tuesday.


The small-cap Russell 2000 sharply underperformed, falling 0.5%. Leading growth stocks outperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied 0.9%. Inside the IBD 50, **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) was one of the top performers with a 6.3% advance, as the [IPO Leader broke out](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-software-leader-zoom-video-stock-clears-new-buy-point/) past an early entry. On the downside, chip leaders **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) dropped 3.7% and 3.2%, respectively.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP0820-240x300.jpg)Volume was sharply higher on the Nasdaq, but lower on the NYSE volume vs. Wednesday's trading session, according to preliminary data.


Nasdaq Rebounds From Sharp Reversal
-----------------------------------


The Nasdaq looked to extend Wednesday's late-day reversal with more losses at Thursday's market open after a jump in jobless claims. But the Nasdaq quickly turned higher and never looked back. The tech-heavy composite erased the entirety of Wednesday's 0.6% decline to set another all-time high.


The Nasdaq still has four [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), while the S&P 500 has just two, a modest amount of institutional selling. So far, the few distribution days haven't slowed down the stock market rally.


Meanwhile, top technology stocks continue to demonstrate strength. Tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rose 2.2% to hit another all-time high. It closed above a $2 trillion market cap for the first time, while **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) surged 6.6% to also set a record high. A number of high-profile growth stocks are in or near buy zones.

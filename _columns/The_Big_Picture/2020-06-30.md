What a quarter. Really, is there anything else to say?




Well, of course. The 90-day period featured a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) (in fact, two including [the one on April 2 by the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/)), new breakouts, [high-quality stocks that are setting up](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/), numerous short-term pullbacks, scary one-day sell-offs on coronavirus fears, and why you should not bet against a confirmed market uptrend that is capable of climbing a coronavirus-laden wall of worry.


The second quarter also presented another textbook example of how leading stocks can pulverize the returns of a broadly diversified equity index.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP063020-208x300.jpg)Case in point: Tuesday's session alone saw strength in companies that populate the key stock lists at Investors.com as well as the lists that give [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/past) their flesh and bones.


While the S&P 500 gained 1.5% on Tuesday, Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ran ahead 2.1%. Remember, performance between FFTY and [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) will differ due to a difference in stock weightings.


And even though the Nasdaq, still queen of the major stock benchmarks, rose in splendid form, its 1.9% gain still paled vs. rallies of 2.5% to 6% among [11 individual stocks that hold a spot on Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


Stocks Up, Bonds Down
---------------------


Institutions dumped long-dated bonds, sending yields up. The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond finished the month with a yield of 0.66% — exactly where it began in June. The yield ranged from as low as 0.64% to as high as 0.91%.


For the quarter, the Nasdaq and Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, both flew more than 30% higher. The S&P 500 finished the quarter with a 20.1% rise. That overshadows a 12.9% lift by SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)). But gold has outdistanced the S&P 500 year-to-date. (Please see this [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch feature](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-franco-nevada-near-buy-point-gold-prices-hit-highs/) on one of the strongest companies in the IBD 50 that directly benefits from strong gold prices.)


Since the Nasdaq staged its Day 10 follow-through day on April 6, a 7.3% rip higher, in volume that boomed 17% higher vs. the prior session, it's posted a ton of daily gains in above-average or higher turnover vs. the prior session. ([Weekend Stock Market Update](https://www.investors.com/tag/weekend-stock-market-update/) gave that April 6 session a name: The Tom Petty 'Won't Back Down' follow-through.)



Just in the past two weeks, on a daily chart, please see the days such as June 12, 15 and 16.


In two of those sessions, the index began weak and finished strong.

Growth Stocks: What To Do Next
------------------------------


If you had doubted the possibility of this highflying comeback, and you're ready to deploy capital in the next quarter, what do you do now?


Let's cover the things not to do:


1. Don't chase stocks [way past the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/). Wait for a proper set-up, such as the base on base, or a three weeks tight. Patience pays off.
2. Don't back up the truck toward the [market's laggards](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jun-29-2020/). You have no idea how long they will stay that way. Today, bank, S&L, energy, aerospace and utility sectors function as the caboose of this market rally.
3. Don't buy falling knives. Now, that's different from stocks that are testing their 10-week moving averages on a normal-looking pullback. But a [stock that stabs right through the 10-week line in the heaviest turnover](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) since the start of the advance? Stay away.


Heading into the third quarter, no one also knows what sectors or industry groups are going to lead. But the top performers can stay on top for months, if not years.
